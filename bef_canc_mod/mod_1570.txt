Chest PA/Lat [**2112-1-16**]:  Previous dense consolidation in the left lower lobe has improved since early [**Month (only) 1096**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions remain, and there is still pulmonary vascular engorgement but no clear pulmonary edema.
The new transvenous left ventricular pacer lead ends high along the lateral wall of the left ventricle close to the projection of the interventricular septum.
There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening to indicate any complication.
ECHO [**2112-1-18**]:  Severely dilated left ventricle with severely depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated, mildly hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Diastolic pulmonary hypertension.
The right ventricle is now dilated and mildly hypokinetic.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased to moderate to severe (previously mild).
The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased to moderate to severe (previously mild to moderate).
There is moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, also unchanged.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, consistent with a small right effusion.
There is probably also a small effusion posteriorly.
Increased density projecting posteriorly on the lateral view, likely lies within the left lower lobe and is unchanged.
There is minimal right greater than left [**Hospital1 **]-apical pleural thickening and old healed left-sided rib fractures.
Cardiomegaly, with probable mild CHF.
Left lower lobe consolidation and small bilateral effusions, essentially unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 56-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy w/ EF 20% s/p ICD, CAD s/p post stenting of the LAD and RCA, and pAF s/p multiple cardioversions (last [**1-8**]) on dofetilide admitted for worsening CHF; course complicated by hypervolemic hyponatremia.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC CHF:  Patient with progressive peripheral edema, DOE, and episodes of PND and orthopnea over the past month, related to dissynchrony from pacer.
He was admitted for worsening CHF and for upgrade of his single-lead pacer to a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer.
Lasix drip was stopped following marked improvement in volume status, and the patient was transitioned to torsemide by mouth.
24 hrs after cessation of lasix drip, the patient's ins and outs remained even, but he became increasingly volume overloaded with predominantly right-sided symptoms, and acutely worsening hyponatremia from 130 to 120.
The patient underwent transthoracic ECHO that demonstrated worsening of his cardiomyopathy (EF ~ 15%) with severe TR and likely worsening of his MR ([**2-19**]+).
During admission, ramipril held for acute kidney injury and eplerenone held for hyperkalemia.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response s/p single-lead pacemaker placement in [**2104**].
Digoxin was held for a supratherapeutic level in the setting of acute kidney injury.
130), likely due to hypervolemic hyponatremia from CHF.
The patient was seen by nephrology, who confirmed the etiology of acute decline as hypervolemic hyponatremia.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  On admission, the patient had acute kidney injury associated with poor forward flow from fluid overload.
Digoxin was also held, as it became supratherapeutic in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
# LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Patient with progressive leukocytosis during admission.
No fevers, chills.
Leukocytosis resolved without intervention.
Last cath in [**2110**] with patent stents, but 60-70% stenosis in mid RCA.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Chronic.
# ANXIETY/INSOMNIA:  Chronic.
Ambien was held during admission for possible mild delirium on one occasion overnight.
# LEFT THIGH WOUND:  Wound has been present since vascular surgery.
# HX GOUT:  Secondary to chronic diuretics.
The patient did not have an active gout flare during admission.
Dose was decreased to 150 mg daily to adjust for acute kidney injury.
#CODE: full code ================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Patient on levothyroxine with TSH 10 in setting of acute illness.
If persists as outpatient, may need higher dose of levothyroxine (dose not changed as inpatient in setting of illness) # Ramipril was held at discharge for acute kidney injury.
# Digoxin was supratherapeutic during admission due to acute kidney injury.

You were admitted to the hospital for worsening fluid overload related to your atrial fibrillation.
Your pacemaker was also replaced with a [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacer to help the efficiency of your heart.
You did not have any immediate complications from the procedure.
It is VERY IMPORTANT to restrict your daily fluid intake to 1.2 liters or less.
At discharge, you should stop taking your ramipril and digoxin because of your kidney function.
