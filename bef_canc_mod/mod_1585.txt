Admission Date:  [**2167-2-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-2-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-2-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Known lastname **] SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old male sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 4419**] Hospital when he was noted to have an increasing white count to 16,000, a drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 60s, distention of the abdomen with decreased bowel sounds.
At the rehabilitation hospital, the patient had been noted to be incontinent of loose watery diarrhea and was also noted to have a sore on his scrotum.
In the MICU, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course during that admission, was complicated by a myocardial infarction, pneumonia caused by MRSA, a failed swallow study requiring the placement of a PEG tube.
Renal cell carcinoma, status post partial nephrectomy in [**12-22**].
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol.
The patient appeared in no apparent distress with a flattened affect.
The physical examination was notable for a tense and distended abdomen which was tender to moderate palpation throughout.
The patient was noted to have an area of gangrenous skin on the dorsum of his right scrotum with bilateral scrotal erythema and edema.
A CAT scan of his abdomen revealed pancolitis without evidence of perforation.
The patient had an x-ray of the abdomen which revealed no free air under his diaphragm with a paucity of bowel gas, particularly distally.
An ultrasound of the scrotum revealed that his right epididymis looked thickened while his left epididymis was within normal limits.
The patient had a right-sided hydrocele.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient was also evaluated by the Urology Service to rule out the possibility of Fournier's gangrene.
In view of the patient's clinical presentation and physical examination, he did not have the characteristic presentation of Fournier's gangrene.
Findings on flexible sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm revealed that the patient had numerous pseudomembranes and relatively normal intervening mucosa which were all consistent with Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis.
On [**2167-2-8**], the patient's clinical situation appeared to be worsening with his white count elevated to 34 and with increasing abdominal distention.
Following an evaluation of the patient's status, it was decided that he needed an emergent colectomy with ileostomy for fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis.
The patient underwent a total abdominal colectomy without complication.
The patient's early postoperative course was complicated by hemodynamic instability requiring massive volume resuscitation and Levophed supplementation as well as multiple ventilator changes to maintain adequate oxygenation.
He was followed by the Urology Service with no worsening in his scrotal lesions.
Of note, a small portion of the patient's incision was opened distal to the umbilicus to allow for the patient's diagnostic and therapeutic peritoneal lavage.
This part of the incision is currently packed with wet-to-dry dressings.
The patient's midline abdominal incision appeared to be healing well, although as previously noted there was a small portion distal to the umbilicus which continued to be packed and dressed.
