Pt initially presented to OSH on [**2200-1-7**] with low grade fevers, N/V, diarrhea.
Had recent admission for PNA at same hospital.
Pt had persistent fevers and blood cxs grew high grade GPC found to be MRSA.
Felt pt had DIC although per OSH records no schistocytes on smear.
Pt underwent TEE at OSH which showed veg on prosthetic valve, no abscess.
He underwent TEE [**2200-1-22**] which showed prosthetic valve thickening but no vegetation.
He was transferred to medicine service to undergo w/u of source of bacteremia as Cardiac surgery did not feel valve replacment indicated given the negative TEE.

There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery.
There appear to be bilateral pleural effusions.
There is haziness of the pulmonary vasculature and especially in the perihilar areas and the findings likely represent failure .
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left or right atrium/atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy  with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
A small paravalvular aortic valve leak is present near the junction of the right and left coronary cusps.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Trace (physiologic) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the mitral, tricuspid or pulmonic valves.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
There are dense intramural aortic calcifications.
The pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pneumothorax.
Small, stable pleural effusions are again noted, with bibasilar linear and patchy atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 25062**] is a 78 y/o M with h/o DM, CRI, HTN s/p AVR (tissue) and 2 vessel CABG (LIMA--> LAD, SVG-->OM1) in [**2197**] who presented to OSH with fevers, n/v/d.
He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with a question of prosthetic aortic valve MRSA endocarditis after having had several tooth extractions prior to admission.
Since then, he had persistent fevers, and blood cultures revealed MRSA.
At that time pt also had plt drop (222-->86), creat 1.9->2.9 and hct drop and there was concern for DIC however blood counts recovered before transfer.
TEE at OSH showed vegetations on the prosthetic valve and he was treated with Vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then vanc/gent which was started on [**1-14**].
Pt transfered to CT [**Doctor First Name **] service and repeat TEE performed which was negative for vegatiation.
On the medicine service, he had an MI, diagnosed when he had CP, SOB, and diaphoresis on the morning of [**2200-1-23**].
The following morning he became acutely confused after receiving 2.5mg of seroquel and 0.25 mg ativan x2.
The TEE was repeated on [**1-31**] given persistent positive blood cultures and revealed aortic valvular vegetation.
# [**Name (NI) **] Pt with multiple blood cultures with MRSA at [**Hospital1 **], which meets criteria for endocarditis (1 major, 3 minor) but did not have clear vegetation on TEE in this hospital initially.
Pt also has chronic diarrhea s/p radiation for his prostate CA, he was negative for C. diff toxin on multiple stool exams, O&P exam negative.
Pt had recent dental procedure, along with significant tenderness of his facial and mandibular bones on exam.
# Renal- The patient developed acute renal failure in setting of gentamicin and Vancomycin despite renal dosing.
Vancomycin levels should be drawn weekly to ensure optimum concentration and limit potential renal toxicity.
Levels should be drawn just prior to next dose for a trough.
# Anemia- The patient has h/o of anemia of chronic disease.
# CV-Ischemia- Patient had an MI on admission to the medicine service.
MI, diagnosed when he had CP, SOB, and diaphoresis on the morning of [**2200-1-23**].
He did not have further CP throughout the admission.
# Prostate ca, s/p artificial urinary sphincter.
# DM- Blood glucose well controlled.
# HTN- continued Toprol XL.
# Gout- We stopped Allopurinol in the setting of his renal insufficiency.
He did not develop any symptoms of gouty arthritis during this admission.
