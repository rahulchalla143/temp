Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR: No acute pulmonary process.
Sinus tachycardia.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes with ST segment elevations suggest pericarditis.
Since the previous tracing of [**2150-8-24**] sinus tachycardia rate has decreased and diffuse ST segment elevation is now seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo F w/IDDM h/o non-compliance and mult admits for DKA in the past, HTN, dyslipidemia, admitted for DKA.
Likley precipitated by noncompliance as well as viral illness, as daughter had similar symptoms of cough, fever, N/V oneweek prior to presentation.
3) CVS: Pump-Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] had 2 echos showing LV hypokinesis and EF 40-45% on her previous admission [**6-24**] when she presented with CP.
At that time, EKGs showed diffuse ST elevation; cath was clean.
It was thought that she may have had viral pericarditis.
Her EKGs on this presentation again showed diffuse ST-T elevation, no flipped Ps, but concerning for pericarditis.
As the EKG seemed relatively unchanged from prior, there was question as to whether this was due to a new infection vs. a chronic process that had not yet resolved.
Ischemia- There was no evidence of acute ischemia.
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] has multiple RFs for CAD, but cath in [**Month (only) 216**] showed no coronary disease.
The first 2 sets were negative, the third trop were slightly elevated to 0.04, likely troponin leak secondary to her sustained sinus tach that had abated by HD#3.
There was no evidence of acute blood loss on this admission.
