HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old male known to our hospital who was transferred here with a history of a lower GI bleed from an outside hospital.
He was admitted there for five days in work-up for this lower GI bleed and both endoscopies from above and colonoscopy failed to reveal the source of the bleed, so he was transferred to our hospital.
Cardiovascular: He had a regular rate and rhythm with no orthostatic signs.
There is a midline incision noted.
He had gross blood on rectal exam.
Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, and he had warm and well- perfused feet.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on the [**9-27**] for treatment of his lower GI bleed.
On hospital day two, he had significant hematochezia and at that time he was transfused two units of blood and was immediately transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in anticipated of a tagged red cell scan and subsequent angiography to attempt embolization of the bleeding vessel.
On hospital day three, he again suffered colonic bleeding and was again taken for a tagged red cell scan to try to identify the source of the bleed.
On hospital day four, he had a 1300 cc hematochezia and also hypotension which prompted a third red cell scan to attempt to identify the source of the bleed.
Thereafter, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were ordered to ensure that the patient did not have an aortoenteric fistula.
The patient did have a history of a distant AAA repair back in the [**2098**].
On hospital day five, the patient again had a massive bleed and at this point it was decided, due to two negative EGDs at the outside hospital, one negative EGD here, and a negative colonoscopy at the outside hospital, a negative CT scan here, three negative tagged red cells scans, to directly take the patient to the operating room for a planned total abdominal colectomy which was potentially the only procedure that could save his life.
He appeared to have a fistula from an infected distal aorto-iliac graft to common iliac anastamosis to the appendix, requiring division of his graft.
After the patient was returned to the ICU from the operating room, he had threatened limb ischemia bilaterally.
