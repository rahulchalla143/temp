Occasional premature atrial contractions.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-1-2**] no change.
[**2125-1-4**]   Radiology ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE): IMPRESSION: Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
However, other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease (i.e., significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis) cannot be excluded.
No concerning focal hepatic lesions.
[**2125-1-3**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is again a left lower lobe consolidation demonstrated, that appears to be slightly progressed since the prior study and might be consistent with worsening infectious process.
Left lower lobe opacity, non-specific, possibly representing atelectasis or pneumonia.
[**2125-1-2**]   Cardiology ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2124-6-1**] sinus tachycardia is now present but, otherwise, baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.

He is not acting as though he is having a major GI bleed as the cause of his symptoms, nor is there any clear source of infection or underlying pathology to explain why he would withdraw at this time.
Hematemesis:  The patient had one episode of nausea/hematemesis after receiving PO Potasssium.
He denied any nausea or vomiting and was guaiac negative.
Last EGD [**2119**] with no varices but does have known liver disease.
No evidence of ongoing bleeding, abdominal pain, etc.
Possible etiologies include variceal bleed, ulcer disease or [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (if he has vomited in the past few days).
# Fever and infiltrate:  CXR and CT indicated LLL pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
Elevated transaminases: History of Hep B/C.
LFTs elevated somewhat above previous values on admission.
No history of withdrawal seizures per patient.
Abnormal U/A: + Hematuria possibly myoglobin from muscle damage as 0 RBCs on sediment.
Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus, will hold anticoagulation given bleed.
H/o hypertension: Will permit him to be mildly hypertensive as he is now, will control hypertension via withdrawal as above and address any urgency without beta blockade given GI bleed.

You also had a pneumonia that was treated.
We provided you with medications that treated the withdraw and treated you for GI bleed.
You need to complete you antibiotics (metronidazole and levofloxacin) because you are being treated for pneumonia.
