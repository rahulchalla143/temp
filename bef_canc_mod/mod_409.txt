2)LE U/S ([**8-6**]): Non-occlusive thrombus in both right and left superficial femoral veins, not extending into popliteal or common femoral veins.
3)L foot xray ([**8-6**]): Extensive chronic bony remodeling involving the metatarsals as described above.
There is marked soft tissue swelling around the posterior aspect of the foot with area of lucency indicating subcutaneous gas in the plantar aspect of the heel with an adjacent foreign body.
No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-8-8**] at 3:06:05 PM      FINAL  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-1-3**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] is a 71 yo male with past medical history as listed above who presents with fevers, bilateral LE DVTs, L foot ulcer, and hyperglycemia.
1)L heel ulcer/cellulitis: Patient has significant diabetic neuropathy and at baseline has no sensation below the knees.
He has an ulcer on the medial aspect of the L heel.
Podiatry debrided the wound and recommended [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes.
2)Bilateral LE DVT: Patient noted to have lower extremity swelling (L>R).
U/S in ED showed bilateral superficial femoral clots without extension.
No murmur was documented on exam when he saw his nephrologist few months ago.
Given fevers and recent dental work, concerned was raised for endocarditis.
There is no extra cardiac findings on physical exam but the ESR and CRP is significantly elevated.
Echocardiogram was ordered which showed no evidence of valvular vegetations but mild mitral regurgitation was seen.
4)Type 2 DM: Patient presented with elevated blood sugars in the ED (501).
There was no anion gap.
It was felt that the patient's elevated glucose was due to his infection.
NPH doses were increased due to continuation of his elevated sugars.
Likely [**2-12**] diabetic nephrosclerosis and chronic hypertension.
Likely has a pre-renal component given active infection.
No evidence of hypotension in the ED.
His HCTZ, Lisinopril, and Atenolol were initially held given his elevated creatinine.
There was no evidence of ethanol withdrawal through his admission.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Ten (10) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Humalog Sliding Scale  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cellulitis Diabetic Ulcer Hypertension DVTs   Discharge Condition: Pt was hemodynamically stable, afebrile and without pain at the time of discharge.
There is no indication for surgery.
