Admission Date:  [**2141-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-8-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6734**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, Vomitting, Abdominal Pain, HTN Urgenc  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper GI endoscopy Exploratory laparotomy Tunneled hemodialysis catheter in R femoral vein Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24 y/o F with h/o ESRD, HTN who started peritoneal dialysis during the week of [**2141-10-8**] and presented with a 1 day history of acute onset N/V, sharp abdominal pain on [**2141-10-13**].
On the day of admission on [**2141-10-13**], the patient reported that the previous night, she was awoken from sleep with severe, sharp abdominal pain, 6 episodes of frothy emesis, 10+ yellowish BMs without melena or BRBRP.She was admitted for further work- up of this abdminal pain.
Her abdominal CT showed multifocal areas of small bowel wall thickening.
She had some signs of peritonitis and thus surgery was consulted.
Upon arrival to the MICU the patient was mentating well with complaints of diffuse sharp abdominal pain that radiated to the back and diarrhea.
She had no headache or visual changes.
Past Medical History: - SLE DX ([**2134**] - 16 years old) when she had swollen fingers, arm rash and arthralgias.
- Malignant hypertension.
History of hypertensive crisis with seizures.
History of two intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were thought to be due to the posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome.
- Thrombocytopenia.
- Thrombotic events.
- History of left eye enucleation [**2139-4-20**] for fungal infection.
- History of vaginal bleeding [**2139**] lasting 2 months s/p DepoProvera injection requiring transfusion.
- History of Coag negative Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**6-16**] and [**5-17**]   Social History: Single and lives with her mother and a brother.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-10-2**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
CXR ([**2141-10-13**]): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
No free air under the diaphragms.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2141-10-13**]): There is a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, similar in appearance from [**2141-10-13**].
The great vessels are normal in caliber, without aneurysmal dilatation.
Interstitial thickening, particularly within the perihilar regions, is suggestive of fluid overload.
There is bibasilar atelectasis with a small focus of consolidation in the right lower lobe (2:35) unchanged from [**2141-10-13**], and may reflect aspiration or pneumonia.
Scattered bilateral nodules are largely stable from as far back as [**2139-10-9**].
Specifically, there is a 5 mm nodule in the right middle lobe (2:25), two adjacent nodules in the right lower lobe measuring 5 mm and 2 mm (2:24), and a 4 mm pleural based nodule within the left lower lobe.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
The esophagus is distended and filled with contrast, with marked wall thickening and edema throughout its entire length, a new finding.
There is a moderate- sized hiatal hernia.
Additional small clustered foci of extraluminal air is seen adjacent to the proximal stomach and the gastroesophageal junction, with a focus of air tracking into the fissure of ligamentum venosum.
Additionally, there appears to be air tracking into the anterior subcutaneous tissues in the region of the umbilicus.
These findings are all new from the prior CT on [**2141-10-13**], but free air was present on chest radiograph performed [**2141-10-25**].
The stomach, small bowel, and colon are filled with contrast, without evidence of obstruction.
The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands demonstrate no gross abnormality.
There is a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen, similar in appearance to the prior study.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Bones are diffusely sclerotic, which may be related to renal osteodystrophy.
There is bilateral sacroiliitis.
However, as foci of air is seen in the region of the proximal stomach and GE junction in the setting of a recent endoscopy, perforation cannot be excluded, though no frank extravasation of contrast is identified.
New dilation and wall thickening of the entire esophagus, a nonspecific finding that could relate to infectious or inflammatory esophagitis; clinical correlation is recommended.
Anasarca, with moderate-sized pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, and small right pleural effusion.
Large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis.
Imaging cannot exclude SBP, which should be evaluated for clinically.
Focus of consolidation within the right lower lobe, could represent aspiration or pneumonia, but unchanged from the prior study.
Gastric Biopsies ([**2141-10-18**]): Antrum:  Corpus-type mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Jejunum:  Small intestinal mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
UE Venous U/S: No evidence of DVT of the left upper extremity, without thrombus identified within the left subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 24 year old woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started peritoneal dialysis approximately one week prior to admission), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events (on warfarin) who is presenting with persistent suprapubic/lower abdominal pain and new onset severe epigastric pain w/ nausea and vomiting, and hypertension.
Her hospital course was complicated by multiple transfers between the MICU and the floor secondary to hypertensive urgency.
# Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: During the patient's admission, her complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting progressively improved although no clear source of the symptoms was found.
Infectious causes, including viral gastroenteritis, peritonitis or c. dif colitis, were considered.
However, during the initial part of her admission, the patient remained afebrile with an initial relative leukocytosis which trended to within baseline limits.
Serial abdominal exams showed no peritoneal signs.
Peritoneal dialysis fluid analysis was negative for leukocytosis without organisms on gram stain.
CT of the abdomen on [**10-13**] showed evidence of multifocal small bowel thickening and gastric wall edema, but no acute process.
Other etiologies of her abdomoinal pain were also considered including mesenteric ischemia bowel secondary to SLE vasculitis, malignant HTN, or microthrombosis and SLE enteritis.
Surgery was consulted and felt that the patient did not have an ischemic bowel as serial lactates were negative and serial abdominal exams showed improvement in pain.
A heparin drip and warfarin were started for treatment of possible microthrombotic ischemia, although this was stopped when the patient had evidence of a possible GI bleed.
With regards to SLE vasculitis/enteritis, rheumatology was consulted and they did not believe her symptoms were related to SLE.
On [**10-18**], GI performed an EGD which showed erosion in the gastroesophageal junction yet an otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to third part of the duodenum; biopsies of stomach antrum and proximal jejunum were negative.
Approximately halfway through her hospital course, the patient complained of severe epigastric pain in addition to her lower abdominal pain.
Both cardiac, GI, and pulmonary etiologies were considered for the origin of her epigastric pain.
Pericarditis was considered, but her EKG was unchanged from prior studies and there had been on interval increase in her pericardial effusion since [**2141-10-13**].
However, her abdominal CT on [**2141-10-26**] showed a large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis.
There were no major findings: no evidence of perforation, obstruction, or infection.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and immediately reported that both her epigastric and suprapubic pain were gone after the surgery.
At discharge, the patient only complained of some mild incisional pain.
# Hypertensive urgency: The patient was initially admitted to the MICU with a blood pressure of 240/180.
Her hospital course was complicated by extremely labile HTN and was transferred back and forth between the MICU and the floor on three separate occasions ([**10-19**], [**10-21**], and [**10-22**]) for identical episodes of SBPs > 260.
Throughout all of these episodes of hypertensive urgency, the patient remained asymptomatic from a neuro and cardiac standpoint except for occasional headache.
During her admission, the patient underwent multiple trials of peritoneal dialysis, but was unable to tolerate it on a consistent basis secondary to abdominal pain.
However, over several days, she became hyperkalemic and increased swelling was noted bilaterally in her ankles and feet.
On [**2141-10-17**], she was found to have guaiac positive stools and her HCT was found to have dropped to a low of 18.6.
Between [**2141-10-23**] - [**2141-10-24**], the patient had a HCT drop from 26 to 20 in the setting of occult positive emesis.
She was also started heparin drip secondary to concern for ischemic bowel [**2-11**] microthrombotic disease.
However, this was stopped for her EGD and after she had evidence of a GI bleed.
The patient remained off heparin and coumadin from [**2141-10-23**] - [**2141-10-25**] given her drop in HCT and in preparation for a possible GI intervention.
This was mostly attributed to nutritional deficiency [**2-11**] poor PO intake, but there was concern for possible synthetic dysfunction as well.
Of note, the patient has a history of SVC syndrome and had a L subclavian venous thrombosis.
During the last few days of her hospital stay, the patient complained of increased tongue swelling and her L face was noted to be slightly more swollen than previously noted.
As a result, she underwent upper extremity venous ultrasound on [**2141-11-2**], which showed no evidence of a DVT within the left upper extremity and the previously noted thrombus within the left subclavian vein was not seen as well.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient was noted to have OSA based on clinical nocturnal exam during admission.
# Metabolic Acidosis:  The patient's bicarbonate on admission was 13.
