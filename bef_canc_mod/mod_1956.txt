Acute Issues: #) Acute on chronic renal failure: Since surgery in [**Month (only) 547**], patient's baseline Cr has been gradually rising from 1.5, peaked at 4.5, was 3.6 on admission.
Most likely cause is post-renal obstructive, in the context of rising creatinine since recent radical surgery, that may have altered his anatatomy in a way that predisposed him to developing obstruction.
Patient does report volume loss from excessive ostomy output and recent poor PO intake thus pre-renal failure could also be contributing.
Initial u/s of kidneys done on [**8-6**] showed moderate-to-severe left-sided hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter.
A L percutaneous nephrostomy was placed under IR on [**8-6**] and follow-up u/s done on [**8-12**] showed almost complete resolution of hydronephrosis on the L.  His creatinine trended down during the admission and on discharge, was 2.6.
#) Urinary tract infection: Most likely [**3-14**] obstructive uropathy as described above.
He was initially treated empirically with daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and micafungin but this was narrowed to fluconazole only when sensitivities for his [**Female First Name (un) **] returned and given continued negative blood cultures.
Urine from urostomy did have many bacteria, +leuk esterase, 100 proteins, 15 WBC, but this is likely due to contamination.
#) Sepsis: Patient has had intermittently have low-grade fevers with leukocytosis that initially trended down upon arrival to floor but has rose toward the end of his admission (14.2 on [**8-10**].1 on [**8-11**] on [**8-12**] and [**8-13**]).
Thought initially to be caused by UTI given negative blood cultures to date.
Patient does have prior pelvic imaging ([**7-16**]) notable for simple fluid collections within, likely postoperative lymphoceles.
#) High ostomy output: Has been a chronic issue for the patient (normally puts out ~1L daily at home), and patient has had a prior admission for acidosis thought to be related to high ostomy output with high stool bicarb concentration.
He will need an ostomy take-down (thought best not to do this during this admission, given were actively treating him for infection), which will be done as an outpatient likely within the next couple of weeks.
#) AMS: Had one episode of AMS during this admission prompting transfer to the MICU.
Chronic Issues: #) Normocytic Anemia: Likely [**3-14**] to his renal disease.
RBC smear negative for schistocytes.
Tbili, LDH, and haptoglobin were not consistent with hemolysis.
Loperamide 4 mg PO TID Please give before meals, pt may refuse, maintain ostomy output b/w 600cc-1000cc per day RX *Anti-Diarrheal (loperamide) 2 mg 2 capsule by mouth three times daily Disp #*180 Capsule Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]/[**Hospital1 8**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic kidney injury Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital directly from the nephrology clinic on [**8-5**] given your rising creatinine in the context of recurrent urinary tract infections.
Your creatinine trended down during your admission (was XXX on discharge) and renal ultrasound on [**8-12**] showed no hydronephrosis on the R and minimal hydronephrosis on the L.  You had high ostomy output (up to 2.3 liters daily) which improved upon increasing your [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] recommendations from the colorectal team.
Towards the end of your stay, your white blood cell count increased up to 22,200, which was concerning for infection although you had no clinical signs or symptoms of infection on exam.
Prior CT and ultrasound had demonstrated two large pelvic fluid collections which we were worried may have become infected.
Medication Changes: 1) Please stop taking ciprofloxacin 2) Please continue taking fluconazole 200 mg daily until [**8-26**] 3) Please take acetaminophen (Tylenol) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1999**] mg every 6 hours for pain or fever 4) Please take loperamide ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 28303**]) 4 mg three times daily for diarrhea  Follow-up Appointments: Please see below Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**].
