There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior wall and basal inferior wall.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-7-18**], inferior wall hypokinesis is now suggested c/w ischemia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
Of note, the patient's SBP remained in the mid 90's on POD1, and this prompted troponin analysis.
The patient's EKG showed evidence of ST segment depression, similar to his previous episode of demand ischemia seen in [**7-10**].
This picture was confounded, however, by the patient's continued renal failure in the immediate post operative period.
He required hemodialysis on POD 0 for fluid overload, and he tolerated temoval of 1.5 L. Early in the am of POD2, the patient was found to be recovering well, with no need for hemodynamic or respiratory support.
Over the weekend, his hospital course was notable for difficult to control FBG's in the setting of post operative methylprednisolone.
On POD 3, the patient's troponin was found to be persistently elevated to 2.3, after briefly decreasing to 1.8 from 1.97.
A TTE showed a new area of hypokinesis consistent with a new ischemic event.
By POD 4, the patient's graft function appeared to be picking up, with a doubling in urine output from the day prior.
In fact, they suggested that his residual volume overload could be treated with lasix instead of hemodialysis.
He is fully ambulatory, and is eating and voiding without difficulty.
His post operative pain is well controlled on oral medications.
Your operation went well with no complications.
This may have been due to a myocardial infarction, likely due to the strain on your heart during surgery.
You also had elevated blood sugars after your surgery.
You will likely need HD for a short while until your new kidney is at full speed.
