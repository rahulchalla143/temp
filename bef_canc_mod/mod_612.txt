Admission Date:  [**2176-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-6-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3283**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of tunneled catheter for hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 84 y/o M w/hx of DM, ESRD approaching HD, HTN, presented to the ED with 2 days of increasing dyspnea.
Has been having worsening DOE over the past few months, now would be dyspneic if he walked up a flight of stairs.
Also has had worsening LE edema over the past few months.
In terms of renal disease, had AVF placed [**1-21**] in anticipation of HD but has not required it as of yet.
CXR showed moderate to severe pulmonary edema, so he was placed on bipap.
EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3 which were worse from prior.
He was seen by cardiology who performed a bedside echo; it did not show any wall motion abnormalities, so they felt this was not a cardiac problem and recommended admission to the MICU.
Past Medical History: - ESRD felt [**2-16**] DM and HTN, had AVF placed [**1-21**] in anticipation of needing HD soon -Hypertension -DM -Hyperlipidemia -Severe DJD of the cervical spine with resultant gait disturbance -Gout -Known thyroid cancer (Patient declined resection) -Probable renal cell cancer (noted by MRI, not biopsied)  Social History: Lives with wife, worked in social work supervising children with drug problems.
[**Name (NI) **] tobacco, EtOH, drugs   Family History: Heart problems, HTN, stroke  Physical Exam: VS -  98.2, 60, 157/64, 20, 92%RA --> 98% 4L NC Gen: middle aged male in very mild respiratory distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
II/VI systolic murmur at apex.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Minimal abdominal breathing, no other respiratory muscle use.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
CXR showed moderate to severe pulmonary edema, so he was placed on bipap.
EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3 which were worse from prior.
He was seen by cardiology who performed a bedside echo; it did not show any wall motion abnormalities, so they felt this was not a cardiac problem and recommended admission to the MICU.
Patient's respiratory status and symptoms improved while in MICU, so he was weaned from bipap to nasal cannula, then weaned off nitro gtt and called out to floor.
Most likely diagnosis was flash pulmonary edema, given the sudden onset, symptoms of orthopnea/PND, worsening renal failure and LE edema, and findings on physical exam.
CXR read questions aspiration, but pt gives no hx of this and has no signs or symptoms of infection on exam.
The underlying question is why he suddenly flashed overnight: ?
if he became hypertensive and then flashed vs the hypertension as a response to the hypoxia.
Most likely diagnosis is myocardial ischemia, given his numerous risk factors, EKG findings, and cardiac enzymes.
Likely has volume overload related to worsening renal failure.
- now on RA with no respiratory symptoms - will likely be less problem[**Name (NI) 115**] now that patient has started HD as below.
- TTE with NL EF, mild aortic regurgitation - on discharge, patient will continue aspirin, beta-blocker, CCB, statin  # Fever: Two days prior to discharge, patient had T to 100.9, then to 101.1 the following night.
Tunneled line site without erythema or TTP.
-Patient was found to have UTI by UA/Cx which was felt to explain fever given otherwise very well-appearing patient with no other clinical findings -CXR with no infiltrate -Blood cx pending, negative at time of discharge Discharged on cipro for total course of 7 days for UTI.
# Anemia: Likely due to renal disease.
Neck Mass: patient with known thyroid CA.
CXR revealed tracheal shift, but this was stable compared to prior CXR's, and was present prior to line placement.
Avandia recently discontinued, ?
# FEN: Diabetic, low sodium diet.
