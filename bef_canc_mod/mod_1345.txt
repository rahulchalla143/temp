CXR [**2126-8-29**] IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process though the costophrenic angles were partially excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 57yo homeless man with history of EtOH abuse, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation (not on coumadin), hypertension, hepatitis B and C, who presented in the ED complaining of left-sided chest pain, and became tremulous.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Chest pain: history suggestive of ACS (substernal chest pain, left arm pain), but ECG showed no acute ischemic changes and TnT was <0.01 x3.
Pneumonia was unlikiely given the lack of fevers and CXR with no infiltrates.
# Alcohol withdrawal: In the ED patient became agitated, diaphoretic, and increasingly tachycardic.
In the MICU he was afebrile, hypertensive to 161/100, tachycardic to 114, and was somewhat tremulous and diaphoretic.
He was otherwise comfortable and stable, no longer reported any chest pain, and was speaking in full sentences, and was alert and oriented to person, place, and date.
The next morning the patient was requiring less diazepam  (5mg q4H:PRN for CIWA>14) and was no longer tachycardic, hypertensive, tremulous or diaphoretic.
On the floor he was initially comfortable and stable, and his diazepam requirement decreased to 5mg q8H: PRN for CIWA>10.
The risks of leaving while undergoing treatment for alcohol withdrawal were explained to the patient, including seizures and death; however, he insisted on leaving and left the hospital against medical advice.
# Tachycardia (sinus): unresponsive to IV fluids in ED.
INACTIVE ISSUES # Hypokalemia: admission K 2.7, possibly due to long-standing alcoholism accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, as well as this patient's use of HCTZ and furosemide.
Both anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression, though on this admission B12 was wnl (308).
Pain was controlled with lidocaine patches.
Has h/o grade 3 fibrosis.
