Admission Date:  [**2145-5-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2145-6-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2081-11-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  UROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 62 year old gentleman who had been diagnosed with Grade III muscle invasive bladder carcinoma after having undergone a transurethral resection of bladder tumor for hematuria.
A preoperative CT scan for staging showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
On [**2145-4-9**], he underwent a radical cystoprostatectomy with an orthotopic diversion and a continent cutaneous diversion with ilial loop.
His postoperative course was complicated by the development on postoperative day 11, of an enterocutaneous fistula as well as a leak from the anastomosis of the neobladder.
Total parenteral nutrition.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Examination at the time of admission was notable for a soft nontender abdomen with the lower portion of his midline incision that was previously draining small bowel contents being closed.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] is obviously removed and the site was probed with no significant fluid draining.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a CT scan on [**5-6**], which demonstrated that contrast was draining from the small bowel through the enterocutaneous fistula without any evidence of free air or free extravasation of contrast.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound to rule out acute cholecystitis was positive only for sludge with no evidence of inflammation of the gallbladder.
pain regimen.
They made the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood and recommended initiating him on Remeron which he will be continued on as an outpatient.
Pulmonary:  The patient remained intubated postoperatively until day two secondary to bilious secretions aspirated from the endotracheal tube on postoperative day one.
He was weaned off of his O2 nasal cannula with appropriate saturations on room air and no other respiratory events.
Cardiovascular:  His postoperative EKG was notable for low voltage, and he was subsequently ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
He had no other cardiac issues.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient went to the Operating Room on [**5-7**], and underwent an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions with resection of approximately 5 centimeters of small bowel at the original anastomosis with subsequently formation of ileostomy and mucus fistula.
Ostomy output over the last several days of his admission had noted to be elevated and therefore 1/2 cc.
There was persistent difficulty with aspiration of both the suprapubic tube and the Foley.
Towards the end of his hospital course, the patient had some difficulty with his electrolytes, developing a moderate hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis.
Interoperative wound cultures ultimately grew out MSSA and the Vancomycin was discontinued on postoperative day five.
On hospital day 11, he had a positive urinary tract infection that was growing out Klebsiella, sensitive to Levofloxacin and he was started on Ciprofloxacin for two days before being changed over to Levofloxacin for a total course of one week.
On postoperative day 18, a repeat surveillance urine culture grew out Enterococcus.
This was ultimately accomplished and a follow-up urine culture demonstrated no growth.
Of note, the patient needs to have a Chem-7 drawn on Monday, [**2145-6-7**], and this information has been communicated in the Page One Patient Care Referral Form.
