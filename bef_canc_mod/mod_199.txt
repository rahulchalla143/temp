Epiaortic duplex scanning.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 15633**] is a 79 yo female with a complex medical history including severe aortic stenosis, s/p bioprosthetic AVR/CABG([**2118**]-F [**Doctor Last Name **]) now with bioprosthetic restenosis and recurrent systolic heart failure requiring multiple hospitalizations, Patient also s/p CABG x1([**2118**]) and PCI-LAD([**2119**]).
Cardiac status further complicated by mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension and complete heart block s/p pacemaker([**2120**]),   hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes.
Last month, patient was admitted for severe hypertension and resultant pulmonary edema.
She was subsequently admitted to CCU with congestive heart failure placed on BiPap and Lasix gtt.
Cardiac surgery was reconsulted for surgical evaluation Cardiac Echocardiogram: [**2125-10-16**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Aortic stenosis s/p Aortic valve replacement with [**Company 1543**] mosaic valve, 19mm([**2118**])-Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] 2.
Acute Congestive Heart Failure with numerous hospitalizations 3.
CAD - CABG x 1 with SVG to PDA in [**2118**], PCI to LAD [**2119**] 4.
HTN 5.
History of subdural hemorrhage after motor vehicle accident.

There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a partially echodense pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
She had been doing well on [**2125-10-24**] and had her chest tube removed earlier in the day when she suddenly had arrhythmia issues and became hypotensive.
She was brought to the operating room emergently for mediastinal exploration.
She had multiple clots evacuated and a repair for bleeding coming from a hole in the vein graft proximally.
She had an attempted cardioversion postoperatively which was unsuccessful and EP was consulted to adjust her PPM.
She was on Coumadin preoperatively for atrial fibrillation but this was held per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] due to post operative bleeding.
Pacing wires were discontinued without complication and permanent pacemaker was interrogated by EP.
She was weaned slowly from the ventilator with copious secretions initially.
Once CVVH was started and fluid was removed she was able to be extubated on [**2125-11-4**] without complications.
Initially after extubation she failed her speech and swallow but later tolerated a full po diet.
It was thought that her renal failure was a combination of acute tubular necrosis and renal hypoperfusion in the setting of decompensated congestive heart failure causing poor forward flow.
An ACE-I was not initiated due to her elevated creatinine.
Renal recommended no standing Lasix dose and follow up Friday [**11-16**] with renal labs.
The patient spiked a temperature of 101 and blood cultures form [**11-3**] came back with SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
She was afebrile and WBC was normal at the time of discharge.
By the time of discharge on POD the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
She did have a moderate left effusion seen on discharge CXR and the CXR will be repeated on Friday [**11-16**] before follow up clinic appointment.
8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Prosthetic valve aortic stenosis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery    bypass grafting with a vein graft to the distal right    coronary artery.
Multiple persisted bouts of congestive heart failure    necessitating admission to the hospital over the last 2    months (total of 4 admissions).
Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented x3 nonfocal Ambulating with steady gait Incisional pain managed with Incisions: Sternal - healing well, no erythema or drainage Leg Left - healing well, no erythema or drainage.
No Edema      Discharge Instructions: Please shower daily including washing incisions gently with mild soap, no baths or swimming until cleared by surgeon.
