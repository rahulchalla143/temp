Pt denied chest pain, palpitations, or any focal symptoms.
Symptoms worsened on of [**3-1**] when he was more visibly short of breath with mild exertion walking to the bathroom.
VNA noted SBP in 80s and 02 in in the 80s.
Pt and wife denied recent fevers, cough, dysuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or focal signs of infection.
Wife noted increased lethargy of the patient, but without change in mental status (baseline pt respons yes/no.
Pt is a chronic aspirator and has a baseline cough that is unchanged.
In addition pt has had a complicated recent infectious course.
Then given hypoxia and hypotension, pt underwent CTPA revealing extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, with signs of R heart strain and small wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower lobe.
Pt was also seen by neurosurgery and head CT showed no acute changes.

No interval change.
Extensive pulmonary emboli involving upper, middle, and lower lobar arteries on the right and the upper and lower lobar arteries on the left.
Wedge-shaped consolidation at the periphery of the right lower lobe may represent a small pulmonary infarction.
Prominence of the right ventricle and flattening of the interventricular septum is concerning for right heart strain.
Bronchioles of the lower lobes bilaterally demonstrates partial opacification, concerning for aspiration.
Density noted within the trachea and main bronchi bilaterally may also represent secretions, although some of this appearance may be due to motion arifact.

# Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli were seen on chest CTA on [**3-1**].
Although the patient showed signs of right heart strain with elevations in BNP, a mild bump in troponin, and increased RV to LV ratio on CTPA, S1Q3, the decision was made to use heparin gtt instead of thrombolysis given his history of intracranial hemorrhage and multiple cranial surgeries.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were without clot burden.
Frequent neuro checks showed no change in neurologic status.
The patient had a head CT when his INR became therapeutic which showed no bleed and no changes.
Neurosurgery cleared him to be discharged to follow up with his neurosurgeon as an outpatient regarding possible future surgery.
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased over the course of his stay and he was saturating well on room air at the time of discharge.
# Witnessed Aspiration: The patient was witnessed to have an aspiration event while in the ICU.
The patient had previously been evaluated by speech and swallow with recommendations for ground solids/nectar thick liquids.
Of note, in the ED he received doses of vanco/ctx/flagyl for an initial question of aspiration pneumonia, which was then held without clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia.
# Seizure Disorder - Stable.
Hemangiopericytoma: Dx [**2196**], s/p resection and hemicraniectomy complicated by multiple subsequent revisions and XRT.
An MRI from [**12-28**] showed evidence of treated tumor, unchanged.
The patient was followed by neurosurgery during his hospitalization who felt there were no active neurosurgical issues.
# History of Multiple cranial infections: Hx of craniotomy c/b MRSA infection, subsequent sub-galeal abscess with MRSA now s/p I&D in [**2198-11-19**] and 6 weeks of vancomycin/ceftaz/flagyl.
During his stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 67736**] remained afebrile and his white blood cell count was within normal limits.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted for evaluation of shortness of breath and found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli (blood clots in your lungs).
Treatment for your blood clots consists of anticoagulation (use of blood thinners).
You were closely monitored for signs of infection.
You did not have any fevers and your blood counts did not show any sign of infection.
You had CT scans of the brain that did not show any new changes or signs of bleeding.
You should follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], your neurosurgeon to discuss options for future surgery.
