Found to have a large L infiltrate, gave nebs, lasix, Vanc, and his dose of lovenox.
He continued to be dyspneic and was started on bipap with much improvement in dyspnea.
He was then transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued management of resp distress and PNA.

Given the density of this lesion, the two most likely considerations are dense pneumonia or an underlying mass.
Recommend further evaluation with chest CT.  RUE US [**12-13**] - Grayscale, color, and pulsed wave Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed on the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins.
Evaluation is slightly limited as the patient is not able to lie flat, and exam was performed with the patient sitting in a chair.
The right arm is diffusely edematous, with 3+ pitting edema on physical exam.
IMPRESSION:  No DVT in the right upper extremity.
TTE [**12-13**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-22**], the moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and mild estimated pulmonary arterial hypertension are now better appreciated.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Consolidation within the posterior right upper lobe, with debris seen within the central airways, and right hilar adenopathy.
These findings are most suspicious for aspiration pneumonia atop underlying emphysema.
Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
Dependent atelectasis in both lower lobes, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Regions of superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
No underlying lung mass seen, although portions of the lungs may be masked by the consolidation and atelectasis.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Enlarged thyroid as previously described   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for RLL PNA and COPD flare.
#) Dyspnea, RLL opacity - On arrival, he was initially on BIPAP for dyspnea and hypoxia, which was weaned off to oxygen via nasal cannula on the day of admission.
The patient was also started on levofloxacin to cover for CAP with improvement in his symptoms and O2 requirement.
A speech and swallow evaluation was concerning for aspiration and suggested soft pureed foods only.
A chest CTA was obtained due to the patient's relatively [**Name2 (NI) 61519**] consolidation seen on admission CXR to rule out an underlying lung mass showed likely consolidation pneumonia.
#  PE - Diagnosed in [**2106-2-21**].
Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Not currently being anticoagulated with warfarin as he is only on lovenox at prophylactic dose.
Hypothyroidism s/p partial thyroidectomy - Continued home dose of synthroid.
Bilateral LE lymphedema and RUE lyphedema: Pt had a repeat TTE showing no signs of systolic failure but signs of diastolic failure and mild PA systolic HTN.
He also had a RUE U/S that ruled out RUE DVT given R > L upper extremity edema.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: pneumonia COPD flare   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call your PCP or pulmonologist with any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever.
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss chronic antibiotic suppressive treatment.
