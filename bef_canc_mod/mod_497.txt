ECHO [**2200-11-13**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is mild pulmonic valve stenosis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonic stenosis.
Acute on chronic CHF: Ischemic event leading to acute CHF was ruled out with cardiac enzymes.
They were slightly elevated, but this was likely due to demand ischemia.
An echo was done showing an EF of 50% and increased wedge pressure.
She also had elevated JVP, rales and LE edema.
She was seen by nutrition, who went over dietary modifications and the importance of a low sodium diet.
CAD: Suspect troponin leak in the setting of heart failure exacerbation.
Trend cardiac enzymes, trending down.
Acute renal failure: likely due to poor forward flow.
