Past Medical History: [**1-11**] Cardiac Surgery -mechanical MV placement [**3-9**] chordae rupture following IE -CABG x 2 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag) -PFO closure -[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] ligation CAD Permanent AFib s/p MAZE DMII COPD Gout Anxiety/Depression s/p cataract surgery   Social History: Retired electrical engineer.
Has a girlfriend in the area.
Family History: Mother had CAD and colon CA in her mid 70's.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Large mixed but predominantly hyperdense left extra-axial collection consistent with acute subdural hematoma with gyral and lateral ventricular effacement, 9- mm rightward shift of midline structures and left uncal herniation.
Internal relatively low-attenuation foci may represent non-clotted blood from hyperacute hemorrhage, related to active bleeding.
Small right frontal extra-axial, likely subdural hematoma.
Status post virtual-complete evacution of left convexity subdural hematoma with expected post-surgical changes including bifrontal subdural pneumocephalus.
Unchanged subdural blood layering along the tentorial margins, as described.
Head CT [**2150-3-4**] IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of subdural hematoma layering over the left cerebral convexity, without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or herniation.
The CSF-atttenuation fluid, occupying the more anterior portion of the left frontal extra- axial space, was present on the initial scan of [**2150-2-25**], and may reflect decompression and re-expansion of pre-existent compartmentalized subdural space, or true hygroma.
There is a small amount of remaining blood products in the left frontal convexity consistent with expected evolution of left subdural hematoma.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, mass effect, or major vascular territory infarction.
There is no hydrocephalus or herniation.
There has been an interval decrease in left frontoparietal subgaleal soft tissue edema.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain well aerated.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territory infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: #Bifrontal subdural hematoma evacuation - The patient did well postoperatively following left craniotomy and evacuation of SDH on [**2150-2-25**].
Therapeutic INR was achieved without any evidence of progression of SDH by CT.
#Mechanical mitral valve - TTE on [**3-2**] showed a well-seated prosthesis with normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients, without MR. Heparin bridge to therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin was achieved, as above, with a goal INR 2.5-3.5.
#DMII - Serial elevated fasting glucose confirmed the diagnosis of DMII.
[**Month (only) 116**] benefit from initiating beta-blockade as an outpatient if reactive airway disease permits.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary 1) Acute bilateral subdural hematoma 2) Mechanical mitral valve replacement 3) Type II Diabetes 4) Iron deficiency anemia  Secondary 1) Coronary artery disease 2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3) Hyperlipidemia 4) Gout   Discharge Condition: Asymptomatic with stable vital signs and normal neurological exam.
Surgery to remove the blood was performed on [**2150-2-25**] without complications.
Please continue to take Fiorecet for headaches until your INR has stabilized.
You were also diagnosed with type II diabetes and started on a medication called metformin (glucophage) to treat this condition.
The following medication changes were made: 1) Keppra (Levetiracetam) was started to prevent a seizure.
3) Fiorecet 2 tablets every 12 hours for headaches.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
