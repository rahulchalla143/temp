History of Present Illness: Patient is a 79 year old right handed man with history of right intracerebral hemorrhage in [**2127**], hypertension, chronic pain, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2139-5-20**] with altered mental status after an unwitnessed fall at home.
About 15 minutes later, around 10:30 am, he was found down in garage, lying on right side, with active bleeding from an occipital laceration.
By report, he had generalized tonic clonic seizure activity x 2 minutes while en route to [**Hospital1 18**].
While in the ED, he had 3-4 episodes of [**2-8**] minutes of generalized tonic clonic seizure activity.
He received another 4 mg of Ativan for agitation during MRI.

2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Coordination/Gait: Unable to fully assess given mental status.
There is a rounded nodular density at the left lower lung base of unclear etiology or significance.
The lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of infiltrate.
There are no pleural effusions.
Significant thoracic scoliosis convex to the right is again noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Rounded nodular density at the lateral left lung base of unclear etiology.
----- CT head without contrast [**2139-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is hyperdensity along the left aspect of the tentorium cerebelli suggestive of a subdural hematoma versus tentorial calcification.
Tiny foci of high attenuation are present within the right anterior frontal lobe locales, suggestive of intraparenchymal and/or subarachnoid hemorrhagic regions.
There is no evidence of is significant mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Old areas of infarction are seen within the right basal ganglia.
Hypodensity adjacent to the periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular infarction is also present.
Bone windows show partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells and the ethmoid air cells with a probable left sided surgical defect related to prior mastoid surgery in this intubated patient.
o evidence of fracture is seen.
Hyperdensity along the left aspect of the tentorium cerebelli suggestive of a small subdural hematoma versus tentorial calcification.
Additional areas of hyperdensity within the anterior right frontal lobe are suggestive of traumatic intraparenchymal and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
----- CT Cspine [**2139-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of fracture or subluxation.
No bone destruction, bone erosion, or abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen.
Multilevel degenerative changes present with loss of intervertebral disc space height is seen at the levels of C3-4, C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.
There is 10 degree rotation of C1 relative to [**Name (NI) 12952**] which could reflect patient positioning or alternatively rotatory subluxation.
Some degenerative calcification of the ligamentum flavum is present at the level of C3/4.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of fracture.
2) Rotation of C1 relative to [**Name (NI) 12952**] that may be positional in nature but could also represent rotatory subluxation.
3) Multilevel degenerative change (most prominent at the levels of c5-6 and c6-7) as described above.
4) Partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells, likely inflammatory in origin.
----- CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2139-5-20**]: CT ABDOMEN: There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Small stones are noted in the gallbladder.
Numerous bilateral renal cysts are seen.
Additional small foci may represent cysts but are too small to be fully characterized.
There is no free air or free fluid.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS: There is extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Extensive vascular calcifications are noted.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
No evidence of perforation or free fluid.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Hepatic cysts and additional low attenuation foci which are too small to be fully characterized.
Bilateral renal cysts and additional low attenuation foci which may represent cysts but are too small to be fully characterized.
-----  Hi-res CT head: prelim report shows longitudinal fracture of right temporal bone.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 79 year old man with past medical history of multiple vascular risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, with history of right intraparenchymal hemorrage in [**2127**] with residual left sided hemiparesis who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with intermittent generalized tonic clonic seizures status post fall.
He may have had a seizure with his old stroke as an irritable focus and then fell with traumatic hemorrhage or had hemorrhage leading to seizure and fall.
Neurologic exam remarkable for poor mental status exam with depressed level of alertness and inattention.
Tone and reflexes are increased on the left compared with the right, likely reflecting his right intracerebral hemorrhage and subsequent left hemiparesis.
His altered mental status may be postictal, from his hemorrhage, due to the enormous dose of Ativan he received while in ED, or due to ongoing non-convulsive seizure activity.
An EEG was performed to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus; the EEG showed evidence of encephalopathy but no signs of status.
MRI of the head was done and showed hyperdensity along the left tentorium, bifrontal hemorrhages and calcifications in the bilateral basal ganglia.
Neurosurgery evaluated patient and imaging and deemed the patient's cervical spine stable for removal of the cervical collar placed upon arrival to the emergency department.
The patient received Ativan in the emergency department and also during his imaging studies on the day of admission and his diminished mental status could be secondary to this medication combined with his series of seizures.
The patient also had an ECG which showed a first degree AV block and left anterior fascicular block, both of which were seen on prior ECGs.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac markers.
On admission, the patient chest x-ray showed a possible left lower lobe nodule.
However, upon chest CT to evaluate said nodule, no nodular abnormalities were notes.
The patient was noted to have basilar atelectasis and emphasematous changes, but no evidence of infiltrate.
CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of perforation.
The patient was made NPO given altered mental status.
However, what appeared to be a unilateral ecchymosis around his right eye expanded to enclose both eyes and the patient appeared to have the classic "raccoon eyes" as well as "Battle's sign" signifying a basilar skull fracture.
Additionally, he developed some conductive hearing loss bilaterally which has been stable for several days prior to discharge.
Thin cuts of the skull via CT were ordered which confirmed longitudinal fracture in the R temporal bone.
MRI head ([**2139-5-21**]): Thin longitudinally extensive subdural hematomas extend over both cerebral hemispheres.
Areas of focal intraparenchymal hemorrhage are seen within the anterior and inferior aspects of both frontal lobes, best seen on susceptibility-weighted imaging.
A small quantity of blood is present, layering within the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles.
There is no evidence of shift of normally midline structures.
No associated mass effect is seen secondary to these areas of hemorrhage.
Diffusion-weighted imaging shows no evidence of acute infarction.
No abnormal enhancement is seen within the brain.
Abnormal signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted imaging is seen within the periventricular white matter consistent with a chronic microvascular infarction.
An old area of lacunar infarction is seen within the region of the right basal ganglia.
IMPRESSION: Intraventricular, subdural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage as described above without associated significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Generalized tonic-clonic seizures 2.
Small subdural hematomas   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You have been found to have multiple small collections of blood in your head.
