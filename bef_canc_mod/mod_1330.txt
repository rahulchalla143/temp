# Complicated UTI: History of Vanc Sensitive Enterococci & ESBL E.Coli.
The patient arrived with the following prior labwork: urine cx from [**10-30**] was known to have ESBL E coli and VSE, urine cx from [**11-13**] that ultimately grew ESBL E coli and yeast.
# Labile blood pressure: Several hours after being admitted to the floor, triggered for BP in the low 80s, subjective malaise / lethargy, and decreased attention.
Was transiently responsive to fluid boluses but because of refractory hypotension and concern for urosepsis, transferred to the MICU for observation; flagyl was empirically started because of concern for C.Dif.
Diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, bladder spasm: His pain was localized to his upper midline groin, and was ultimately attributed to bladder spasm.
The patient did not produce any stools for culture/guaiac after transfer from MICU even with bowel regimen.
# Recurrent UTI s/p suprapubic catheter: Underwent placement of a suprapubic catheter [**2172-11-20**] with urology for recurrent UTIs and bladder spasm.
# Hypoxia / Possible infiltrate on CXR: Possible infiltrate on CXR: Patchy R Base infiltrate on CXR on admission was concerning for PNA and in the setting of labile pressures, was empirically covered with meropenem.
Resolution of hypotension and symptomatic improvement with improvement of UTI was reassuring for the patient not having a pulmonary process.
No ECG changes.
Pain was reproducible with palpation pointing to it likely being MSK in etiology.
# Post-procedure hypoxia and CAD: Became hypoxic after placement of the suprapubic catheter, thought to be due to volume overload from IVF administered during the procedure.
CXR was suggested of pulmonary edema.
The day of discharge a nuclear stress test was performed that showed a partially reversible inferior wall defect with associated hypokinesis and reversible low inferolateral ischemia associated with hypokinesis; EF was 43% from 63% in [**2164**] and EDV was elevated at 104cc.
He has a long history of medication non compliance and would not be a candidate for more aggressive interventions at this time.
# Conjunctivitis: The patient was observed to have injected conjunctiva on [**11-19**] with thick white discharge bilaterally.
# Diabetes mellitus: The patient was kept on humalog insulin sliding scale with good glycemic control.
# CAD: Med management of CAD with home dose atenolol and ASA 81mg po daily.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Antibiotic resistant urinary tract infection associated with urinary catheter Bladder spasm  Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitus type 2 Coronary Artery Disease High blood pressure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized because of a recurrent urinary tract infection, which you were susceptible to developing because you had an indwelling foley catheter in your penis.
You had lower abdominal pain this admission as well, which we believe was caused partially by your urinary tract infection.
This pain improved with IV antibiotics but did not resolve completely because of your chronic bladder spasm.
This catheter should improve your abdominal pain and also make you less susceptible to infection.
During this hospitalization you had low blood pressures, which may have been caused by your infection, although this is not certain because no cultures have grown any bacteria.
You had chest discomfort prior to this admission and difficulty breathing as well.
We performed numerous tests which showed that you were not having a heart attack.
