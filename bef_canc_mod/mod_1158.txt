There were also multiple stones in the biliary tree.
There, he had a fever to 105F and his SBPs fell to the 80s.
He was seen by ERCP who wanted to watch him clinically for now, and feels he likely has an area of edema causing mild obstruction versus biloma in rt lobe or retained stone fragment.
He reports increased LE edema and abdominal distension beginning today.
He has continued mild RUQ pain, but no other abdominal pain.

RUQ Ultrasound (wet read): [**2118-12-16**]: Stable size to right lower liver lobe bile [**Doctor Last Name **], but with new echogenic debris.
may be related to recent ERCP, but infection cannot be excluded.
Microbiology: Blood cultures x 2 [**2118-12-16**]: [**2118-12-16**] 8:20 pm BLOOD CULTURE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2118-12-19**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2118-12-19**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.

coli bacteremia: Multiple episodes of biliary obstruction previously thought to be secondary to hepatic artery insufficiency and presenting with fevers, rising bilirubin, RUQ pain after ERCP on [**2117-12-14**].
GNRs growing in both BCx from ED with sensitivities as above, most likely source from biliary source.
Bedside U/S shows no obvious pocket for ascites.
His bacteremia resulted to E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone, for which he was switched to complete a 10 day total course through [**2118-12-25**].
