Low voltage.
Minor T wave abnormalities.
CXR [**2158-6-21**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, an area of parenchymal opacity has newly occurred at the right lung base.
Although, the area could correspond to atelectasis, the possibility of early pneumonia should not be discarded in the appropriate clinical context.
Minimal new retrocardiac atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No pleural effusions.
[**2158-6-21**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-12**], the findings are similar with normal biventricular systolic function, dilated right ventricle and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2158-6-23**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2158-6-21**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2158-6-22**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Confirmation should be requested in cases of treatment failure in          life-threatening infections..   Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with a history of prostate cancer, COPD with an FEV1 33% predicted, and cirrhosis who presented from his group home with hypoxia found to have a pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation.
Pneumonia, Hypoxia: Diagnosis supported by leukocytosis, high normal temperature, symptoms and consolidation on CXR in the setting of a respiratory culture which grew H.flu.
He was initially covered for HCAP with double gram negative coverage with 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluroquinolone, and vancomycin for MRSA coverage.
His oxygenation also improved prior to discharge after receiving lasix 60mg IV once with large volume urine output.
There was some concern for aspiration so he was evaluated at the bedside by speech and swallow and was felt to be safe to eat a regular diet without evidence of aspiration.
Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient's initial ABG was consistent with acute respiratory acidosis most likely in the setting of some degree of chronic hypercarbia given his severe COPD.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine was initially 1.6 from baseline 1, with FeNa 0.1 and hyponatremia felt to be [**2-7**] pre-renal azotemia in the setting of pneumonia and poor po intake.
# Scleral icterus: Has history of ?
cryptogenic cirrhosis vs alcoholic cirrhosis.
He remained compensated during his stay without evidence of encephalopathy.
# Anemia of chronic disease: Hct baseline 27 - 33 with elevated MCV on folate with elevated ferritin and iron:TIBC ratio ~50%.
This should be trended to ensure no further decrease.
# Schizophrenia: Benztropine, ativan and risperidal should be continued.
# Prostate cancer: On long-term hormonal therapy for metastatic bone disease.
