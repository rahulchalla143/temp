WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2132-2-25**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Generalized low voltages are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested.
[**2132-2-20**] CXR: No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Findings concerning for development of osteomyelitis at the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals  [**2132-2-23**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Multiple areas of skin ulceration, over the medial, lateral, and plantar foot, extending near to the bone in several areas, with edema and enhancement seen within the lateral cuboid, and base of the fifth metatarsal, and also within the navicular bone, concerning for osteomyelitis.
Findings most consistent with neuropathic osteoarthropathy within the midfoot.
Diffuse soft tissue edema, and edema within the plantar musculature.
Markedly abnormal study showing a large deep right gluteal decubitus ulcer extending to the right iliac bone, as before.
Chronic osteomyelitis in the right ilium with acute on chronic osteomyelitis and small fluid collection in the posterior right ilium adjacent to the SI joint and small collection about the superior right ilium.
Asymmetric amount of fluid in right sacroiliac joint, may be reactive in the setting of acute osteomyelitis, presence of infection is not excluded.
Decubitus ulcer extends to the perineum and in close proximity to the urethra with persistent foci of air and marked enhancement in the perineal region.
Marked muscle atrophy and edema about the pelvic girdle.
Left parasympyseal abnormality may be due to reactive changes versus acute osteomyelitis.
DISCHARGE LABS:  141  119  3 ------------ <89 3.5  19  0.2  Ca: 7.1 Mg: 2.2 P: 2.6 MCV 72    6.2 7.7> <268    20.6  Repeat hematocrit: 23.7  Brief Hospital Course: 46 year old female with a history of transverse myelitis (T7) with subsequent paraplegia, multiple dependent ulcers (including stage IV decubitus ulcer), left heel ulcer osteomyelitis s/p treatment in [**2130**], and now recurrent left foot osteomyelitis who presents with hypotension and tachycardia concerning for sepsis.
# Osteomyelitis of left foot and pelvis: Patient was empirically started on vancomycin and meropenem given previous culture sensitivitis for treatment of her osteomyelitis.
A wound swab of her left heel was done which grew out proteus and pseudomonas on culture (see above for sensitivities).
She underwent MRI of both her left foot on [**2-23**] showing multifocal osteo and her pelvis also showing chronic osteo of the R ilium.
Given the multifocal and significant disease burden, debridement and amputation were tabled during this admission and therapy with antibiotics alone was pursued.
Patient will need to follow up with outpatient infectious disease specialists for further management as well as with her outpatient orthopedic surgeon to discuss possible future left below knee amputation.
# Tachycardia/hypotension: Initially there was high concern for sepsis given her pressures in the 70s and tachycardia in the 130s.
Septic physiology was felt to be less concerning given patient's decent urine output and appropriate mentation.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia consistently.
Differential for the patient's strange hemodynamics include neurogenic causes given her transverse myelitis as volume repletion, pressors, and treatment of her infection had little effect on her heart rate and blood pressure.
The possibility of PE was considered but was felt unlikely given the patient's pristine oxygen saturations on room air, lack of dyspnea and baseline paraplegia as well as the chronic nature of her hemodynamics.
An ECHO showed preserved global ventricular function without effusion.
Concern for decompensation would be heightened if her mental status were to deteriorate or urine output were to fall.
We also noticed that anxiety and pain were at times contributors and recommend continuing her lorazepam and morphine as needed.
She remained at her hemodynamic baseline without signs of bleeding.
Hemolysis and DIC labs negative.
# Diarrhea- Patient reported diarrhea for 1 month.
However during her hospitalization she had no episodes of diarrhea and actually did not stool for several days.
Given no abdominal pain and no diarrhea during hospitalization, concern for C. diff was low.
Recommend monitoring stools since patient is at risk given her long term antibiotics.
# Psychotic disorder- Patient with a history of chronic schizophrenia (paranoid and disorganized features) currently stable.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer- Stage IV, extensive ulcer with deep involvement extending from posterior to anterior surfaces.
Did not appear infected on superficial examination, though clearly with underlying infection given MRI findings.
# Nutrition- Laboratory results suggest significant nutritional deficiencies with albumin of 1.6 and elevated coags.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
3. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
5. oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for bladder spasms.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU because you had low blood pressures and a fast heart rate which were concerning for infection.
