He also had resection of LV outlet tumor which was found to be papillary fibroelastoma.
He presented to his PCP's office today and had some mild shortness of breath and was feeling generally unwell.
He began to feel somewhat unwell about 6 days ago at work when he missed work and had a blood sugar in the 50s.
He had some episodes of lightheadedness, which he thought was related to low blood sugar.
An EKG was performed and showed ST depression in the lateral leads and ST elevations in R-sided leads.
EKG showed NSR with ST dep lateral leads, ST elevations in R sided leads.
On review of systems, he has had mild dry cough that has persisted since his surgery.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

ECHO ([**2170-3-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

# CORONARIES: Patient had known 4 vessel disease and was s/p bypass graft on [**2170-1-8**].
He also began to notice mild dyspnea on exertion without chest pain, orthopnea, PND.
Given the fact that the patient's troponin was slightly elevated, a diagnossi of non-ST elevation MI was made.
Per interventional cardiology, pt will need to return for another cath for stenting of SVG-diag in [**4-4**] weeks after acute changes from initial bypass have quieted down since the stenting will likely take place in one of the bypassed vessels.
Unfortunately, the patient has had rather rapid failure of his bypass grafts.
# PUMP: Patient has known depressed systolic function (EF 30-35%).
He has no signs of volume overload on admission.
Repeat TTE on [**2170-3-9**] showed anterior, septal and apical akinesis with depressed EF that was overal similar to prior ECHO but did not show hoped for improvement in systolic function after bypass.
He has had several episodes of hypoglycemia recently and his blood sugar may be too tightly controlled.
While in house, we  decreased novolin from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] given recent low FS and in light of that patient will be NPO for tomorrow's cath.
As above, statin changed to Rovastatin 20mg daily to optimize lipid reduction in setting of bad coronary disease with little available as interventional options and all efforts being made to optimize medical management.
# Hypertension: currently well-controlled.
14. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain .
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute coranary syndrome Chronic Systolic Heart failure, EF 30% Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to EKG changes and shortness of breath.
You were sent to the ICU and then had a cardiac catheterization, it showed imparment of the bypassed blood vessels in your heart.
REPEAT CATHETERIZATION DID NOT DEMONSTRATE ANY NEW CHANGES IN CORONARY ARTERY OR GRAFT ANATOMY.
AS OF THIS DISCHARGE SUMMARY, THE PATIENT HAS A VERY GRAVE PROGNOSIS.
