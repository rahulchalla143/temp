History of Present Illness: 67 yo woman with history of atypical meningioma in [**11-21**], s/p resection and then XRT which was complete in [**2-22**].
Her family says that prior to her tumor resection pt had significant cognitive dysfunction and inattention, most of which resolved after resection.
For the past few months she has been improving significantly with regards to her mental status.
No seizure-like activity.
On Wednesday had worsening of her prior tremors in her arms and mouth.
No LOC or incontinence with the fall.
She was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic this am and there was concern about her deterioration in mental status and therefore she was sent to ED for further workup.

Difficulty writing.
More detailed frontal lobe testing difficult due to inattention.
CN: PERRLA, VFFTC, optic disks sharp, no papilledema or hemorrhages.
[**6-21**] SS bilaterally.
Tongue midline, no atrophy or fasciculation.
Tremor of mouth very notable.
Motor: Nl bulk and tone, resting and action tremor R>L, and in jaw.
No pronator drift.
Strength is roughly [**6-21**] throughout but pt has give-way weakness and will not hold attention to full formal strength testing.
[**Last Name (un) **]: difficult due to inattention.

Periventricular white matter hypodensity likely represents chronic small vessel infarction.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
--- Head MRI:IMPRESSION: No significant interval change since the previous study of [**2193-4-8**].
Craniotomy is seen in the left frontal region with encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe.
Changes of small vessel disease are noted.
No acute infarcts, mass effect, or midline shift.
No enhancing lesions.
--- EEG [**6-25**]:This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in wakefulness  due to the presence of continuous [**2-18**] Hz delta frequency slowing  intermixed with slow theta frequency slowing over the left frontal temporal region with intermixed sharp features.
This finding suggests a subcortical dysfunction over the entire left frontal temporal region and anatomic correlation is recommended.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded.
EEG [**6-26**]: IMPRESSION: This 24 hour EEG telemetry is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Anterior, distal septal, apical, and distal inferior  akinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo woman with history of meningioma s/p resection in [**2192**] who presented with new evidence of encephalopathy with inattention as well as evidence of some frontal lobe dysfunction (perseveration, inappropriate affect).
Upon admission, she had no metabolic or electrolyte imbalances.
A complication included severe nephrotoxicity (creat 6).
An MRI was performed which showed no new tumor, no new white matter disease, no evidence of bleeding, or any other changes from her prior MRI.
She has no enhancing lesions.
No evidence of radiation induced necrosis.
The patient had an EEG that showed slowing at the site of her old tumor resection with some sharp features as well.
She remained intermittently confused, with a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status that seemed to change fairly suddenly at times according to her family.
No clinical seizures were noted.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATIENT [**Month (only) **] HAVE EPISODES WITH RHYTHMICAL MOUTH MOVEMENTS.
THESE DO NOT REPRESENT SEIZURES AND DO NOT HAVE A CORRELATE ON EEG.
Her mental status changes were thought to be due to steroid taper, rather than seizures, although no clear adrenal insufficiency was present.
Further adjustments per brain tumor clinic.
Another factor that may have affected her MS is hypothyroidism (see below).
The patient was started on ISS and ajdustments were made as per endocrine service.
Initially she was treated with acyclovir for possible viral encephalitis (see above).
No source of infection was found.
Renal: The patient had acute renal failure (creat 6) due to acyclovir.
Hypernatremia: During the admission, the patient developed hypernatremia due to a deficit in free water.
During the admission, an NGT was placed for increased aspiration risk.
Pulm: She had some swelling in her LEs and ?
of pain, so LENIs were done and negative for DVT.
She also had some borderline hypoxia eith O2 sats in the low 90s.
We considered PE, but her D-dimer was only mildly elevated and her hypoxia resolved.
Prophylaxis included ca carbonate 500mg TID; vit D; heparin xs TID; lansoprazole; senna, colace.
