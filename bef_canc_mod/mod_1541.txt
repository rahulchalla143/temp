Admission Date:  [**2203-6-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2203-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-7-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Febrile seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2203-6-7**] Intubation [**2203-6-8**] RIJ line placement [**2203-6-8**] IR-guided lumbar puncture [**2203-6-9**] TEE  History of Present Illness: 57F presenting after witnessed seizure.
After returning from work, she was watching television with her husband when ~7pm, she had a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure lasting ~15 minutes.
She received ativan 2mg IV x 2 by EMS for recurrence of seizure activity, which then broke, and upon arrival to ED she was no longer seizing.
Past Medical History: - SLE c/b lupus nephritis - Rheumatic heart disease, s/p bioprosthetic AVR [**9-9**], s/p mechanical MVR with tricuspid valve annuloplasty [**10-13**].
Now with moderate MS and MR, moderate AS and moderate to severe TR, mild pHTN (42/16).
- HTN - Raynaud?????
?s syndrome - s/p cholecystectomy - chronic anemia [**2-7**] recurrent GI bleeds, source unclear (extensive GI workup including capsule endoscopy on [**11-26**] showed no significant source for bleeding), on procrit [**2-7**] CRI, PPI for GIB prophylaxis.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T 103 HR 70 BP 104/76 RR 14 O2 100% on AC 500/40/14/5 General: Intubated, sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple-no meningismus, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Irregularly irregular, mechanical S1, and S2 with difficult to hear heart sounds over ventilator Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: no rash/petechiae NEURO: pupils 3mm->2mm bilaterally, withdraws to pain minimally, minimal arousal to sternal rub, dolls eyes intact.
[**2203-6-7**] ECG: Junctional rhythm with atrial premature complexes.
Possible left posterior fascicular block or inferior myocardial infarction.
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia/myocardial infarction Since previous tracing of [**2202-12-27**], rhythm new, axis more right inferiorly, shorter Q-T interval and peaked T waves - consider hyperkalemia - clinical correlation is suggested .
Left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2203-6-7**] CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process.
Areas of encephalomalacia within the bilateral parietal and left frontal regions likely attributed to prior ischemic insult.
[**2203-6-8**] CT head w/o contrast: No significant change since the prior study dated [**2203-6-7**], unchanged areas of encephalomalacia involving the bilateral temporoparietal lobes and left frontal region, likely consistent with prior chronic ischemic events.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
If there is any clinical concern related with an acute/subacute ischemic changes, correlation with MRI is recommended if clinically warranted.
Multiple areas in bilateral hemispheres, mostly frontal and parietal lobes, particularly in the left frontal lobe concerning for subacute embolic infarcts.
No abnormalities seen within the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] vasculature.
No evidence for hemorrhagic conversion.
Small vessel perivascular ischemic and age-related atrophy.
Prior left thalamic infarct.
[**2203-6-7**] TTE: The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-12-20**], there is no significant change.
No vegetations identified but a TEE is required to assess prosthetic valves for endocarditis.
Mild paravalvular leak and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
No aortic vegetation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
No tricuspid or pulmonic valve vegetations.
Brief Hospital Course: # Endocarditis: Patient had staph aureus in [**4-9**] BCx bottles from admission and a history of mechanical valve as well as bio-prostetic valve.
# seizure - Given fever, leukocytosis, bandemia, an infectious etiology, particularly meningitis, seemed likely on presentation.
LP was performed in IR and revealed a leukocytosis.
MRI head showed multiple likely septic emboli.
She was continued on dilantin, dosed by level, and antibiotics as above for endocarditis with presumed seeding of the CSF.
# hypotension - Patient had septic shock on presentation and required levophed to maintain pressures after receiving 9L IVF.
# metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology, lactate trended down with IVF and antibiotic treatment.
# SLE c/b lupus nephritis: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3057**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt her plaquenil should be held in the setting of her acute illness.
# Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR: She was started on a heparin gtt and coumadin was held given likelihood of procedures during her hospitalization.
# HTN - Her home medications of coreg, valsartan and lisinopril were held during this hospitalization.
