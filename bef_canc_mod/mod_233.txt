TRACING #1  Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 79 150 74 392/425 71 5 55   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19376**] is a 76yo F with severe COPD on 4 L home O2 admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was thought to be due to a COPD exacerbation  in the setting of medication non-compliance, resumption of smoking.
She is also likely a chronic retainer of CO2 given the severity of her COPD and her chronically elevated bicarbonates, and her serial ABGs demonstrating an underlying chronic respiratory acidosis.
She appeared clinically euvolemic on exam, so acute heart failure exacerbation was less likely.
Her sputum, blood, and urine cultures showed no evidence of underlying infection.
She also initially received Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for treatment of possible community acquired pneumonia -- sputum returned without any growth so antibiotics were tapered, and she completed 5 days of Azithromycin in the hospital.
She occasionally desaturates down to 80% when eating or beig turned, which returns to her baseline oxygen saturations with repositioning and increased oxygen delivery.
Recent normal mammogram in [**2165**] with some fibrocystic changes.
# Secondary Polycythemia: Elevated Hematocrit chronic, likely from uncorrected hypoxemia and history of smoking.
