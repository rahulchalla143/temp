He states that 30 hours after he had a bone scan to evaluate for metastases he began to develop fevers and chills.
He denies URI like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain.
He denies sick contacts or recent travel.
He denies chest pain or shortness of breath (although does have it with exertion) or dysuria.
ROS: as in HPI and including no lightheadedness, hemoptysis, muscle pains or aches.
He did have some left thigh tightness with exertion and then at rest for the last few weeks.
This is what led to the bone scan to ensure there were no mets.
- nocardosis.
has pain to legs.
- h/o Grave's disease s/p radioablation.
on levothyroxine - PAF with in the perioperative period during each of 3 surgeries - PUD - cholelithiasis - CAD - dyshydrotic eczema - hemorrhoidectomy in [**2061**] - MVA in [**2062**] with transient LOC - cataracts - h/o microscopic hematuria  Social History: Married and lives in [**Location **].
Family History: positive for breast cancer, DM  Physical Exam: vitals T 99.2, BP 110/58, HR 95, RR 20, O2 sat 98% RA General: pleasant male in NAD.
HEENT: NCAT, anicteric sclera, non-injected conjunctiva, PERRLA, EOMI, OP mildly erythematous without exudate.
No anterior or posterior cervical, occipital, posterior or anterior auricular, or supraclavicular LAD.
CV: RRR no S1 S2 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the USB Lungs: Scar on right from thoracotomy.
Absent breath sounds on right except anteriorly which was clear.
No wheezing/rales or rhonchi heard Abdomen: +BS, soft, NTND, no HSM appreciated Ext: no e/c/c.
No patellar reflex elicited on left.
No evidence of pneumonia in the right upper lobe or left lung.
[**2108-1-31**] MRI L spine:  IMPRESSION:  Limited, but unchanged lumbar MRI with no definite epidural abscess, discitis, or osteomyelitis identified.
[**2108-1-31**] TTE: Conclusions: Mild LVH with LVEF>55%.
Mild aortic valve thickening.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
Increasing right pleural effusion and pleural thickening, concerning for metastatic involvement although infection is also possible.
Asymmetric thickness of right lateral chest wall with questionable increased enhancement compared to normal musculature of left lateral chest wall, concerning for possible chest wall neoplastic involvement.
New geographically marginated air space opacities in right upper lobe as well as additional peribronchovascular right upper lobe nodular opacities and left upper lobe ground glass without geographic distribution.
Although possibly representing radiation pneumonitis and associated hypersensitivity reaction, coexisting infection or edema should also be considered.
Soft tissue thickening and stranding in the mediastinum, possibly due to post-radiation changes.
Confluent 1.5-cm soft tissue density posterior to right main bronchus, without air bronchograms adjacent to more typical post-radiation changes.
[**2108-2-1**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial nocardiosis or other acute process.
[**2108-2-3**] CXR: SINGLE AP UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is near complete opacification of the right hemithorax.
The patient is s/p lobectomy of the right middle and lower lobes, with known loculated pleural effusions of the upper and lower lung zones.
Given the history of recent transbronchial biopsy, this is concerning for a non- visualized pneumothorax, hemorrhage, or mucous plugging causing bronchial obstruction.
The left hemithorax is clear with a tiny pleural effusion.
There is now increased infiltrate and/or edema throughout the left lung.
Mild pulmonary edema of the residual right lobe and left lung persists, though there has been marked improvement compared to [**2108-2-7**] and [**2108-2-8**].
No evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged mild pulmonary edema and postoperative appearance of the right hemithorax.
There is a persistent pleural opacity at the right upper lung zone with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
Unchanged layering right pleural effusion.
The remaining right lung is better aerated though there is a rounded lateral opacity which may represent resolving edema or atelectasis.
The left lung is clear, with resolution of pulmonary edema.
No invasive lines or tubes are seen.
IMPRESSION: Resolved pulmonary edema with mild residual atelectasis in the right lung.
Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old male with history of stage 3a lung ca s/p chemo/XRT/surgery who presented with 2 days of fevers, and required a MICU admission for respiratory distress.
Thought to be secondary to viral/bacterial lower respiratory infection vs. ARDS vs. post-XRT inflammatory process such as BOOP.
Although likely an infectious etiology, patient continued to spike fevers through vancomycin/[**Last Name (un) 2830**].
Serologies sent for mycoplasma infection are pending.
No evidence of nocardia, fungus, or AFB on BAL gram stain and cultures.
He was treated with steroid taper for possible BOOP as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible underlying pneumonia.
Infectious etiologies include pneumonia vs. parapneumonic effusion vs, endocarditis (new murmur on exam no heard during PCP visit last month or documented on ECHO- although systolic murmur heard at the base not apex more suggestive of flow murmur secondary to fever), UTI (U/A mostly clean).
CT head was done to look for disseminated nocardosis as he recently finished a course of minocycline for nocardia infection.
He continued to have fevers for several days.
Thoracentesis and bronchoscopy were done to try to identify a source of infection or return of malignancy.
#Vocal cord paralysis- S/p previous lung resection.
# NSSLC: Recent CT and bone scan show no suggestion of metastases.
CT chest was done and suggested there was a new mass and worsening effusion.
# PUD: continued PPI .
# PPX: heparin SC for DVT ppx given h/o malignancy despite his ambulation, PPI as patient takes at home .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - stage 3a NSSLC - ?aspiration pneumonia vs BOOP - fever unknown origin - PAF - Right true vocal cord paralysis .
Secondary: -HTN -spinal stenosis -h/o Grave's disease s/p radioablation.
Etiology included aspiration pneumonia vs BOOP.
-Please return to the hospital if you are experiencing shortness of breath, fever>101, abdominal pain, or any other symptoms concerning to you.
