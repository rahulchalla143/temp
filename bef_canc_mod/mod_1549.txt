DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7593**]    Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo male with a history of Afib, hypertension, constipation and lung cancer presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-7-8**] with severe abdominal pain, vomitting, iarrhea and an elevated white count.
The patient also received an CXR to evaluate the mediastinum for free air and it too was negative.
What's more, he received a CT scan which demonstrated early cholecystitis.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had a large palpable gallbladder.
At surgery, he was found to have a necrotizing cholecystitis with hemorrhage into the wall as well as necrotic gallbladder.
The cystic duct actually had a very small stricture  at its junction with the common bile duct which precluded completion of choledochoscopy as noted in the procedure below.
There was no evidence of any ductal injury.
Later on, he became disoriented and began pulling lines.
There was also leakage of similary fluid from the wound.
POD2:  Patient CXR demonstrated congested lungs.
Haldol was continued for the agitation and steroid administration was tapered off to avoid possible consequences associated with long term steroid use.
Patient's blood pressure was also elevated and was thus, placed on Lopressor and Hydralazine.
His WBC dropped to 11.7 from a high of ~15 a couple of days prior due to the administration of steroids, which will continue to be tapered off.
Lungs mostly clear with scattered rhonchi.
Abdomen soft and wound clean and dry.
Abdomen still slightly distended and patient is having loose bowel movements.
He could void independently without difficulty, tolerate appropriate po diet, demonstrated markedly reduced dyspnea on exertion  with no pain and a healing wound   Medications on Admission: Prednisone 5'(temporal arteritis), Atenolol 25', Coumadin 2.5', Simvastatin 10', Tamsulosin 0.4 SR', Clonazepam 1 hs, Protonix 40', Albuterol, Atrovent, Salmeterol 100'   Discharge Medications: 1.
