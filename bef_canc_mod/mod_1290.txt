Admission Date:  [**2173-3-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-12-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: transferred from OSH for IPH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation tracheostomy PEG tube placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 90430**] is a 74 year-old left-handed man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and emphysema (on 3L suppl O2 at baseline)initially evaluated at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85061**] after being found unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when imaging revealed several foci of hemorrhage in the left forntoparietal regions.
He was not responsive to voice or tactile stimulation.
A non-contrast CT of the head was done, and showed hemorrhage in the left frontaoparietal regions.
NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW OF SYSTEMS - unobtainable  GENERAL REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: - unobtainable   Past Medical History: - CHF (EF unknown) - SBO - gallstones - HTN - HLD - GERD - emphysema - on 3.5 L suppl O2 at baseline   Social History: - lives with fiance - retired police officer   Family History: - negative for known neurological conditions   Physical Exam: Exam on Admission:  Vitals: T: nr P: 83 R: 16  BP: 135/61 SaO2: 100% propofol suspended for 10 minutes General: intubated HEENT: Normocepahlic, truamatic with dried blood in region of left ear, right nare Neck: c-collar Cardiac: Regular rate, normal S1 and S2.
No murmurs appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Skin: scattered ecchymoses mostly on right aspect of body; no appreciable splinter hemorrhages.
* III, IV, VI: gaze conjugate; eyes stay midline with doll's maneuver * V, VI: corneals intact bilat * VII: No obvious facial droop.
No evidence of acute intrathoracic or intra-abdominal injury; Cholelithiasis; Calcifications along the pleura on the left, likely due to prior asbestos exposure; Focal aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3.1 cm.
CT C-spine: No fracture.
Degenerative changes noted throughout the cervical spine with moderate anterior osteophytes and calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
Small posterior osteophytes are noted at C4-5 and cause mild canal narrowing  CTA ([**3-5**]): Left frontal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema; CT angiography demonstrates no evidence of abnormal vascular structures, early draining veins to indicate arteriovenous malformation or enhancing lesion in the region of hemorrhage; A tiny 1.5-mm infundibulum versus aneurysm at the right posterior communicating artery is likely incidental, unrelated to the hemorrhage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MR head with and w/out contrast ([**3-6**]): Left frontal intra-axial hematoma with mild surrounding edema without evidence of associated abnormal vascular structures or abnormal enhancement; Chronic microhemorrhage is seen in the right posterior temporal region; No evidence of acute infarct, midline shift or hydrocephalus; Small vessel disease; Soft tissue swelling in the parietal skull.
EEG ([**3-9**]): continuous EEG on [**3-9**] showed a low voltage slow encephalopathic background throughout.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
TEE ([**3-9**]): No evidence for ASD/PFO.
No atrial thrombus identified.
Simple atherosclerotic plaque in descending aorta and aortic arch.
MRI/V head ([**3-10**]): Evolving left frontal intra-axial hematoma with surrounding edema.
No evidence of a mass lesion.
No evidence of major dural venous sinus thrombosis.
Punctate foci of slow diffusion is demonstrated in the left posterior frontal lobe and right parasagittal frontal lobe likely suggesting hemorrhage.
Stable shallow subdural collection overlying the right cerebral convexity  CXR ([**2173-3-20**]):   The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo LHM w pmh including htn, hld, emphysema (3.5 L suppl O2 at baseline) who presented to [**Hospital1 189**] Gen after found unresponsive to tactile/verbal stim + bleeding from ear + nose and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] when found to have several foci of L frontoparietal hemorrhages in a watershed distribution.
He also has some microbleeds and punctate infarcts in bilateral hemispheres.
Neurologic: He was admitted to the Neurology ICU for his left frontoparital hemorrhages.
Was initially in C-collar but this was cleared by CT C-spine.
EEG was performed and did not show any epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
Given that he initially had fevers, there was concern that he may have had septic embolic with hemorrhagic conversion; however TTE and TEE performed with no evidence vegetations.
There was also no evidence of ASD or atrial clot.
MRI performed to further evaluate etiology of bleed; MRI showed presence of hemorrhage without acute infarct, shift or hydrocephalus.
Possible etiologies for the hemorrhage include hemorrhagic conversion vs. amyloid vs. HTN.
He initially had an elevated CK, however this trended down following IVF support.
ID: Completed 8 day course of antibiotics (Cefepime/[**Month/Day (1) **]/Vanco) for suspected VAP (gram stain from BAL indicative infection but only commensal respiratory grew out on cultures).
About 2 days after completing course of abx, he was spiking fevers again and WBC trending up.
Given the elevated white count and fevers, he was started on Vanco and Zosyn empirically.

10. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Capsule PO bid prn as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: L intraparnechymal hemorrhage Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (treated, though culture negative)  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Opens eyes to voice Level of Consciousness: lethargic, arousable can follow simple commands Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after being unresponsive at home.
You were found to have bleeding on the left side of your brain; this is resulting in your right sided weakness.
To help with BP control given the bleeding in your brain, you were started on a medication called Amlodipine and were continued on your home Atenolol.
