HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old white female with a history times six months of a right medial malleolar nonhealing wound.
The Sulfa course was not tolerated well and it was associated with loose stools and nausea.
She cannot recall any specific injury to the site and denies venous stasis disease.
Pain is with walking but accentuated with climbing stairs described as a heaviness in the hip.
Sulfa causes nausea and vomiting.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Remarkable for ten pound weight loss over the last two months, fevers, chills, sweats and adenopathy.
She admits to a murmur which is known for years but no myocardial infarction, hypertension, chest pain, congestive heart failure, ankle edema.
She denies renolithiasis, hematuria.
She denies any vaginal symptoms, vaginal bleeding or discharge.
There is no jugular venous distention or thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy appreciated.
No breast masses.
On the left, the popliteal is 1+ with dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial signals.
There are no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No abdominal aortic aneurysm widening noted.
The right medial malleolar ulcer is clean base with no erythema or exudate.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 30.2, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 539,000, differential neutrophils 84, bands 6, lymphocytes 8, monocytes 1, no eosinophils or basophils.
Preoperative chest x-ray was remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with increased density in the right lung apex.
The patient had a P-MIBI done on [**2158-11-20**], which showed abnormal myocardial perfusion with severe fixed defect in the inferior wall toward the base with a mild amount of reversibility in the distal anterior wall extending into the apex and inferior apex.
Global ejection fraction is diminished to 46% with hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Preoperative electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature depolarizations.
Anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Diffuse nondiagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
The patient did have episodes of sinus tachycardia.
Cardiology was requested to see the patient because of persistent tachycardia and atrial flutter versus MAT versus sinus tachycardia.
Check TSH to rule out thyroid disease.
She underwent a P-MIBI on postoperative day six which was positive for inferior wall myocardial infarction with some reversibility.
Wound care right medial malleolar ulcer with Hydrogel to wound base once daily with dry sterile dressing change.
Ischemic medial malleolar ulceration, status post right ileofemoral to femoral popliteal bypass with greater saphenous conduit, 2.
