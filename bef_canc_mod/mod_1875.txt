History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 103090**] is a 76 year old female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes.
Per review of records, the patient had a fever at her NH with a Tmax of 102.9 today with a CXR performed at her nursing home that demonstrated increased congestion without consolidation per report.
A urinalysis She was also reported to have altered mental status from her baseline.
Of note, the patient appears to have relatively frequent admissions for altered mental status and fever, most recently in [**10-19**] with another admission in [**12-19**] for bleeding AVF.
The patient also had a left femoral CVL after being unable to place a LIJ, RIJ, or right femoral CVL.
CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema but no acute consolidation.
CTAP was notable for a wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding in the left colon.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-2**] and [**3-4**]:  The right perihilar lung has cleared at least radiographically since [**3-4**], [**2175**], probably due to decreasing moderate-sized right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course: # Fevers / bacteremia / infected AV fistula: 76 year old female with DMII, ESRD on HD, dCHF, CVA, dementia who was initially admitted to the MICU for fever and hyperkalemia with ECG changes.
She underwent HD and was called out to the medical floor with improvment of her K. At baseline she is disoriented to person, place, mumbling speech, ambulating with walker; [**Name8 (MD) **] NP altered from baseline AND in setting of fever and elevated lactate strongly suggests underlying infectious etiology; initally, most likely etiology thought to be colitis apparent on CT abdomen; patient high risk for  diff colitis given past history of recent antibiotic use.
Initially there was also a concern for intra-abominal process and so she was started on cipro/flagyl.
C. diff was negative and CT abd/pelvis was without infectious etiology.
CNS possible source given fever and AMS although less likely with CT findings and absence of meningeal signs on PEx.
Endocarditis possible source given murmur, but no embolic phenomena visualized and murmur is not acute; TTE was unremarkable.
Reports of difficulty threading wire in ED through IJ and concern for clot raises concern of septic thrombus.
On the floor at approximately 1730 that day, she was found by nursing to be in a pool of blood and was bleeding from her fistula site.
Arctic cooling protocol was discussed after her PEA arrest but deferred given patient's improved/return to baseline mental status shortly after the event.
Repeat TTE on [**2-23**] was negative for vegetations.
A WBC scan showed small tracer uptake at the graft site, without any other source in the body.
There was minimal bleeding over 24 hrs at the catheter tunneled site which IR injected with thrombin and achieved hemostasis, the patient should not be weight bearing for 12 hours after this.
# Diabetes [**Month/Day (1) **] type II.
# Diastolic CHF, chronic.
She has diastolic HF based on prior TTE and CXR with signs of mild fluid overload, but no signs of respiratory distress.
We continued HD for fluid removal.
# Dementia.
Her baseline mental status is poor in setting of vascular dementia.
The psychotropics were held this admission due to her altered mental status.
# Hypertension.
# Hypothyroid.
# Hyperlipidemia.
Heparin (Porcine) 1,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Hyperkalemia with EKG changes Bacteremia with MRSA AV fistula graft infection .
Secondary Diagnoses End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Type II diabetes [**Location (un) **] Vascular Dementia Hypertension Osteoarthritis Cataracts Hypothyroidism Anemia Diastolic congestive heart failure S/p cerebrovascular accident   Discharge Condition: afebrile, stable vitals, tolerating POs .
Mental Status:Confused - always Level of Consciousness:Lethargic but arousable Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of high potassium levels in the blood and bacteria in your blood.
An extensive workup was conducted throughout your body and it was determined that the bacteria was coming from an infection in your AV fistula/graft.
Initially, we could not perform a surgery on this site to remove the infectious nidus; however, the graft led to a serious bleed which required multiple blood products.
You had a guide wire left in your aorta as well but this was succesfully found and retrieved without any complications.
You continued to have positive blood cultures despite being on IV antibiotics after this time and ultimately had a graft revision by transplant surgery after which time your blood cultures remained negative.
You had placement of a tunneled HD catheter for dialysis which initially had small amounts of bleeding which was ultimately controlled.
- Please take amlodipine 10mg daily - Please take hydralazine 50mg every 8 hrs - Please stop taking Aspirin 81mg due to concerns for bleeding around your HD catheter site - Please stop taking olanzapine and trazodone There were no other changes to your medicines.
Please do not hesitate to return to the hospital for any concerning symptoms at all.
