He did well until [**Month (only) 116**] when abnormal liver function tests were noted.
The tests were specifically cholestatic with elevated alkaline phosphatase.
Hepatic artery stenosis was ruled out by hepatic angiogram.
A liver biopsy was performed on [**4-8**] which was consistent with recurrent viral hepatitis C with grade 0-1 inflammation and stage 0 cirrhosis.
He had 2 admissions in the month prior to this admission for elevated LFTs and pruritis.
He presented for initiation of infergen/ribavirin therapy for recurrent hepatitis C. .
On admission he complained of continued pruritus and 3 episodes of loose, [**Male First Name (un) 1658**] colored stools.
He also reported continued epigastric pain that is occasionally sharp.
He has had no bloody bowel movements, dark stools.
- HCV: Genotype unknown.
Liver biopsy in [**9-/2144**] showed stage 4  cirrhosis and small well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Found to have grade 1 esophageal varices on EGD in 4/[**2143**].
Developed hepatic encephalopathy in [**2142**] requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**], started on lactulose with good effect.
These meds were discontinued due to suicidal ideation.
- HCC: Recently noted 1.4 cm enhancing lesion on liver imaging,  proved to be small, well-differentialed HCC on bx in [**9-26**] s/p cadaveric liver transplantation on [**11-28**] (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]) - Hypothyroidism.

While the biliary features are focal and may be secondary to HCV, evaluation to exclude a component of biliary ischemia is recommended.

RECURRENT HEPATITIS C S/P OLT- transaminitis was likely secondary to recurrent infection with HCV.
Pt started treatement with infergen and ribavirin on [**5-12**] but viral loads did not seem to respond to this therapy.
Hep C viral load was trended during hospital course and increased from >20 million to >42 million to >69,000,000.
However, bilirubin  and transaminases continued to rise.
In order to rule out rejection or potential fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, pt underwent bedside liver biopsy on [**5-19**].
However, on the evening of [**5-19**], pt c/o severe mid-epigastric pain and had a few episodes of vomiting, so stat CT abd was ordered to rule out hemorrhage.
As pt reached CT scanner, he complained of anxiety and ringing in his ears, then had a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure lasting <1 minute.
Final pathology demonstrated findings consistent with early recurrent hepatitis C.  Upon the patient's return to the floor, his bilirubins began to slowly trend downward, but the patient's alkphos continued to rise, raising concern for an ongoing acute process, such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH).
Also considered at the time was the hypothesis that intrahepatic cholestasis was being caused by an immune-mediated inflammatory response to hepatitis C antigen.
Final pathology results were consistent with the previous biopsy with mildly decreased inflammation, in favor of recurrent hepatitis C and decreasing the likelihood of FCH.
[**Name (NI) 23172**] Pt does not have a h/o seizures, and in the context of leukopenia and post-seizure febrile state to 101.8, multiple etiologies had to be considered including mass, infection, medication-related.
Immediate tx for pt's seizure included Keppra (loading dose) and Ativan; however, Ativan may be responsible (paradoxically) for agitation seen well after post-ictal period had passed.
CT on [**5-19**] showed no acute intracranial process, and MRI on [**5-20**] revealed increased putamenal signal bilaterally, consistent with tacrolimus toxicity or acute hepatic encephalopathy.
LP on [**5-20**] demonstrated no evidence of organisms or PMNs.
EEG consistent w/ toxic encephalopathy.
These were discontinued and pt had no further episodes.
ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY : Pt's creatinine had been increasing since [**5-16**] (prior to ICU) with Cr 1.2 (at admission) to 2.1.
Etiology unclear, but may be related to prerenal process (FEurea<35%), intrarenal process, or even potentially HRS.
Renal consulted on patient and suggested that there may be a component of MGN from active hep c infection contributing to renal failure, but this would not explain the acute nature of the renal failure.
Bactrim was discontinued because of elevated Cr.
Renal was consulted who believed Cr would trend down without intervention and that CVVH/HD was not indicated.
The likely etiology of renal failure was acute tubular necrosis caused by decreased renal perfusion during a hypotensive episode (although pt was not recorded to be hypotensive during his episodes or in the ICU).
Diarrhea: Pt noted to be C.diff positive on [**5-15**], and was started on PO vancomycin which was switched to PO Flagyl.
Patient reported an improvement in his symptoms but still reported diarrhea with each meal.
ABDOMINAL PAIN-epigastric pain resolved after episode of coffee-ground emesis on morning of [**5-20**].
Coffee-ground emesis likely from swallowing blood from tongue lacerations during seizure; H/H remianed stable.
However, given EKG axis change with incr QRS duration also ruled out MI with troponins.
Lower quadrant abd pain has been stable since admission, and likely related to hepatitis, although etiology unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] acute tx for lower quadrant abdominal pain that had no guarding/rebound, with CT abd/pelvis on [**5-20**] negative for abdominal hemorrhage.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule [**Doctor Last Name **]: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: recurrent hepatitis C infection, seizure, acute renal insufficiency, C. difficile colitis SECONDARY: s/p OLT hepatitis C, depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital on [**5-12**] for initiation of Infergen and Ribavirin to treat your recurrent Hepatitis C. While in the hospital you developed an infection in your colon with C. difficile, which was treated with a 14 day course of antibiotics.
While in the ICU, your kidneys sustained some injury, likely from having low blood pressures during the seizure.
We ADDED Keppra, a medication to take to prevent seizures at 500mg TWICE per day 2.
You will also get TTG testing and testing for bacterial overgrowth with the hydrogen breath test.
