Per the patient, she began to notice some redness and tenderness of the tip of her nose five days prior to admission.
She presented to the office of her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] started minocycline therapy for her cellulitis as she had tolerated this antibiotic in the past.
Her cellulitis initially seemed to improve but then stopped improving and may have worsened a bit in the days immediately preceding admission.
About three days prior to admission she developed diarrhea and RUQ/R flank pain, which she has had before in reaction to medications.
During this previous use, however, she had been an inpatient and her reaction was attributed to confounding factors due to the hospitalization.
The patient had been dealing with these pains and symptoms over the last few days, but continued to be concerned that she was not absorbing enough food and that her nose appeared to be worsening again.
When asked to better describe her pain, she described the RUQ pain as constant in nature without radiation.
She had decreased PO intake over the last three days prior to admission due to GI distress and abdominal pain.
She also denied dysuria or hematuria.
After reporting this GI distress to her PCP she was told to come to the hospital.
Regarding the state of her cellulitis on admission she reported it was improved from when it had started but had worsened a bit from the first few days of treatment.

Brief Hospital Course: 59 yr old female with hx of IgA deficiency and multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerances admitted with worsening nasal cellulitis and GI intolerance of her antibiotic regimen.
1) Cellulitis: The patient has an extensive history of MSSA skin infections.
She presented with cellulitis on the tip of her nose for which she had been given minocycline as an oupatient.
Unfortunately, the patient had been having worsening of the appearance of her nose as well as increasing GI intolerance while on minocycline therapy.
Given her history of multiple infections and multiple antibiotic intolerances the infectious disease service was consulted and recommended nafcillin desensitization in the ICU with transition to dicloxacillin for discharge.
Her respiratory desensitization was accomplished without any respiratory symptoms or major complications and after switch to nafcillin the patient almost immediately began to have decreased erythema and discomfort at the tip of her nose.
The patient never had fever or elevated white count during this hospitalization.
2) Right Upper Quadrant Pain: The patient had a normal right upper quadrant ultrasound and presentation and normal transaminases and bilirubin so this was presumed to simply be part of her GI intolerance syndrome to minocycline.
3) Diarrhea/GI sensitivity: The patient presented complaining of loose stools and abdominal pain, which was presumed secondary to her gastrointestinal intolerance of minocycline.
The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms improved during her first and second day in the hospital off minocycline but then began to worsen again, presumably secondary to nafcillin therapy.
The patient reported soft stools and abdominal discomfort and bloating.
This was alleviated somewhat simethicone but other symptomatic therapies were not possible as the patient has a history of intolerances to almost all anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals including ondansetron, lomotil, and immodium.
Given there was no further indication for hospitalization as she was tolerating a PO diet and there was no suspicion of a dangerous etiology of her GI symptoms she was discharged with encouragement to keep up good PO intake and  use probiotics for GI symptoms.
4) Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia, which was stable throughout this hospitalization.
5) Hypotension: The patient had one episode of hypotension with SBP's down to the 70's on the morning after admission.
This resolved with IV fluids and required no further management.
The patient was maintained on a full diet with restrictions made for her numerous food allergies.
She was not put on SC heparin as she has a history of easy bleeding but did ambulate TID as she was asked by the primary team.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for sleep.
Secondary Diagnoses: -------------------- IgG subclass deficiency Increased fibrinolysis syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Depression History of ductal carcinoma in situ History of anal carcinoma in situ   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile, resolving cellulitis, no respiratory compromise   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had cellulitis that was not responding to the  antibiotic you were initially prescribed.
You never had respiratory issues with this transition.
Your cellulitis was improving and you had no fevers or signs of spreading infection so you were discharged home to complete your recovery.
Please call your doctor or come to the hospital if you have fever>101 F, chest pain, shortness of breath, inability to stay hydrated, or any other concerning changes in your health.
