Describes 3 days of chest pain that radiates across the chest, occuring only while supine at night, describes as a constant "punching" sensation, lasting multiple hours, and resolving either spontaneously or with tylenol.
Pain is similar in character, but more severe, compared to prior episodes (most recently many months ago).
Had one episode of nonbloody emesis.
No associated dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dyspepsia, edema, or positional/exertional component.
When pain recurred for the 3rd straight night, she presented to the ED.
Had CP in the ED, at which time EKG showed ~1mm ST elev in aVR with new ST dep in I,II,L,V2-V6.
Upon transfer to the floor on [**7-14**], patient was a symptomatic without chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or active bleed.
Past Medical History: -L MCA infarct [**2181**], residual R sided deficits -AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.1 cm2 by TTE [**3-2**]) -HTN -Carotid stenosis -Moderate pulm HTN -Cecal and splenic flexure mass ([**4-1**] Bx showed superficial fragments of colonic mucosa with rare dilated crypts, granulation tissue formation and focal ulceration = may be seen overlying/adjacent to a mass lesion or may represent superficial sampling of an inflammatory-type polyp) -Diverticulosis -Internal hemorrhoids  Social History: H/o tobacco use.

Mild vascular congestion has resolved.
Moderate cardiomegaly persists, with a slightly tortuous aorta.
Mild degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F h/o CVA, AS, known colonic masses admitted with chest pain at rest and global ischemic EKG changes in the setting of acute on chronic blood loss anemia.
#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia - Patient was admitted to the MICU with chest pain x 3 days after son had noticed a significant amount of blood in her bed.
The source of her bleeding has not been confirmed, but differential includes hemmhoroidal, diverticular, or from masses in her cecum an splenic flexure which were found on colonoscopy in [**3-/2199**] (likely malignant).
She was followed by both surgery and GI in-house and both agreed that she would likely need surgical intervention for the masses but acknowledged that she had a high surgical risk (aortic stenosis, history of CVA).
She remained hemodynamically stable on the floor, but did have an episode of BRBPR on HOD#3 with a hct drop from 31.6-->29.9.
She remained asymptomatic with this episode and did not require PRBC.
She was discharged on HOD#4 with follow-up in the geriatrics clinic for further discussion of options for her colonic masses.
She was informed to return to the ED if her symptoms of chest pain return, or if she has significant bleeding.
#Chest pain/EKG changes - Along with BRBPR, patient presented with chest pain , and an EKG with diffuse ST depressions, suggestive of global ischemia in the setting of profound anemia, likely a demand ischemia.
Her pain resolved with blood transfusions.
She continued to remain asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint throughout transfer to floor and remainder of admission.
Both agreed that surgical intervention was likely warranted given high likelyhood of malignancy from her cecal/splenic flexure masses.
However her comorbidities make her an increased surgical risk, especially in the setting of her recent acute bleed.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed Anemia Demand ischemia Colonic masses Diverticulosis Hemmorhoids  Secondary Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 4313**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest pain and blood in your stool causing you to become anemic (low blood counts).
We feel that the anemia was likely the cause of your chest pain because you improved when you were transfused with blood.
You did have a few episodes of bleeding again yesterday but your blood count remained stable and you were not experiencing any symptoms from it.
Please note that you may continue to have more blood in your stool, but that this is likely old blood and should not cause symptoms.
If you do have any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or increasing blood loss please come back to the emergency room.
We also request that you have lab work done tomorrow or Thursday.
