Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 167/78 HR 67 RR 16 SaO2 100%RA General: somnolent male, NAD HEENT: NG tube in place, mild scleral icterus, no oral lesions, dry MM Neck: JVP not elevated Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally on anterior exam, no wheezes or crackles CV: Regular rhythm, normal rate, S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur LLSB Abdomen: soft, mild destension, nontender, +BS, scar from prior surgery inplace.
GU/Rectal: foley and flexiseal in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no splinter hemorrhages or lesions   Pertinent Results: Micro: OSH [**Year (4 digits) **] culture: S. mitis [**2160-12-31**] Peritoneal fluid: negative [**2161-1-1**] [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures: negative [**2161-1-2**] Urine culture: pending .
Images: [**2160-12-31**] ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: There is moderate amount of ascites in the perihepatic and perisplenic region.
The macronodular [**Month/Day/Year **] liver is echogenic in echotexture but without focal lesions, compatible with cirrhosis.
A 3-cm focal dilation of the main portal vein is similar in appearance compared to prior CT study.
There is no hydronephrosis, hydroureter or stone.
Cirrhotic liver with moderate ascites.
There is no significant change in the bibasilar atelectasis.
Bibasal atelectasis and bibasal effusions along with cardiomegaly, overall appearances are suggestive of CHF.
The nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach, recommended advancing up to 5 cm  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 54381**] is a 55-year old male with HCC s/p RFA, HCV cirrhosis, s/p OLT [**2156**], with HCV recurrence and cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices who was admitted with altered mental status and Streptococcal bacteremia.
BACTEREMIA- Original cultures from [**Hospital6 33**] showed Strep mitis, but subsequent speciation showed Strep sanguinus and salivarius species, all of which are consistent with oral flora, as patient has poor dentition.
A TTE was obtained to rule out endocarditis, and there were no obvious vegetations.
A TEE was not pursued due to low clinical probability of endocarditis given lack of adequate Duke's criteria.
HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY- Mr. [**Known lastname 54381**] was quite encephalopathic on admission, and his mental status improved slowly each day on lactulose and rifaxamin.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS- chronic metabolic acidosis with partially compensated respiratory alkalosis as per [**Known lastname **] gas and daily labs.
Could be partially due to volume depletion from greatly increased stool output from lactulose, as patient was hypokalemica and bicarb depleted.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
