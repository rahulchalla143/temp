Blood culture: negative Sputum culture: cancelled due to contamination .
TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-12-21**], no obvious change but the technicalloy suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
Admission CXR: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes and pulmonary edema.
No definite pleural effusion seen on the lateral view.
Bibasilar opacities, which may relate to atelectasis from low lung volumes and overlying edema.
In the appropriate clinical setting, consolidation from aspiration or infection would be difficult to exclude.
R LE Doppler: negative for DVT .
Brief Hospital Course: 86M with history of HTN, DM, CAD, SVT, pAib, PVD, CKD, IPF and recent hospitalization in the ICU from [**Date range (2) 19889**] requiring pressors/intubation presents from home with worsening symptoms of CHF and concern for cellulitis of L LE .
# Acute decompensated heart failure (diastolic): On admission to the floor, the patient appeared volume overloaded with elevated JVP, rales throughout posterior lung fields, and 2+ pitting edema in LE.
He was diuresed with 80 mg IV Lasix in the ED and again on the floor the night of admission due to mild dyspnea at rest.
While in house TTE showed EF > 55% with mild AS.
# Symptomatic bradycardia: On [**2-13**] AM, the patient had 2 episodes of symptomatic bradycardia - code blue was called for the second episode.
Patient had transient hypotension with each episode.
After transfer to ICU on [**2-13**] was monitored on telemetry with no further bradycardia.
# Hypercarbia/hypoxia: Repeat ABGs showed persistent hypercarbia and hypoxia.
He was initially kept on oxygen 2L on the floor and was diuresed as above; however, following bradycardic event on [**2-13**], patient's oxygen requirement climbed to 5L NC despite diuresis.
Aspiration causing vagal episodes as well as hypoxemia is a possible unifying diagnosis for reason for transfer to the MICU on [**2-13**].
On the morning of [**2-15**], after the patient had been anxious most of the night for persistent SVT, the patient was became more confused and somnolent.
# Elevated troponin/CAD: Troponins were flat.
CK-MB remained elevated at 11,10, and 10.
There was concern for persistent ischemia [**1-27**] diastolic dysfunction.
He appeared to be in increased respiratory distress.
Toprol 100 mg qday was continued on the floor until the patient's episode of symptomatic bradycardia on the floor.
# Venous stasis dermatitis: No ulcer was present.
Changes thought to be [**1-27**] venous stasis and PVD (on left).
No obvious signs of cellulitis or infection.
