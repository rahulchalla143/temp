650 cc of Cysto-Conray contrast was administered via Foley catheter into the bladder under fluoroscopic guidance which demonstrates extravasation of contrast along the right superior aspect of the bladder.

INDICATION: 82-year-old female with a recent surgery presenting with hypotension and decreased urine output.
There are no pleural effusions.
The soft tissues and osseous structures are grossly unremarkable aside from degenerative change of the thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: PO contrast ONLY (not IV) Field of view: 35  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old woman with abd pain, elevated WBC.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PO contrast ONLY (not IV) CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: creat  INDICATION: 82-year-old woman with abdominal pain and elevated white count, and renal failure.
No intravenous contrast administered secondary to poor renal function.
CT ABDOMEN: There is small bilateral pleural effusion at the lung bases, with adjacent atelectasis.
Additionally, in the right upper quadrant, there is large air fluid level, and air within the ascites.
Oral contrast passes through loops of small and large bowel, and can be seen extending to the descending colon.
There is a tiny focus of dense material abutting the liver (series 2, image 35), which cannot definitely be identified within a loop of bowel, and likely represents a tiny focus of extravasated contrast.
The bowel is not dilated, there is no evidence of obstruction.
There is limited evaluation of solid organs without intravenous contrast; however, the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
No pathologic or retroperitoneum lymphadenopathy is seen.
Subcutaneous air and post-surgical change can be seen within the anterior abdominal wall from recent surgery.
There is also soft tissue anasarca.
There is free fluid within the deep pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: There is diffuse osteopenia, which is stable.
There is sclerosis along the anterior and superior aspects of the sacroiliac joints, consistent with changes from osteitis condensans ilii, which are stable.
Additionally, there is a small amount of oral contrast outside of bowel.
These findings are concerning for focal anastomotic leak.
There is also a large amount of ascites remote from this area, and by report, the patient has had bladder surgery.
A second source of ascitic fluid from a urine leak from the bladder surgery cannot be excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Surgical changes in the anterior abdominal wall from recent surgery.
HISTORY/INDICATIONS:  The patient is an 82-year-old female who underwent a resection of a large right perforated right cecal tumor which infiltrated the bladder, 12 days ago.
She represented with signs of sepsis and presumed leak on CT scan.
FINDINGS:  There was a lot of purulence and some gas in the abdomen.
There was a lot of free fluid, as well.
The areas of contamination were widely irrigated and the decision was to make a diverting ileostomy.
This was freed up such that there would be no excessive tension.
The wound was packed with Kerlix and covered.
COMPLICATIONS:  Injury to the bladder from the sepsis and right down to the ileocolic anastomosis.
Following an initial CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated ascites and a likely leak at the site of her ileo-colonic anastomosis, she was volume resuscitated and antibiotic therapy was initiated.
She was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, and underwent repair of an anastomosis leak at the site of her ileo-colonic anastomosis, repair of a bladder perforation, and creation of a diverting loop ileostomy (see Operative report for details).
She initially required pressors for blood pressure support, but these were weaned successfully as well.
She was started on Meropenem and Caspofungin per ID recommendations for gram negative & positive organisms identified from abdominal wound culture.
Because of her high output she has been given IV fluids for replacement; her labs have been followed closely and her electrolytes have been stable (see pertinent results).
A wound VAC remains in place, as well as a JP drain.
