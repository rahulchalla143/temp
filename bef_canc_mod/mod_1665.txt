She now returns to [**Hospital6 256**] with chest pain [**8-18**] x 2 hours associated with nausea and vomiting, unrelieved by nitroglycerin.
In the emergency room the patient was noted to be pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin as well as intravenous nitroglycerin and intravenous heparin.
Her electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V3 through V6 resolved after the patient became pain free.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease.
She underwent a catheterization in [**2125**], which showed three-vessel disease including 80% right coronary artery, 90% left anterior descending coronary artery, 80% circumflex, and an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year, which showed normal left ventricle and right ventricle with an ejection fraction of 55% and no abnormal wall motion activity.
Also, the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension, as well as hypercholesterolemia.
In general the patient appeared pale, weak, but in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed mucous membranes moist; pupils equal, round and reactive to light; extraocular movements intact.
Heart sounds showed a regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmur, no jugular venous distension.
Extremities were warm with no edema.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure or infiltrates.
When the patient was pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous nitroglycerin as well as heparin, the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 92 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V4 and 5 and T wave inversions in V3 through 5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Service with a diagnosis of unstable angina for cardiac catheterization.
No ejection fraction was obtained at that time.
The patient continued to experience pain during the catheterization procedure and for that reason, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed without complication.
She did however, on that day, experience an episode of atrial fibrillation, which was treated with intravenous Lopressor and amiodarone, after which an initial loading dose the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm.
Heart sounds were regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended; positive bowel sounds with well-healed scars from a prior cholecystectomy and hysterectomy.
Left leg incision had Steri-Strips, open to air, small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the upper thigh.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 5.
