On [**2121-11-16**] he had a chest xray which showed As compared to the previous radiograph, there was increase in density of the right hemithorax.
He was placed in two point restraints secondary to non-violent behavior such as tube pulling.
He was reintubated on [**11-18**] after increased respiratory distress to RR 28-29.
Worsening right upper lobe opacity either represents consolidation or fissural fluid.
Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions, increased since [**2121-11-19**].
He was started on TPN on [**11-21**] for nutritional support.
His pain was controlled with IV dilaudid.
He continued HSQ for DVT prophylaxis and pantoprazole for GI prophylaxis.
he received Albuterol nebulizers for wheezing and increased work of breathing.
His CXR on [**2121-11-25**] showed:  Severe cardiomegaly has worsened since [**11-22**], moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged and previous mild pulmonary edema has decreased.
Large dependent bilateral pleural effusions and resulting atelectasis, with a right fissural component which may or may not be loculated.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcification, and pulmonary arterial enlargement.
On [**2121-11-27**] he continued his TPN, received a dose of lasix for increased work of breathing, and also received a transfusion of 1 uPRBC to continue to optimize his respiratory status.
His chest x ray showed:  Severe cardiomegaly and large right pleural effusion are unchanged.
What appears to be increasing consolidation in the right upper lobe and persistent severe consolidation in the right lower lobe is instead fissural pleural effusion and mild basal atelectasis posterior to a moderate layering pleural effusion, respectively.
He chronic left upper extremity swelling improved after elevation above the level of the heart with a stockinette.
