Patient has had L sided flank pain since the night prior to admission.
This was associated with blurry vision for the past 1-2 days, and headache over the last few hours.

She does have a history of HTN and is compliant with her antihypertensives.
Of note, she had much more severe flank pain 6 weeks ago.
She was told to drink fluids for potential kidney stone.
She had imaging done in [**State 760**], at her home, that showed no obvious stones.
Apparently she was referred to a nephrologist at that time and was told she had some evidence of kidney failure.
She was first told she may have kidney failure in [**2198-4-22**].
She did not have this flank pain at that time.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's flank pain is much improved.

No evidence of diverticulosis or urinary tract calculi.
Unchanged large calcified fibroid uterus.
2.9-cm low-attenuation left renal lesion larger than prior study.
Head CT ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Sclerotic focus in the left humeral head, could reflect a bone island given lack of underlying risk factors for metastasis.
Renal US and doppler ([**3-19**]): FINDINGS: There is a partly cystic/partly solid isoechoic mass again seen in the mid portion of the left kidney which corresponds with the recent CT findings.
This mass measures 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm and demonstrates some vascular flow within it on color Doppler imaging.
The appearance of this mass may be suggestive of cystic renal cell carcinoma.
No additional focal abnormality is seen in the left kidney and there is no hydronephrosis.
There is no hydronephrosis and no stone or mass is seen in the right kidney.
Resistive indices of the intraparenchymal arteries on the right kidney are slightly elevated ranging from .78-.80.
The resistive indices of the intraparenchymal arteries in the left kidney are also slightly elevated ranging from .73-.83.
IMPRESSION: 1) Slight upstroke delay of the arterial waveforms in the main renal artery of the right kidney may indicate some renal artery stenosis on the right side.
Bilateral moderately elevated RI's.
Cystic and solid mass in the mid-left kidney, concerning for neoplasm.
Bone Scan ([**3-21**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Reduced renal function bilaterally consistent with chronic renal impairment.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo F with hypertensive urgency found to have a new renal mass.
# Renal mass:  The patient was found to have a new renal mass on the CT of her abdomen/pelvis done in the ED to evaluate her flank pain.
The size and characteristics of the mass are concerning for renal cell carcinoma.
Her renal mass was thought to account for her flank pain.
On her admission CXR she was found to have a sclerotc focus in her left humeral head which was concerning for metastesis.
This was evaluated with a bone scan which showed no evidence of metastesis.
Urology was consulted and felt that more information was needed before a definitive plan for diagnosis could be developed so a renal scan was preformed to assess the functionality of her kidneys and showed differential renal function of 39% from the left kidney and 61% from the right kidney.
# Hypertensive urgency: Her initial BP was 221/71 with worsening of visual blurring and flank pain.
No papilledema on exam.
She states she had been taking her blood pressure medications regularly, however her PCP notes document that she often runs out of her medicaitons and has difficulty regularly taking her medications.
# Chronic renal failure: The patient had an admission creatinine of 3.4.
Patient had brought labs with her showing Cr 3.0-3.29 in [**2198-12-23**].
FENA of 4.24 consistent with intrinsic or postrenal etiology.
This may be consistent with chronic diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy.
CT abdomen showed no stones, or obvious obstruction.
Renal was consulted and recommended starting sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tid, vitamin D.  She was given epo while hospitalized for anemia, however this was stopped at discharge due to concern for insurance reimbursement.
She was asked to follow up with a nephrologist for further managment of her renal disease.
# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8.
Likely anemia of chronic renal disease.
She had no evidence of bleeding.
# MGUS: As part of the workup for her chronic renal insufficiency UPEP and SPEP were sent which returned showing a monoclonal IgG lambda protein spike.
There is concern that her kidney disease could be due to amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease, however a kidney biopsy would be necessary to diagnosis this and at this time cannot be preformed given her renal failure.
She will need yearly UPEP and SPEP to monitor for developement of multiple myeloma.
# Type 2 Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.
# Code: Full code  # Primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 768**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 769**]  Medications on Admission: Lisinopril 40mg po daily Atenolol 100mg po bid Nephrocaps 1 cap daily Tylenol #3 tid PRN pain Omeprazole 20mg po daily Lipitor 40mg po daily Glipizide 5mg po daily Actonel 35mg po q week Pristiq 50mg po daily Diovan 320mg po daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma Hypertensive urgency Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance Chronic renal insufficency, Stage IV  Secondary - Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to elevated blood pressure and back pain.
Your scans showed a mass in your left kidney which was concerning for cancer.
We were also concerned about a mass seen on your left arm X-ray.
While you were hospitalized you were also found to have abnormal protein in your blood and urine.
The cancer specialists were called and felt you have a disease called Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown Significance (MGUS).
People with this condition have a small chance of developing a cancer of the blood called multiple myeloma and need to be screened yearly to check for this.
Due to your chronic kidney failure you should avoid taking antiinflammatory medications such as Motrin, Alleve, ibuprofen, or naproxen.
For pain you can take Tylenol or ask your primary care physician what to take.
It is important that you follow up with urology to discuss a plan for diagnosis and management of your renal mass.
