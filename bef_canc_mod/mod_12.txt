Admission Date:  [**2179-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Doxepin / Levofloxacin / Oxycontin / Benzodiazepines / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: picc line and central access   History of Present Illness: 65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**], severe COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.
On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic and then gradually unresponsive.
He remained unresponsive during this time.
However, on Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report.
Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked "very scared" and would often stare at the ceiling.
She also notes that he was very diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
Pt was initially started on levophed for hypotension.
However, after learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been stable in the 120s off of pressors.
No new consolidation on CXR.
Squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**].
Perioperative pulmonary embolus [**2174**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Transient ischemic attack in [**2165**].
Atypical chest pain since [**2164**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Basal cell carcinoma on his back.
19. multiple admissions for pneumonia (including pseudomonas) and bronchitis, last in [**10-31**] resulting in ventilator dependence, trach and [**Date Range 282**] placement 20. vitamin B12 deficiency.
Diastolic heart failure.
Cataracts 22. bradycardia on amiodarone  Social History: Recently discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab s/p trach and [**Hospital 282**].
Does not follow simple commands.
Anicteric sclera.
Right subcalvian triple lumen without erythema or other signs of infection.
Pulm- Coarse breath sounds throughout.
Difficult to detect decreased breath sounds on the left.
[**Year (4 digits) 282**] in place with no erythema or discharge.
Moderate rigidity with movement of his limbs.
Nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no major changes since previous studies.
Right lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal contours toward the right consistent with previous pneumonectomy.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural effusion.
Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left lung which appear stable.
No new left pneumo or focal consolidation.
Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or evidence of hydrocephalus.
No evidence of a major CVA.
2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins  Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed.
There is an 8-9 mm stone located at the neck of the gallbladder.
There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps located at the fundus of the gallbladder.
No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified.
Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no focal abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder.
In the proper clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with cholecystitis.
They are not completely typical for acute cholecystitis.
FINDINGS: Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right.
There is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is a left pleural effusion.
The main pulmonary artery appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.
Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the left lung.
No specific areas of cavitation are identified within these nodules.
Atelectasis is also seen at the left lung base.
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
Septal thickening is seen throughout the left lung field.
A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: 1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the entire left lung.
These most likely represent aspiration pneumonia.
Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the CT appearance.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**] demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder.
5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type 2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from [**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension.
#ID/sepsis Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating blood pressure, lactate 1.3.
His decubitus ulcer looks clean.
Chest CT was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the rest of his hospital stay.
Narcotics was taken into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes.
#anemia/coagulation Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on coumadin.
The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no hematoma.
He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin drip.
He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from arterial line site.
#transaminitis He presented intially with transaminitis likely from hypotension.
RUQ ultrasound was done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension, thickened gallbladder.
He remained afebrile and has no abdominal tenderness  #respiratory: Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and post tracheostomy.
During his past admission there was concern about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.
# [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148.
# Cardiac Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such complain during this hospitalization.
He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia.
#Anxiety/pain Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at baseline.
He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil.
His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: hypotension and altered mental status likely from narcotic overdose +/- aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have more shortness of breath, confusion, hypotension, chest pain, fever or if there are any concerns at all.
Coumadin has been discontinued because you had significnant bleeding from arterial punctures from attempted central line insertion.
This should be restarted at a lower dose in [**11-29**] days time given the history of DVT and also atrial fibrillation  Fentanyl patch has been discontinued due to concern about narcotic overdose.
