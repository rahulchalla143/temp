Coli and Pseudomonas, chronic arachnoiditis, on chronic morphine PCA, with multiple recent admissions for altered mental status related to either infection or opiate intoxication from her morphine PCA.
She was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-26**] for altered mental status and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans growing in her blood culture bottles from [**Hospital1 **].
Her fungemia was treated with a 14 day course of caspofungin and her Hickman line was discontinued.
Chest CT showed multiple nodular paranchymal lesions with tiny cavitations concerning for fungal infection, inflammatory process, or metastatic thyroid CA.
On night of this admssion the pt was found with altered sensorium with jerking movements.
Her eyes were noted to be roving and there was question of seizure activity.
She was noted to have lactate of 5.5, tachycardia, and fever so code sepsis was called in the ED.
Head CT on admission was negative for any acute change.
When patient intitially presented to the MICU she was noticed to have tonic-clonic seizures which resolved after increased of propofol.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2193-3-7**]: No aspiration demonstrated during the study.
There is a mild amount of penetration before and during swallow.
Nonspecific esophageal motility disorder characterized by weakened primary peristaltic waves and prominent tertiary activity also noted on study from [**2190**].
No strictures or masses are identified.

She was likely post-ictal in the ER, and then presents with another witnessed tonic clonic seizure when in the ICU.
She was also found to have a UTI which was felt that could have also contributed to her altered mental status.
The LP came back negative for infection and her EEG did not show any evidence of seizure activity.
However since patient had witness seizures in the hospital it was decided to load patient with Dilantin which was then transitioned to Keppra.
# Urosepsis:  When patient presented she had elevated WBC, fever, and was hypotensive.
She was initially treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for empiric coverage.
Her blood cultures came back negative but her urine culture came back positive for UTI with Pseudomonas that was sensitive to ceftaz.
A new PICC line was placed on [**2193-3-7**] once patient was being treated for infection and no longer had fevers.
The patient then continued to have low grade tachycardia.
#Esophageal dysmotility: Patient with history of esophageal dysmotility and appeared to be aspiration risk when she arrived.
However when patient's mental status improved it appeared her swallowing also improved.
There was concern for upper esophageal stricture so she underwent EGD which showed normal esophagus with no stricture.
She also had video swallow as well as braium swallow which was consistent with esophageal dismotility.
Her EGD did show gastritis and patient was given PPI [**Hospital1 **].
# Metastatic thyroid CA with recurrence s/p iodine and XRT: Patient was followed by endocrine while in the hospital.
- She should have her TFTs monitored once weekly and if trending toward hypothyroidism her levoxyl dose should be adjusted.
# Hisotry of DVT and PE: Patient with IVC filter on lifelong coumadin.
Her INR continued to trend up most likely secondary to malnutrition and being on Dilantin.
