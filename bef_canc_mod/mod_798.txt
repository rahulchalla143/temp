mild inflammatory stranding around duodenum which may be consistent with duodenitis or ulcer.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Ketoacidosis: Initially presented from OSH with anion gap metabolic acidosis and abdominal pain.
His anion gap was felt secondary to ETOH ketoacidosis.
CXR and urinalysis were negative for infectious source and EKG showed no ischemic changes.
He was fluid hydrated with a total of 7 liters NS and was then transitioned to 1/2 NS for maintenance.
He had no mental status changes throughout his course and his electrolytes were repleted as needed.
2) Chronic Pancreatitis: His initial abdominal pain was of unclear etiology.
It was suspected that there may have been a component of abdominal pain secondary to his DKA, but that his primary pain was from his chronic pancreatitis.
An abdominal CT was performed to rule out complicated pancreatitis.
This showed atrophic pancreatitis without pseudocyst, stranding or necrosis.
He was given dilaudid prn for pain and was kept NPO until he was able to tolerate PO's, then given percocet, and discharged on tylenol not to exceed 2 grams daily.
3) ETOH abuse: He presented with evidence of mild withdrawl symptoms including diaphoresis, tremor and tachycardia.
He had no HD instability and no seizure activity or visual hallucinations.
He had no mental status change to suggest DT's.
CT abdomen showed no evidence of liver or gall-bladder disease, therefore U/S was not felt indicated at this time.
Hepatitis serologies were checked and showed hepatitis C so he should be limited to 2 grams daily of tylenol.
5) Gastritis: There was noted duodenal stranding by abdominal CT of unclear significance.
However, he got a EGD which showed gastritis but no duodenitis which could be from alcohol use.
6) Psych: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder.
7) Renal cyst - He was incidentally found to have a renal cyst, and follow up ultrasound is recommended preiodically to make sure it is not changing in appearance.
