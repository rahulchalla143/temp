FINDINGS: A narrow tracheal coronal diameter is consistent with a saber sheath configuration.
Indistinctness of the perihilar vasculature bilaterally with generalized ground-glass opacity has slightly improved since [**2145-5-26**] suggesting improving pulmonary venous congestion.
The left hilum is prominent, but this most likely relates to mild pulmonary arterial enlargement, better characterized on CT of [**2145-2-4**].
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Echo [**2145-5-24**] Conclusions The left atrium is mildly elongated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen (images suboptimal).
No definite mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-5-10**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
Overnight in the ICU the patient developed an acutely cold left foot without pedal signals.
An [**2145-5-20**] ECG obtained also showed changes in lateral lead with elevated troponins which was concerning for coronary ischemia.
He required re-intubation and the decision was made to return the patient to the cath lab for a coronary intervention for STEMI as well as an attempt to revascularize his left leg.
No acute issues.
