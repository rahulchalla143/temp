AV fistula in left arm w/o bleeding or bruising, in tact.
Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the mid inferior and mid inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-2-12**], there has been global deterioration of left ventricular systolic function.
[**Street Address(2) 107513**] depression and T wave inversions inferiorly and in leads V3-6, there were no significant ST segment changes throughout the study.
The patient was hypertensive at baseline with an appropriate response to the infusion; heart rate response was flat.
No signficant EKG changes in the presence of baseline abnormalities.
No anginal type symptoms.
Nuclear report: Inferior wall perfusion cannot be evaluated due to subdiaphragmatic activity.
Decreased LVEF of 39% and moderately increased left ventricular cavity size.
CXR [**1-23**]: Worsening, mild-to-moderate fluid overload and persistent cardiomegaly.
AV fistulagram: Stenosis at arterial anastomosis site of left upper extremity AV fistula.
Successful balloon dilatation with 6-mm balloons and with improvement of flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 75F dm, esrd, chf presents with nausea, vomiting, and GI upset for x2 days, found to have mild diverticulitis and NSTEMI in setting of tachycardia.
She was briefly admitted to MICU for tachycardia and diverticulitis w/ a concern for impending sepsis with low BP with an elevated lactate.
She was observed in the MICU for 2 days with resoving lactate and leukocytosis and then transfered to the floor.
# Diverticulitis - Pt's primary symptoms over the three days prior to admission were gastrointestinal in origin with nausea, vomiting, and overall "GI upset."
She has a history of ischemic vs. infectious colitis in [**2165**] in tranverse and descending colon, which has resolved on CT scan.
Initially, there was a concern for impending sepsis with blood pressures in the 90's and an elevated lactate to 4.0.
She remained afebrile with decreasing leukocytosis (13->6) and resolving symptoms.
She was discarged with no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
# NSTEMI - On admission, she had several EKGs with TWI in lateral leads and I/II, not concordant with any coronary distribution.
Her troponins were found to be mildly elevated, with flat CK: troponin 0.18->0.22, CK 95->53.
A cardiology consult was called for assistance with EKG changes and mild troponin elevation.
They determined that these changes were likely due to demand ischemia and recomended against heparin or cardiac catheterization.
# CHF- The patient has  history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with depressed EF (30%) which then recovered to 55%.
The echo showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the mid inferior and mid inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %).
The regional areas of hypokinesis in the inferior/inferiorlateral walls raised the possibility of new ischemic cardiomyopathy.
A pMIBI was performed which was unable to assess the inferior walls and vessels due to subdiaphragmatic activity.
The remainder of the walls were without perfusion defects.
While in house, she became slightly volume overload from IVF in the MICU.
She had mild symptoms of orthopnea, but no SOB or hypoxia.
She was dialized with resolution of her symptoms.
# Hypertension - The patient was continued on amlodipine and metoprolol after her blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
# ESRD - Stage 5 CKD, likely [**1-10**] diabetes and hypertension followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7473**].
There was previous concern for a proximal narrowing of the fistula with a loud bruit.
She received an AV fistulogram which showed proximal stenosis.
The stenosis was sucessfully dilated via balloon angioplasty by IR.
She did have one episode of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension after her third HD where 1.5 kg was removed.
She had no further episodes of orthostatic hypotension, and her blood pressure remained stable even with her anti-hypertensives.
