The patient did have a work-up for her right leg pain complaints with plain films of the right hip and MRI of the L-spine which did not reveal an explanation for her symptoms and did rule out avascular necrosis.

R HIP XR [**2141-9-6**]: No acute fracture or dislocation.
MRI L-SPINE [**2141-9-6**]: Diffuse low-signal intensity is identified in the bone marrow of the lumbar and lower thoracic spine as described above, possibly related with anemic changes, please correlate clinically.

The patient had no symptoms of end-organ damage.
Hypertensive urgency: During the patient's [**Hospital1 **] stay, her SBPs ranged from 140s-160s during the day, which is her baseline systolic blood pressure.
Throughout her hospitalization, the patient had no symptoms/signs of hypertensive emergency, including no seizures, no acute worsening of renal function, no headache, nausea, visual and mental status disturbances, chest pain, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.
Right leg pain: Upon arrival on the floor, the patient complained of [**2143-4-15**] pain in R buttock and posterior thigh, much exacerbated with standing.
Of note, lumbar spine MRI and R hip XR on most recent admission were both negative.
Her pain was intermittent, likely secondary to sciatica, and had resolved by the time of her discharge.
Her pain when she was symptomatic was controlled well with PO dilaudid.
If the pain recurs, an MRI of the right hip can be considered to evaluate for osteonecrosis.

The patient's creatinine remained stable at 7.9-8.4 throughout her hospitalization, which was similar to her baseline renal function.
She has anemia from chronic kidney disease and chronic disease.
The patient is not on Epopoeitin as an outpatient, likely due to her malignant hypertension.

You were also treated for urinary tract infection with antibiotics.
Your right leg pain improved during admission, and we are unsure of the cause of this pain.
You should discuss the need for an MRI of the hip if the pain returns when you meet with your primary care doctor.
