Admission Date:  [**2131-7-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-7-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-11-11**]     Sex:  F  Service:  C-MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, positive history of smoking, history of abdominal aortic aneurysm who came for CT abdomen to evaluate her abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The procedure with intravenous contrast was done but the patient developed respiratory distress and her arterial blood gases were pH 7.07/88/56 with oxygen saturation 70%.
She was bradycardic and required admission to Medical Intensive Care Unit, responded well to Epinephrine and then Atropine on second occasion.
stay which showed bradycardia and moderately depressed ejection fraction.
She was started on Aspirin and Nitroglycerin which produced transient hypotension requiring Dopamine.
She had workup for pulmonary embolization during Intensive Care Unit stay which included negative LENI, VQ scan and CKs but her troponin was positive with peaking to 5.7.
History of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Hydrochlorothiazide which was discontinued due to hyponatremia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has hypertension and myocardial infarction.
Her sister had history of multiple aneurysms in different organs.
The neck is supple with full range of motion and no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination reveals S1 and S2, no murmur, and no rubs or gallops.
Abdominal examination is benign with positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended abdomen.
Neurological examination revealed normal strength, 1+ reflexes in the upper extremities, 1+ reflexes in her knees and no ankle jerks.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 72 year old woman with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, now transferred from Medical Intensive Care Unit after respiratory arrest after intravenous contrast.
On [**2131-7-10**], she had abdominal CT to evaluate abdominal aortic aneurysm.
After she received intravenous contrast, she had respiratory distress and bradycardia.
Her echocardiogram revealed moderate depression of ejection fraction, and she was started on the above medications.
She had negative workup for pulmonary embolization.
Status post respiratory arrest requiring intubation - As I mentioned in the history of present illness, the patient required intubation and her respiratory arrest was most likely due to contrast allergy, less likely due to ischemic event.
After transfer to the C-Medicine floor, she remained stable, had normal oxygen saturation and remained without any subjective complaints.
She was closely followed by cardiology service and it was felt that echocardiogram can be done on an outpatient basis to evaluate her ejection fraction and systolic function of her ventricles.
She was started on ace inhibitor and beta blockers which will be continued for presumed coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary - The patient had acute respiratory arrest after intravenous dye.
She required intubation for over 24 hours, after extubation remained without any signs of hypoxia and stable.
The etiology of her respiratory arrest was most likely due to the above possibilities.
Hematology - The patient has a history of macrocytic anemia, her B12 and folate levels were checked, but were pending at the time of discharge.
On neurologic examination, she has a signs of small fiber neuropathy.
Urine culture revealed no growth.
Chest x-ray initially question of congestive heart failure.
There were no signs of pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia, borderline left atrial abnormality, right bundle branch block.
Peaked T waves possibly consistent with hyperkalemia.
Repeat electrocardiogram revealed normal Q-T intervals and remained with findings of peaked T waves.
Mild systemic left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity and systolic function.
Aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No significant aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation.
No mitral valve prolapse.
Status post respiratory arrest.
