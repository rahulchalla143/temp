CXR with possible LLL infiltrate and mild to moderate central congestion.
He was subsequently intubated for his worsening hypoxia and also to improve his ability to get a CT head.

MODERATE GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
[**2143-12-30**] Urine culture- No growth.
STUDIES: [**12-20**] CXR: A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates within the right atrium.
The left cardiac border and the hemidiaphragms are obscured by moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Air bronchograms at the left retrocardiac region may represent an underlying consolidation.
Hazy central opacities, with Kerley B lines demonstrated in the periphery, are compatible with central [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with mild-to-moderate interstitial edema, worse on the right.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
A dense left lower lobe opacity is concerning for pneumonia.
Repeat radiography after diuresis may be of benefit to discern a discrete infiltrate.
Pulmlonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with preserved global systolic function.Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal free wall motion.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-6-5**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now seen with mild right ventricular cavity dilation and free wall hypokinesis.
No definite gross intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**12-20**] CXR: Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Area of consolidation within the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia.
Mild-to-moderate central [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with interstitial edema.
No periprosthetic lucency to suggest loosening and no focal osteolysis is detected.
There is considerable surrounding heterotopic ossification.
Some notching at the junction between the acetabulum and inferior pubic ramus is noted similar to the appearance on the [**2142-3-7**] CT and may be postoperative.
Probable diffuse osteopenia.
Scattered [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcification present.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2145-1-1**] 05:48AM BLOOD WBC-10.3 RBC-3.77* Hgb-10.2* Hct-32.2* MCV-85 MCH-27.0 MCHC-31.6 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-394 [**2145-1-1**] 05:48AM BLOOD Glucose-170* UreaN-32* Creat-1.1 Na-135 K-4.3 Cl-94* HCO3-35* AnGap-10 [**2145-1-1**] 05:48AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo M with multiple medical problems including 3VD s/p multiple PCIs, PVD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, AF, pulmonary fibrosis and DMI presenting from home with 2 days of lethargy, hypotension and subjective fevers initially thought to be most consistent with severe pneumonia complicated by septic shock.
He was transferred to the MICU where he was felt to be septic from acute bacterial PNA given cough, sputum, fevers and CXR.
The sputum gram stain revealed GNR diplocci, and GPC in pairs and the pt was given Vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin initially to cover for hospital acquired pathogens including MRSA and pseudomonas and was switched to Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin and then to Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin on [**12-21**] to cover CAP.
His sputum cx grew out Moraxella and his antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin on [**12-23**].
The patients cortisol was normal ruling out adrenal insufficiency and he had an echo that showed LVEF>55%.
The antibiotics were discontinued [**12-24**] as pt was essentially afebrile and had no leukocytosis and was likely colonized with Moraxella.
Presumably the patient has a low baseline BP and an inciting event (MI, PE) occured prior to presentation that resulted in hypotension and AMS.
# Supraventricular Tachycardia: Pt had baseline rates in the high 90's.
Early the morning of [**12-24**] the patient had sudden onset tachycardia with rates from 130-140's and a drop in blood pressure to systolics in the 50's.
EKG and rhythm analysis was consistent with AVNRT.
The patient had repeat multiple episodes of SVT during his ICU stay, converting spontaneously until [**12-26**] when he required adenosine 6mg IV x 2.
He did not have any further episodes while in the ICU.
On transfer to the medical floor he intermittently had short bursts of tachycardia, most consistent with an SVT.
Pts hypoxia was most likely secondary to V/Q mismatch from PNA on top of baseline significant restrictive lung disease from IPF.
He had a CXR on [**12-23**] that looked like he may have some pulmonary edema and a lasix gtt was started with attempt to diurese and improve respiratory status.
#) Elevated troponin and CKMB: The patient intitially had a troponin= 0.33 which was most likely secondary to demand ischemia and not an NSTEMI given lack of chest pain, stable enzymes and overall septic picture.
#) Acute Renal Failure due to Acute Tubular Necrosis: The patient presented with a creatinine= 2.4 which was likely secondary to hypotension/shock leading to ischemic ATN as the creatinine trended down to baseline of 1.0 with IVF hydration.
