Admission Date:  [**2198-8-22**]       Discharge Date: [**2198-8-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-10-7**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction with right coronary artery PCI in [**2192**], hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and tobacco use, who had done well status post his right coronary artery stent until the evening of admission, when he developed jaw pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, weakness.
His pain was similar to his previous cardiac pain.
The patient was seen in the Emergency Department and was found to have electrocardiogram findings of ST elevations in I, L and V6, as well as deep T wave inversions inferiorly.
He became hypotensive after two sublingual nitroglycerin, and transiently bradycardic.
In the catheterization laboratory, he was found to have an left anterior descending with mild disease but a high diagonal with a 90% occlusion.
He also had a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and left circumflex, with collateralization.
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit post-procedure for monitoring.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes, hypothyroidism, hiatal hernia, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2192**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his right coronary artery, history of guaiac positive stools after receiving aspirin, depression, anxiety.
General:  Alert and oriented x 3, resting comfortably, elderly male in no acute distress.
Neck:  He had jugular venous distention to the ear lying at 20 degrees, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly, with occasional crackles at the bases.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, single S1 and physiologically split S1, with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
There was no sign of a hematoma or bleeding.
The patient had a chest x-ray that showed moderate cardiomegaly with interstitial edema, however, an element of underlying interstitial lung disease could not be excluded without prior studies for comparison.
Post-PCI showed normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, and mild ST elevations in V4 and V6 with resolution of the prior ST elevations.
Catheterization results revealed three vessel coronary disease, elevated left-sided filling pressures, lateral wall acute ST elevation myocardial infarction with revascularization of the diagonal branch with good results.
He had a total occlusion of the right coronary artery and a subtotal occlusion of the left circumflex.
The patient was started on aspirin despite his past history of bleeding and would be monitored carefully with guaiac testing of all stools.
The patient's CKs elevated significantly.
Echocardiogram on [**2198-8-23**], showed a mildly dilated left atrium with a left ventricular cavity that was mildly dilated, showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral akinesis/severe hypokinesis.
Basal inferior akinesis, mid-inferior hypokinesis, and mid to distal inferior hypokinesis and mid to distal anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis.
There was no definite left ventricular thrombus identified.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened, and there was no aortic regurgitation seen.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial physiologic pericardial effusion compared to the prior report of [**2193-1-10**].
Prior tape was not available for comparison.
The patient had five episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the first 24 hours after his PCI.
The patient was asymptomatic throughout each event, and had no episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia after the 48 hour period post-PCI.
The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospitalization, and had no other arrhythmias throughout the hospitalization.
He was diuresed aggressively and, despite improvement of his lung examination and improvement radiographically on chest x-rays, the patient remained hypoxic disproportionately to his likely congestive heart failure.
It was thought, based on both radiographic and physical examination findings, that the patient may have an underlying interstitial lung disease that has been previously unrecognized.
The patient has a 110 pack year history of smoking, which could explain his potential lung disease and very well may have a hint of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema.
The patient occasionally complained of shortness of breath but, for the most part, was symptom-free with regard to his respiratory status.
Due to the large dye load, he was also briefly hydrated, however, this hydration was stopped due to the patient's hypoxia and pulmonary edema.
Additionally, on [**2198-8-23**], the patient began complaining of dysuria in the context of Foley catheterization.
When the Foley was pulled, the patient was noted to have 250 cc of frank blood in his urine.
The urine was sent for analysis and was found to be positive for a urinary tract infection with positive nitrites, positive leukocyte esterase, and positive finding of white blood cells in the urine, along with large amount of red blood cells.
The patient's hematuria continued despite bladder irrigation which was started on the evening of the 25th, continued through the [**8-24**], and into the [**8-25**].
Their differential diagnosis included complicated urinary tract infection in the setting of anticoagulation, and bladder cancer, prostate cancer or benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Psychiatry:  The patient had a significant complaint of anxiety and depression throughout his hospitalization.
The patient showed evidence of agitation and anxiety during every encounter with the medical team.
The patient complained of sleeplessness on the day of the 26th, and was given a 2 mg Haldol dose.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was given Protonix for peptic ulcer disease prevention, docusate for constipation.
He was given subcutaneous heparin initially for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
