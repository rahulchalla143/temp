Admission Date: [**2118-10-29**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-10-29**]        Sex:  M  Service:  Neonatology  HISTORY:  This is a 27-1/7 week infant who is now being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**], 7 North for further care due to diagnosis of a colonic stricture following medical necrotizing enterocolitis.
Benign antepartum course until mother presented with vaginal bleeding and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**].
Magnesium sulfate was discontinued and mother had further bleeding and concern for abruption.
Due to this concern for abruption and mother's decreasing platelet count the infant was delivered by cesarean section on [**2118-10-29**] at 6:57 p.m., 20 minutes post onset of general anesthesia.
Ruptured membranes at delivery for clear fluid, no maternal fever, no intrapartum antibiotics.
The infant initially had decreased spontaneous respiratory effort likely secondary to general anesthesia.
Abdomen benign without hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
Decreased spontaneous movement.
Cardiovascular: There was a murmur noted on day of life     #2 and an initial echocardiogram showed a PDA.
A repeat echo on [**11-3**]     showed a small PDA that was about 1 mm and a follow up on     [**12-6**] at the time of his necrotizing enterolitis showed     no ductus arteriosus.
with an umbilical arterial and an     umbilical venous line in place.
He was slowly started     feedings on day of life #7 and slowly advanced to full     feedings on day of life #10 and he was then advanced to     breast milk 30 with beneprotein, was doing well without any     intolerance until day of life #37 on [**12-5**] when he     was noted to have grossly bloody stool.
Please see GI     system for rest of GI issues but he was made n.p.o.
at     that time and due to diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis     remained n.p.o.
A KUB showed mildly dilated loops     throughout the entire bowel.
Continue to gastrointestinal     for further information.
He had     evidence of medical necrotizing enterocolitis with KUB     showing multiple areas of pneumatosis over the next 1 to     2 days.
His CBC was     significant for a bandemia with 25 bands that increased     to 27 bands the following day and later normalized.
Today, in the setting of the     increased abdominal distention on the KUB and his high risk     for a stricture, he was sent over to [**Hospital1 **] radiology for     a barium enema and a transverse colonic stricture was     identified.
Endocrine: [**Known lastname **] had normal sugars in the first 2 weeks     of life and on day of life 18 was noted to have a D-stick     of 36 and he then continued over the next 1 to 2 weeks to     have intermittent low D-sticks and endocrinology consult     had been obtained and recommended sending an insulin     level as well as growth hormone, urine for ketones,     cortisol, and a blood gas if the blood D-stick was <50.
Infectious disease: He did receive an initial rule out     sepsis in the first 48 hours.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital3 1810**] level 3 for surgical repair of the colonic stricture.
Hearing screen status has not been done at this time but     will need to be done prior to infant's discharge.
Discharge Diagnoses: 1) prematurity 2) s/p medical necrotizing enterocolitis 3) apnea of prematurity 4) s/p hypoglycemia 5) s/p PDA treated with indomethacin 6) s/p RDS requiring surfactant 7) anemia of prematurity 8) now with colonic stricture requiring transfer to [**Hospital3 18242**] 7N Surgical Service for repair.
