CXR showed multifocal PNA (LUL, RLL, ?RML) and slightly increased effusions from [**3-10**], cardiomegaly.
CT abdomen with po/IV contrast showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, CHF.
Also showed an inflammatory process in left posterior pararenal space with mild sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
(of note, last CT at [**Hospital1 2177**] with pararenal hematoma after biopsy, lung bases pneumonitis) .
CT head at OSH: possible R mastoiditis, otherwise unremarkabel awith no intracranial mass or hemorrhage  ABG - 7.55/32/79 at OSH on RA -> 7.51/34/73 few hrs later -> 7.55/29/69 this AM .
CK 5, Trop I 0.25 ((0.1-1.5 - borderline on OSH labs) .
TTE: 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with inferior wall akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely  more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic  regurgitation seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is  seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-12-29**],  the LV function has decreased substantially with now global hypokinesis with  inferior wall akinesis.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis  seen.
MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2125-3-16**] 6:24 PM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  Reason: Evaluate for mastoiditis, mass lesion, possible vasculitis/a Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with possible mastoiditis, recently dx'd with bacterial meningitis, continues to have mild confusion.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate for mastoiditis, mass lesion, possible vasculitis/amyloid CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with possible mastoiditis with bacterial meningitis continues to have mild confusion, for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
There are no prior similar examinations for comparison.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion to indicate acute infarct.
There is evidence of slow diffusion within the posterior portion of both lateral ventricles as well as in the fourth ventricle and cisterna magna indicative of cellular debris possibly related to meningitis.
There are soft tissue changes within the right mastoid air cells which could be related to the history of mastoiditis.
No evidence of cerebritis is seen in the right temporal lobe or cerebellum.
No evidence of periventricular edema is seen.
Increased signal within the posterior portion of both lateral ventricles, fourth ventricle and cisterna magna indicative of cellular debris possibly related to history of meningitis.
No evidence of cerebritis or acute infarct.
Right mastoid soft tissue changes and subtle meningeal enhancement along the right petrous temporal bone could be related to mastoiditis.
Moderate ventriculomegaly indicative of communicating hydrocephalus.
No evidence of periventricular edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 22873**] is a 57 yo M with non-ischemic CM and other medical problems who presented from [**Hospital3 **] with fevers, altered mental status/agitation, and report of headache, photophobia and confusion at home.
Head CT there showed only R sided possible mastoiditis.
CXR showed multifocal bilateral pneumonia, however the patient was recently treated for pneumonia at [**Hospital1 2177**] and it is cunclear what his CXR looked like at that time.
CSF was consistent with bacterial meningitis, despite the patient being on antibiotics for approximately three days.
Echo performed while in the ICU showed EF 20% and new global and inferior hypopkinesis.
The patient has a known history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with last echo in [**Month (only) **] showing EF of 35-40% and a clean catheterization at that time.
The patient is being worked up as an outpatient at [**Hospital1 2177**] for possible vasculitis versus intrinsic renal disease with renal biopsy results pending.
He is on prednisone 40mg po qday as an outpatient for this possible vasculitis and therefore will be maintained on this dose.
He is also being worked up at [**Hospital1 2177**] for likely plasma cell dyscrasia with light chain gammopathy.
ID was consulted to assist in defining treatment course for meningitis and pneumonia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
