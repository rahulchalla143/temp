CXR [**2177-11-9**]: No appreciable change in patchy consolidation of both lungs, suspicious for pneumonia with possible superimposed failure.
CXR [**2177-11-4**]: New ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.
CXR [**11-3**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-11**], there is little overall change.
Pathology [**2177-10-28**]: Right leg tissue: 1.
Bone Marrow Scan [**2177-10-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Bone Marrow Scan [**2177-10-17**]: IMPRESSION: Increased uptake in the distal third of the right distal lower extremity consistent with continued active infection.
White Blood Cell study [**2177-10-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2177-10-11**] (MICU): Enlarged pulmonary arteries due to pulmonary hypertension are unchanged.
CXR [**2177-10-10**] (MICU): IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of congestive heart failure/volume overload.
CXR [**2177-10-6**]: A small component of pulmonary edema present on [**10-4**] has resolved.
Pathology [**2177-10-4**]: Right tibial bone: Bony fragments with acute and chronic inflammation, fibrosis and focal necrosis consistent with acute and chronic osteomyelitis.
CXR [**2177-10-4**]: Slightly improved congestive changes compared to prior but overall not particularly different; certainly no worse than baseline.
CXR [**2177-9-29**]: Mild pulmonary edema has developed since [**9-6**] superimposed on chronic atelectasis at the lung bases, mild chronic interstitial abnormality, severe pulmonary hypertension and vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly.
Final internal length is 25-cm, with the tip positioned in mid-subclavian due to known central venous stenosis and per request from clinical team.
WBC Scan [**2177-9-17**]: Right anterior lower extremity soft tissue abscess and underlying osteomyelitis of the adjacent tibia.
Tib/Fib x-ray [**2177-9-15**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change compared to prior study.
Unilateral Doppler US [**2177-9-12**]: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler examination of the right common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed.
CT RLE: IMPRESSION [**2177-9-8**]: 1.
CT without contrast [**2177-9-7**]: CONCLUSION: Extensive bilateral airspace infiltrates in both lungs without change from [**2177-7-1**].
Results were called by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1169**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1445**] at 6 p.m. on [**2177-9-7**].
CXR [**2177-9-6**]: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacity, most suggestive of atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
Tib/Fib x-ray [**2177-9-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Hardware infection: On [**9-8**], pt received a CT of her RLE demosntrating  an 8 cm x 2 cm low-density, peripherally enhancing phlegmon within the anterior compartment of the calf just deep to the patient's large soft tissue defect.
As part of continued workup of the patient, she recieved an IN-111 tagged white blood cell scan to help determine whether her hardware was, in fact, infected.
The IN-111 scan showed that Ms. [**Known lastname 18918**] hardware was infected.
US guided biopsy of phlegmon was inadequate and patient was taken to OR for debridement, culture and bone biopsy on [**9-23**].
On [**2177-10-17**] she had a bone marrow scan which showed increased uptake in the distal third of the right distal lower extremity consistent with continued active infection.
The patient continued to have weekly vac changes in the operating room on Tuesdays, and cultures were taken on [**2177-10-21**].
A bone marrow scan was completed on [**2177-10-28**] to investigate progression of her infection compared with a scan on [**2177-10-17**], which was found to be unchanged.
The patient continued to spike fevers, and she had blood cultures drawn for temps >100.4 F.  On [**11-19**] pt had another wbc scan again unchanged from prior, further evidence that despite the antibiotics, the osteomyelitis had not resolved.
Orthopedics changed the vac dressing to a pressure wet to dry dressing, and allowed the patient to see the wound on [**11-19**].
A family meeting was called on [**11-20**] which involved Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**], her husband, her friend/pastor's representation, orthopedics, the medicine team, case management and social work.
Path margins were found to be clear, cultures negative and ID recomended to d/c her abx (daptomycin/bactrim/meropenem) x10d after the OR cultures had been sent (abx course ended [**12-1**]).
An x-fix was placed in the OR on [**2177-10-10**].
Pt will undergo extensive PT and eventually be fitted with a prosthesis.
Following her [**Name (NI) 6024**] pt received an epidural in the PACU as well as large doses of narcotics.
Initally cause was thought to be due to high dose lyrica (75 [**Hospital1 **], which was decreased to 75 qd with improvement).
Patient's fever and BP improved with daily dose of antibiotics.
Hypotension was attributed to narcotics and epidural.
CXR performed, with no new changes, unlikely large bleed.
She remained stable with plans to transfuse with Hct <21.
Blood glucose levels were monitored closely.
A cosyntropin stim test on [**2177-10-23**] revealed a modest bump in cortisol, but not as expected.
ESR, and CRP levels were monitored without major changes.
Fentanyl 100 mcg/hr Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1)  Transdermal Q72H (every 72 hours).
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-10**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
You initially received IV antibiotics for your infection and showed marked improvement over the course of your hospitalization in terms of your blood pressure and in terms of your fevers.
Please return to the ED with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
