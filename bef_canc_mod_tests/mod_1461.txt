Earlier on the night of admission, the patient was noted to have increasing shortness of breath and oxygen saturations in the 80s despite nebulizers.
Initial vital signs revealed a temperature of 101.4, heart rate of 112, blood pressure of 70s/palp, respiratory rate of 20 to 30, and oxygen saturations of 98% on 100% nonrebreather.
A chest x-ray revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate, with her urinalysis being positive.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/chronic bronchitis (no pulmonary function tests documented) 5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient was noted to have a temperature of 101, a heart rate of 114, blood pressure of 72/35, respiratory rate of 30, oxygen saturation 97% on 100% nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination demonstrated a surgical right pupil, which was fixed, and a left pupil which was responsive.
Cardiovascular examination demonstrated tachycardia, regular, unable to hear rubs, murmurs or gallops.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count 27.8, hematocrit 38.2, platelets 244.
INR 1.5, PTT 32.2.
Chem 7 showed a sodium of 139, potassium 8.3, chloride 104, bicarbonate 20, BUN 37, creatinine 1.9, glucose 120.
Albumin 3.3, calcium 9.6, phosphate 2.9, magnesium 2.2.
On admission, the patient had an arterial blood gas of 7.23/49/170, a lactate of 7.6.
A urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.010/moderate blood/negative nitrates, 31 red cells, 56 white cells, occasional bacteria, and no epithelial cells.
The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures were pending at the time of admission.
Chest x-ray demonstrated questionable scarring of the right upper lung, with haziness in the right upper lobe fields.
CT of the chest taken in [**2141-8-29**] demonstrated right pleural effusion with consolidation.
An electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus tachycardia at 108, low voltage in limb leads, and no ischemic changes, no changes from previous electrocardiogram taken in [**2141-8-29**].
On [**5-8**], urine cultures came back with intermediate resistance to fluoroquinolones, and the species was further identified as proteus.
The patient underwent a CT angio on [**5-9**], which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
Head CT on [**5-9**] showed the old left MCA stroke, but no acute process.
The patient also underwent a swallowing study, which was positive for aspiration, and had to have a nasogastric tube placed in order to start feedings.
Multiple cultures, including stool, urine, blood and a left intravenous catheter tip remained no growth to date, however, urine samples taken three days prior to discharge demonstrated urine cultures positive for yeast.
The patient's white blood cell count improved dramatically over the course of treatment, from an admission white count of 27.8, to a discharge white blood cell count of 13.7.
The patient continued to have low-grade temperatures of less than 100 degrees at the time of discharge.
All cultures were no growth to date by the time of discharge.
At the time of discharge, the patient was scheduled to have four additional days of ceftriaxone to treat the proteus urinary tract infection as well as proteus sepsis (cultures taken early on during the patient's admission demonstrated one out of four blood culture bottles positive for proteus.
