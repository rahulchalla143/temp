His symptoms and K improved with treatment in the ED, and he was transfered to the ICU.
Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of [**2-22**].5.
This led to a bump in his creatinine to 3.5 and potassium retention.

His potassium was monitored and he was given Kayexalate as needed.
He was give 1 amp of atropine in the ED and his heart rate improved to the 50s.
He was monitored on telemetry throughout his stay, and was stable.
