During that admission he had several melanotic stools, and his Hct nadir was 20% and peak Tnt was 0.2.
He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2123-9-23**] at which time his Hct was 28.6 which was down from 34.5 on [**2123-9-6**].

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with infero-lateral hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
His blood pressure rapidly normalized following 1L of saline and 1 unit of pRBCs.
