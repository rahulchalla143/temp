The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Compared with the report of the prior study of [**2148-2-7**], there are now pacing wires in the RA/RV and a mobile echodensity is associated with the right atrial wire.

Final internal length is 46 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
It is likely that the endoscope did not reach abnormal area noted on CT scan.

# Unresolved leukocytosis: The patient presented with a WBC of 17, which downtrended with blood and was initially attributed to bone marrow stress response but then attributed to infection with resolution of the leukocytosis on both GP and GN/Anaerobic antimicrobial coverage.
**The patient will follow-up with his PCP to discuss goals of care and whether further diagnostic procedures are warranted, including potential consultation with surgical oncology.
# Lower GI Bleed: Presenting Hct was 18, was transfused 4 units of blood in the ICU, and transferred to the floor after reassuring trends were demonstrated in lactate and pre-renal [**Last Name (un) **]; the floorm Hct remained stable until the end of the hospitalization, when the patient required an additional unit for a Hct of 22 with subsequent Hct appropriately increased and stable on discharge.
The etiology of the bleed remained indeterminate on discharge, but the leading diagnosis was the distal jejunal thickened segment seen on CT that was unable to be reached by spirus enteroscopy.
# GNR, Klebsiella PNA bacteremia: After an interval of sterile blood cultures, the patient grew out one culture of K.PNA and was started on Zosyn before being narrowed to Cipro/Flagyl PO.
# RUE DVT: RUE US was performed because of a superficial thrombophlebitis that was found; the patient had no symptoms of edema and the RUE DVT exam was ordered as an adjunct to the forearm US.
The patient's pressure rebounded with small boluses and thereafter remained stable.
CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis showed the jejunal lesion detailed above, prompting enteroscopy.
Remained on diuretic pre-hospitalization diuretic regimen, with Torsemide intermittently held for BP < 100 and BP medications held in the acute setting of GI bleed.
CT showed no pneumonia, only effusions.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 39857**] - [**Location 9583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: -Abnormal jejunal segment of indeterminate specificity -Lower gastrointestinal bleed of indeterminate etiology -Endocarditis of the right ventricular pacemaker SECONDARY: -stable chronic systolic congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized for maroon stool, which caused your blood count to be low.
You underwent an advanced endoscopy to attempt to biopsy this abnormal segment of the intestine, but the segment was too deep into your small intestine for this to be possible.
You were found to have a blood infection, which was treated with antibiotics.
You were found to have a blood clot in the deep veins of your right arm.
You were not treated with blood thinners because of your recent bleed.
