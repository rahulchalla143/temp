Pt then had a CXR which showed RLL PNA, with subsequent CXR showing worsening R sided PNA, so he was changed to azithro and CTX.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.6 BP 167/90 HR 106 RR 18 O2 93% on 50% FM Gen: NAD, lying on in bed on his side HEENT: PERRL.
Suprapubic cath and baclofen pump in place.
Pertinent Results: CXR (prelim): R sided peri-hilar fullness and RLL infiltrate, L sided infiltrate .
CXR ([**9-28**], OSH): New bihilar infiltrates and more patchy densities in the periphery of both lungs may represent asymmetric pulm edema vs bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
CXR ([**10-1**], OSH): Again seen is the L sided air space process.
The cardiac silhouette is ill-defined, though likely at least mildly enlarged.
EKG: sinus tach @ 100, nl axis, nl intervals, biphasic PW in V1-V2, <1mm STD in V5 .

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
He does appear to be limited by his side lying, semi-reclined position in the bed, as did appear to contribute to premature spill over and penetration of thin liquids.
An ECHO done at that time to assess for CHF revealed a normal LVEF but positive for diastolic dysfunction.
ECHO here - normal LV EF with some evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
Repeat chest xray showed marked improvement.
Hematocrit remained at baseline with no acute bleeding.
The results of his prior workup for GI bleed should be obtained in clinic.
