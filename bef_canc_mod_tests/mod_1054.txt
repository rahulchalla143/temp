Catheterization showed 99% stenosis of LAD s/p stent placement.
Pump - Echocardiography post-stent showed anterior and distal septal hypokinesis and apical dyskinesis w/ an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
In light of aneurysm, pt was deemed to require anticoagulation on Coumadin for 1 month with a goal INR of 1.8-2.5 along with low dose ASA and Plavix.
However, in light of her anticoagulation on Coumadin, aspirin, and Plavix - a head CT was obtained to r/o an acute bleed.
The head CT was negative.
U/A and urine cx was also sent.
U/A was negative for leuk esterace and nitrates.
Urine gram stain showed few PMN's.
Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours) for 7 days.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on [**1-5**] and subsequent days until level is between 1.8 - 2.5.
Please take you lovenox injections and have you INR blood test checked on Wednesday with the results sent to your physican.
Goal INR is 1.8 - 2.5.
