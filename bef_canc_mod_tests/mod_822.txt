These nodules were not previously seen (last CT chest at [**Hospital1 18**] [**4-11**]).
Urine legionella, CMV, serum cryptococcal antigen, and 3 AFB smears were negative.
Thoracics were consulted for VATS, and the patient underwent VATS with BAL and wedge biopsies of right lower lobe and middle lobes on [**2-18**].
EBL was 50 cc and intraoperatively, received 300 cc LR.
Follow up ABG was 7.08/94/154 and pt was somnolent.
Repeat ABG was 7.10/71/104.
The pathology result of the pulmonary nodule biopsy returned as bronchiolitis obliteran pneumonitis.
Liver transplant consultants thought that Sirolimus was likely the culprit for the cause of BOOP and discontinued sirolimus on [**2-21**] and increased Cellcept to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and continued prenisone 5mg daily.

Chest CT was done on [**2-28**].
ABG was near his baseline however given nursing concern he was transferred back to Medical ICU.
Urine lytes were sent were consistent with pre-renal vs. ATN.
