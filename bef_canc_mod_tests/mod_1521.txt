CT scan showed abdominal & cervical LAD, and large right pelvic mass.
Excisional biopsy of left supraclavicular node pathology and immunohistochemistry c/w CLL.
BM Bx [**12-16**] revealed extensive infiltration, with 40% marrow cellularity.
Rituxan weekly was given from [**2164-10-10**] through [**2164-11-2**] and platelets recovered to about 30,000.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**10/2164**] suggested a sustained response to chemotherapy on the megakaryocytes.
Chlorambucil was restarted at 4mg dose on [**2166-8-29**] when she progressed with painful adenopathy.

[**2167-2-19**] CXR (AP PORT): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-1-27**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
[**2167-2-23**] CXR (PA & LAT): IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2167-3-1**] CXR (PORT): IMPRESSION: Worsening CHF with now moderate pulmonary edema.
[**2167-3-3**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or significant interval change.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) and regional function is normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-23**], findings are similar except patient now in sinur rhythm.
[**2167-3-6**] CXR (AP PORT): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**Month (only) 956**].

[**2167-3-4**] BCX neg [**2167-3-5**] BCX neg  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 68 year-old female with PMH of CLL, HTN, CAD, chronic stable diastolic CHF (EF >60%), hyperlipdemia, hypothyroid, CKD (baseline creatinine 1.3), DM2, anemia, a-fib, and gout admitted with AMS, UTI, and renal failure.
Head CT on admission was negative.
Blood cultures were negative.
This was again changed to nitrofurantoin when cultures returned as bactrim-resistent strain.
CXR was negative for consolidation, blood cultures were negative.
Sites of previous biopsy showed no e/o abscess (though +fluctuance on exam).
CXR showed volume overload and echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved EF.
Cardiac enzymes are negative on admisison, recycled [**3-2**].
ECG w/o new ST-T changes.
#) ARF: The patient had a creatinine of 2.8 from baseline ~ 1.3 This trended back to baseline with diuresis and antibiotics.
Creatinine on discharge was 0.9. .
Patient has CLL and chronically has low counts; however, her white count on admission was very low compared to her usual baseline.
Marrow infiltration vs. medication effect were considered; however, recent bone marrow biopsy on [**12-20**] was not suggestive of a clear explanation to account for pancytopenia.
Her ANC returned to baseline but platelets remained low.
She required a total of 3 platelet transfusions (on [**2-23**], -18, and -25) and 4 PRBC transfusions ([**2-21**] x 2, -17, and -21) during her hospital course.
The patient had panorex x-ray and was seen by the dental team who recommended extraction when medically stable.
#) The patient was discharged to rehab on [**3-12**] in good condition, VSS, ambulating well with walker, with good O2 saturations on 2L NC.
