Following the syncopal episode, the patient was found to have a sustained heart rate less than 40 and low BP to 70s, was therefore referred to the ED for further evaluation.
On one occasion, his HR dipped to 30s sinus and SBP in the 50s systolic, however the patient was mentating ok, aaox3 and mildly diaphoretic.
Ekg showed sinus bradycardia with mildly prolongued QT.
