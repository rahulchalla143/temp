Vascular Surgery was requested to see the patient on [**2108-2-8**] for abnormal peripheral vascular resistance studies which demonstrated significant superficial femoral artery tibial occlusive disease.
The blood vessels were noncompressible.
The metatarsal forefoot pressure was 5 mm.
The patient's initial wound cultures grew Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Oxacillin sensitive, intermediate Levofloxin.
Second cultures done on [**2-17**] grew Pseudomonas gram negative rods and Staphylococcus coagulase negative.
The patient was seen by Cardiology who felt that if he is at high risk, he likely would need a cardiac catheterization and if low risk we would probably be able to proceed with surgery.
The patient then underwent arteriogram on [**2108-2-10**] which demonstrated patent common iliac with a distal stenosis 56% just proximal to the bifurcation.
No cardiac intervention or diagnostic study was indicated with the results of the Persantine MIBI.
The patient was followed by the Renal Service and his immune suppression was managed during his perioperative hospital stay.
Immediately postoperatively the patient was hemodynamically stable and his postoperative hematocrit was 31.3.
BUN was 31, creatinine 1.6, potassium 3.5 which was supplemented.
His hematocrit remained stable at 31.
His initial creatinine kinase was 41, BUN and creatinine remained stable.
His examination was unremarkable.
The patient continued to be followed by the Podiatry Service for his metatarsal head resection, it was open wound.
On postoperative day #2 the patient remained afebrile, his hematocrit was 29, BUN and creatinine 29 and 1.5, magnesium 1.9, Vancomycin 15.
The patient had bedside sharp excisional debridement on [**2-17**] of the wound edges done in the metatarsophalangeal joint resection on [**2-7**].
Ambulation status, strict nonweightbearing, left foot.
