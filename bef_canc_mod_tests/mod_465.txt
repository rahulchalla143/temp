Admission Date:  [**2178-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-11-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Ciprofloxacin / Clindamycin / Quinidine / Niacin / Persantine / Diuril IV / Metolazone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stents x2 to left circumflex artery   History of Present Illness: 76 y/o F with PMH of CAD s/p CABG in [**2146**], redo in [**2173**] ((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA 'y' graft to OM 'Y' graft to PDA), CKD with baseline Cr of 2.6 transferred to CCU in setting of ACS s/p DES x2 to native LCx.
She initially presented to OSH where EKG uninterpretable in setting of v-paced rhythm.
1st set of enzymes were negative, but second set revealed troponin 0.2 (increased from 0.06), MB 18, and CK 179; pro BNP 1573.
Pain was treated with morphine - reportedly made her feel worse- and nitro gtt.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient complained of persistent discomfort despite high nitro gtt causing SBP in 80-90s.
Angiography revealed thrombus in prox Cx which was treated with prox and mid DES.

PULSES: Right:  DP 1+ PT 1+ Left:  DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: # CARDIOLOGY  [**2-19**] Cardiac Catheterization .................  [**2178-2-20**] TTE Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis.
Compared to prior study of [**2174-2-28**], left ventricular ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation now much worse.
[**2-23**] ECHO Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-2-20**], there has been interim improvement in systolic function of the distal 2/3rds of the inferior/inferolateral wall and global LVEF.

Cardiac catheterization revealed a 95% occlusion proximally in the LCx with filling defect/thrombus; the patient received [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.
TTE on [**2-20**] showed left ventricular systolic function that was severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and of the apex.
Patient received a Lasix drip with additional doses of metolazone and diuril given to augment urine output.
Repeat chest xray showed mild improvement in pulmonary edema.
Her Pacemaker settings were changed to decrease AV delay to 150ms to provide more effective atrial kick.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine was elevated (baseline Cr 2.6, now 4.0), likely secondary contrast-induced nephropathy secondary to dye load from cardiac catheterization.
We expect creatinine to peak at 48-72 hours post-exposure.
Fractional excretion of urea was <30%, which indicated a pre-renal component as well.
Urine culture showed 2 epis, sm leuk, 3 WBC, few bacteria, 14 hyaline casts.
She will need further monitoring and workup of her renal failure after discharge.
She had an infectious workup which included urinalysis and culture as well as a chest xray.
Her hematocrit trended down; etiology unclear.
She was started on iron supplementation in addition to folic acid & vit B12.
