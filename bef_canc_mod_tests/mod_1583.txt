Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-2-12**], there has been global deterioration of left ventricular systolic function.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is greater and right ventricular free wall hypokinesis is now present.. .
CXR [**1-23**]: Worsening, mild-to-moderate fluid overload and persistent cardiomegaly.
She has a history of ischemic vs. infectious colitis in [**2165**] in tranverse and descending colon, which has resolved on CT scan.
CT scan did reveal new diverticulitis which was thought to be the etiology of her symptoms.
Initially, there was a concern for impending sepsis with blood pressures in the 90's and an elevated lactate to 4.0.
Her symptoms and blood pressure improved.
Her troponins were found to be mildly elevated, with flat CK: troponin 0.18->0.22, CK 95->53.
Pt had echocardiogram done on this admission to further evaluate cardiac status.
The echo showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the mid inferior and mid inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %).
A pMIBI was performed which was unable to assess the inferior walls and vessels due to subdiaphragmatic activity.
# Hypertension - The patient was continued on amlodipine and metoprolol after her blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
As she became hypertensive, she was started on Valsartan with an improvement in blood pressure.
She received an AV fistulogram which showed proximal stenosis.
She did have one episode of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension after her third HD where 1.5 kg was removed.
She had no further episodes of orthostatic hypotension, and her blood pressure remained stable even with her anti-hypertensives.
