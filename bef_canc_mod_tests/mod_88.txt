He had CXR which showed bilateral infiltrates worse on the left side.

CXR admission INDICATION: 59-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer and multiple pneumonias in the past presents with shortness of breath and cough with wheeze and rales.
COMPARISON: Multiple studies including most recent chest radiograph of [**2126-12-8**].
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: There is bilateral multifocal airspace opacity which is most pronounced in the left upper lobe and concerning for pneumonia.
CXR [**2127-2-16**] Final Report STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2127-2-16**].
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2127-2-13**].
Alternatively, interstitial pneumonitis and acute lung injury from crack use is possible, perhaps with a superimposed infection, a repeat CXR later in admission showed improvement of opacities; however, the pt still had an oxygen requirement (no WBC, afebrile) which was ultimately weaned off to room air.
Iron studies were not consistent with iron overload or deficiency.
