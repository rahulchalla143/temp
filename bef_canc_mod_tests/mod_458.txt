His liver biopsy demonstrated moderate acute cellular rejection.
This was due to the fact that he had worsening liver function tests, with an ALT of 271 and an AST of 317.
His liver biopsy demonstrated no features of acute cellular rejection, but there was evidence of grade 1 inflammation and stage I-II fibrosis.
His rapamycin levels at that time were elevated at 27.3, and therefore this medication was held.
Upon discharge, he was told to have his rapamycin levels checked on the 29th and then to restart this medication on the 29th after getting his levels checked.
A rapamycin level was drawn: 18.2 on [**10-20**] with plan for followup [**2146-10-26**].
CT abdomen/pelvis in the ED showing no acute intraabdominal pathology.
Liver biopsy in [**9-/2144**] showed stage 4 cirrhosis and small well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Found to have grade 1 esophageal varices on EGD in 4/[**2143**].
- HCC: Recently noted 1.4 cm enhancing lesion on liver imaging, proved to be small, well-differentialed HCC on bx in [**9-26**] s/p cadaveric liver transplantation on [**11-28**] (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]) - Hypothyroidism.

Imaging: CT Ab/Pelvis [**2146-10-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2146-10-23**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-31**], there is no interval change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
[**2146-11-9**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: There are no focal or textural abnormalities within the liver.
A single view of the right kidney shows no hydronephrosis.
ABDOMINAL DOPPLER: The left, main, and right portal veins are patent with hepatopetal flow.
Moderate portal/periportal, and mild lobular mixed inflammation including lymphocytes, plasma cells, occasional neutrophils, and eosinophils.
Iron stain shows minimal iron deposition in hepatocytes.
Of note, another concern in a patient with known liver [**Year (4 digits) **] rejection would be SBP, but the patient does not have ascites on exam or CT and has only mild tenderness to abdominal palpation.
# GI Bleed: While in the hospital, the patient began to pass burgundy colored stools with small blood clots on evening of [**11-1**] and subsequently triggered on the floor for hypotension (85/48).
His hematocrits were stable until the afternoon of [**11-4**] when he had a Hct drop to 25.9.
Of note, levels have been fluctuating lately.
His levels were followed and re-dose as appropriate .
# Direct hyperbilirubinemia (MICU course, primary team to update) Patient had admission bilirubin of 3.3 with subsequent uptrend to 12 mostly direct fraction with obvious jaundice.
His recent [**Hospital1 **] showed a patent extrahepatic system.
# HCC: The patient is scheduled for a protocol CT scan on [**2146-12-7**], which will be one year post-transplantation.
The patient's hematocrit stabilized and on POD 2 he was transferred to the floor.
His hematocrit remained stable, and his hemodynamic status never faltered.
On POD5 he was given 1U PRBC's for a Hct of 28.3, down from 31 the day before.
Of note, the liver biopsy performed during his operation was notable for recurrent HCV as well as acute rejection.
His rapamycin was transitioned to prograf in the interest of better wound healing, and his levels were aimed at slightly higher values.
Because your LFTs were elevated, a liver biopsy was done, which showed infection and recurrent hepatitis C. [**Hospital **] was done and had a stent placed.
If you do not pass these stents, you will have an abdominal XRAY called a KUB on [**First Name (STitle) 766**] [**11-21**]  CareGroup VNA services have been arranged to see you at home for Physical therapy.
