Studies CT head [**12-24**] There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
CT C-spine [**12-24**] There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST, THREE VIEWS OF RIGHT-SIDED RIBS: Heart remains moderately enlarged.
Irregularity of this rib is compatible with a remote fracture, as seen on the prior chest CT from [**2163-10-10**].
Scrotal U/S The patient reports a longstanding history of swelling in the right hemiscrotum, which is also corroborated with a CT from [**2-28**], [**2163**], which shows right-sided hydrocele in the imaged portion of the scrotum.
Recommend followup imaging after resolution of symptoms to confirm resolution of the right testicular collection.
CXR [**2165-12-26**] Mild to moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema has improved since [**2165-12-24**].
CT Abd/Pelvis/chest [**2165-12-26**] CT OF THE THORAX: There is diffuse alveolar consolidation involving all lobes, particularly the lower lobes as well as thickening of the interlobular septa.
Hilar lymphadenopathy cannot be assessed due to consolidation.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Surgical mesh for repair of the ventral hernia is stable.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The appendix is normal.
No other CT findings to explain acute back pain.
CXR [**2166-1-3**]- Since [**2165-12-29**], mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lung atelectasis (left side more than right), have improved.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2165-12-29**], mild pulmonary edema, small effusions and left lower lung atelectasis have improved.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] (on mycophenolate, cyclosporine, prednisone immunosuppresion), failed pancreas [**Known lastname **], hypertension, admitted for injuries sustained after mechanical fall and dyspnea, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
CXR consistent with fluid overload, but also could not rule out infectious process in patient that has underlying immunosuppression.
He did develop a fever in the MICU and CT torso showed multifactorial pneumonia and Right-sided effusion.
ECG showed atrial fibrillation with changes c/w old ECGs, however new T wave changes in V5/V6, so his cardiac enzymes were trended and remained flat.
At the time of discharge, his oxygen saturations were 92-94% on RA at rest, and 89-94% when ambulating.
Creatinine was within patient's typical baseline range on admission.
Calcium supplementation was continued.
Patient will need creatinine rechecked on Tuesday [**1-7**].
# Acute onset back pain: In setting of elevated INR w/ scrotal hematoma retroperitoneal bleed is possible, although INR was only midly elevated and his hematocrit has been stable.
A CT torso was performed which showed no aortic pathology or RP bleed but did show a single non-displaced rib fracture.
INR was 1.6 on the day of discharge, and patient will need INR checked at [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] on Tuesday [**1-7**].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Will need INR and creatinine checked on TUESDAY [**1-7**] # Cinacalcet held at time of discharge.
Check ca/phos/PTH levels as outpt # Started renogel 800mg TID # Lasix increased to 60mg PO BID as outpt # Repeat testicular U/S once this acute episode resolves, to see if there is an underlying predisposition to bleeding, urology follow-up appointment scheduled  Medications on Admission: amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
calcium carbonate-vitamin D2 600 mg calcium- 200 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day.
You were evaluated with CT scans which showed no evidence of acute fractures.
We decreased the fluid overload in your lungs with lasix, and you completed a course of antibiotics.
Please have both your INR and CREATININE checked on tuesday [**1-7**], [**2166**]  We have made the following changes to your medications: - INCREASE lasix to 60mg TWICE a day - START iron pill twice daily - START renogel 800mg three times a day, with meals - STOP cinacalcet  Please continue the remainder of your medications as prescribed prior to admission.
