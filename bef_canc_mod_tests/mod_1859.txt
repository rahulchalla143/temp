CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2130-2-10**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
TTE ([**2130-2-14**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Renal U/S ([**2130-2-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
LUE LENI ([**2130-2-15**]): IMPRESSION: Left deep venous thrombosis involving the internal jugular and brachial veins.
Chest X-ray for PICC placement ([**2130-2-16**]): Radiology read dictated: PICC in the right superior caval junction.
VBG in ED was 7.09/28/94, showing uncompensated metabolic acidosis.
Abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of pancreatitis with inflamed pancreatic head.
EKG without changes from her baseline and she was without chest pain.
Trop, CK, MB were trended and noted to be decreasing, no changes on serial EKGs.
# Acute on CKI: Patient has a creatinine baseline of 3.0 and presented to the ED with creatinine of 6.2.
There was no acute need for HD and the patient's creatinine trended down with IVF suggesting it was hypovolemic ARF.
Ucx grew yeast ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 53550**]) and repeat UA with continued pyuria, so fluconazole was started to treat likely yeast UTI for a 7 day course.
The bacteria were felt to be a contaminent as CFU was low and other cultures were negative for bacterial growth.
Renal ultrasound was done to evaluate for abnormalities (poorly evaluated in CT scan), showed layering of debris in bladder consistent with UTI.
She should have a UA and urine culture checked after fluconazole to assess for cure.
#DVT: LUE swelling noted on exam on [**2-15**], LENI showed occlusive L brachial clot and a nonocclusive thrombus in L IJ.
PICC line was placed for heparin drip until INR between 2 and 3 for 24 hours.
Hct of 27.1 on admission.
Plt on admission at 105.
# ?AAA - noted to have a pulsatile abdomen in the ED, noncontrast CT of abdomen did not show any signs of AAA.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
Weight based dosing.
For this we started an antibiotic, fluconazole, which you should continue taking once a day until [**2130-2-20**].
