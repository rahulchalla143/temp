On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a systolic blood pressure of 70.
He reported a usual SBP of 80-110.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2 of 48, and pO2 of 33.
When evaluated by the MICU shortly after arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via nasal cannula.
Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute PE.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with PFTs in [**2176-5-27**] showing an FEV1 of 0.83 L, which is 25% of predicted, and FEV1 to FVC ration of 68% of predicted.
Catheterization at that time showed normal left ventricular function, ejection fraction of 50%, and a 30% right coronary artery lesion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.5?????
?, heart rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT 22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7.
Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.
Theophylline level 4.3.
Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no pneumothorax, no effusion.
CT angiogram showed no acute PE, possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left lower lobe that is not occlusive.
Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
He continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of greater than 92%.
On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Hypotension:  The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90.
He also had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been given to the patient.
His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was thought that there was not any significant cardiac component to the patient's respiratory distress.
No further work-up was done.
