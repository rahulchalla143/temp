On Thursday afternoon he started to feel some malaise and his temperature started to rise.
In the ED, patient had labs which showed and elevated white count with a 10% bandemia.
He had a CXR which was negative for any acute process.
UA, urine culture, and blood cultures were sent.
Past Medical History: Congestive heart failure with EF 65% on [**2158-6-13**] Type 2 diabetes with triopathy, controlled.
History of hepatitis C - no therapy - [**11-22**] bx -Minimal portal and lobular mononuclear cell inflammation, consistent with involvement by chronic viral hepatitis C ( Grade 1 activity).
End-stage renal disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant, creatinine 1.5 in [**2159-4-17**] Peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease.
enlarged LN in his neck s/p bx - 2-3 years ago, pt reports nl EBV IgG positive in [**2154**]/CMV IgG positive hep B core ab + transplant: on lamivudine .
ECHO ([**2159-4-30**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-6-16**], the aortic prosthesis gradient is significantly elevated.
CT Torso: [**5-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2159-6-5**]: NC Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or large [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territory infarction; if suspicion for infarct is present, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
Air-fluid levels in paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells may relate in part to recent intubation and recently removed NG tube.
There is no evidence of ligamentous disruption seen on limited evaluation on the sagittal inversion recovery images.
IMPRESSION: Limited study with motion on the sagittal images.
Urinalysis was positive but urine culture negative; CSF suggested possible Aseptic meningitis; Rapid respiratory viral screen was negative; C. difficile was negative x3; TTE was negative for vegetation to suggest endocarditis; bronchoalveolar lavage was negative; LFTs were normal.
Noncontrast head CT scan was negative, MRI c-spine and head were negative for acute abnormalities as well.
Blood pressure has been stable on the floor.
Peak creatinine was 5.6, which trended downwards and hit baseline of 1.5 on [**6-6**].
# acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient was admitted with a history of diastolic CHF and an EF of 65%.
During his admission he was noted to have an EF of 40% on echocardiogram with global hypokinesis in the setting of his SIRS.
We anticipate that his EF may recover as the patient recovers overall and repeat echo may be considered in the future.
Once coumadin was restarted, the patient's stool became guaiac positive and required 2 units total of pRBC's (given on different days) to maintain Hct > 21.
His hematocrit was subsequently stable and he has no sign of active bleeding.
# DM2: Blood sugars were initially poorly controlled in the setting of sepsis and suspected PNA.
He was given vitamin K. Coumadin was  restarted on callout to the floor from the ICU, however his INR was elevated after 5mg dosing.
His coumadin is now being held for drifting down of INR and should be restarted at 1mg po qday once his INR is <2.5.
His goal INR is [**2-18**] and this should be checked in three days and eevery three days until stable.
Continued lamivudine, which was initially dosed for renal failure and now with improved creatinine is at regular dose.
Ferrous Sulfate 300 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily).
Outpatient Lab Work pls check INR monday [**6-12**] and every 2-3 days thereafter; pls restart coumadin 1mg when INR<2.5.
goal INR [**2-18**] 17.
