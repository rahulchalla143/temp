He was admitted to the intensive care unit at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Past Medical History: Stage III chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 2.1) Cystinuria with a history of heavy stone burden (on longstanding penicillamine until 3 yrs ago) Cutis laxa secondary to penicillamine [**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (thought to be secondary to penicillamine) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF) Pulmonary hypertension Atrial flutter s/p AV node ablation (with postprocedure complete heart block requiring pacemaker placement) Pancreatic low grade, benign mucinous cystic neoplasm (LGBMC) Large bilateral renal cysts Small AAA Popliteal aneurysm hyperuricosuria restless leg syndrome GERD  Social History: Works as a software engineer.
CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g Lungs - Decreased BS bilat w/ mild rales throughout lung fields  Abd - soft, NT/ND.
Ext - no LE edema b/l  Pertinent Results: CXR - [**2198-1-7**]: There is a new airspace consolidation involving the left lung (mostly upper) consistent with pneumonia.
CXR - [**2198-1-9**]:  A new airspace opacity has developed in the right lower lobe since the prior day.
Note is made of fullness of the right renal collecting system, similar to CT from [**2197-5-26**].
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 58 yo man with PMH significant for a h/o HTN, diastolic CHF, pulm HTN who initially presented from [**Hospital3 3765**] in respiratory distress w/ evidence of pneumonia on CXR along w/ pulm edema.
On admission, it was felt his shortness of breath was most likely due to pneumonia seen on CXR along w/ component of CHF especially given response to nitro gtt and Lasix while at [**Hospital3 **].
His ambulatory saturation did hover around 88-90% so he was sent home with portable oxygen until he is fully recovered from his pneumonia.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient had an elevated Cr to 3.4 from baseline 2.1 which was likely due to infection.
His creatinine improved to his baseline.
Oxygen Continuous oxygen at 2L NC to keep oxygen saturation levels greater than 92% 19.
You required additional oxygen to help keep the levels of oxygen in your blood at adequate levels.
