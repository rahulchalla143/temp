Prior to her admission on [**2167-11-27**], her O2 saturation dropped from the low-90s which is her baseline, down to 78 to 80% at home with a heart rate in the 130s to 140s.
of 99.8 F.; blood pressure 123/70; heart rate 130 to 140; respirations 30; 02 saturation 80% on room air, up to 95% on four to five liters.
Arterial blood gas was initially 7.23, 98, 117, 100% non-rebreather mask; 7.25, 95, 58, on 5 liters nasal cannula, to 7.25, 99, 75, on Bi-PAP, then to 7.26, 96, 72, on C-PAP.
Her O2 saturation on nasal cannula of four to five liters was as low as 90%.
Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure; the patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix, for a total of nine liters negative while in the Cardiac Care Unit.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction,     echocardiogram in [**2166**] very limited, ejection fraction     was 67% on stress test in [**2164**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9 F.; pulse 85 to 112; blood pressure 93/60; respirations 23; O2 saturation 90% on five liters nasal cannula, 95% on non-rebreather face mask.
Unable to assess jugular venous pressure secondary to morbid obesity.
INR 2.8.
Sodium 143, chloride 93, potassium 4.4, bicarbonate 41, BUN 12, creatinine 0.4.
Chest x-ray unchanged from previous studies, shows congestive heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions.
Her O2 saturations improved to 93 to 97% on 2 liters via nasal cannula.
An attempt to continue Bi-PAP at night was tried, however, the patient's O2 saturations dropped to the high 80s on bi-PAP.
Her rate was still poorly controlled.
The patient refused cardiac catheterization since she is unable to lie flat.
The patient was continued on Statin and aspirin.Repeat TTE was done that showed decraesd EF of 35-40% and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
