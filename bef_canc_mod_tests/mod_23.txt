slow VT, rate 80 (AIVR) .
[**6-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-14**] and 22: Intraaortic balloon pump has been removed.
Lung volumes remain low with persistent atelectasis at the right base, but insufficient abnormality in the lungs to explain respiratory failure.
[**6-19**] CT head IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage .
[**6-22**] Ct Abd Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Aortic root aortography showed markedly dilated aortic root.
Hemodynamic assessment reaveled a depressed Cardiac Index 1.7-1.9 and PCWP of 35 (with large V-waves).
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, 6.
Successful diastolic augmentation of blood pressure was achieved.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2133-6-22**] and portable abdomen [**2133-6-22**].
Per CT [**Doctor First Name **], was determined not to be a CABG candidate due to poor touchdowns and severe R sided lesions.
An IABP was in place (1:1) with hep gtt after cath.
The balloon was subsequently removed and we titrated up inotropes/pressors to MAP > 60, CI > 2 A PCWP > 40 determined that he needed aggressive diuresis which he underwent via PD with renal service following.
QTc was monitored in setting of Haldol administration, and was consistently in normal range.
ESRD on PD x several years -- volume o/l by elev PCWP on admission, s/p fluid removal by PD for several days, now euvolemic on exam with even volume exchanges.
Groin hematoma- Pt had rapidly expanding groin hematoma of his right groin in setting of heparin s/p cath.
He had a HCT drop in setting of bleed.
Peripheral pulses were still dopplerable (baseline) throughout.
CT head [**6-19**] ruled out bleed/new process but did show old lacunar infarct.
Pain may have been due to hematoma from subcutaneous heparin, which was d/c'ed prior to d/c, as patient was ambulating well CT Abdomen ruled out bleed, or other pathology that could explain his symptoms.
Peritoneal fluid analysis from [**6-22**] showed gram positive cocci in pairs, not yet speciated.
His cell count from his peritoneal fluid was low, with a very low number of PMNS.
A plain film of the abdomen on [**6-24**] demonstrates a small amount of intra-abdominal free air, which is likely secondary to a PD cath that was uncapped for too long.
Repeat analysis of peritoneal fluid showed on 33 WBC, 14% PMNs.
HCT remained stable.
