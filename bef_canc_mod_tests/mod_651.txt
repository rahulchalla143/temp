The patient was taken to the MRI scanner which revealed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and right middle cerebral artery with an evolving right frontoparietal temporal stroke.
He was taken then to the neurological surgical intensive care unit and placed on Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Showed a temperature of 98, blood pressure 91/46, heart rate 129, respiratory rate 25, O2 sat 99% on mechanical ventilation.

His left pupil was 10-mm and nonreactive.
He was emergently given 50 grams of mannitol for presumed cerebral herniation, and his respiratory rate on the ventilator was increased to decrease his PCO2.
He was taken immediately to head CT which showed diffuse edema of the right hemisphere, as well as the occipital lobe.
His serum sodium and osmolality was followed closely.
His blood pressure started to drop which was maintained with phenylephrine.
