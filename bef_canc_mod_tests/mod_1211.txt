Routine labs drawn and patient was found to have worsening creatinine, metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis.
Urine microscopy showed muddy brown casts.
Patient was requested to go to ED for further managment.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Laboratory data significant for creatinine 9.8 -> 9.3 (baseline 3.8), potassium 6.6 -> 5.0, WBC 21.0 -> 18.3, hematocrit 31.4 -> 25.0, lactate 1.9.
Blood and urine cultures sent.
EKG reportedly with no acute changes.
CXR 2V reportedly with no acute changes.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast (reportedly performed to rule out urinary obstruction) remarkable for bilateral pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and no evidence of obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 67900**] is an 84 yoF with history of hepatic adenocarcinoma s/p resection and CKD (baseline creatinine 1.7-1.8) who was admitted for acute on chronic kidney failure.
Routine labs drawn and patient was found to have worsening creatinine, metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis.
Urine microscopy showed muddy brown casts.
Patient was requested to go to ED for further managment.
When Ms. [**Known lastname 67900**] was admitted, she had a Cr of 9.3.
