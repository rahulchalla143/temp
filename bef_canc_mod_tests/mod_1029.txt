A CT revealed a SMA stenosis with concerns for acute mesenteric ischemia given the patients hypotension requiring a vasopressor.
Post operatively his exam was notable for a palpable femoral pulse and a strong dopplerable left PT signal.
His neuro exam remained intact and these were discontinued when he was extubated.
He underwent a bronchoscopy where copious secretions were encountered and suctioned.
His post-bronch CXR showed improved aeration of his lungs.
His did require transfusion of 3 units of PRBC in the early post-operative period, but his hematocrit has remained stable since transfusion.
Endocrine: His blood sugars have been well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
On POD zero there were concerns for pneumonia based on CXR and bronchoscopy so double coverage was started for his history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.
All of his culture date returned negative so his antibiotics were discontinued one at a time.
