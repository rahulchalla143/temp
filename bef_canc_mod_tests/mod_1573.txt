The patient was noted to be hypothermic to 94.3 F, hypotensive in the Emergency Department with a blood pressure of 94/40.
Patient received approximately 2 liters of normal saline in the ED, 1 liter of Lactated Ringers and 1 liter of D5 with bicarbonate.
CT of the abdomen was remarkable for 4.5 x 2.3 cm Staghorn calculus in the right renal collecting system.
Chest x-ray was unrevealing.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine varying between [**2-22**].
PHYSICAL EXAM FROM ADMISSION:  Temperature 94.3, heart rate 60, blood pressure 94/40, respiratory rate 12, and 96% on room air.
Cardiac examination unremarkable.
Lung exam normal.
Abdominal examination normal.
LABORATORY STUDIES FROM ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 30.8, platelets 230.
INR 2.4.
Sodium 131, BUN 157, creatinine 3.5, bicarbonate 13, calcium 7, phosphorus 12.7, anion gap 19, calcium/phosphorus product 88.9.
Urinalysis notable for moderate blood, 500 protein, negative nitrites, glucose and ketones, small leukocyte esterase.
ABG:  pH 7.12, pCO2 40, pO2 114, lactate 0.6.
CT of the pelvis:  4.5 x 2.3 cm Staghorn calculus in right renal collecting system, no hydronephrosis.
Renal ultrasound from the [**11-4**]:  Right kidney measuring 9.8 cm, left kidney 12.9 cm, multiple cysts in the right kidney one with septations.
Previous EKG A-V paced with fusion beats.
The patient's creatinine and BUN improved dramatically post IV fluid hydration likely secondary to prerenal azotemia versus ATN.
Cultures were negative.
Pump:  Repeat echocardiogram was unchanged.
Patient's INR was therapeutic.
Her hematocrit responded appropriately, and patient was maintained on a proton-pump inhibitor.
