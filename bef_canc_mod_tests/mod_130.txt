A bedside shock u/s did not demonstrate a pericardial effusion but showed global hypokinesis, and a large right sided pleural effusion.
A CT torso demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions R>>L with associated atelectasis and cardiomegaly, but no intraabdominal pathology on wet read.
EKG was notable for low voltage afib with bradycardia but no ischemic changes compared to prior.
BNP was 3200 (which is in the middle of recent values).
An ABG was notable for a respiratory acidosis and he was intubated with etom and rocuronium for airway protection and increased minute ventilation.
Urine output was poor throughout ED stay.
Upon transfer, HR 66, BP 113/64 on levophed 0.12mcg, satting 100% on A/C 500x14 peep 5 and FiO2 1.0. .
Hct did drop at that time to 21 with reports of melena.
EGD was normal w/o AVMs seen.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-2**], the left ventricular systolic function is better.
Lower Extrem U/S - IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

Lower extremity ultrasounds ruled out DVT.
Additionally, after his empiric 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn, the patient developed a leukocytosis and was started on zosyn, which was switched to meropenem when sputum cultures grew out klebsiella.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - The patient had chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.0-2.5.
Dobutamine was given in an attempt to increase cardiac output and renal blood flow but was stopped as explained above.
Echo results showed improvement in systolic function but were indicative of a restrictive cardiomyopathy.
?s hematocrit was 27-28 on admission.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was sedated and on a ventilator, making assessment of his mental status difficult.
Blood sugars have been controlled on sliding scale with 30units glargine qhs.
This effusion was monitored through serial chest x-rays with some resolution following volume removal.
?s urine cultures consistently grew yeast throughout his hospitalization.
