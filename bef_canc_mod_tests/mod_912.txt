Patient was in her USOH until 2 week PTA when developed sub-sternal chest pressure w/ radiation down both arms while raking leaves.
At that time she was r/o for MI with negative cardiac enzymes and underwent stress ECHO that was negative after going 7 minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, achieving 91% of maximum HR.
Found to have EKG with ST elevations in inferior leads with reciprical ST depressions in aVL, V1-V2.
R sided EKG demonstrated ST elevations in V4, indicating RV involvment.
Also received benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid prior to cardiac cath given hx of dye allergy.
In cath lab, patient found to have lesion in RCA extending into PDA and PL - patient had 1 x stent placed in RCA-to-PDA, jailing the PL, which was then rescued with balloon angioplasty (TIMI 3 flow demonstrated).
Also noted to have 50% LAD lesion after D1, 70% L Cx lesion, 40% proximal RCA lesion.
Hemodynamics were noted to be CO 3.48, CI 2.02, PCWP 20, RA mean 15, PAP 46/22, RV 46/8.
Also had hypotension with SBP = 90's intra-cath, given fluid boluses for total of 1.8L in cath (2.8L total with 1L fluid bolus in ED).
Post cath pt noted to have small groin hematoma.
Post cath EKG notable for resolution of ST elevations, q waves in leads III and aVF.

CXR ([**4-8**]): Prominence of bilateral vasculature, which may represent early volume overload versus mild CHF.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided pressures (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg, mean PCWP 20mmHg).
The cardiac index was normal at 2.02 L/min/m2.
TTE ([**4-10**]): 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Pump:  Patient with EF=65%, no wall motion abnormalities noted on stress ECHO done at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2102-4-4**].
Intra cath hemodynamics consistent with mild fluid overload, with PCWP=20, RA=15, PAP=46/22.
TTE on [**4-10**] with EF 70-75%, no wall montion abnormality, 1+ MR, and borderline PA systolic hypertension.
Euvolemic on exam upon discharge.
