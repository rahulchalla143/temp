He was volume resuscitated with adequately controlled blood pressures not requiring additional fluids.
Blood cultures grew back GNR and urine cultures grew E.coli.
Blood cultures remained negative since [**3-24**] and WBC trended down.
Of note, C.diff was negative x 2 while here.
Cultures grew pansensitive E.coli so he was switched from cefepime to PO cipro (and continued on PO vancomycin).
EKG not consistent with ACS, chest pain and elevated troponin presumed due to demand ischemia (CK peaked [**3-24**]).
#Metabolic Acidosis- Improved; occured in setting of elevated lactate from sepsis/bacteremia; Patient received IV fluids (NS) while here.
Pt did present with worsening diarrhea prior to admission; initially received treatment dose of flagyl/vanc and, after urine culture returned, he resumed suppressive doses of vancomycin which he will continue indefinitely.
Medications on Admission: aspirin 81 mg daily nigtroglycerin SR 2.5 mg metoprolol 25mg q24 sertraline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] vanco 125 [**Hospital1 **] folic acid 400mg avicor 20mg [**Hospital1 **] multivitamin  Discharge Medications: 1.
You were treated with antibiotics, and your heart rhythm was cardioverted.
