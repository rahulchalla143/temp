Again underlying pneumonia in the lung bases cannot be completely excluded and evaluation after appropriate diuresis could be performed if pneumonia remains a clinical concern.
Hypertensive urgency was treated as follows with nitro and labetalol gtt which were quickly weaned as blood pressures dropped below SBP 120.
She evenutally became hypotensive to SBP of 90 which resolved on its own.
