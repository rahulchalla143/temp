Admission Date:  [**2142-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-5-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: I&D of R anterior leg hematoma Transesophageal echocardiogram  History of Present Illness: 82 year-old woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, complaining of increasing fatigue over the last 10 days.
She had a normal EF of 70% on [**3-8**] TTE, with moderate AS (peak gradient 61, mean gradient 32, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.1-1.2cm2), 2+ MR. She had a PPM placed in the mid-[**2125**] for HOCM, originally a Thera 7960 dual chamber PPM, that was changed to a [**Company 1543**] SDR303 in [**8-6**].
Blood pressure was 86/60mmHg left arm standing.
Pulse was 110 and irregularly irregular.
ECG demonstrated new AFib with rate 120, with evidence of LVH with extensive ST-T changes c/w left heart strain.
During a recent admission at [**Hospital1 498**]-[**Hospital1 107**], a KUB, CT and mesenteric dopplers were unremarkable.
She has never had a colonoscopy, and was recommended to have a colonoscopy done in the near future.
JVP 8cm Chest: CTAB, no w/r/r Abd: Diffusely mildly tender throughout, nondistended, +BS throughout, no HSM Extr: 2+ LE edema bilaterally Neuro: A&Ox3, no focal deficits   Pertinent Results: Admission CXR: The heart size is slightly increased.
TEE Report: GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Pulmonary pressures could not be assessed.
CT RLE: FINDINGS: There is a large hematoma involving the anterior and lateral aspect of the right lower extremity.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-12-22**], the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation and global left ventricular systolic function is now depressed.
Arterial Dopplers: The exam was limited.
Doppler interrogation of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries bilaterally demonstrated monophasic waveform.
Head CT: FINDINGS: The study is slightly limited by the fact that the patient is obliqued in the scanner.

2) Pump: Evidence of some volume overload on initial exam and CXR, most likely [**1-4**] diastolic dysfunction in context of new AF, tachycardia, and loss of atrial kick.
Coumadin was held prior to discharge for supratherapeutic INR (4.7 on AM of discharge).
INR should be checked every day, and coumadin restarted at 2mg PO qHS once INR falls below 3.5.
Goal INR [**1-5**].
Per OSH records, recent KUB, CT abdomen, and mesenteric doppler U/S were unrevealing.
A head CT was obtained, which demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage.
You should keep your leg elevated at all times.
They will examine your leg and decide if any further surgery needs to be done to promote healing of the affected area.
