Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: This is a 59 year-old male with a history of CAD, seizure disorder, remote PE off of anticoagulation, peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease with left BKA, Interstitial lung disease NOS with radiographic evidence of emphysema and is on 2L Home O2, who presents with fall with resultant head injury and loss-of-consciousness, followed by chest discomfort upon regaining consciousness.
He was found to have acute renal failure, creatinine 0.9=>3.6 and was given 2 litres of normal saline.
Given the head trauma, CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology.
VQ scan was performed given history of PE and inability to perform CTA due to renal insufficiency.
Given elevation of troponin and Creatinine Kinase, outpatient cardiology coverage for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16801**] was notified and advised against initiating heparin at this time given marked impairment in renal function making troponin unreliable, and small MB index despite large CK elevation, suggesting against cardiac aetiology of biomarker elevation.
SBP improved to 110-140 after 2 L NS.
Cath [**8-20**] showed LSFA stents were totally occluded with collaterals supplying the distal extremity via the LPFA which was diffusely diseased, s/p successful PTCA and rheolytic thrombectomy of the left popliteal and s/p successful stenting of the proximal left peroneal artery with a 3.5 x 23 mm cypher DES in [**9-18**], s/p successful stenting of the [**Female First Name (un) 7195**] with a 9.0 x 38 mm Dynalink self-expanding stent post-dilated with a 8.0 mm balloon.

MICRO: Blood Culture ([**4-11**]): No Growth x2 .
CXR Portable ([**2128-4-11**]):  IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT ([**2128-4-11**]):  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
EEG ([**4-12**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background admixed with bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing.
TTE ([**4-12**]): The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Bubble study could not be interpreted due to poor windows.
LV systolic function appears grossly normal.
MRI Head/MRA Brain ([**4-12**]): 1.
Multiple periventricular FLAIR hyperintensities, for which the differential diagnosis is broad.
Renal Ultrasound ([**4-12**]): 1.
CT Left Lower Extremity ([**4-12**]):IMPRESSION: 1.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**4-13**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
Arterial bypass angiography revealed 100% occluded SVG->R-PDA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated and equalized right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP, mean PCWP, and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was moderately elevated.
Cardiac index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation and LVEF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis.
CTA Chest ([**4-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE ([**4-16**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is grossly normal (LVEF 60%).
An atrial septal defect (or any intracardiac or extracardiac shunt) cannot be excluded on the basis of this study due to the technically suboptimal nature of the images.
A transesophageal echocardiogram is recommended if exclusion of a shunt is required.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology, MRI/MRA Head showed no evidence of acute infarct but did show multiple periventricular FLAIR hyperintensities, for which the differential diagnosis is broad (no cause, small vessel infarction, demyelinating disease, infection including Lyme disease, and occasionally seen in patients with migraine headaches).
EEG was negative for seizure activity, but did show slow and disorganized background admixed with bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures (Ddx: medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection).
TTE attempted twice, but quality was suboptimal: bubble study could not be interpreted due to poor windows, LV systolic function appears grossly normal (LVEF >55%), RV is dilated and hypokinetic, no significant valvular abnormality seen.
# Hypotension: The patient had a blood pressure of 79/48 on admission, which improved to SBP 110-140 after 2L NS in the ED.
His WBC ranged 5.4-10.4, and his blood cultures showed no growth.
TTE [**2128-4-12**] did not show evidence of systolic or diastolic heart failure, LVEF >55%.
Cardiac Catheterization showed possible restrictive/constrictive physiology.
He has a history of asbestos exposure and a history of possible interstitial lung disease, however there was no evidence of interstitial lung disease on Chest CT [**10-22**].
V/Q scan on admission was indeterminate/intermediate probability for PE.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 51, mean PCWP 20), possible restrictive/constrictive physiology.
TTE showed TR gradient elevated to 42 mm Hg.
CTA Chest on [**2128-4-15**] showed no pulmonary embolism, left lower lobe pneumonia, mild pulmonary edema, and spiculated nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, with interval growth.
He was continued on supplemental O2 for a goal SaO2 88-93% due to CO2 retention if higher than 93%.
He was scheduled for a repeat Chest CT in 1 month to evaluate the spiculated nodule.
His CK peaked at 1427, troponin peaked at 3.41 on [**4-11**].
The patient had a cardiac catheterization on [**2128-4-13**] which showed patent prior LAD stent, mild restenosis of OM1 stent, and 100% occluded SVG->R-PDA and RCA.
He had a bump in troponin from 1.85->2.14 after the catherization but his CK remained normal (69-84).
His FeUrea was 14%, and this was thought to be prerenal renal failure with a likely component of contrast nephropathy.
His initial CK was up to 1427, and he may have also had component of rhabdomyolysis.
Renal ultrasound showed no renal mass lesion or hydronephrosis.
Left knee films showed little change in the below-the-knee amputation with patchy demineralization about the knee.
CT of the LLE showed diffuse osteopenia status post below-the-knee amputation, no displaced fracture, mild patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritic change, and small joint effusion.
# Transaminitis: The patient presented with transaminitis, and peak enzymes were ALT 2888, AST 4099, LDH 3344.
A Hepatitis panel was negative for A, B, C.  His LFTs were trending down at the time of discharge.
# Seizure disorder: The patient had an EEG which showed no clearly epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
# Hypothyroidism: His TFTs showed TSH 0.024 (low), Free T4 1.7, T3 61 (low).
He was instructed to have his TFTs rechecked in 1 month.

We are holding your Atorvastatin, because your liver enzymes were elevated on admission.
You should have your liver enzymes rechecked as an outpatient, and then consider restarted your Atorvastatin.
You should have your thyroid function tests rechecked in 4 weeks on this new dose.
You have a repeat X-ray of your Left Femur on [**2128-5-6**] at 12:00 in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building, [**Location (un) 551**].
You have a follow up CT Chest on [**2128-5-12**] at 1:00 in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1824**] at 1:00.
