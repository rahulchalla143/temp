You were eventually restarted on some of your blood pressure medications, however it was thought that you were on too many resulting in dehydration and low blood pressure that caused your initial problems.
Also, you are to continue wearing your multipodus boots (which off-load both heels, and malleoli to prevent a pressure ulcer).
