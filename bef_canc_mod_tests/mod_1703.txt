However, he presented to the ED on [**2137-5-1**] with hematuria and was found to have INR of 9 so coumadin was stopped by his PCP.
RUQ ultrasound showed moderate ascites, enlarged spleen (15.6cm), splenorenal shunt, consistent with portal hypertension; no ultrasonographic evidence of cirrosis.
EGD was performed which showed a Dieulafoy lesion in the fundus which was cauterized, blood in stomach, esophagitis.
Serial hematocrits remained stable (29-30).
Alpha feto protein was normal at 2.3.
Admission CXR without evidence of CHF.
Echocardiogram on [**6-21**] showed EF 45-50%, pulmonary hypertension, [**1-6**]+ MR, 3+ TR, dilated RV with systolic/diastolic dysfunction c/w RV overload.

Radiology: -CXR: decreased right pleural effusion, no clear evidence of CHF, no PTX or infiltrate.
-Abdominal ultrasound IMPRESSION: 1.
Echocardiogram: Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.

# Hematemesis: Etiology secondary to Dieulafoy lesion seen on EGD [**2137-6-21**].
Given FFP x1 and Vit K without significant improvement in INR .
Ascites fluid was negative for SBP, SAAG 0.8 (not portal hypertension).
# CHF: Pt was in decompensated right heart failure at admission by exam & labs.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 45-50% (likely less than this, given severe valvular abnl).
