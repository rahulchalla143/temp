CT scan of the abdomen at that time showed a dilated [**Year (4 digits) 499**] and no other pathology.
The patient underwent rigid colonoscopy in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit which relieved the dilatation and allowed the patient to pass stool in there.
Initial blood and urine cultures were positive for E. coli in the urine and the patient was subsequently treated with Levaquin while on the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for urosepsis.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which showed patent airways, scant foamy secretions bilaterally.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction; ejection fraction of approximately between 45 and 50 percent with a negative bubble study in [**2134-4-23**], to evaluate for cause of hypoxia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.6 F.; blood pressure was 112/76; pulse was 56; respiratory rate was 24; O2 saturation was 94% on four liters nasal cannula.
Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat:  Mucous membranes were dry.
Chest examination showed decreased breath sounds at the left base, clear on the right.
The rest of the neurological examination was grossly non-focal.
LABORATORY:  Values on transfer from the Intensive Care Unit, the white blood cell count was 14.2, hematocrit was 30.1, platelets were 198.
Sodium was 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 98, bicarbonate 34, BUN 24, creatinine 0.6, blood sugar was 251.
Calcium 7.6, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus was 2.5.
TSH was 0.4  Portable imaging:  The patient had a portable abdominal film which showed that they could not evaluate for placement of the nasogastric tube but there was a dilated sigmoid [**Hospital 499**].
The patient was subsequently diuresed and they decided to initially hold off on a CT scan of the chest to further evaluate for any cause of hypoxia.
The patient already had an echocardiogram with bubble study to evaluate for left-to-right shunt for his hypoxia.
Chest CT scan was performed while the patient was on the Floor.
Chest CT scan showed a new small left pleural effusion with adjacent left lower lobe and lingular opacity which may reflect pneumonia or atelectasis, dependent atelectasis within the left upper lobe, a heterogeneously appearing thyroid gland with multiple low attenuation foci probably due to goiter, stable appearing cystic lesions within the upper pole of the right kidney.
The patient's white blood cell count remained stable.
The patient was on Prednisone so it was difficult to say why the patient's white blood cell count remained slightly elevated, however, at the time of dictation, the white blood cell count went back down to normal.
three times a day, which the patient tolerated well with a slight bump in his creatinine to 0.8.
The patient had a bedside swallowing evaluation which the patient did not perform so well on.
Subsequently, the patient underwent a video swallowing evaluation which showed appropriate transport of fluid bolus and initiation of swallow.
There was an incomplete evaluation of the larynx during swallow and a small amount of penetration without aspiration of all consistency liquids and mid-swallows followed with a neck inflection did not prevent penetration.
Renal:  Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's creatinine was actually improved from what apparently was his baseline.
The patient was given a small dose of Bumex in an attempt to diurese him, however, it was not felt that the patient was particularly wet on examination and did not have much fluid to diurese with the Bumex.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   The patient's electrolytes were repleted on an as-needed basis.
At the time of dictation, INR was still pending.
