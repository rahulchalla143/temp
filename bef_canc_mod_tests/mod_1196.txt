His NH has been closely monitoring his Hct, which has been low but stable for the past several days.
He received 2 units prbcs at rehab on [**4-18**] for Hct 22, and did not have an adequate response (Hct [**4-23**] was 23.8 and [**4-25**] was 22.3 with INR 2.2).
On prior admissions, further invasive testing was discussed, and the patient and HCP opted for more conservative measures including transfusions and iron supplementation.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.0 86 95/51 14 97% RA, pain 0/10.
Labs were significant for Hct 20.5 (down from 22.3 at NH), INR 3.0.
Incontinent of urine and stool at baseline.

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH FECAL       CONTAMINATION.
CARDIAC ECHO [**2160-4-29**]: Poor image quality.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with a suggesiton of more prominent inferior hypokinesis (difficult to assess due to poor image quality).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-1-30**], no definite change.
Hemolysis not thought to be a significant factor given the Coombs test was negative and he had a normal LDH.
If his anticoagulation could be stopped they would recommend monitoring his HCT over a few months time to evaluate stability.
His HCT was 20.7 on admission and he received 2 units PRBCs in the ED and his HCT had an appropriate bump to 25 and remained stable at 25 thereafter.
GI team was aware of him, but since prior EGD/Colonoscopy has failed to reveal a source, decided conservative treatment was the best.
Capsule studies have not revealed a source, though was incomplete (in [**2159-12-3**]).
# Mechanical Aortic valve: The patient has a goal INR of [**3-6**] (ideally 2.5).
His INR was reveresed in the ICU with Vit K and he was restarted on IV heparin drip (wt based protocol without bolus) to bridge until therapeutic INR on warfarin.
A TTE was updated and showed no change from prior (see report in results section).
Urine culture [**2160-4-26**] is growing >100K organisms with a predominant GNR, not yet speciated with sensitivities.
This needs to be followed by [**Hospital 100**] Rehab by calling [**Hospital1 18**] Micro Lab [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4645**] for results.
# CKD: On admission his creatinine was at his baseline (1.2-1.5).
Creatinine varied 1.0 to 1.4 during hosptialization.
11. heparin (porcine) in NS 10 unit/mL Kit Sig: wt based units Intravenous continuous: until therapeutic INR 2.2.
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
