Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture on [**8-22**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] is a 73 yo male with a complicated past medical history, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-8**] following a prolonged admission for STEMI, respiratory failure felt secondary to pulmonary edema requiring intubation and subsequent tracheostomy [**2-28**] failure to wean, sepsis and C.difficile colitis treated with Vancomycin and Flagyl with a course of Levophed.
At OSH, sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and MRSA, and he was restarted on Zosyn ([**8-14**]) and Vancomycin ([**8-15**]).
Vitals [**Last Name (Titles) 4351**] HR 88-98, BP 150/80.
ABG done on FiO2 100% 7.36/66/417/98%.
At [**Hospital1 **], BP dropped to 90, and patient was started on NS IVF, with improvement in BP.
EKG without acute changes.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management on AC, RR 15, PEEP 5, Vt 500, Fi02 1.0.
In ED, BP 80/60, HR 80.
Continued on IVF (received total 2300cc), with improved BP to SBP 105-118.
Stool sent for C.diff and given Flagyl 500 mg PO X 1 dose.
CHF with EF 25% on last echo on [**2159-7-25**] 7.
BPH 8.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on admission: VITALS: BP 90s-118/47-59, HR 80-90s.
Vent: AC, RR 15, PEEP 5, Vt 500cc, FiO2 1.0.
Withdraws to painful stimulus.

EKG in ED: Afib, occasional V-paced, rate 83 bpm.
LVEF 25%.
Resting WMA include mid to distal septal akinesis, apical akinesis, inferior akinesis/hypokinesis, and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
[**2159-8-22**] CT head: New rounded low-density area measuring 2.5 cm in left basal ganglia, which partially extends to the left thalamus, probably representing subacute infarction.
On this head CT without contrast, the evaluation is limited.
Overall LVEF is difficult to assess due to poor echo windows although the basal LV appeas hyperdynamic without regional contraction abnormality (suspect significant improvement compared to prior study dated [**2159-7-24**]).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (due to poor echo windows cannot fully exclude).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade  [**2159-8-23**] EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage suppression over the left hemisphere and due to the bursts of generalized slowing and right hemisphere slowing.

He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT, MRI, LP, and EEG.
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct, likely cardioembolic.
CHF with EF 25% on last echo on [**2159-7-25**] 7.
BPH 8.
