Micro: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-10-1**]):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN       AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
[**2139-10-8**] 10:09 pm SPUTUM      Source: Expectorated.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2139-10-12**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-9-30**] 10:18 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Stable, moderate pulmonary edema.
ECHO [**9-30**]: Suboptimal image quality.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably preserved (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
If clinically indicated, a repeat study with contrast (Definity) may aid in regional LV systolic function determination.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-10-7**] 11:52 PM IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-30**] through earlier in the day: Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion have worsened today consistent with cardiac decompensation though moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged and there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-10-7**] 1:52 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is little change.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-10-8**] 8:21 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is not possible on this noncontrast study, and if clincally indicated, VQ scan would be helpful for further evaluation.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-10-8**] 11:00 AM Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed.
The patient head overlie the lung apices, thus evaluation of pneumothorax cannot be obtained precisely, although no evidence of large pneumothorax is present.
Repeated radiograph with improved technique is highly recommended.
Her oxygen saturation recovered, but she was transferred to the MICU given her tenuous respiratory status.
Because of the acuity of patient's respiratory compromise, PE was also suspected.
CTA was considered but given patient's renal function, this was deferred.
Subsequent bilateral LENIs were negative, and CT w/o contrast demonstrated extensive LUL and LLL infiltrate.
Follow-up sputum Gram stain demonstrated Gram-positive rods and cocci, as well as Gram-negative rods.
Because little fluid was removed via HD ultrafiltration, chronic diastolic dysfunction was considered to be a less likely contributor.
Further ultrafiltration was unable to be performed given low blood pressures.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative, and repeat EKGs showed no significant change.
Her insulin regimen was titrated for blood sugar control, though her glycemic control proved difficult.
An ultrasound showed a fluid collection, but aspiration of the lesion was unsuccessful.
Medications on Admission: Furosemide 120mg daily (from 120mg TID prior to last hospitalization) Spironolactone 25mg daily Metoprolol 100mg TID [**Known lastname **] 325mg daily Simvastatin 20mg daily Prednisone 25mg daily Omeprazole 20mg daily Insulin (NPH 40 [**Hospital1 **]), Humalog sliding scale Iron Caltrate Vicodin PRN  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ventricular fibrillation from respiratory failure .
