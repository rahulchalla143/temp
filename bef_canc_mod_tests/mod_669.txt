IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed first degree AV block.
CT scan of the chest showed type B dissection extending into the right femoral vessels.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure on exam on the right was 160/60, on the left 107/55.
White count 10.2, hematocrit 35.2, platelet count 194,000.
PLAN:  The plan was to get a TEE and see if this was normal, then no MRI, but if it was abnormal, then get an MRI and MRA of the chest.
His CT started at the left subclavian artery and continued down to his iliac bifurcation into the right iliac artery.
All recommendations and analysis of the scans were the same with a type B dissection requiring tight medical management.
His blood pressure was 100/44 on an Esmolol drip and a Nipride drip.
He also had maintained his peripheral positive dorsalis pedis and femoral pulses bilaterally.
His hematocrit was stable.
His blood pressure was 80/50 in his left arm.
On house-day 2, he was weaned off all of his intravenous drips.
Blood pressure was controlled through oral medications with beta-blocker.
He went for his MRA and was transferred up to the floor.
His blood pressure increased that afternoon to 130 systolic.
At the time, his blood pressure dropped to 70.
Hydralazine and an additional order was given if the blood pressure rose to greater than 160; his pressure at the time was 147/70.
Later that evening he had a single episode of supraventricular tachycardia with his heart rate to 130s.
His blood pressure remained stable to 100/70.
The rhythm broke and came down to 80s in sinus rhythm.
Heart rate broke and dropped down to the 80s again.
Over the next couple of days, his blood pressure continued to be monitored tightly, as well as his rhythm issues.
On house-day 5, his white count was 6, hematocrit 30, potassium 4.0, BUN 23, creatinine 0.9.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
The patient's blood pressure rose slight to 125/50 on house-day 5.
On house-day 6, the patient continued to have elevations in his blood pressure to 162/80.
On house-day 8, his blood pressure was 140/78 despite Norvasc, Lopressor, Losartan, and Labetalol.
It was then determined by the team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that most likely this systolic blood pressure 120/40 was his baseline and was reasonable control given his age.
On postoperative day 8, his blood pressure continued  to climb to 182/90 and remained in sinus rhythm at 72.
His oxygen saturation was 91 percent on room air.
He continued to have significant issues with blood pressure control.
The patient continued to have good urine output and otherwise was doing well, other than mild depression over his lack of blood pressure control and having to remain hospitalized.
The patient's blood pressure dropped on the morning of [**1-25**] after his Labetalol dose to the 70s to 80s systolic range.
The patient complained of dizziness but was much better at the time of exam with a blood pressure of 105 where he remained in sinus rhythm.
His creatinine remained stable at 1.0.
His Labetalol was decreased to 400 mg three times a day with plans to increase his Toprol as needed.
He was also encouraged to use his incentive spirometer and cough and deep breath, given his limited ability to ambulate at the time of blood pressure issues.
He was seen again by Vascular Surgery on consult with plans to try and discharge him if possible if his blood pressure settled out.
On postoperative day 10, he did have much better blood pressure control with decreased Labetalol with a blood pressure of 126/79.
He was also given clearance for discharge home by Vascular Surgery attending and to have repeat imaging with either CT Surgery or Vascular Surgery in approximately [**4-16**] mos to follow his dissection.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was told to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16004**], his primary care physician, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**], on Monday, [**1-30**], four days postdischarge at 11 a.m.
