The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on [**7-11**] that showed left main disease with a patent right coronary artery stent a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex; both patent.
Severe mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 67%.
His echocardiogram done on [**7-6**] showed right ventricular enlargement with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Status post bone marrow biopsy to diagnose pancytopenia in [**2113-7-13**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination prior to admission revealed height was 5 feet 10 inches, weight was 185 pounds, heart rate was 85 and irregular, blood pressure was 106/62, respiratory rate was 24.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light with extraocular movements intact.
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ on the right and 1+ on the left.
Posterior tibialis pulses were not palpated.
Radial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in atrial fibrillation at a rate of 100 with a central venous pressure of 13, a mean arterial pressure was 67.
The patient did tolerate ventilatory wean to a pressure support of 5 and 5 during the day, resting at night, with increased amounts of pressure support (up to 15) or intermittent mandatory volumes with a rate of 8 to 10 breaths per minute.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  A review of the patient's physical examination at this time is as follows;  temperature was 99.8, heart rate was 100 in atrial fibrillation, blood pressure was 129/50, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation was 100% (that was with pressure support of 10, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and 40% FIO2).
His tidal volume with those settings was a tidal volume of between 450 and 500, and his respiratory ranges 20 to 25.
Cardiovascularly, he had a heart rate from 80 to 100, in atrial fibrillation.
He remained on CPAP 40%, 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure, 10 of pressure support, oxygen saturations were 96% to 100%.
Endocrine wise, the patient was receiving sliding-scale insulin to cover blood sugars of greater than 150.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's laboratories on discharge were white blood cell count of 15, hematocrit was 25, platelets were 240.
PT was 16, INR was 1.8.
Sodium was 149, potassium was 4.7, chloride was 115, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 48, creatinine was 1, blood glucose was 151.
Magnesium was 1.8, phosphate was 3, and calcium was 8.7.
Regular insulin sliding-scale; less than 150 use 0 units, 150 to 200 use 4 units, 201 to 250 use 7 units, 251 to 300 use 10 units, 301 to 351 use 13 units, greater than 350 use 16 units.
(titrate to achieve a goal INR of 2.5).
