Patient was also noted to be hypertensive and was given metoprolol 25 mg PO and 5 mg IV, but without much response from his blood pressure.
Initial EKG in the ED showed ST elevations and there was concern for STEMI.
Cardiology reviewed his EKG and read them as J point elevations, which were similar to his previous EKGs.
On transfer to the CCU, patient's vitals were T 75, BP 166/81, RR 16, O2sat 97% on 4L.

URINE CULTURE (Pending):  [**8-29**]: Baseline artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-7-21**] heart rate is faster.
CXR [**8-29**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are bibasilar hazy opacities, compatible with increased interstitial edema, atelectasis and pleural effusions.
Echo [**9-1**]: The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-4-27**], minimal aortic valve stenosis is now present.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower (but was overestimated on the prior study).
Cardiac Cath [**9-2**]: COMMENTS: 1) Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates three vessel coronary artery disease.
TTE in [**2189-4-27**] shows normal systolic function with LVEF of 55%.
His fistula for dialysis was found to be clotted so an IR fistulogram and thromectomy was attempted but failed with immediate reclotting so an IJ temporary dialysis catheter was placed with plan for tunneled catheter in 2 days.
Troponin on admission was slightly elevated at 0.06 but in setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
Ekg from [**2190-8-31**] 0800 showed marked T wave inversions in precordial leads, concerning for anteroseptal MI, different from prior EKGs.
Repeat EKG on [**2190-9-1**] showed consistent changes.
Troponin was 10.13, up from 0.06 on admission, however both CK and MB were flat.
ECHO was completed showing no wall motion abnormality and preserved LVEF.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which showed a distal lesion in his OM that was unable to be intervened upon due to the vessel being too small.
Baseline creatinine ranging from [**5-21**], creatinine of 9 on admission.
His phosphorous was climbing so the patient was started on sevelamer.
His hematocrit was stable and the patient was discharged with instructions to follow-up with Urology as an outpatient.
The IR doctors tried to restore the blood flow, but were unable to, so you received a temporary catheter through a vein in your neck and a more permanant tunnelled catheter that was placed on [**9-3**].
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed a small blockage in one of the arteries that supply the heart.
An echocardiogram showed no changes in your heart function.
Your blood pressures were running high and we adjusted your medicines.
We started the following medications: START Aspirin 325 mg daily START taking labetalol 200mg twice daily to lower your blood pressure and heart rate (this medication will be instead of metoprolol) START taking calcium and Sevelamer with meals to lower your phosphate level  We increased the following medication: INCREASE Lisinopril to 40 mg daily INCREASE Simvastatin to 40 mg daily  We stopped the following medication: STOP taking Metoprolol STOP taking ciprofloxacin as you have finished the course of the antibiotic.
