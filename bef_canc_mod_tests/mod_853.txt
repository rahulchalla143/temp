Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2190-9-13**] at 2:04:57 PM  The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-9-1**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now seen.
Based on [**2186**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 3 years.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2190-9-13**] 2:58 PM  IMPRESSION: Large bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis and mild volume.
He does have a history of ESRD and has had some frequent difficulty with blood pressure and fluid overload.
Last ECHO on [**2190-9-1**] showed LVEF>55% with otherwise preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Echo during this hospitalization was largely unchanged with trivial pericardial effusion.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions.
Creatinine was 8.3 on admission.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Patient was recently admitted the week prior to admission with NSTEMI s/p cardiac catheterization that revealed distal lesion in his OM with no intervention.
EKG on this admission similar to EKG on previous admission.
Trop T 0.93, CK 262 (trending down from Trop 7.67, CK 424 on [**9-5**]).
He was hypertensive in the ED and started on nitro drip for blood pressure control, though he did miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dose of home meds.
While you were in the hospital your blood sugars were normalized.
You were fluid overloaded so you received medications and dialysis to normalize your fluid levels with improvement of your breathing.
