The patient subsequently underwent a stress echocardiogram for evaluation of this shortness of breath.
Two years ago, the patient underwent repeat exercise stress test which was apparently "OK" according to the patient.
The patient was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and underwent an echocardiogram on [**2191-8-24**], which apparently showed mildly decreased left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%.
The patient was started on Accupril and Lasix and was referred for cardiac catheterization today as an outpatient.
On cardiac catheterization, the patient had normal coronary angiography.
On left ventriculography, the patient had severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 10% and mild mitral regurgitation.
His hemodynamics at that time included a cardiac index of 1.4, pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 40 and left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 30.
His mixed venous oxygen saturation improved from 49 to 75 without intervention.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination in the CCU, the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 109, respiratory rate 19, blood pressure 96/55 with oxygen saturation of 97% on three liters nasal cannula.
His abdominal examination was benign and his right groin arterial sheath was intact and not bleeding.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's white blood count was 10.1 with a hematocrit of 44.5 and platelets of 282,000.
Chem7 revealed sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.4, glucose 65.
He had CK and troponin from [**Hospital 21242**] Hospital which were negative.
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were within normal limits and his arterial blood gas was 7.40, 42, 86 in room air.
Electrocardiogram showed the patient to be in sinus rhythm at 110 beats per minute with left axis deviation, occasional premature ventricular contractions and low limb voltages.
His postcatheterization film was unchanged from his precatheterization film.
The patient subsequently had a troponin done at the [**Hospital1 69**] which was less than 0.3 The patient also had a PPD done which was negative.
His chest x-ray was unremarkable with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
The patient also had a workup for hemochromatosis which was negative and a serum protein electrophoresis was normal.
His TSH was within normal limits.
On [**2191-9-6**], the patient was noted to have a run of accelerated idioventricular rhythm which was again asymptomatic.
The patient continued to be diuresed with Lasix and Aldactone and underwent an echocardiogram on [**2191-9-7**].
On that study, the patient was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20% with left atrial enlargement and lipomatous hypertrophy of his interatrial septum.
His left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function were both depressed.
The patient's wife was able to pick up [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts Monitor and was instructed on its use.
At the time of discharge, the patient still had some outstanding tests pending for his workup of his cardiomyopathy including [**Location (un) **] B viruses and Enteroviruses.
