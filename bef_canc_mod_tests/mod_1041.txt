Workup here revealed that it was likely due to gallstones.
On her physical examination, she was afebrile, tachycardic at 122, pressure was 144/69, respiratory rate 20, with 98% oxygen saturation.
Her labs were significant for a white count of 19.
Her ALT and AST were normal at 33 and 34.
Her alkaline phosphatase was 128, total bilirubin was 0.4.
Her amylase and lipase were 123 and 131, respectively.
The patient defervesced slowly on NPO and TPN and further evaluation showed she had multiple pseudocysts.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2200-5-1**], for an exploratory laparotomy cystoduodenostomy and make multiple pancreatic drainages as well as G-J tube placement.
Her TPN was slowly weaned off during this time period.
CT scan was performed which showed complete resolution of her pancreatic cysts with good drainage with J-P drains and no other fluid collections that were undrained.
Her J-P drains continued to put out adequate amounts.
The right drain which was near the cystoduodenostomy site slowly decreased in output.
Her J-P drains were putting out approximately 100 cc per day both superior and inferior and consisted of pancreatic fluid.
Status post exploratory laparotomy, cystoduodenostomy, drainage of multiple other pancreatic pseudocysts, G-tube and J-tube placement.
