During the last hosptialization his dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial from diastolic CHF, COPD and pulmonary hypertension.
Repeat ambulatory sats to 85%.
ABG was 7.23/ 117 /90 /52.
He was given Levofloxacin 500mg po, prednisone 60mg and Duoneb X 1.
Labs were significant for CO2 of 5, BNP 2166 similar to recent admission.
CXR could not rule out L basilar infiltrate.
Repeat ABG 7.33/86/63/47.
h/o 0.5ppd - 1ppd x 35 years.

There was no obvious pneumonia on CXR and pt remained afebrile w/o leukocytosis.
-He will need a retitration sleep study as an outpt to further optimize and should have close follow-up with his sleep/pulm doctor [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (we have emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re this issue).
#CKD - his creatinine did rise from 1.2 on admission to 1.7 with diuresis in the ICU.
Looking back at his previous labs, his creatinine has fluctuated up in this range in the past (was 1.9 in [**2195-8-24**]), and no other cause for renal failure was identified.
# Acute on chronic respiratory failure requiring ICU stay but not intubation - MICU team felt COPD exacerbation main component and started high dose steroids, Abx, nebulized bronchodilators - no evidence of bronchospasm on my exam - am tapering steroids rapidly -D/C levofloxacin - wean O2 to maintain sats 88-92%, down to home flow of 2L/min via NC.
Check ambulatory sats - OSA likely large component - needs to wear BiPAP at night.
He did last evening and sats dropped to 93% only (good) .
-FeNa yesterday = 0.95%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia but creatinine continues to increase despite IV hydration and holding ACE-I -no evidence of urinary retention (PVR < 350) -He was seen in consultation by Nephrology on [**2195-10-12**], and they agreed with trial of IV hydration and with holding the ace-inhibitor and the diuretic.
His discharge serum creatinine was 1.7.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure -last echo in [**2195-6-24**] showed right heart failure (likely due to chronic lung disease and resulting pulmonary hypertension) but preserved LV function -no evidence of acute HF now - received torsemide inthe ICU with resulting decrease in BNP, but increase in creatinine - on the floor, we held off on further diuresis -there was no peripheral edema .
# [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]'s disease - asx, blood counts remained stable.
- trended CBC  # Code: Full (discussed with patient)  #code status: full   Medications on Admission: 1. carvedilol 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO twice a day.
2. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO BID (2 times a day).
4. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO BID (2 times a day).
