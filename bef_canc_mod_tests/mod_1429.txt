He returns from rehab today as he was noted to have stool output through his wound vac.
Of note, a possible fistula between the descending colon and the inferior portion of the fluid collection was seen on [**2169-5-5**] CT scan (prior to the open drainage procedure).
A fistulogram was obtained to further assess but did not show evidence of communication with the fistula.

CT abdomen on [**5-22**] revealed decrease in size of previously visualized bilobed perisplenic hematoma.
On [**5-30**] patient reported increased abdominal pain and CT scan was obtained.
CT demonstrated new collection of extraluminal gas and/or stool in association with marked edema involving a segment of hepatic flexure of colon, with pericolic stranding, which were worrisome for a necrotic portion of bowel or a perforation of bowel.
On [**5-31**] patient went in OR, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, complex lysis of adhesions, exploration of the right colon with drainage of mesenteric micro perforation, irrigation and drainage of the colocutaneous fistula and diverting loop ileostomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
[**6-1**]: worsening tachycardia (ST to 150-160) and hypotension, fever spike (102), given 1L fluid bolus, neo gtt restarted, repeat Hct sent (27->24), given 1 unit PRBCs; neo gtt able to be weaned [**6-2**]: Persistent tachycardia (120s) Received 500ml albumin & 1u pRBC w/o change in heart rate.
Went for B/L LE ultrasounds that were neg for DVT but noticed complex loculated fluid collections within the lower abdomen, surgery notified but do not want further workup at this time as this may be post-surgical changes.
Stool negative for C-diff.
His heart rate would intermittently spike to 140s, remaining in sinus rhythm, when ambulating, which would eventually settle back to his baseline.
The hypotension and HR returned to [**Location 213**] baseline.
Pulmonary: He was found to have a stable left-sided pleural effusion on CT scan with no evidence of loculation or pneumonia.
The patient otherwise remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially placed NPO due to his noted stool output from his left flank wound, which previously was suspicious for a fistula but was found not to be so on fistulogram during his previous hospitalization.
A colocutaneous fistula in this area was present on initial CT when he re-presented on [**2169-5-15**].
The TPN was weaned off on [**6-7**] as fistula output subsided, and patient was started on tube feeds.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
He intermittently spiked temperatures to 102F with negative urine and blood cultures.
The VRE sensitivity test came back resistant to Daptomycin and antibiotic was discontinued.
His most recent blood and stool cultures were negative prior to discharge.
Right colonoc perforation 4.
CT scan on [**5-30**] was suspicious for bowel perforation and you were taken in OR for exploratory laparotomy and diverting loop ileostomy.
*Try to maintain ostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day.
*If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, dislocation.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection; fever, redness, bad odor.
