Patient's shortness of breath continued despite this intervention so CTA chest was performed that demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
He underwent c. cath today that demonstrated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg and near equalization of diastolic pressures consistent with early tamponade physiology.
Repeat ECHO demonstrated RA pressure of 5 mmHg.

========== CYTOLOGY ==========  Pleural Fluid [**2112-5-22**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pericardial Fluid [**2112-5-23**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
ECHO [**5-23**] PRE- PERICARDIOCENTESIS Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO [**5-24**] Limited study.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-5-23**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and no right ventricular diastolic collapse is present (when compared to pre-pericardiocentesis images).
CTA [**5-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg.
There was near equalization of diastolic pressures of diastolic pressures consistent with early  tamponade physiology.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.3 l/min/m2.
The mean RA pressure fell to 5mmHg and a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated near complete resolution of the effusion.
Patient's shortness of breath continued despite this intervention so CTA chest was performed that demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
He underwent c. cath on [**2112-5-23**] that demonstrated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg and near equalization of diastolic pressures consistent with early tamponade physiology.
Repeat ECHO demonstrated RA pressure of 5 mmHg.
Pericardial fluid cytology demonstrated no malignant cells and cultures were preliminarily negative at time of discharge.
Would suggest pt have a repeat ECHO in [**3-21**] weeks.
Prior CXR showed enlarging moderate left pleural effusion and small right effusion.
The cultures were prelim no growth and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
# PUMP: ECHO from [**5-22**] demonstrated EF 60-70%.
His atenolol was initially restarted but was stopped at time of discharge given his pressure were running in the low normal range (SBP's high 90's to low 100's).
Blood pressure came back up to a normotensive range right away without any intervention.
# HTN: Initially patient's atenolol 50mg daily was continued, however, given that his SBP's were running in the high 90's to low 100's consistently for 24 hours prior to discharge (while on the atenolol) we decided to have him stop the atenolol and follow up with his PCP within the next week for a blood pressure check.
# Microcytic Anemia: Iron studies indicated an Fe of 17 with normal ferritin and TIBC.
Possible this could be 2/2 blood loss from recent surgery.
Would suggest outpatient anemia work-up including age appropriate screening.
NEW MEDICATIONS: START Ferrous Sulfate 325mg twice a day  MEDICATION CHANGES: STOP Atenolol- you should have your blood pressure rechecked when you see your PCP and he can decide whether or not you need this restarted.
