Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with mid to distal anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis/akinesis and mild/moderate hypokinesis elsewhere.
[**2195-4-14**] CXR Compared with [**2195-4-12**], the left pleural effusion may be somewhat decreased.
[**2195-4-8**] CT Chest 1.
Left-sided opacity on recent portable chest x-ray is shown to be predominantly due to atelectasis of the lingula and left lower lobe, although moderate left pericardial effusion accumulating preferentially on the left side also contributes to this appearance.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed  normal functioning aortic and mitral bioprosthetic valves and a large pericardial effusion.
As his rate was somewhat rapid at times, amiodarone was started for rate control with good effect.
A chest CT scan was obtained which showed small bilateral pleural effusions and normal postoperative changes.
On [**2195-4-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] was well enough to transfer to the step down unit for further recovery.
