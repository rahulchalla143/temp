#Pneumonia due to Proteus and Methicillin resistant staph aureus: Patient was admitted with hypoxia above 2-3L home needs and was found to have right basilar opacification on CXR and CT showed RLL heterogenous consolidation and RUL ill defined opacification with trace right sided effusion.
She was initially treated with Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levaquin, and Azithromycin and was narrowed to Vancomycin and Cefepime and then to Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone based on sputum culture sensitivities.
Her oxygen requirement decreased to 40% FiO2 via 10L/min TM satting in the high 90s.
It is unclear why the patient aspirated resulting in pneumonia this admission, but it may have been related to an underlying viral URI as subglottic edema was seen on evaluation laryngoscopy with ENT.
The patient had a videoswallowing study that was similar to previous.
Coumadin can be restarted when INR drops to <3.
INR continued to be >3 on the day of discharge.
INR was >3 entire admission and LUEUS showed no DVT.
#Anemia: Hematocrit dropped from 34 to 27 but remained stable in the high 20s thereafter.
There was low suspicion for blood loss.

Also, your Coumadin was held because your INR was >3, but this should be restarted when your INR drops below 3.
Followup Instructions: 1) Please have your rehab call Dr.[**Name (NI) 26287**] office to set up a follow up appointment in [**3-30**] weeks  2) Please have your rehab call Dr.[**Name (NI) 25674**] office to schedule a follow up appointment in the next 1-2 weeks.
