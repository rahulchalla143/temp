He has a multi-resistant  virus, due to serial monotherapy in the early [**2142**]'s and some  adherence problems thereafter.
His last CD4 count in [**12/2157**] was 126, with a  corresponding viral load that was undetectable.
Colonscopy [**2157-5-10**] showed 8 mm sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon,and a fugating 3.5 cm mass just above the anal verge.
The biopsies of both lesions revealed focally invasive squamous cell  carcinoma.
He needed a diverting  colonoscopy to be placed, and had two admissions for fevers due  to infection of the tumor.
Pathology of the tissue removed revealed foci of active tumor.
His last glycated hemoglobin in [**12-14**]  was 4.5%.
Lung Nodule: He has a calcified pulmonary nodule on a chest X ray in 11/93.His sister had tuberculosis, but he had minimal exposure to her.
Normal ETT MIBI: In [**9-/2154**], he had a CT Scan of his heart (as part of a study)that revealed extensive calcifications of his coronary arteries.He, therefore, had an exercise thallium study that revealed an EF of 62% and no perfusion defects at a 111% predicted heart rate.
COPD: "COPD" by CT scan in [**2154**].
Initial CT scan showed ground glass opacities.
Seen by pulmonolgy at [**Hospital1 18**] and repeat CT scan was normal.
Physical Exam: T 97.7 BP 106/60 HR 83 20 97%RA Gen: Chronically ill appearing male in no respiratory distress HEENT: Moderate facial wasting.
JVP at 1cm above angle.
Abd: soft, non-tender (although exam in [**Hospital **] clinic notable for RLQ tenderness)hypoactive BS.
He was diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction until [**2-27**], when his symptoms failed to resolve and a CT scan showed a transition point.
He was taken to the operating room and underwent extensive lysis of adhesions and a biopsy of a small bowel mass.
As a follow-up surgery was planned for [**4-5**], the cystoscopy was done at this time.
His surgery on [**4-5**] consisted of an ex lap and construction of an ileocolic bypass.
Cystopscopy revealed only small clot and expected inflammatory changes.
Although his ostomy output continued to be negligible, the tissue itself was viable, and there was no indication of frank obstruction.
A repeat small-bowel follow through on [**4-18**] was negative for obstruction, and in fact the contrast could be seen freely passing from the ostomy site.
On [**4-19**], his urine again darkened and became quite cloudy.
He was fluid resuscitated and his urine color and output improved.
