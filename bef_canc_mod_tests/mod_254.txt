Digoxin level of 3.7, lactate 3.3, [**Date Range 263**] 3, and K 5.2.
BNP 9300.
EKG showed AF@90, mild right axis, RBBB, diffuse down sloaping ST segments and NTW which are more pronounced compared to previous tracing and are consistent with digitalis effect.
CXR showed hyperinflation, elarged heart shadow, vascular congestions and increased bilateral effusion.
EF 70%.

She was diuresed with lasix 20mg iv bid for net negative 1.5L daily for a total diuresis net negative of 6 L. Admission weight was 52.1 kg.
Discharge weight was 49 kg.
Repeat echo showed LVEF greater than 65%, worsening TR, and worsening pulmonary htn, which were all likely exacerbated by her overloaded state.
She was weaned off oxygen and maintained good oxygen saturations on room air.
#Elevated Digoxin level: The digoxin level of 3.7 was drawn two and a half hours after her last dose and likely represents a predistribution level.
Her EKG is not concerning for digitalis toxicity as the qrs interval is normal, there are no PVCs, and the rate is normal.
Digoxin level trended downward and doses were held.
Her heart rate improved and she was restarted on a reduced dose of atenolol 12.5 mg daily.
