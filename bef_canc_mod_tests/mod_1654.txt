In the ER she had an LP and was given IV hydration, IV Cefipime 2 gm IV Ceftriaxone 2 gm, IV Ampicillin 500 mg. CSF was neg for wbc's, patient underwent ct chest/abd/pelvis w/o clear identification of source.
A repeat lung biopsy was c/w T-cell lymphoma.
Repeat CT also showed kidney inflitration.
Glaucoma [**12-19**] to ophthalmic steroid use 4. h/o of mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with moderate global hypokinesis on TTE and cardiac MRI ; LVEF [**2115-2-8**] - 50% 5. gastritis, diagnosed by EGD in [**12-22**] 6.
Physical Exam: In ED: Vitals: T 100.6 HR 107 BP 126/61 RR 20 O2 97%RA After the ICU: 97.6 85 20 126/69 97% RA PE: NAD; labored breathing, using accessory/abdominal muscles - paradoxical breathing HEENT: oral pharyx moist and clear, white-scrapable excudate on her tongue.
CARDIAC: RRR, Nl s1, s2 CHEST: expiratory wheezes with I:E of 1:4 ABD: soft, NT, ND, +BS EXT: no edema, 2+ peripheral pulses, small fingers on left hand  NEURO: A and O x 3, appears midly sedated, but is aware of her history and place LINES: L central line, L hand PIV   Pertinent Results: CT Torso [**2115-8-30**] INDICATION: 38-year-old woman with T-cell lymphoma presents with fevers.
Please evaluate for fever source, compare with previous CT for renal changes seen on prior CT.
COMPARISONS: CT [**2115-6-6**], MRI [**2115-6-19**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed following administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Again seen are bilateral areas of scarring within the lung parenchyma.
This appears relatively unchanged in size when compared to the prior study where it measured 2.0 x 1.9 cm.
On the right side, again seen is exophytic hypoechoic lesion measuring 9 mm in greatest dimension relatively unchanged from prior study when it measured 11 mm.
These lesions are too small to characterize by CT, but of note, when seen on MRI performed [**2115-6-19**], these lesions were felt to represent simple renal cysts.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Oral contrast is seen in the proximal small bowel.
These areas are too small to characterized by CT, but when seen on MRI dated [**2115-6-19**], these were felt to be simple renal cysts.
CT of the sinuses: .
TECHNIQUE: Coronal non-contrast CT scans through the paranasal sinuses were obtained.
Comparison is made to previous sinus study from [**2115-3-23**].
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM: Diffusion-weighted imaging is normal.
An opportunistic infection cannot be excluded, given the patient's immune status.

CXR, CT torso, CT of the sinus all failed to show a consolidated infection.
Sputum cultures were negative.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and spinal fluid tap were all negative.
3) Transient auditory hallucinations - patient 24 hours after the ICU stay experienced auditory and visual hallucinations described as hearing 80s music and seeing water running on the wall and on the ceiling.
Imaging studies with CT/MRI and EEG failed to show any pathology.
6) Dilated cardiomyopathy - [**12-19**] adriamycin toxicity.
