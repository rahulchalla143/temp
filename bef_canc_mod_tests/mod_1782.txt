[**2146-11-25**] 8:00 pm (after heparin drip started) FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist  [**2146-11-26**]: FINDINGS: Again is noted a right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 3.7 x 1.8 cm compared to prior 3.7 and 1.9 cm.
CXR: [**2146-11-28**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-13**] and [**10-31**].
Nodule at the left lung base has been evaluated by CT scanning as atelectasis.
TTE [**2146-11-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-9-19**], heart rate is faster.
CT Head [**2146-12-5**]: FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained.
She had mild tachycardia, but no chest pain, and she maintained good oxygen saturation on 2L NC.
A heparin drip was started, and repeat head CT showed no progression of ICH.
Heparin drip was difficult to titrate due to inconsistent PTT values, and patient was switched to lovenox 70mg SC daily.
Coumadin PO was started and dose was titrated to an INR of [**12-28**].
Follow up was arranged with neurology, hematology and neurosurgery, witha  repeat head CT in 8 weeks.
A repeat head CT showed evolution of the prior ICH, but no increase in size or new hemmorhage.
