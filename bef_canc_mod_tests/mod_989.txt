Blood cx's from his tunnelled subclavian HD line grew out S. aureus.
He was covered with Vancomycin until blood cx's grew out [**Month/Year (2) 8974**] and he was switched to Nafcillin.
TTE on [**11-6**] without evidence of vegetations.
However, patient spiked T to 101.4 one week later, and blood cx's drawn from his temp HD line grew Enterococcus raffinous and micrococcus on [**11-14**] and VRE (E. Facecium) on [**11-17**].
Peripheral blood cx's were negative.
In addition, patient was noted to have worsening transaminitis (bili 7.6, AP 674, GGT 572, AST 60 ALT 50) with some RUQ abdominal pain.
Patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of possible endocarditis and transaminitis.
Patient allowed examination but declined to be interviewed on admission to the floor, and would only answer a few questions regarding social history (as stated below).
His brother [**Name (NI) **] can be reached on his cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 71407**] or work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 71408**].

CXR: [**2176-11-21**] 1.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-5-31**], a very small circumferential pericardial effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now identified.
ERCP: [**11-27**] 1 fluoroscopic spot images were obtained during ERCP without presence of a radiologist and submitted for review.
Images demonstrate cannulation and opacification of proximal portion of the pancreatic duct which appears prominent.
HIDA scan showed markedly poor hepatic uptake of radiotracer compatible with severe hepatocellular dysfunction; no evidence of central biliary obstruction.
MRCP and subsequent ERCP showed no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation nor evidence of cholelithiasis.
Liver enzymes peaked on [**11-30**] with ALT 30 AST 50 ALP 1739 total bili 11.6.
Enzymes started to trend down spontaneously and at time of discharge were ALT 26 AST 37 ALP 1170 tbili 4.3.
Hepatology deferred inpatient liver biopsy given his improvement in LFTs.
Further evaluation for biopsy will be deferred to outpatient hepatology.
Peripheral cx have been negative.
and blood cultures cleared (first negative culture [**11-7**]).
TTE [**11-6**] negative for vegetations.
Blood cultures from his fem line on [**11-17**] grew VRE faecium.
His blood cultures remained negative during his entire admission.
Given patient's multiple episodes of bacteremia and new murmur on physical exam, the infectious disease team recommended treating patient with full 6 week course of daptomycin (end date [**1-3**]) from last positive culture for presumed endocarditis.
Aspirate showed 70,000 WBCs, 330,000 RBCs, and gram stain was negative in the setting of longterm antibiotics.
Patient went to surgery on [**2176-11-28**] for a washout which was consistent with an old hematoma/hemarthrosis per the surgeon, but did not look grossly purulent.
Cultures were negative.
At time of discharge, patient is non-weight bearing pending further evaluation at orthopedic clinic.
Head CT at OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**] showed no acute pathology.
His HCT had trended down to 20.
He will need outpatient hematology evaluation for this.
We did many tests to determine what the source of the infection and why your liver enzymes were elevated.
Eventually your liver enzymes started to return back to normal, but you will need to be followed by the liver clinic as an outpatient (see below).
While you are on this medication, you must have your muscle enzymes checked every week.
