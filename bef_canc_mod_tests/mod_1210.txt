Her previous admissions were in [**Month (only) 547**] and [**Month (only) **] with similar complaints.
CT scan ([**2105-3-15**]) demonstrated some minimal wall thickening of deep loops of small bowel.
A small-bowel follow-through demonstrated a slightly thickened, irregular, aperistaltic loop of small bowel in the distal pelvis but no evidence of obstruction.
Her last CT in [**Month (only) **] showed an obstruction at a deflection point in the left lower quadrant.
MRI was notable for a 4.0 x 4.3 x 7.2 cm heterogeneous cystic and solid pelvic mass anterior to the bladder.
Biopsy was consistent with poorly differentiated malignancy.
Taxol on [**2104-9-24**] and then palliative radiation therapy.
MRI on [**2104-12-18**] was notable for interval decrease in size of the soft tissue density immediately adjacent to and posterior to the pubic symphysis, compatible with scar and no evidence of disease recurrence  elsewhere in the pelvis.

Pathology specimen from [**2105-6-9**] Small bowel (3.3 cm): Mild mucosal edema, otherwise unremarkable small bowel.
[**6-23**] abdominal Xray No evidence of underlying bowel obstruction.
NGT was clamped and she had significant nausea.
Was transfused one unit of blood for Hct of 21.
Again on [**6-13**] the patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy to r/o anastomotic leak/peritonitis.
She was evaluated for confusion and serial neuro exams showed no focal or cognitive deficits below baseline.
