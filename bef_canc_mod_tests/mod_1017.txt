Her HCT there was 30.
A non-contrast CT showed fluid in the pelvis consistent with blood.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center where she was remained hemodynamically stable, had a HCT of 30.4.
Past Medical History: - CKD, developed CIN after her MI in [**2132-8-18**] and was on dialysis from [**2132-8-18**] to [**2133-2-18**].
Pertinent Results: [**2133-10-1**] CT ABD FINDINGS:  CTA OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  The patient is status post aorto-right iliac [**Month/Day/Year **] repair (AAA repair) and status post left AKA.
If indicated, conventional angiography or repeat CTA with delayed phase imaging should be considered.
[**2133-10-1**] CT HEAD FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-4-28**], the current study is very limited in nature (poor image quality (body habitus)), but no major changes are appreciated.
[**2133-10-11**] Abdominal plain film  The patient is after recent abdominal surgery.
Her initial organism was fairly resistant (VISA).
There was no CT evidence of recurrent [**Month/Day (2) **] infection.
A perigraft abscess was found without evidence of ongoing bleeding; but a high index is suspicion that the distal anastomosis was the source of her hemoperitoneum bleeding.
Plain films were taken which were concerning for possible early small bowel obstruction however the pt seemed to improve on her own.
Information was obtained from  team census .
