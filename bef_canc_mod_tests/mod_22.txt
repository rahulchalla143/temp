He reports that his ostomy output has been more watery, but he is uncertain whether it has increased in volume.
In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have serum sodium of 107; which was thought to explain his recent symptoms.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit about two hours later for further evaluation and treatment of his hyponatremia.
Prostate cancer; treated with brachy therapy and external beam radiation.
His postoperative course was complicated by a partial small-bowel obstruction and postoperative leak.
Surgical pathology showed adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, grade II, with surgical staging T3 N0 M0.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 71, his blood pressure was 101/47, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head and neck examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient's mental status was intact.
Sensory examination was without focal deficits.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 8.7 and hematocrit was 29.5 (with 75% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 3% bands, 16% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes).
His prothrombin time was 12.4, his INR was 1, and his partial thromboplastin time was 25.1.
Sodium was 107, potassium was 4.6, chloride was 72, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 26, creatinine was 1.5 (increased from his baseline of 1), and his blood glucose was 117.
ALT was 20, AST was 18, alkaline phosphatase was 113, total bilirubin was 0.6, amylase was 286, and his lipase was 67.
The right bundle-branch block and the first-degree atrioventricular conduction delay were new when compared to the prior study from [**2169-4-22**].
A KUB revealed mildly dilated loops of small bowel with air/fluid levels, much less pronounced; consistent with prior study from [**2169-5-22**].
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The impression was that this is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of colon cancer, status post resection and loop ileostomy in [**2168-12-28**], now presenting with lightheadedness for two to three days, nausea for one day, with a sodium of 107.
His sodium levels were followed every three hours.
Over the course of 24 hours, his sodium was noted to correct from 107 to 118.
His urine was sent for electrolytes, revealing a low urine sodium and chloride in conjunction with most serum osmolalities; pointing toward volume depletion as the most likely cause for his hyponatremia.
In addition, his fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1%; suggestive a prerenal etiology for his acute renal failure as well as decreased oral intake as a cause for his hyponatremia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's fractional excretion of sodium prior to hydration revealed a fractional excretion of sodium of less than 1%; revealing prerenal cause for his acute renal failure.
The patient's creatinine subsequently improved to 1 by the day of discharge.
As this could be contributed to his increased ostomy output, his urinary anion gap was positive; suggestive of a concomitant renal tubular acidosis.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  A KUB was done on admission which revealed nonspecific air/fluid levels.
His urine was sent for culture and was pending on the day of discharge.
