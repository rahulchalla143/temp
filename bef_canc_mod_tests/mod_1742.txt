<b><u>STRESS:</u></b> [**2183**] .
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-8-31**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly lower.
<b><u>IMAGING:</u></b> -[**12-23**] CXR Port: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities which could represent pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
Recommend repeat study with optimized technique for accurate evaluation.
-[**2197-12-27**] CXR Port: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-24**] through 23: Left lower lobe remains largely collapsed, responsible for leftward mediastinal shift.

On admission to the ICU, sputum cultures were collected and confirmed GNRs, at which point vancomycin and azithromycin were stopped; however, it was not until after the meropenem course was completed that sensitivities showed resistance to meropenem and sensitivity to imapenem.
# (PUMP) dCHF Decompensation: On admission had pulmonary congestion on CXR and exam consistent with elevated LVEDP.
She was admitted at 141.7 kg (312lbs), from a dry weight of 119 kg (262lbs) on discharge [**2197-10-19**].
She was diuresed aggressively in the ICU with lasix and metolazone and continued diuresis on the floor to her dry weight, being mindful of the patient's preload dependence with dCHF/AF/mod-AS.
Her discharge weight was 120.9 kg.
A lipid panel was sent and showed LDL 74, HDL 42, TG 109, Chol 138. .
# Leukopenia: Presented with a chronically abnormal CBC with WBC trending in the 2-3 range during her previous admission in 09/[**2197**].
Direct ophthalmoscopy showed likely bilateral cataracts.

You were intubated and admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure; your chest x-ray showed fluid in your lungs due to heart failure.
We suspected that your heart failure may have been provoked by your atrial fibrillation, which is a fast irregular heart rate that makes your heart less effective at pumping blood.
Your cardiologist recommended that this rhythm not be corrected by cardioversion and that your heart rate be controlled with medication.
It is very important that you weigh yourself every morning and [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
