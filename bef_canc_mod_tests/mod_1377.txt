Oxygen saturations dropped and she required 8L via venti-mask.
CT torso showed multifocal opacities suggestive of pneumonia (possible aspiration) without acute intra-abdominal process.
She was found to be in new afib with RVR with rates 150 and LBBB.
Blood pressure was stable with SBP 130-140s throughout ED stay.

Portacath was removed [**8-17**] but tip culture results were negative.
If there is high clinical suspicion for obstruction, then further assessment with CT would be recommended.
Pulse volume recordings demonstrate preservation of the dicrotic notch down through the metatarsal level bilaterally.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MR INCOMPLETE STUDY [**2120-6-11**] Limited examination, the patient became unstable and the study was discontinued, only diffusion-weighted images and sagittal images were obtained.

Blood and urine cultures did not grow any organisms.
CT chest was done which revealed a multifocal pneumonia.
An ABG did not show hypercarbia.
Serial EKG's were perfromed each day for potential digoxin toxicity.
After an extensive workup with the liver team to exclude drug toxicity vs autoimmune vs infectious hepatitis, a definitive etiology for acute liver failure could not be found.
Nephrology was consulted and concluded that renal failure was likely multifactorial: prerenal/hypotension, hepatorenal, contrast induced, and possible DIC.
INR normalized by Hospital Day 10 and platelets trended upwards, reaching >100 during this time as well.
An xray of this joint showed a normal appearing total shoulder replacement.
Hydralazine was added for BP control during her MICU stay, but it was taken off when metoprolol and diltiazem were increased and before digoxin was started.
#Anemia: Pt came in with a HCT of 31, but her HCT trended down to as low as 20.2.
The patient was given several units of PRBCs during her admission to keep her HCT above 21.Her HCT stabilized throughout her stay and she no longer required any transfusions.
Vascular was consulted and recommended arterial-brachial index which showed good distal perfusion.
She should be placed on a 1.5L fluid restriction moving forward, and will need close monitoring given her autodiuresis as her kidney recovers.
Transitional Issues: - will need Liver f/u - will need Renal f/u - will need Vascular f/u - will need cardiology f/u - Hepatitis serologies negative except for HAV antibody -1,25 OH Vit D pending -Free water restriction  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Your blood pressure was low and you required medications to boost your blood pressure, which caused you to have a blockage of the blood to your feet.
Your heart rate also became elevated and irregular while you were here, and you required three different medications to keep your heart rate low.
