The ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung zone seen on the prior study has resolved.
# CXR [**2157-7-22**]: IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration in the upper lobes.
# CXR [**2157-8-1**]:  FINDINGS:  A PA and lateral of the chest were obtained and compared to the prior examination dated [**2157-7-30**].
The study is limited secondary to patient's inability to breath-hold.
# PNA: As pt reported syptoms of productive cough, admission CXR was obtained which demonstrated RUL infiltrate suspicious for infection.
In light of her recent hospitalization, pt was started on ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12H ([**7-6**]) for nosocomial PNA.
To cover the possibility of aspiration PNA as pt's hepatic encephalopathy persisted, abx were broadened to vancomycin ([**7-9**])/pip-taz ([**7-9**])/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 11067**]).
Serial chest xrays every other day showed gradual interval improvement.
On [**7-8**], pt received 1 unit PRBC for Hct = 20.9.
On [**7-9**], HD#3, patient c/o increasing SOB, with RR = 30, PaO2 = 61 on 4L NC, PCO2 = 33, pH 7.44.
Repeat CXR demonstrated new L upper and lower lung infiltrates and likely volume overload.
TTE performed in the MICU demonstrated hyperdynamic EF, enlarged LA, and no evidence of pulmonary HTN.
Repeat sputum and urine cultures, however, demonstrated continued heavy yeast colonization, with urine growing C. glabrata, and sputum growing C. albicans (sensitive to fluconazole) as well as another yeast organism with indeterminate speciation.
On [**2157-7-21**], pt was removed from the transplant list given respiratory compromise but was relisted after transferring back to the floor.
Her encephalopathy showed improvement daily.
Free water was stopped when her Na reached 130.
# DM2: Pt's blood glucose was controlled with HISS, with home regimen of glipizide first reduced and then ultimately held out of concern for hypoglycemia in the setting of hepatic dysfunction.
# Hematuria: Pt presented with gross hematuria on [**7-11**], with INR = 3.4.
FFP 2 units were transfused with resolution of hematuria.
On day of discharge, her Hct was 25.9. .
# UTI: Pt was noted to have entercoccus in urine culture on [**7-9**], treated with vancomycin.
Urinalysis on [**7-29**] grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella, and has been receiving a course of Ciprofloxacin, to complete on [**8-8**].
After extubation, pt was given NutrenPulmonary tube feeds at 60cc/hr, cycled from 1800 hrs to 1200 hrs, to increase her caloric intake, which was then changed to continuous 24 hr.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: # Hyponatremia # Hypernatremia # HCV cirrhosis # Hepatic encephalopathy # Pneumonia # [**Female First Name (un) 564**] overgrowth # Adrenal insufficiency .
We have given you some new medications: hydrocortisone 20mg daily folic acid 1mg daily ciprofloxacin 250mg every 12 hours until [**2157-7-8**] lactulose was increased to 45 ml three times titrated to 3 bowel movements with 45 ml as needed in addition.
