ECHOS  [**9-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[**9-30**] CT abdomen: 1.
After CVL placed, negative echo & abdominal CT showing new ascites, she was admitted to the SICU for resuscitation and reversal of her supratherapeutic INR.
[**9-22**]: Diagnostic paracentesis showed serous inflammatory ascitic fluid, and the patient was taken for ex lap & abdominal washout.
NEURO: Her pain was controlled with small doses of morphine & her agitation was controlled with ativan & seroquel.
CV: Echocardiograms showed good cardiac function, with mild mitral regurgitation.
Initially she required pressors to maintain her blood pressure, but she has been hemodynamically stable for some time.
Initial fluid avidity resolved after surgery & she was diuresed down to her baseline weight of 55kg.
HEME: INR was reversed with vitamin K & FFP prior to [**9-22**] paracentesis.
Poor creatinine clearance required small dose of vanco (500qd).
ENDO: blood glucose maintained less than 130 with RISS.
