CXR negative.
Patient's blood pressures normalized and then became hypertensive.
# Macrocytic Anemia/Concern for gastrointestinal bleeding: Outpatient work-up has been consistent with anemia [**12-30**] alcohol use given macrocytosis not explained with folate, b12, nor pernicious anemia (IF antibody negative).
Initially blood work upon reaching the floor was singificant for a hct of 17.2, however this was determined to have been taken off a line with normal saline flushed into it.
Repeat hct was 24.2 (from a previous of 26.7).
Her hematocrit bumped appropriately, however she nadir'ed down to 21.7 and so was given another 2 units of PRBCs.
After transfusion, the patient's hematocrit stabilized between 26 and 28.
She was transfered to the floor where her hematocrit was monitored daily.
Hematocrit was monitored and patient was transfused 1 unit on admission to the ICU and 2 units the following day for low hematocrit, as above.
Admission UA showed 7 WBC in urine and leuk esterase +, but given that she had no symptoms a urine culture was added on, no antibiotics given initially.
Once your blood pressure normalized and your sodium began to improve you were transferred to the medical floor.
Your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] you and decide if you should have further evaluation for these events with a neurologist.
The GI doctors did [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] which showed gastritis and esophagitis .
Your blood pressures later became very high while you were hospitalized so you were restarted on your Lisinopril and given a new medicine called Amlodipine for better control.
