Also the patient has a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital6 649**] Emergency Department the patient was found to be hyperkalemic with a potassium of 7.8 and an increased blood urea nitrogen level of 43, up from a baseline of 20.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  NonHodgkin's lymphoma, pulmonary histoplasmosis and pulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary fibrosis with the following pulmonary function tests, FVC .6, FEV 1/FEC 68%, tuberculosis in [**2121**], status post splenectomy, status post left pneumonectomy, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, anxiety and depression.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, 100.7, heartrate 110, blood pressure 76/30, respiratory rate 19, oxygen saturation 97% on pressor support ventilation of 5 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and FIO2 of .4.
Cardiac, the patient is tachycardiac with a summation gallop palpable on the chest wall, II/VI systolic murmur is auscultated best at the apex.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed sodium 133, potassium 7.8, chloride 88, bicarbonate 37, BUN 43, creatinine .5, glucose 138, white blood cell count 15.6, 81 neutrophils, 11 lymphocytes.
Hematocrit was 35.7 and platelets 467,000.
PT is 12.7, PTT 26.6, INR 1.1, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.0, albumin 2.6, Digoxin level 1.5, CK of 15, troponin of less than .3.
Urinalysis is significant for 20 hyaline casts.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed congestive heart failure, however, improved from previous x-rays during previous admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course by systems is summarized below:  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was admitted with hyperkalemia with an initial potassium of 7.8.
The patient responded well to insulin, Kayexalate and calcium given in the Emergency Room and repeat potassium was 5.6.
On hospital day #2 the patient's potassium was down to 4.3 and remained in the normal range for three days.
The patient was initially on pressor controlled ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit with inspiratory pressures of 35, FIO2 of .4 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
The patient was clinically volume-overloaded and it was felt that the patient's ventilator dependence would improve with aggressive diuresis.
Initially diuresis was difficult as the patient's blood pressures were consistently low with systolic pressures in the 70s and 80s.
The decision was made to discontinue the patient's Lopressor and Captopril and after this change the patient's blood pressures were much more appropriate and Lasix diuresis was instituted successfully.
The goal of the diuresis was to bring the patient down from an admission weight of approximately 59 kg to her calculated dry weight of approximately 51 kg.
The patient remained on a Lasix drip of 7 mg per hour through hospital day #10 ([**2131-3-25**]) with daily diuresis between 1 and 1.5 liters.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable with systolic pressures in the 80s during this time.
The patient's Digoxin dose was also increased on hospital day #4 after a Digoxin level came back subtherapeutic at .7.
At the time of this dictation the patient is planned for laparotomy with gastrostomy tube resiting on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2131-3-26**] or Tuesday [**2131-3-27**].
Hematology - The patient was initially admitted with a hematocrit of 35.4, however, this coursed down throughout hospital days 1 through 4.
On hospital day #4 the patient's hematocrit was 24.6.
Anemia laboratory data were notable for a low iron level of 24 and the patient was started on iron supplementation, 325 mg p.o.
On hospital day #4 the patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells and on hospital day #5 the patient's hematocrit had gone up to 30.6.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable, above 30 through hospital day #10, [**2131-3-26**].
On hospital day #2 the patient had gram positive cocci on gram stain of blood drawn off of the patient's PICC line and the patient was started on Vancomycin.
The resulting culture was sparse growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis which was felt likely to be a likely contaminate.
Endocrine - On hospital day #4 the patient underwent a Cosyntropin stimulation test to check for adrenal insufficiency.
The test was negative and the patient was not started on any supplemental corticosteroids.
