She took his blood pressure and it was in the 130s systolic.
When EMS arrived, BP was 150/80, HR 134, RR16, O2 sats 94%.
The monitor showed sinus tach.
He had a blood transfusion for a HCT of 25 which was complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation and ?TRALI but was extubated within 24 hours.
No further blood transfusions were attempted during the admission.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-12-28**], the overall LVEF has probably improved.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-3-28**]  PORTABLE AP CHEST: Limited study with bilateral chest walls not included in the field of view.

Hemodynamic measurments were then taken at baseline and on low dose dobutamine.
Final hemodynamic measurments demonstrated a significant reduction in the mean gradient to < 15mmHg and a calculated aortic valve area of 1.2cm.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe Aortic Stenosis with a calculated valve area of 0.8mm2.
There were elevated left and right sided filling pressures with a PCWP of 31mmHg and an RVEDP of 19.
The central aortic pressure was mildly elevated at 156/69 with a mean of 102mmHg.
Following aortic balloon valvuloplasty, the mean gradient was  reduced to 15mmHg and the calculated valve area increased to 1.2cm2.
Aortic root aortography revealed mild aortic regurgitation with a mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient had known severe aortic stenosis, which was confirmed with an echocardiogram demonstrating an aortic valve area of 0.8cm2.
He underwent a balloon valvuloplasty on [**2142-3-29**] which resulted in mean gradient reduction to 15mmHg and the calculated valve area increased to 1.2cm2 from 0.8cm2.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and were normal.
# Positive blood culture: Patient had one positive blood culture growing Coag (-) staph that was thought to be a contaminant as the patient had no signs or symptoms of infection.
