Male with a past medical history of medically-managed CAD s/p MI x 2 in [**2179**], CVA, severe aortic stenosis seen on cath [**7-22**]  presenting to the ED with marked respiratory distress.
His BP was noted to be in the 220s and he became obtunded enroute to the ED.
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's initial VS were noted to be HR 65, BP 133/62, RR 30, Sat 97%.
His CXR showed ET and NG tubes positioned appropriately.
Initial ABG was noted to be show resp/metabolic acidosis.
pH 6.84, pCO2 105, pO2 170, HCO3 20, lactate 7.4.
His vent was changed to FiO2 100%, Rate 30, TV 450, PEEP 10 with a resulting pH of 7.08, pCO2 59, pO2 141, HCO3 19.
Repeat lactate trended down to 6.6.
His BP then dropped to SBPs in the 70s, sedation switched to fent/versed, and patient started on dopamine gtt given severe AS.
His CBC was notable for a leukocytosis 12.5, Hct 35.1.
CT Head showed no acute process.
ABG prior to transfer showed pH 7.29 pCO2 42 pO2 105 HCO3 21 with lactate now 1.1. .

ECHO [**2201-1-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
ECHO [**2201-1-10**]: Technically suboptimal study.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**2201-1-15**]: IMPRESSION: Decreased bilateral pulmonary edema with resultant right greater than left small pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.
VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY [**2201-1-15**]: IMPRESSION: Aspiration and penetration with puree and nectar-thickened liquids.
VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY [**2201-1-20**]: IMPRESSION: Aspiration with all consistencies of barium despite head maneuvers.

# CAD: Pt has history of CAD with prior cath in [**7-/2200**] showing 2 vessel disease, he was managed medically.
His BP improved as his delirium and agitation improved.
His Na was 142 on discharge.
Hcts remained stable after transfusions, however, CT scan was negative for RP bleed, but showed splenic infarct.
Hct remained stable.
# Anemia: Hct was 35 on admission, and dropped to 25, without s/s bleeding.
His Hct remained stable for the duration of the admission.
