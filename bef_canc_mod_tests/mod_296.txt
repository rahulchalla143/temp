She called her daughter and they brought the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
The patient did have a blood transfusion 40 years ago.
Physical Exam: On admission:  Vitals: T 97.9; BP 152/72; P 78; RR 16; 97% RA General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple, no carotid bruit Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no m/r/g Carotids: no blood flow murmur Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.

Hypodensities in the subcortical white matter as described on the earlier studies are unchanged as are hypodensities in the basal ganglia.
MRI OF THE BRAIN: The study is markedly degraded due to patient motion artifact.
Perfusion series images were acquired and are to be processed separately, by the Neurology service.
Evaluation for aneurysm is not possible due to the motion artifact.
IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to patient motion artifact.
Repeat HCT [**10-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
HCT [**10-22**]: Increased hypodensity along the left frontal and parietal regions, consistent with the evolving left MCA stroke.
HCT [**10-23**]: Hypodensity involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter in the left frontal and parietal lobes, consistent with infarction is again demonstrated, not significantly changed compared to the previous study.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2190-9-21**], symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy is not suggested on the current study.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
CTA of head:  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 69yo man w/ PMH significant for breast cancer, renal cell ca, and hepatocellular ca who p/w acute onset difficulty speaking and RUE weakness.
Neurological exam was significant for expressive aphasia, right face/arm weakness in UMN pattern, and right sided extinction to DSS.
On arrival within the 3hr IV tPA window, he had a head CT showing no evidence of hemorrhage.
He went for MRI which showed evidence of a left MCA stroke consistent with embolic etiology.
MRA of the brain had a questionable thickening in the left carotid, and this was repeated later in his hospital course.
He went immediately to carotid u/s for further evaluation, which showed no stenosis.
A head CT showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
His repeat head CT the next day showed a small focus of hemorrhage, but he began to improve.
The following day a repeat head CT was stable.
An ECHO showed no evidence of PFO, ASD, or thrombus, but did demonstrate a new area of hypokinesis.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
A head MRA was obtained, which showed marrowing of the distal left ICA.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Goal INR 2.0-3.0.
Heparin (Porcine) in D5W 100 unit/mL Parenteral Solution Sig: 1100 (1100) units/hour Intravenous  ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): Continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50-70 until therapeutic INR on coumadin.
