Stress MIBI showed new reversible inferior wall defect with decision made not to re-catheterization.
The patient now presents with increased shortness of breath x1 day even at rest, worsening with orthopnea, also complaints of right-sided chest pain, 5- [**8-8**], different from her myocardial ischemic pain, which is left-sided at baseline, no anginal symptoms, able to walk 2 blocks before getting short of breath, baseline blood pressure runs at 170/100, prior to dialysis and 150/80 to 90, postdialysis.
In the ED, her vitals were temperature of 98.3 degrees, pulse of 92, blood pressure of 248/118, 80% on room air and 95% on 2 liters.
Blood pressure still 228/112, saturations improved to 99% on 2 liters.
Her chest x-ray with volume overload.
Afterwards, blood pressure still elevated, improved to 180/90, around her baseline after hydralazine 10 mg IV once, received 0.5 mg morphine.
In the MICU, the patient was ultrafiltrated with 3 liters, blood pressure 120-150/70-90.
[**Month/Day/Year 766**], Wednesday, [**Month/Day/Year 2974**], CHF, EF of 40% in [**8-1**], CAD, 2-vessel disease, RCA, and LAD, [**2171-6-5**], catheterization unchanged, history of DVT, history of CVA and TIA, increased homocystine, cervical spondyloarthropathy, status post C4 and C7 fusion, refractory hypertension requiring hemodialysis, macrocytic anemia.
Admission chest x-ray showed CHF, cannot rule out pneumonia.
EKG normal sinus at 90 beats per minute, normal axis intervals, possible LVH, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V5-V6, consistent with LV strain.
This study demonstrated what appears to be a new reversible defect inferior wall perfusion defect.
Her echocardiogram from [**8-1**], showed EF of 40-50%, catheterization from [**8-1**], EF of 40%, 2-vessel disease as described above, LAD 50% occluded, RCA totally occluded, unchanged from [**12/2158**].
She was restarted on her home medications and the nitroglycerin drip was titrated to control blood pressure.
Her blood pressure was in the 170s, 160s-190s/70-90, with goal blood pressure of 140-150/80-90.
She received hemodialysis with much improved blood pressure control and was euvolemic.
Her blood pressure was in the 87-120s/40-60s, on the floor after 3 sessions of hemodialysis.
She was continued on the metoprolol, Isordil, valsartan, Norvasc, as her outpatient doses and IV hydralazine p.r.n., and was to restart her terazosin as her blood pressure increased.
Her ESRD, her electrolytes were followed.
Blood pressure 120s to 150 systolic.
