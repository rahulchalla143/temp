She was given multiple lasix boluses for poor urine output and attempt to excrete hypo-osmolar urine.
Of note, she had another fall (out of bed) on the night of [**2-1**], and had negative head CT given her thrombocytopenia.

CXR from the ED on [**1-31**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process.
CXR [**2-1**]: little change compared to [**1-31**].
CXR [**2-3**]: Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
TTE [**2-2**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-6-25**], the echocardiographic findings are similar.
Regionality of LV dysfunction is better appreciated on today's study, and severity of mitral regurgitation also appears similar.
CT head [**2-2**]: 1.
Pathology: BM biopsy [**1-20**]: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW FOR AGE WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND ATYPICAL LYMPHOCYTIC INFILTRATE.
Patient's ABG showed low PaCO2 with normal paO2, consistent with asthma.
Pneumonia was less likely given no fever or leukocytosis, and chest x-ray was clear.
CHF was less likely, because pt appeared euvolemic on exam (she had diffuse wheezing but no crackles on exam, no LE edema, no JVD).
Acute PE was on the DDx, but pt was getting better without anticoagulation.
On review of her previous CBC diff, it appears that patient has been having peripheral eosinophilia for years, so it is possible the carpet (which has been there for over 10yrs) is playing a role.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient was admitted on [**1-19**] for thrombocytopenia, underwent [**Month/Year (2) 500**] marrow bx and discharged the next day.
# Hyponatremia: Patient had Na 133 on [**2-1**], fell off bed that night, and the next day Na was 120. urine osm >400 and urine Na>40 along with euvolemic exam suggested SIADH.
CT head was neg for ICH.
# Acute renal failure:  Patient's baseline creatinine 1.1, admission cr 1.2, which rose to 1.6 in the setting of getting multiple doses of lasix in the MICU for low urine output and hyponatremia.
On discharge, her creatinine was 1.3. .
# Falls: Head CT was neg for ICH.
# Pump:  TTE on [**2-2**] showed EF 45%.
Her Hemoglobin A1c was 7.6, with average glucose estimated to be 171.
