Ms. [**Known lastname 18995**] had an SVC obstruction which led to her having to have her R subclavian HD catheter removed today, and a R IJ tunneled HD line placed.
Post-procedure, she was felt to be oozing from all of her sites of intervention, so protamine was given and manual compression was attempted.
She became transiently hypotensive after receiving protamine in IR suite, but her BP responded on its own.
On arrival to CC7 she had SBP of 110 and this decreased to 80's and she had decreased responsiveness, responding only to pain.
Her hct dropped from 36 to 26.5.
Taken for emergent CT scan which demonstrated no RP bleed.
While in CT scan, pt became more awake and responsive, taken to MICU for further observation, where she was fully responsive.
