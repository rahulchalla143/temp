Imaging: CXR Portable ([**11-18**]): Since [**2141-11-16**], heart size enlargement is unchanged due to known pericardial effusion.
CT A/P ([**11-18**]): 1.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**11-18**]): 1.
Overnight in the MICU, patient required IV and PO labetalol for SBP > 200.
Her blood pressure also seemed to improve when her pain decreased and was normal in the middle of the night.
TSH was sent and elevated, although free T4 was normal.
Plasma metanephrines were sent and pending at discharge.
2) Abdominal pain: CT scan showed increasing ascites, but no acute pathology.
Peritoneal fluid was obtained and contained 544 polys.
Treatment was started with metronidazole and levofloxacin, as well as vancomycin as 1 blood culture was growing GPC pairs/clusters.
Blood cultures ended up growing 1 out of 4 bottles coag-neg Staph, likely contaminant, so vancomycin was stopped.
Since nephrology felt her peritoneal fluid polys were inflammatory but not infectious, the levofloxacin and metronidazole were stopped.
The peritoneal cultures remained negative.
3) SVC/brachiocephalic thrombosis: Patient's INR was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.3.
Her INR reached 2.0 at discharge (therapeutic range 2-3).
She was advised on breathing exercises, which seemed to have benefit, and given lorazepam 1mg q8h PRN.
Clonidine 0.3 mg/24 qwk 3.
Bisacodyl 10mg [**Hospital1 **] 6.

Hydralazine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO q30 min prn as needed for hypertension: for SBP > 180.
You will need to continue to have your INR monitored at [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 2786**] clinic.
