Chest x-ray revealed a spiculated mass in the right middle and right lower lobe by measuring 2.2 x 3 cm.
Patient also had a head CT that was negative.
CT was performed, which confirmed the presence of this spiculated mass as well as subpathologic adenopathy.
Patient had an EKG on admission and on review, was found to have a Q wave in lead III as well as ST depressions in V1, V2, V4, V5, and right bundle branch block.
An EKG revealed ST elevations in lead II, F, and ST depressions and V1 through V5.
and plans were made for cardiac catheterization on [**2105-3-30**].
Compared to an echocardiogram in [**2104-2-12**], which revealed an EF of 60- 65 percent with 1 plus TR.
Other admission data included the following:  CBC of 7.7, hematocrit of 30.6, platelet count 192.
CK number 1 is 160 with a troponin of 16.6.
Number two CK is 146 with a troponin of 16.87.
Number [**Doctor Last Name **] CK is 102 with a troponin peak at 19.9.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2105-3-31**], which revealed the following:  Cardiac output of 3.82, cardiac index of 1.92, pulmonary capillary wedge mean at 15, RA pressure at 19, PA pressure of 25.
EP performed a conduction study, which was normal with no His-Purkinje system disease.
Subsequently, an EP study with ablation of VT was planned.
Patient underwent ablation of the left ventricle VT with good result.
Prior to discharge, the patient was fitted with a defibrillation vest, and plans were to followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] in the [**Hospital **] Clinic in approximately 3-4 weeks after discharge.
An ultrasound was performed to rule out acute thrombosis and was significant for a right cephalic vein subacute nonflow limiting chronic occlusion.
An ultrasound was performed, which was negative for acute DVT.
The patient had urine and blood cultures, which were drawn and were no growth by the time of discharge.
Patient's creatinine bumped to approximately 3.3 on Lasix.
When allowed to autodiurese, his creatinine returned to 2.4, which is his baseline.
Patient maintained good urine output and had no evidence of urinary tract infection.
He will eventually need an outpatient colonoscopy.
It was instead recommended that patient follow up in the Pulmonary Clinic in one month's time, where a repeat CT would be performed and should not be present or if increased in size, that a biopsy would be undertaken at that time.
It would be Interventional Pulmonary Clinic to have repeat CT and possible bronchoscopy performed.
