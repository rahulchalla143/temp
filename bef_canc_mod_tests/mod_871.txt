Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 6.
2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: Echocardiogram [**2199-5-29**]: Baseline evaluation of gradient and coronary anatomy prior to intervention: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function.
Echocardiogram [**2199-5-29**]: Focused evaluation during ethanol ablation Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: After injection of 1ml and 0.5ml of alcohol, there is intense hyperenhancement of the distal thrid of the basal septum.
Continuous wave and pulsed Doppler demonstrated a 25-30mmHg peak LVOT gradient.
Following alcohol injection (1.5ml total), there was further hyperenhancement of the region and the peak LVOT gradient was <20mmHg.
Global systolic function remains excellent and valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] persists.
She had no chest pain and cardiac enzymes trended down.
Her blood pressure remained in good range.
Iron 325mg three times daily  Please take the iron for the next few months to help your blood counts recover after the procedure (there was some blood loss during the ablation).
