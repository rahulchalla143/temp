LABORATORY:  The patient's laboratories at the time of admission revealed a white blood cell count of 7.9, but on the 18th the next day it was as high as 23.7, which was verified and doubly checked.
An intraoperative cholangiogram was performed and revealed normal anatomy of the cystic duct and common duct prior to cholecystectomy.
Due to the nature of the bleeding the patient's laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open cholecystectomy, which was then able to clearly identify the source of the venous bleeding from the gallbladder, which was appropriately treated.
Hemostasis was adequate at that point in time and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit after this procedure.
Postoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring.
He was found to have a hematocrit that started preoperatively of 43 and postoperatively was down to 29.
His hematocrit was checked daily, which revealed a hematocrit drop down to about 25 or 26, but he had received approximately four to six liters of IV fluid and was quite positive.
This was felt to be hemodilution and it's effect, he was not symptomatic from this hematocrit change.
His morphine PCA was changed to an oral pain medication, which he tolerated without difficulty.
He is being discharged home with a hematocrit checked on the 22nd of 30 with stable hemodynamics.
