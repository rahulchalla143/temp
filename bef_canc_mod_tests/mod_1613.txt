She had a nasogastric lavage in the Emergency Department which was negative, and she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for hypotension and a gastrointestinal bleed.

Her Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.
Heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and without rales.
Her rectal examination was occult-blood positive.
Extremity examination revealed lower extremity with 1+ edema bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data upon presentation revealed hematocrit was 23.
INR was 0.9.
Chemistry-7 revealed a potassium of 5.7, sodium was 135, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 68, creatinine was 1.3, and blood glucose was 103.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram was done and showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and T wave flattening in leads I and aVL, II, III, and aVF.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was taken to colonoscopy and upper endoscopy by Gastroenterology after having a negative nuclear scan which showed a probably large bowel source.
The colonoscopy revealed multiple blood clots throughout with a possible cecal ulcer.
*The patient's bleeding scan was negative.
After her hematocrit stabilized, she was sent out to the floor because the family did not wish to pursue any further colonoscopies for visualizing the ulcer.
She had several units of packed red blood cells during this admission, and her hematocrit did not bump appropriately at first.
When she came out to the floor, she had copious melanotic stools and a hematocrit drop of 29 to 24 over that day.
She was sent back to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and endoscopy.
The patient had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy which again showed the same lesions but did not reveal any actively bleeding ulcers.
The patient continued to be watched in the Intensive Care Unit, and her hematocrit stabilized at 28.
Her hematocrit stabilized and improved to approximately 29 to 31.
Her stools showed old blood, but were negative for new bleeding.
These would usually be postprandial and would be accompanied by systolic blood pressures of about 100.
A Neurosurgery consultation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] was called, and he recommended flexion extension plain films of the cervical spine to see if there was instability.
