ECHO [**2197-5-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-12-1**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia (mid-distal LAD lesion).
# Hypotension: Most likely hypovolemia but could be component of sepsis given bacteremia - IVF, adequate hydration - follow urine output .
#Bacteremia--gram positive cocci in [**2-19**] bottles, one aerobic, one anaerobic .
- IVF - adequate hydration - renally dose meds .
INR supratherapeutic.
- hold dilt, b-blocker, coumadin - hold digoxin -> f/u level, likely can discontinue this medication .
