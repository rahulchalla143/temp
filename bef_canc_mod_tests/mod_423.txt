His Total Bili, which was elevated to 7 from a baseline of 1.5 to 3, improved following the drain exchange.
An echo during the admission saw a small pericardial effusion, which was not there during a TTE in ([**5-24**]).
The patient was recently discontinued off his Naloxone, which he was taking for persistent pruritis.

ECG Study Date of [**2178-8-31**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-8-25**] diffuse ST segment elevations have improved.
Ventricular ectopy is not as frequent.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2178-8-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-8-25**], the pericardial effusion is larger and increased pericardial pressure is now suggested.
Serial evaluation and clinical correlation is suggested.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2178-8-31**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or MR is recommended.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2178-8-31**] IMPRESSION: Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2178-9-1**] FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2178-9-2**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT ABD W&W/O C Study Date of [**2178-9-4**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2178-9-4**] IMPRESSION: 1) Slight decrease in pericardial effusion.

The drain was removed [**2178-9-2**] and repeat TTE showed only a trivial effusion.
Bacterial cultures are negative at the time of discharge.
Viral cultures and serologies for EBV, CMV, VZV, adenovirus, and [**Location (un) **] virus are pending at the time of discharge and should be followed-up as an outpatient.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
He was treated with prednisone 20 mg daily x 2 days and 10 mg x 2 days during admission, and discharged with 10 mg x 4 days until further evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] at his follow-up appointment.
CT abdomen was performed for further evaluation, and the lesion was most likely an area of hyperemia or inflammation, and was not thought to represent a recurrence of hepatoma.
It is unlikely that this represented cardiac ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative at the time, however, he has numerous risk factors and should be considered for outpatient cardiac stress test for further evaluation.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.6, with creatinine 2.1 on admission.
The patient's creatinine improved with gentle fluids.
Further evaluation and management was deferred to the outpatient setting.
Secondary: - Status post liver [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-/2174**] - Cirrohosis due to NASH - History of HCC - Diffuse biliary strictures due to ichemic cholangiopathy with subsequent bilateral percutaneous biliary drains, with multiple exchanges since placement - Type 2 diabetes - Hypertension - Parathyroid adenoma status post parathyroidectomy [**8-/2175**] - Chronic renal failure, baseline creatinine 1.3-1.4   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
You had an area of concern noted on liver ultrasound.
You had an abdominal CT that showed this area was unlikely to be a cancer and was more likely an area of inflammation.
