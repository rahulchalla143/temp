At the [**Hospital3 4527**] Emergency Department, her evaluation included a head CT, which was reported as showing a "intracranial bleed," and she was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**].
The head CT performed at [**Hospital6 256**] demonstrated an extraaxial hemorrhage in the region of the left cerebellar tentorium, which was felt to most likely represent a subdural hematoma.
Neurosurgical evaluation was undertaken; the Neurosurgery Consult Team felt there was no need for emergent neurosurgical intervention for the subdural hematoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6.
Heart rate 64.
Respiratory rate 16.
Blood pressure 181/70, 97% oxygen saturation on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam revealed a normocephalic, atraumatic head.
Lung exam revealed essential lack of breath sounds on the left.
Cardiac exam revealed an irregularly irregular pulse.
Abdominal exam revealed a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
Extremity exam revealed trace peripheral edema.
The neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented patient.
Motor exam revealed normal muscle tone, 5/5 strength was noted throughout all her extremities, both proximally and distally.
Sensory exam was unremarkable.
Cerebellar exam revealed normal finger to nose testing bilaterally and normal rapid alternating movements.
The patient was noted to be mildly unsteady on exam of her gait.
LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 137, potassium 5.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, BUN 27, creatinine 0.8, glucose 96.
The white blood cell count was 9.9.
The hematocrit was 38.1.
The platelet count was 267,000.
The patient's PT was 18.7 with an INR of 2.4.
The PTT was 33.7.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter with a ventricular rate in the 60s.
The patient's head CT, as noted, revealed extraaxial hemorrhage in the left cerebellar tentorial region.
These neurological checks revealed no change in neurologic status.
After fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K, the patient's INR dropped to 1.6.
The patient underwent a repeat head CT on the afternoon of [**2157-7-19**].
This head CT revealed no interval change in the subdural hematoma.
Given her new electrocardiogram findings, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction and enzymes were negative for myocardial infarction.
More Vitamin K was administered for an INR of 1.6.
