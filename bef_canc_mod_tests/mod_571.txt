Microbiology: Blood culture [**2191-2-20**]: 4/4 bottles E. coli, 3/4 bottles KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA, pan sensitive Urine culture [**2191-2-20**]: Negative HCV viral load [**2191-2-20**]: Negative Blood culture [**2191-2-21**]:  NGTD Blood culture [**2191-2-23**]:  NGTD .
CXR [**2191-2-18**]: increased pulmonary markings c/w CHF .
CT head [**2191-2-18**]: no acute ICH, no mass effect .
CTA Chest [**2191-2-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2191-2-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
KUB [**2191-2-20**]: There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern visualized, with air and stool within nondistended colon and air within nondistended loops of small bowel.
CXR [**2191-2-23**]: IMPRESSION: Improving mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions.
ECHO [**2191-2-24**]: Conclusions: EF 35-40%.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
They felt his gait difficulties were likely multifactorial, with Parkinson's disease, cervical myelopathy, and possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia contributing, as well as improper administration of his parkinson's medications.
Blood cultures were sent which ended up growing 4/4 bottles pan sensitive e. coli and Klebsiella.
RUQ U/S demonstrated no dilation of the common bile duct, but given clinical picture, there was suspicion of obstruction.
Therefore patient underwent ERCP on [**2191-2-21**] that noted partial obstruction of common bile duct with 3 stones, stones unable to be removed, but stent placed for pus drainage noticed.
While his pulmonary exam was initially without rales, he had CHF on CXR, LE edema greater than baseline, and he had a markedly elevated BNP.
His last TTE was in [**2186**] and showed an EF of 45-50%.
He had excellent O2 saturations on room air, so he was maintained on his outpatient dose of furosemide.
His outpatient lasix of 20mg PO QD was held during the above infectious period of his hospital course, but was restarted prior to discharge, and the patient had continued (but improved) lower extremity edema.
He also had a repeat ECHO prior to discharge, which demonstrated EF=35-40%.
He and his cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10241**] were planning for DCCV but his INR has been difficult to manage, and he has consistently been subtherapeutic on his coumadin.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] wanted an ECHO to assess heart function prior to making a decision of patient remaining on coumadin or not.
Given ECHO results above, it was decided to continue coumadin 4mg qhs, as patient will be in a controlled environment at rehab.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**], there is continued consideration of cardioversion in the future, once patient has a documented therapeutic INR for 1 month's time.
