Transesophageal echocardiogram showed no dissection.
CXR here showed mild pulmonary congestion.
EKG is unchanged and CK-MB is normal.
A TEE was done in the CCU initially to r/o dissection, and no dissection was found.
This decrease in preload may facilitate control of pulmonary edema as well.
## Urinary frequency and UA suggestive of UTI -  h/o multi drug including ESBL resistant E. coli and VRE UTI in the past.
Had a temperature of 100.4 on admission, though afebrile for the remainder of the admission.
She was empirically placed on cefipime + tigacycline per ID recs, and received these for 2 days, but they were discontinued after urine culture came back negative.
