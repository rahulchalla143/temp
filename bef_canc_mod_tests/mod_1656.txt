[**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *6.0 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Aorta - Valve Level: 1.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: 3.2 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
with small right pneumothorax REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate right pneumothorax PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2119-12-17**] AT 08:42 HOURS.
Echo showed wide open MR.  Intubated, taken emergently to the cath lab.
He was found to have 2vCAD, and was taken emergently to the OR for CABG X 3 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>OM, SVG>RCA) and MVR (25mm pericardial).
Post-op he was taken to the CSRU on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off by the following morning.
He went in to AFib later that day with a controlled ventricular rate, and stable BP.
