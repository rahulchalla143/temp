Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**5-12**] open jejunostomy tube placement [**6-2**], open jejunostomy tube placement following dislodged previously placed tube [**6-21**], [**Month (only) 26092**] IR jejunostomy change (attempted change of 10Fr to larger size) [**7-4**], unable to fundoplicate via Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) [**8-16**], Tracheostomy under local and change of J-tube to 14 Fr tube  History of Present Illness: 80M with dysphagia supported on TPN who presents for feeding jejunostomy placement.
Final internal length is 36 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
Aspiration  VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW EVALUATION: Study done in conjunction with speech and swallow division.
[**2129-5-16**] 8:25pm RADIOLOGY Final Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Reason: NEW APHASIS, RIGHT UPPER WEAKNESS - ASSESS FOR VASCULAR INJURY Comparison is made to prior MRI dated [**2128-4-3**] and prior CT dated [**2128-4-2**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT There are areas of encephalomalacia from previously identified right MCA distribution stroke involving the right frontal, temporal, and subinsular region with bilateral old lacunar infarcts involving the basal ganglia.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK Please note there was very poor contrast opacification of the neck and intracranial vessels due to infiltrated IV during bolus injection.
Carotid ultrasound examination was performed bilaterally.
ICA/CCA ratio 0.84.
LEFT SIDE: There is mild plaque in the distal common carotid artery and proximal internal and external carotid arteries with respective peak systolic velocities 52 cm/sec, 33 cm/sec, and 79 cm/sec.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: The background is slow and disorganized and reached a maximum of 6.5-7 Hz posteriorly during wakefulness.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were bursts of generalized delta frequency  slowing occasionally better appreciated on the left side.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed as this was requested as a portable study.
CARDIAC MONITOR: An irregular cardiac rhythm was noted with an average heart rate of 78 bpm.
[**2129-5-18**] 11:14am Cardiology Report ECHO Portable TTE Indication: Atrial fibrillation/flutter.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-4-6**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
[**2129-5-18**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST HEAD MRI.
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted sequences were obtained.
TECHNIQUE:  2D and 3D Time-of-flight multiplanar imaging was obtained.
A guide wire was advanced into this loop, but due to the lack of normal peristalsis, catheter and guide wire were removed.
Comparison is made to prior UGI series and abdominal radiograph dated [**2129-6-9**].
There is no evidence of focal leak on this limited examination or pneumoperitoneum.
There is diffuse patchy opacities noted within the visualized lungs--chest examination reported separately.
FINDINGS:  Sagittal and transverse grayscale images were obtained portably.
IMPRESSION:  Mesenteric vasculature not visualized on this exam as described above.
[**2129-9-4**] G/GJ TUBE CHECK Contrast is seen in the left lower quadrant through a J-tube.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-5-18**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
On admission (+)blood culture results were reported from the rehabilitation center.
WBC count was 6.2.
CXR was negative for acute process.
Outside blood cultures were positive for coag (-)staph and VRE.
PICC tip culture was (+)coag (-) staph.
Urine culture was (+) for coag(-) staph and enterococcus.
Sputum culture was (+) E. coli.
At HD 6 he was afebrile; serial blood cultures were negative for growth.
At HD 12 a repeat video swallow evaluation was completed which showed that he was unable to tolerate anything PO without aspiration.
Transferrin was low at 189; Alb 2.6.
Stroke team was present on scene shortly thereafter and CT demonstrated LMCA ischemic defect without hemorrhage.
MRI of the brain was performed on POD 7, which confirmed the L MCA distribution subacute stroke affecting the prefrontal and temporal region, appearing to be embolic in nature.
Cardiac enzymes were sent and an EKG was performed, all of which were inremarkable.
Multiple cultures were performed throughout his long course and the pathogens remained constant.
Sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and E. Coli multiple times.
Urine cultures grew VRE and yeast on multiple occassions.
His blood also grew coagulase negative Staph on a number times, treated with line changes and appropriate antibiotics.
Multiple interventions were performed during his hospitalization, including multiple therapeutic bronchoscopies and multiple studies and manipulations of his jejunal feeding tube.
Tracheostomy secretions were noted to be increased and CXR was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
His WBC was also elevated to 32K.
Sputum cultures again grew Pseudomonas and urine cultures grew yeast.
Albumin was given on multiple occasions, only for a CVP less than 4 as it was felt a CVP at or around 4 was the optimal volume on his Starling curve.
It was around this time that the patient's BUN began to rise and urine output to decrease, requiring increasing doses of diuretic to try and maintain euvolemia.
On HD 177, the patients BUN was 46 and Cr 0.9, however his BUN and Cr subsequently steadily increased and urine output gradually decreased.
On HD 182 the patient was noted to have 200cc of blood suctioned from his trach and received a 1 unit pRBC transfusion.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and the Troponion was noted to be elevated to 0.18 on HD 183.
Cardiology was consulted and the troponin increase was thought to be due to demand ischemia.
A TEE performed on [**10-18**] showed normal LVEF, dilated R and L atria, mild valve dysfunction, and normal pulmonary pressures.
His creatinine at that time peaked at 5.8.
