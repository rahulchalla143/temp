Given recent complaints of dyspnea and chest tightness, she saw her PCP the day prior to admission.
The office EKG was notable for Twave inversions in V1-V3 and she was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

Severe systemic arterial hypertension with SBP 218mm Hg and DBP 96mm Hg.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-10-5**], the left ventricle is mildly hypertrophied with moderate diastolic dysfunction and elevated estimated filling pressures.
The left ventricular systolic function remains normal.

Please see result section for further details of catheterization report.
Cardiac surgery was therefore consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed.
Echocardiogram showed moderate diastolic dysfunction but otherwise no significant valvular disease.
Carotid ultrasound revealed no significant disease of both internal carotid arteries.
Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring on titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips.
