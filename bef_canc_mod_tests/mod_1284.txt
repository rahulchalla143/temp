Hypertension:  Pt was admitted to MICU with SBP>180 and treated with labetolol drip for 5-8 minutes before her BP dropped to SBP 60's.
She did require dopamine and levophed and fluids (2L) to maintain her SBP > 70.
Her blood pressure significantly improved after dialysis with removal of fluid and optimization of anti-HTN meds labetaolol, valsartan, and norvasc.
Plasma metanephrin was sent off and pt ruled out for pheochromocytoma.
Her systolics decreased to < 60's during dialysis so it had to be stopped.
PTH-rp workup is to be done as outpt for possible malignancy.
