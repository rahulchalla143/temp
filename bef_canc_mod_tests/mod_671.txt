MICRO: Urine culture [**2102-2-23**] grew out yeast.
ECG [**2104-2-24**]: AF with a rapid rate, extensive non-specific ST and T changes, cannot rule out ischemia .
ECG [**2102-2-24**] Sinus rhythm.
OSH Echo [**2102-2-22**]: Findings: 1.
EF 60%.
Pulmonary artery pressure equals 70mmHg plus the CVP indicating severe pulmonary hypertension.
TTE [**8-23**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Recommend repeat study when heart rate slower.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-7-6**], image quality is poor.
Resting heart rate is faster.
TTE [**2102-2-24**] LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-9-7**], the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased.
CXR [**2102-2-23**] FINDINGS: There is a somewhat heterogeneous but generally diffuse mild interstitial abnormality suggesting slight pulmonary congestion.
Has been on heparin TID at rehab making PE less likely, however it was considered in setting of new atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, hypoxia and evidence of right sided overload on ECHO with preserved LV function.
Exam and CXR speaks against PE.
EKG on presentation with ST depressions in the anterolateral leads and TWI in the inferior leads, resolved with slowing of the rapid rate.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and were flat.
#congestive heart failure: TTE [**2102-2-23**] showed increased mitral and tricuspid regurg, see results section above.
Blood sugars to normal range once tube feeds were restarted.
There was a report that at the rehab pt had a temp of 100.4.
However, white count was slightly elevated on presentation with somewhat of a left shift.
Monitor BP with this change.
