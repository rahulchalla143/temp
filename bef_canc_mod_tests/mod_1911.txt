He was monitored on telemetry throughout his stay with evidence of atrial fibrillation which was well rate controlled.
No further workup was pursued.
His hematocrit was within his baseline on presentation but dropped 10 points within the first 24 hours of this admission with associated hypotension to the 60s systolic and altered mental status.
He was transferred to the MICU where he underwent small bowel enteroscopy which demonstrated AVMs but no active bleeding.
His blood pressures were stable.
Further workup with a double balloon enteroscopy was considered but deferred at this time.
He underwent arthrocentesis which showed evidence of hemearthrosis.
He subsequently underwent hip and femur films which were negative for fracture.
He had a low fibrinogen at 64 and fibrin degredation products of 160-320.
His platelet count slowly improved to 154 on the day of discharge.
Urinary Tract Infection: Urine culture on [**2185-4-9**] grew > 100,000 e. coli.
Anemia:  The patient's baseline hematocrit ranges from 28 to 32.
On discharge his hematocrit was 31.0.
In the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding his creatinine increased to 3.6.
After resuscitation his creatinine quickly improved to baseline and was 2.7 on the day of discharge.
On hospital day two his blood pressures dropped into the 60s systolic.
