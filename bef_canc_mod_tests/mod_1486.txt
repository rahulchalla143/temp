There he was in some extremis with mottled skin, a heart rate in the 180's in and hypoxia.
He received 2L of fluid, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole after a CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for further treatment, vitals prior to tx were T: 101.2 P 96 rr 20 bp 109/72 sa 02 100%.

=========================== RADIOLOGY & OTHER STUDIES =========================== [**10-1**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
[**10-2**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH: IMPRESSION- 1.
[**10-2**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION- 1.
Cardiomegaly, bilateral effusions, and subtle septal thickening suggest mild volume overload.
Clinically correlate, and consider right upper quadrant ultrasound for further evaluation if indicated.
[**10-2**] CT Head: IMPRESSION- 1.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction or global hypoxic injury.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
He is discharged on 2 liters of O2 by nasal canula and O2 sats in the high 90s.
Blood cultures remained negative though he did have multifocal pneumonia.
His echocardiogram revealed diminshed ejection fraction of 30% but likely had further depressed EF on admission due to RVR and decreased ventricular filling time.
Home lisinopril for blood pressure was held on transfer to  the floor in the setting of elevated creatinine and was stable with systolics from 110s-120s.
Unfortunately bronchoalveolar lavage cultures, sputum, and blood cultures all failed ot reveal an organism.
He should have a follow up chest radiograph in [**3-20**] wks to document resolution of his infiltrate.
Further, when his pleural effusion was tapped it appeared transudative and cultures remained negative consistent with an effusion due to heart failure.
He had an echocardiogram that revealed globally diminished contractility but no wall motion abnormalities and troponin negative making acute ischemia unlikely.
On discharge, CXR showed improvement in fluid status and a decrease in his lower extremity edema.
Prior to admission, pt was on lasix 80 mg daily, which we stopped on discharge because he appeared to be euvolemic both by exam and on chest xray and will follow up to determine further need for lasix as outpatient.
Lisinopril was stopped on transfer to the floor in the setting of elevated creatinine, with systolic BP 110s-120s.
