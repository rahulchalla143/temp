She has been followed closely with serial ECHO and underwent cardiac MRI in [**2139-1-13**] with confirmed severe MR with effective forward ejectin fraction of 25%.
She has been admitted for preoperative cardiac catheterization followed by surgical intervention.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
An eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
