PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 92, blood pressure 136/80, 97% oxygen saturation nasal cannula.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 6, hematocrit 40.2, platelets 190.
Chem-7 revealed sodium of 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 23, BUN 27, creatinine 1.7, glucose 95.
Coagulations revealed an INR of 1, PTT 26.1.
Creatine kinase 125, MB 10, MB index 8, troponin 2.5.
Peak MB 26 with an MB index of 12.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 92 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, borderline first-degree AV block, axis 93 degrees, 1-mm ST elevations in V4 through V6 (new compared with electrocardiogram from [**2156-6-24**]).
[**2158-3-2**], catheterization revealed a right-dominant system and 3-vessel disease.
Ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 52%.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiopulmonary process.
A repeat ultrasound on [**2158-3-6**], with Duplex color Doppler revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm, hematoma, or AV fistula.
Echocardiogram revealed left atrial moderate dilatation, interatrial septum (consistent with right atrial pressure), mild left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of question 35%, hypokinetic anterolateral wall and akinetic inferoposterior wall with mild 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Electrocardiogram with ST elevations in V4 through V6 and enzymes that ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction.
He was placed on Integrilin and taken to cardiac catheterization on [**3-2**].
Catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease with totally occluded right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery, 90% proximal stenosis and 50% in-stent stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft, native obtuse marginal 80% lesion, 60% proximal left circumflex lesion.
Catheterization also revealed mild ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
was increased to as much as 100 mg and then gradually decreased back down to 50 mg because of bradycardia to the 40s with sinus pauses of 2 seconds.
