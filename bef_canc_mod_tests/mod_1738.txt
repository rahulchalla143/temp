Gram stain and cultures show OP organisms only.
She underwent a TTE yesterday which showed moderate AS with a valve area between 1-1.2 cm2, so her SOB is unlikely to be secondary to AS.
#GI bleed: The patient was found on admission to have a Hct of 20 and guaiac positive stools.
Her Hct has been stable for a few days and her stool are guaiac negative.
GI recommended an endoscopy to evaluate for an UGI bleed, however as this would entail intubation given the patient's body habitus, the patient wished to choose conservative management and will not undergo the endoscopy.
She will need monthly Hct checks as an outpatient.
Patient may be iron-deficient with low MCV (78), although TIBC is high-normal and serum ferritin is normal.
She was continued on the PPI [**Hospital1 **] and stool was sent for C.diff which is pending.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient had a TTE which showed a normal EF and moderate AS (valve area of [**2-4**].2 cm2).
Her lasix was initially held due to negative fluid balance and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Would benefit from sleep study as an outpatient.
She sould have a sleep study as an outpatient to determine her optimal sleep settings and follow up with sleep medicine, especially as her TTE showed moderate pulmonary htn.
However, the patient reports significant claustraphobia with prior sleep studies and may not realistically tolerate it.
Also is noted to have pancytopenia and would likely benefit from outpatient workup of her pancytopenia.
