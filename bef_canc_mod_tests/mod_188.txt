In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.1 P 101 BP 141/54 R 24 O2 sat 96%.
Patient underwent a CXR which was essentially unchanged with possible retrocardiac opacity.
Hct was notably down from recent baseline and was positive with brown stool.
She was cross matched for blood and GI was notified.

ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2134-11-19**], the LVEF is slightly lower.
CT CHEST: 1)Severe emphysema combined with pulmonary fibrosis is most likely due to the syndrome of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE)with no acute pathology.
She was clinically euvolemic with TTE unchanged, troponin peak 0.09, which trended down; EKG changes in absence of symptoms thought to be due to LVH with strain in the setting of acute hematocrit drop.
Given the history of increased cough and sputum production with no acute process on chest CT, sputum positive for GPC and GNR (likely colonization, but possibly bronchitis), she was treated empirically for COPD exacerbation with levofloxacin (completed 6 day course) and rapid prednisone taper to chronic 10mg dose.
# Anemia: Hematocrit 24.7 on admission.
She was also seen by GI, but declined EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for source of bleeding.
During the admission there was no evidence of active bleeding and her Hct remained stable at 25, with slow upward trend.
# Anticoagulation (s/p mechanical MVR in 99): INR was 2.3 on admission.
Her heart rate remained ~80 throughout the admission.
# Systolic CHF: baseline EF 40-45%, though denies any symptoms of volume overload and appears clinically dehydrated on exam with mildly elevated creatinine.
Enoxaparin 60 mg/0.6 mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Subcutaneous Q 24H (Every 24 Hours): Please discontinue once INR is therapeutic between 2.5-3.5 for at least 2 days.
22. weight Please obtain weight Monday, Wednesday, Friday at same time each day.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR every 2 days and adjust warfarin dose as needed to maintain INR between 2.5-3.5.
Insulin Sliding Scale Please monitor patient's blood sugars and manage with Humalog insulin on a sliding scale.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 169**] [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: COPD exacerbation  Secondary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Anemia Chronic kidney disease Heart failure, systolic dysfunction Atrial flutter Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, satting 99-100% on 4L transtracheal.
Ambulating with O2 sats >90% on 6L.
The bronchoscopy and chest CT did not show any evidence of pneumonia or any new changes.
You were also transfused 1 unit of red blood cells because your red blood cell count was low (Hct 24.7) on admission.
