The incidental finding was during a cardiac angiography done at [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital.
Vital signs were stable.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Bilaterally, distal pulses were intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Preoperative laboratories were significant for a hematocrit of 50.
INR was 1.1.
Blood urea nitrogen was 17, and creatinine was 1.1.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Preoperative imaging included an angiography which showed a severely angulated abdominal aorta with aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta.
Preoperative electrocardiogram revealed sinus with a left shift.
The patient's distal pulses remained intact, and the patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and was ambulating without difficulty at the time of discharge.
The patient's laboratory values were significant for a drop in his platelet count, and a heparin-associated thrombocytopenic antibody was sent which was still pending.
The patient had been off of heparin since then, and his platelet count has since stabilized.
