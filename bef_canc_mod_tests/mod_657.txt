However, during that catheterization procedure patient decompensated with markedly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to the 50s when placed supine.
She was then started on a Dopamine drip, at which point her rate and pressure both stabilized.
In addition, her wedge pressure did improve to approximately 20.
Her catheterization showed three-vessel coronary disease.
Pump:  Patient with severe ventricular diastolic dysfunction following cardiac catheterization which did show severe diastolic dysfunction which was complicated by significant pulmonary edema.
Following transfer to the unit patient was able to be weaned off the Dopamine drip and her blood pressure stabilized.
Her blood pressure was closely managed to avoid any further cardiac decompensation.
However, she first underwent cardiac catheterization as detailed above for preoperative clearance.
Respiratory failure:  Patient developed severe pulmonary edema during her cardiac catheterization requiring intubation.
A TSH was checked which showed her to be euthyroid at this time on an appropriate level of thyroid hormone replacement.
Urinary tract infection:  On routine urinalysis a urine culture did grow out Enterococcus.
A urinalysis showed no evidence of white cells, bacteria, or other infection.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization showing three-vessel disease.
