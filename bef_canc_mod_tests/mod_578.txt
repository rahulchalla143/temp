She also noticed that her right face felt numb like pins and needles especially around her right eyes and mouth, which is still present.
She denies missing any doses of her Coumadin and reports taking 6 mg daily at home, and had an outpatient INR check on Friday (but is unsure of the result).
A Code Stroke was called, and exam showed visual acuity 20/25 bilaterally, full strength, mild dysmetria on FNF on left.
CTA head/neck showed complete occlusion of the distal right vertebral artery, with abnormal increased MTT and decreased cerebral blood volume within the right occipital lobe concerning for posterior circulation event (equivocal MTT abnormalities in the cerebellum).
MRI/MRA head showed multiple infarcts in bilateral posterior circulation territory in the setting of a very irregular distal right vertebral artery with a short segment of high-grade stenosis versus a short dissection.
TTE showed no PFO/ASD.
Her INR was 2.2 at the time of discharge.
Physical Exam: Physical Examination: VS: temp 97.3, bp 150/90, HR 48, RR 18, SaO2 99% on RA Genl: Awake, slightly drowsy, nausea HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx clear CV: Bradycardic but regular, Nl S1, S2, III/VI systolic murmur best at the LLSB, no rubs or gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and laterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales Abd: +BS, soft, NTND abdomen  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake but slightly drowsy.
Cranial Nerves: Fundoscopic examination is difficult due to patient cooperation.
Sensation intact to pinprick V1-V3, but has decreased sensation to light touch at right V2 (80% of the left).
Pertinent Results: MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2116-7-2**] 11:12 AM Multiple new infarcts, extensively involving the brainstem as described above, with near total loss of flow signal within the intracranial arteries of the posterior circulation.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2116-6-29**] 12:19 PM 1.
She reports not missing any doses of her Coumadin, but her INR is 1.3 on admission.
Her exam is significant for nausea, dysarthria, decreased light touch in right V2 (normal pinprick), slight weakness of left deltoid and triceps, and ataxia of the left>right arm with overshoot on the left.
She was then admitted for heparin gtt to make INR therapeutic.
