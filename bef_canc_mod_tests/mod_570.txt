First and second CK and MB were negative.
The patient was without complaints at the time of examination on the floor.
He also has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 1.8, mild congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50 to 55%, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy and CMML diagnosed in [**2188**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29050**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Synthroid 50 mcg by mouth once daily, Lopressor 50 mg by mouth three times a day, Epogen 40,000 units weekly with hematocrit is less than 36, aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily, Prilosec 20 mg by mouth twice a day, and Augmentin 500 mg twice a day for a urinary tract infection started on the [**3-2**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient's pulse was 62, blood pressure 117/30, respiratory rate 16.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  Right radial access for catheterization was clean, dry and intact.
LABORATORY DATA:   Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, bicarbonate 23, BUN 37, creatinine 1.9, glucose 100.
Hematocrit 34.8, platelet count 647.
Magnesium 1.9, CKs 83 and 69, 73, 77.
White blood cell count 17.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST/T changes.
Cardiology:  The patient was initially take to catheterization on the evening of admission on [**2190-9-3**].
The chest pain was associated with electrocardiogram changes consisting of ST depressions of 1 mm in Leads V3 through V6.
He had one more episode of chest pain with similar electrocardiogram changes on the [**9-5**], and on the 8th, he returned to the catheterization laboratory, where it was found that the left anterior descending had a 50% stenosis just beyond the stent, and 90% D1 origin and a 70% mid-diagonal as well as a left circumflex 40% LMI and right coronary artery 40% crux and 40% posterior descending artery.
This was associated with a hematocrit drop from 36.6 to 27.
The patient's vitals were monitored and were stable.
He did have a second hematocrit drop from 35.3 to 30.7 on the [**9-8**], however, his hematocrit was then stable afterwards until discharge.
While the patient was in the Coronary Care Unit, he did have one episode of chest pain on [**9-7**], with lateral ST depressions, similar to previous episodes, which were again relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
We attempted to increase his Lopressor from 25 mg by mouth twice a day to 50 mg by mouth twice a day, however, the patient did have an episode of bradycardia which was symptomatic with nausea, vomiting and hypotension to systolic blood pressure of 65.
The patient quickly recovered with 1 liter of fluid resuscitation, and had no further episodes of bradycardia or hypotension after his Lopressor was again put back to 25 mg by mouth twice a day.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29050**] assured us that Mr. [**Known lastname 29051**] is at his baseline and typically will have an increase in his white blood cell count to as high as 45,000 during an illness, with resolution after the illness has resolved.
This was seen in the patient's CBC, where his white blood cell count increased to 29,000 after his right groin hematoma developed, and then came back down to his baseline of 15 to 20,000.
The differential on his white blood cell count had a monocytic predominance.
The patient has chronic anemia and does get Epogen 40,000 units weekly when his hematocrit falls below 36.
After his bleed into his right thigh hematoma, the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells, as his hematocrit was lingering at about 29 or 30.
His hematocrit was stable at 30 for four days before discharge.
Renal:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.1.
His creatinine was very stable during his hospital stay, and stayed at about 1.9 throughout his stay.
The patient remained afebrile once antibiotics were initiated, and his white count dropped down to his baseline between 15 and 19,000.
