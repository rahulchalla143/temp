The patient was restored to a point where he was ambulating with a cane, but in [**2121**], underwent a reoperation of his abdomen which was complicated by sepsis, shock, and coma.
The patient most recently had his tracheal T tube removed, and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].
Upon examination, the patient's airway demonstrated a normal larynx with a subglottic stenosis starting at the level of the first tracheal ring and extending for about 1.5 cm.
The patient was also noted to have a wire stent in his left main bronchus, which was noted to be patent.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 57%.
Patient's standard laboratory studies were noted to be within normal limits; his chest x-ray and electrocardiogram were noted to be normal.
Patient was successfully extubated in the operating room, and subsequently transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Patient's postoperative hematocrit was noted to be 34.
Followup bronchoscopy conducted on postoperative day #2 demonstrated a mild amount of respiratory secretions which were removed effectively with suctioning.
In addition, the patient's Coumadin was restarted and titrated for a target INR between 1.5-2.5.
On the evening of postoperative day #5, the patient was noted to have yet another episode of acute hypotension with systolic pressures falling to the mid 60's.
Once again, the patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were noted to be normal.
Following review of the patient's past medical records, it was noted that the patient had exhibited similar episodes of unexplained hypotension on prior admissions, which were at that point ascribed to adrenal insufficiency in the setting of steroid discontinuation and the patient on chronic low dose steroid therapy.
Repeat bronchoscopy conducted on postoperative day #7 demonstrated an intact anastomosis with some persistent granulation tissue noted at the patient's stent site.
Coumadin dose to be titrated by [**Company 191**], Anticoagulation nursing for a target INR of 1.5-2.5.
Coumadin level to be titrated by [**Company 191**], Anticoagulation nursing per standing arrangement prior to surgery for a target INR of 1.5-2.5; patient is to have next home blood draw for PT/INR on [**2125-6-29**].
The patient is to undergo autonomic dysfunction testing as an outpatient; the patient will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office within 2-3 days following discharge for test scheduling.
