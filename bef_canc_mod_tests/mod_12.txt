Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or evidence of hydrocephalus.
2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins  Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed.
Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no focal abnormality.
If there is continued clinical concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of IV contrast.
However, on the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating to sludge.
Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the CT appearance.
3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**] demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
#ID/sepsis Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating blood pressure, lactate 1.3.
His blood pressure in the ED was measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower).
His blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors were off.
Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas), blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on discharge.
Chest CT was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
CT head was negative.
The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no hematoma.
His hematocrit had been stable since then.
It should be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable.
RUQ ultrasound was done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension, thickened gallbladder.
Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable.
