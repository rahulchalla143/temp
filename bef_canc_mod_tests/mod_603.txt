Brief Hospital Course: Discharge summary  The patient was admitted to the [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery service on [**2147-11-7**] for evaluation and treatment of acute LLE ischemia.
She did well with this pain regimen and her lyrica was increased to 100 [**Hospital1 **] before discharge.
CV:  Vital signs were routinely monitored.
however, the morning of [**2147-11-8**] she was noticed to have decreasing pulse exam on the LLE and increasing pain that was different from her chronic pain.
Her LLE pulses were non-dopplerable whereas the day before they were.
She was briefly transferred to the CVICU over 24 hrs for closer monitoring of her blood pressures and pulses.
Cardiology was consulted post-op for elevated troponins, peak of 0.69, which continued to trend downward and resolved.
She had an echo that showed mild LV systolic dysfunction, trivial mitral regurgitation, and otherwise relatively unremarkable study.
Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
There was initial concern for a pulmonary mass seen on CXR on [**2147-11-8**] and due to her history of lung cancer, there was concern for recurrent.
The patient's diet was advanced when appropriate on POD 1 after her second surgery, which was tolerated well.
The patient's electrolytes were routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted when necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; her hct was low post-operatively and she was transfused multiple units of blood over the next few days with adequate increase in hct.
She was started on coumadin again, 4mg daily in hospital, and her INR remained therapeutic on discharge with INR of 3.9.
- Please take coumadin 3mg tonight on discharge and have your coumadin dosed by your PCP by tomorrow - You were started on pletal and pregabalin for your lower extremity pain  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] LAB Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**] Date/Time:[**2147-11-28**] 12:40 Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] LAB Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**] Date/Time:[**2147-11-28**] 1:40 Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] LAB Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**] Date/Time:[**2147-11-28**] 2:10 Provider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD Phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**] Date/Time: [**2147-12-4**] 3:00    Completed by:[**2147-11-16**
