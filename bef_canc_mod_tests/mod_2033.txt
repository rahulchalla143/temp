Chest x-ray done on [**4-11**] showed a persistent, but apparently stable left pleural effusion with no indication for drainage at that time.
She had no acute events over the next several days, however, remained in the hospital with close monitoring for her pulmonary status, which waxed and waned.
Prior to the VATS pleurodesis the patient underwent a swallow assessment, which she failed.
This was followed by a video swallow, which she also demonstrated high propensity toward aspiration.
On [**4-15**] the patient's chest x-ray showed a new white out of her left side with a small posterior upper fluid collection.
A repeat video swallow done on [**4-19**] continued to show high risk for aspiration.
Her creatinine slowly improved over the next two days and on [**4-22**] it is felt that the patient is stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
