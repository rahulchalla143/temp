Recommend further evaluation with chest CT.  RUE US [**12-13**] - Grayscale, color, and pulsed wave Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed on the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins.
Evaluation is slightly limited as the patient is not able to lie flat, and exam was performed with the patient sitting in a chair.
TTE [**12-13**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-22**], the moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and mild estimated pulmonary arterial hypertension are now better appreciated.
Chest CTA [**12-14**] - 1.
A speech and swallow evaluation was concerning for aspiration and suggested soft pureed foods only.
A chest CTA was obtained due to the patient's relatively [**Name2 (NI) 61519**] consolidation seen on admission CXR to rule out an underlying lung mass showed likely consolidation pneumonia.
# OSA: Sleep study from [**2097**] obtained from Dr.[**Name (NI) 61520**] office showed OSA with recommendations of CPAP at night with 9cm H2O.
Bilateral LE lymphedema and RUE lyphedema: Pt had a repeat TTE showing no signs of systolic failure but signs of diastolic failure and mild PA systolic HTN.
