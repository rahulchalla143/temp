CT ABDOMEN: There is small bilateral pleural effusion at the lung bases, with adjacent atelectasis.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A foley catheter seen within the bladder.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
The area where the perforation was, was cleaned off and this was repaired with interrupted [**Last Name (un) 34392**] sutures of 3-0 Nurolon with good supply.
Following an initial CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated ascites and a likely leak at the site of her ileo-colonic anastomosis, she was volume resuscitated and antibiotic therapy was initiated.
She was started on Meropenem and Caspofungin per ID recommendations for gram negative & positive organisms identified from abdominal wound culture.
Her ostomy output remained high and she was started on Loperamide, her output remained high.
Because of her high output she has been given IV fluids for replacement; her labs have been followed closely and her electrolytes have been stable (see pertinent results).
