In the ED her vitals were Tmax 101.4 BP 123/63 HR 100 RR 30 86% in RA with 99% on 4LNC.
According to the ED resident's verbal signout her oxygen sats improved to 99% on RA and was placed on 6L NC for comfort.
Her CXR was suspicous for pneumonia and she was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV once and combivent nebs.
Her hematocrit was found to be 14 and she received 1uPRBC and 1LNS.
On arrival to MICU her vitals were T 99.6 HR 117 BP 161/59 RR 35 100% on NRB 100%.

[**2114-1-14**] 5:38 pm URINE      Source: Catheter.
Studies: [**2114-1-13**] Chest x-ray - Retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is most likely atelectasis, however early developing pneumonia not entirely excluded.
[**2114-1-13**] CTA Chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
In a patient at low risk for intrathoracic malignancy, a dedicated followup CT should be obtained in one year; if high risk, a dedicated followup can be obtained in 6 to 12 months.
[**2114-1-15**] EKG - Technically difficult study.
Sinus rhythm Late R wave progression - probable normal variant.
[**2114-1-15**] TTECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[**2114-1-15**] Chest x-ray - IMPRESSION: Increasing right pleural effusion.
Empyema cannot be excluded on this examination and if there is continued clinical concern for empyema a dedicated chest CT with IV contrast is recommended.
[**2114-1-16**] Chest x-ray, lateral decubitus - IMPRESSION: Bilateral small pleural effusions.
The right-sided effusion is less than that matches the small amount of pleural effusion demonstrated on chest CT performed on [**2114-1-13**].
Urine Legionella antigen was negative.
She also had an ECHO to evaluate for CHF given an elevated BNP on admission.
Her ECHO was largely unremarkable except for an elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, likely secondary to pneumonia.
EKG was unremarkable.
As a result of this episode, consideration was given to tapping her pleural effusions to rule out empyema and AP and decubitus chest x-rays were performed, however, it was felt that there was too little fluid to tap, the patient's chest pain resolved, and she continued to improve clinically.
Given the severity of the patient's pneumonia, it is recommended that she have a follow-up chest x-ray in two months to evaluate for resolution.
In addition, given her smoking history and the pulmonary nodules that were noted on CTA, the patient should have a repeat CT scan in [**7-13**] months.
# Anemia - On arrival to the MICU, the patient received 2 additional units of blood and her hematocrit increased appropriately to 20 and she remained hemodynamically stable.
The anemia was also evaluated with haptoglobin (nl), nl folate, nl B12 and reticulocyte count which was appropriately elevated.
Iron studies demonstrated iron deficiency anemia but with an elevated ferritin.
The patient was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBCs on the medicine floor with an appropriate hematocrit increase to 26 that remained stable.
Serum IgA and tTG-IgA were also checked and did not indicate celiac sprue.
The patient was also advised to have her primary care physician check her hematocrit to ensure that it remains stable.
You were given an antibiotic for the pneumonia and five red blood cell transfusions because of the anemia.
You will also need further evaluation of your anemia as an outpatient.
