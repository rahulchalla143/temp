She had a Hct of 17 and INR of 8, but she had no evidence of RP bleed, ICH, etc.
She received a total of 5 units pRBC, and her Hct subsequently remained stable.
The results of this study were pending at the time of discharge.
At time of discharge, Hct was 36, and she appeared hemodynamically stable.
It was unclear why she was supratherapeutic with INR of 8, but pt may have confused the coumadin dosing.
She was reversed with FFP and vit K with good effect.
Coumadin was restarted shortly after admission, and she was bridged with a heparin drip while waiting for INR levels to be therapeutic.
