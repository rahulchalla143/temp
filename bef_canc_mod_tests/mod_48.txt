CXR [**3-12**]: A right IJ central line is present, tip over right atrium, relatively low.
Tib/Fib X-Ray [**3-14**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2129-1-29**], there is little overall change.
ECHO [**3-17**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-1-9**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat lower.
