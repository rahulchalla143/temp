Their exam noted mild tenderness in LLQ and normal cardipulmonary exam aside from tachycardia.He was found to have an elevated WBC count and treated with levo/flagyl empirically for presumed diverticulitis.
EKG revealed afib with rate of 171. nl axis.
TWI in V5 V6.
His pulse then dropped to 70 and SBP to 40.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were HR 116, BP 113/96.
Dopamine switched to dobutamine with out significant improvement in urine output.

Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with single-vessel coronary disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a moderately elevated left-sided filling pressure of 28 mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed no significant mitral regurgitation, normal wall motion, and a calculated ejection fraction of 60%.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the totally occluded OM1 with a 2.5x 8 mm Cypher DES.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow in the vessel .
EKG demonstrated afib,rate 79 bpm.

He initially required multiple pressors to support his blood pressure.
His hemodynamics were monitored with a PA catheter and he required an intra-aortic balloon pump to be placed.
Per the OSH ED record, the patient had a leukocytosis and some LLQ tenderness to palpation concerning for a possible abdominal infection.
CT or U/S.
Seen on CT was some stranding and thickening of the small bowel (could be explained by fluid overload).
TTE here showed global hypokinesis consistent with this.
An IABP was placed due to worsening cardiac status.
His CHF and BP were also medically managed and optimized towards the end of his hospital stay.
Cultures were negative.
His leukocytosis trended down and he remained afebrile.
An appointment with his PCP was scheduled two days after discharge in order to check another INR with a goal of [**1-25**].
Hepatitis serologies were negative LFTs were slowly trending down throughout his hospital stay.
Systolic and diastolic CHF, EF 15% (now 30%) 3.
Questionable sepsis, completed 7 day course of vanc/levo/flagyl empirically 7.
You have been intubated and sedated and received intravenous medications to keep your blood pressure and circulation stable.
Followup Instructions: You should have a lung function test (called PFTs) as an outpatient because you have been started on a drug called amiodarone to control your heart rate and rhythm.
This medication can sometimes compromise lung function and therefore you should have a baseline test to be scheduled by your PCP.
The so called INR should be checked which is a lab test to determine if your anticoagulation (blood thinning) on coumadin is accurate.
