She has had increased fatigue and increased sputum with blood tinges in the sputum.
In the Emergency Department, a blood gas was drawn which revealed 7.44/39/68.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Blood pressure was 155/60, pulse was 90, breathing at 35, oxygen saturation was 93% on a nonrebreather mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was dry but clear.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rate.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the left base.
Dullness to percussion at the left base.
Abdominal examination revealed obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data revealed white blood cell count was 20.1 (with 88% neutrophils, 4% bands, 3% lymphocytes), hematocrit was 35.4, platelets were 385.
Sodium was 138, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 40, creatinine was 1.8, and blood glucose was 210.
Creatine phosphokinase was 258, MB fraction was 2, troponin was 0.6.
Urinalysis was leukocyte esterase negative, moderate blood, nitrite positive, greater than 300 protein, 250 glucose, negative for ketones, 3 to 5 white blood cells, no bacteria, 3 to 5 epithelial cells.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, normal axis, and normal intervals.
A sputum Gram stain revealed 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters as well as greater than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high powered field.
The respiratory culture did not reveal any significant organisms at this time.
Her oxygen requirements continued to improve over her hospital course, and she was given aggressive chest physical therapy.
She was continued on levofloxacin which was appropriately dosed per her creatinine clearance.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have electrocardiogram changes compared to her previous electrocardiogram back in [**2182-5-31**].
Serial cardiac enzymes were drawn which revealed a peak creatine phosphokinase of 490, and a peak troponin level of 12.6 on hospital day two.
A further workup of her troponin leak was not performed secondary to her pneumonia and will need to be followed up for possible outpatient stress test for further evaluation.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have a baseline creatinine of around 1 and was noted to have an elevation in her creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ratio on admission.
Her lung examination deteriorated with fluids and was then aggressively diuresed.
A urine sodium was drawn which revealed a value of 14; suggesting a prerenal picture.
Her creatinine was noted to increase to a maximum of 2.9.
A 24-hour urine was collected to measure the amount of protein and albumin excreted which revealed an elevated albumin to creatinine ratio; suggesting that nephrotic syndrome may have been contributing to her lower extremity edema.
She was placed on standing NPH 40 units in the morning and 26 units in the evening with a regular insulin sliding-scale with fingerstick checks four times per day.
The Learning Center was consulted to instruct the patient on optimal blood sugar management and was to be discharged home on this regimen.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have an abrupt drop in her hematocrit after hydration from a value of 35.4 down to a nadir of 26.6.
There was no indication of hemolysis during this decrease in her hematocrit, and no further issues were seen with regard to her anemia.
The patient to follow up with her primary care physician within two weeks; at which time her renal function will again be monitored, as well as further evaluation of her lower extremity edema and volume status.
She will also need a Cardiology evaluation for her troponin leak.
