[**8-12**] EKG: rate 140s, atrial fibrillation, slight borderline ST depressions in V4-V5 distribution, normal axis  [**8-12**] CT abdoman and pelvis: \ 1.
Biopsies were sent for histology and cmv.The biopsy for CMV was done at about 35cm where there were ulcerations.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 55cm.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 40cm.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 15cm.
Impression: Erythema, punched out ulceration, cobblestoning and exudate in the colon (biopsy, biopsy, biopsy) Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure at 55cm Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results TPN.
Her CT abdomen was unrevealing but a flex sig was consistent with active Crohns, with unremarkable stool studies.
#Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a one year history of atrial fibrillation and presented with AF with RVR, with a ventricular rate in the 150s.
Her rate was initially difficult to control, but she eventually responded to titration of her metoprolol and diltiazem.
Her hypotension was responsive to fluid resuscitation and was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia due to massive GI losses and diminished cardiac output from atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Her blood pressure remained stable while on the floor.
#Anemia of chronic disease: Her hematocrit remained stable during hospitalization.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Crohn's disease flare - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response  Secondary: - Hyperlipidemia - Anemia of chronic disease - Skin furuncle  Discharge Condition: Home in good condition.
A sigmoidoscopy was performed, which showed erythema, ulceration, cobblestoning and exudate in the colon.
