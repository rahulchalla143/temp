However, during this day the patient had an increase in creatinine from 1.3 to 1.7.
Urine eos were negative, and FeNa was <1%.
During the entire hospital stay patients WBC count were at his baseline of 1.9-2.1 with Hgb ~10 g/dL and ~30,000 plts.
Due to the patient's low platalet count and morbid obesity, he was scheduled for USG-guided therapeutic parasentesis on [**7-18**], which was done sucessfully and drained 6.5 L of peritoneal fluid.

You improved,  but your abdomen got tense and your urine culture was positive for ESBL E. coli.

You were given albumin and fluids back, your lactulose was further tappered down and with this management your creatinine improved back to normal (measurement of kidney function).
During the entire hospital course your white blood cells and platelets were low, but quite the same level as before.
We did a urine culture in this hospital, which grew enterococcus.
