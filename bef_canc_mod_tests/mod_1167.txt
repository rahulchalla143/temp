[**2117-10-6**]: CT angiogram of abdomen and pelvis  Preliminary Report !!
CT sensitivity for a slow-flow GI bleed is very low.
A RBC-tagged nuclear scan can be considered if a more sensitive test is desired.
Blood and clots were seen mostly in the distal colon (distal sigmoid and rectum).
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: 54M with h/o HIV (CD4 28 in [**6-5**]), HCV cirrhosis, s/p OLT in [**2112**], HCV recurrence, DM2, recently admitted thrice for rising LFTs, multiple biopsies concerning for acute cellular rejection presenting with BLE edema and BRBPR  Hematochezia- patient had hematochezia at home with a 7 point HCT drop.
There he underwent a colonoscopy and endocsocpy which showed no active bleeding and no interventions were taken.
As it was felt this may be from his small bowel he udnerwent a CT angiogram of his abdomen which showed no bleeding sites that could be intervened upon palliatively.
His HCT was stable at the time of discharge at 24.
His bilirubin was markedly elevated at 40 on admission, and his LFTs were worsening.
He was started on treatment for HRS with midodrine and octreotide.He will be sent home on midodrine to help with his blood pressure as well.
