He had a CT scan at that point which ruled out AAA rupture.
He was initially on dopamine but once it was determined that thigh BPs were higher than arms, he was quickly weaned off.

Denied CP, SOB, cough, fever, dizziness, N/V/D but did endorse abdomen more distended.

CXR (portable AP) [**2201-5-15**]: Again seen is a pacemaker with dual leads seen projecting in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with a 5 cm AAA and penetrating thoracic aortic ulcerations, CHF with EF 30-35%, DM, ESRD on HD(MWF) via LUE AV fistula, carotid disease, chronic dyspnea on 3LNC, previous MSSA bacteremia presents from dialysis with hypotension.
During this prior admission, it was determined that the blood pressures in his right upper extremity were significantly different (by 100 points) from his right thigh pressures, and it was recommended that blood pressures be checked in the patient's thigh.
Based on this information, the patient's right thigh pressure was checked and was found to be in the 200s.
As before, the patient had a significant difference between his his right arm and thigh blood pressures.
Antihypertensives were initially held, but the right thigh blood pressure rose to the 230s during ultrafiltration on [**2201-5-17**].
Lisinopril and metoprolol were restarted, with improvement in the patient's right blood pressure to the 160s.
Consideration was given to whether the patient's arm-thigh blood pressure difference might be a sign of acute aortic pathology.
The same concern was raised during the patient's [**Date range (1) 29411**] admission, during which CT angiography of the chest from showed extensive but stable aortic atherosclerotic disease, and CTA of the abdomen and pelvis showing the patient's known abdominal aortic aneurysm without evidence of leak or rupture.
The patient's arm-thigh blood pressure difference was discussed with the vascular team who cared for the patient during his prior admission.
They concluded that it was very difficult to determine the patient's true aortic blood pressure, which was probably somewhere in between the blood pressures that were being measured in the patient's arm and thigh.
At the time of discharge, the patient's right thigh blood pressure was in the 160s, and his right arm blood pressure was in the 110s with a pediatric cuff.
Leukocytosis: WBC count was elevated to 12.2 on admission, but the patient had no fever or focal signs of infection.
CXR showed some atelectasis but no infiltrate.
The patient's oxygen requirement remained at his baseline of 3L.
A blood culture showed no growth to date at the time of discharge.
Right red blood per rectum: The patient's hematocrit remained stable during his admission.
The nurses were not certain if the bleeding was coming from the patient's GI or GU tract, but the patient refused urinalysis for further evaluation of this.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care doctor for further evaluation of the bleeding.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for bright red blood on toilet paper.
The patient may also require further evaluation with colonoscopy.
It was determined that there is a difference between the blood pressure in your arm and the blood pressure in your thigh.
You had a small amount of blood in your urine or stool, but your blood counts were stable.
