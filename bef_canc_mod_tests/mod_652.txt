PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure 82/60, pulse rate 110.
General appearance - She is an alert white female, cachectic in appearance.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination shows tongue is midline but fissured.
Pulse examination - Carotids are palpable without bruits.
The right popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are absent.
Chest examination - The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination is scaphoid and soft, nontender, nondistended, no bruits, masses.
The rectal examination was deferred secondary to just completing an arteriogram.
The bone/joint examination shows feet ruborous, cold bilaterally, equal.
Neurological examination is unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 30.2, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 539,000, differential neutrophils 84, bands 6, lymphocytes 8, monocytes 1, no eosinophils or basophils.
Blood urea nitrogen was 11 and creatinine 0.5, potassium 3.4 which was repleted.
Serial CKs were obtained which were 136, 121, and 120.
CK MB were 8, 6.
Troponin remained less than 0.3.
TSH was obtained which was 0.69 which is normal.
Preoperative chest x-ray was remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with increased density in the right lung apex.
The patient had a P-MIBI done on [**2158-11-20**], which showed abnormal myocardial perfusion with severe fixed defect in the inferior wall toward the base with a mild amount of reversibility in the distal anterior wall extending into the apex and inferior apex.
Global ejection fraction is diminished to 46% with hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Preoperative electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature depolarizations.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area on [**2158-11-14**].
Her postoperative hematocrit was 37.5.
Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 11 and 0.5, respectively, potassium 4.3 and repleted.
Initial CK was 136.
Their recommendation was this was most likely MAT and that they would recommend check the postoperative chest x-ray for rule out for any infectious process that might be causing the tachycardia, begin Verapamil 40 mg three times a day and titrate to maintain the heart rate less than 60 and a systolic blood pressure greater than 100.
Recommended echocardiogram prior to discharge.
Check TSH to rule out thyroid disease.
On postoperative day two, she continued to remain the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued hemodynamic monitoring and diuresis with heart rates between 80 and 120.
Verapamil dosing adjusted to maintain her heart rate less than 100.
Her white blood cell count was 20.0, she was defervescing.
Her pulse examination remained unchanged.
She underwent a P-MIBI on postoperative day six which was positive for inferior wall myocardial infarction with some reversibility.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100 and heart rate less than 55.
