PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of admission, vital signs with temperature 103.0 F.; blood pressure 100/56; heart rate 128; respiratory rate 16; O2 saturation 79% on room air.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally anterior only.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial Doppler-able pulses bilaterally, posterior tibial greater than the dorsalis pedis.
LABORATORY:  At time of admission, white count 22.9, hematocrit 34.8, sodium 132, potassium 4.3, chloride 95, CO2 22, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, glucose 99.
Cultures from [**1-1**] showed Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase positive, Oxicillin resistant.
Chest x-ray showed no pleural effusions, no infiltrates, no congestive heart failure and no pneumonia.
Given his past admission and catheterization revealing three-vessel disease, cardiac enzymes were sent and it showed a positive troponin and therefore the Cardiology Service was consulted.
The patient underwent an angiogram of his lower extremity which showed infra-popliteal three-vessel occlusions.
Cardiology was again consulted to review his catheterization which was done in [**2166-10-13**].
In summary, the catheterization showed he had a co-dominant system with obstructive three-vessel disease.
He had elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a wedge of 18.
Calculated cardiac output was 6.1.
His Swan-Ganz catheter was removed and his chest tubes were also removed.
At that time, his physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs, temperature 98.0 F.; heart rate 79 and sinus rhythm; blood pressure 120/65; respiratory rate 18; O2 saturation 98% on two liters nasal prongs.
Weight preoperatively was 140 kilograms; at discharge it is 149 kilograms.
Laboratory data, white count 10.7, hematocrit 24, platelets 404.
Sodium 135, potassium 5.0, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 23, creatinine 1.1, glucose 106.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally; somewhat diminished in the bases bilaterally.
Peripheral vascular disease status post incision and     drainage of the left foot; wound culture positive for     Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
