In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have oxygen saturation of 50% in room air which improved to 70% on five liters, 87% on 100% nonrebreather mask.
He was given Lasix 40 mg intravenous in the Emergency Department with 1800 ccs of urine output and decreased FIO2 to 10 liters with oxygen saturation to 90%.
Chest angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed temperature 99.0, blood pressure 104/69, pulse 102, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 87% on 100% nonrebreather mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Motor examination is grossly normal.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count is 7.6, hematocrit 44.0, platelets 199,000.
Sodium 134, potassium 3.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine 0.7, glucose 249.
INR 1.1, prothrombin time 13.1, partial thromboplastin time 26.3.
Urinalysis showed moderate blood, no nitrites, trace protein, negative glucose, negative ketone, 3 red blood cells, 20 white blood cells, few bacteria and no yeast.
Arterial blood gases was done with pH 7.44, pCO2 34, pO2 66.
CT angiogram of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, diffuse increased interstitial markings with patchy areas of ground glass opacifications most pronounced at the bases.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 105 beats per minute, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block, normal intervals, no ST segment changes, no Q waves and there were no changes from his electrocardiogram from [**2150-3-26**].
The patient had a blood culture from [**2150-11-1**], that showed enterococcus as well as coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus that was Methicillin resistant.
There were four out of four blood cultures that were positive including two that were drawn from his port-a-cath and two that were drawn peripherally.
Urine culture was negative.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral coarse interstitial pattern, mild progression since [**3-26**], no consolidation or effusion, stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
Lower extremity Doppler showed normal evaluation in the common femoral, superficial femoral vessels bilaterally.
Pulmonary embolus was ruled out in the Emergency Department with a chest CT angiogram.
He was also initially started on Levaquin for coverage of a possible pneumonia associated with his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as his chest x-ray showed increased interstitial infiltrate.
This was thought to be due to sepsis as his blood cultures came back four out of four bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin.
While on the Medicine floor, he has continued to receive Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q4hours and his Solu-Medrol was switched to p.o.
The patient has a baseline oxygen requirement and while he was on the Medicine floor, his oxygen requirement was titrated to keep his oxygen saturation around the high 80s to low 90s.
On discharge, the patient was on five liters of nasal cannula oxygen with oxygen saturation in the low 90s.
He initially denied any chest pain on admission and electrocardiogram was similar to his prior electrocardiogram in [**2150-3-26**].
He was initiated on Levophed to keep his blood pressure elevated.
His hypotension was thought to be secondary to sepsis and he was gradually weaned off Levophed and transferred to the Medicine floor when his blood pressure was stable off pressors for more than 48 hours.
His blood pressure has been stable over the last 36 hours at 110/70, and this is likely his baseline.
Blood cultures, four out of four bottles, cultured from his port-a-cath and peripherally, grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin sensitive Enterococcus.
His blood sugar was stable throughout his hospital course and he was continued on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet.
