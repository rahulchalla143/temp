Diastolic function could not be assessed.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
CT CHEST: Axial imaging makes it clear that the process is generalized relatively symmetric from side to side and more severe in the dependent, i.e., posterior lungs.
But, the conventional chest radiograph performed [**2191-1-18**] which showed unequivocal right lower lobe pneumonia also showed a large ground-glass abnormality in the perihilar left lung and right apex medially which could have been the early stages of the current process.
Mild central adenopathy is new since [**2188**]: in the prevascular mediastinal station for example, 1 characteristic node is 8 mm, another 7 mm, previously 5 and 7 mm respectively, and in the right lower paratracheal station a node grew from 8 mm to 11.5 mm.
CXR [**4-16**]: Since the prior chest x-ray, the endotracheal tube has been removed.
CXR [**4-17**]: Compared to the study from the prior day, there has been no significant interval change.
CXR [**4-18**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-17**]: Endotracheal tube ends between 3 and 4 cm above the carina, a right PIC line tip projects over the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, and a dual-channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the upper and mid right atrium, all in standard placements.
Contribution of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage or organizing interstitial pneumonitis should not be discounted.
EKG [**4-18**]: Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-4-11**] the T wave inversions seen in leads V1-V3 are much less prominent at that time.
Hypoxic respiratory failure - Patient came to the hospital with progressive SOB over the last week, orthopnea, weight loss, no fever or cough.
Initial WBC 11.4, 86.3% PMNs and no bands and a lactate of 2.4.
Her NT-proBNP was 8012 while her prior values were in the [**2180**] range.
Her oxygen requirements continued to worsen and her SpO2 dropped to mid 80s on 6 L NC and 75% high-flow.
After extensive discussion it was decided to intubate her for a bronchoscopy and CT scan with a maximum of 5 days.
Bronchoscopy showed normal lungs; BAL showed PMNs, but no bacteria.
CT scan showed non-cardiac ARDS that could be compatible with drug toxicity, non-cardiac edema (ARDS)including acute interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and cryptogenic organizing pneumponia.
Once cultures negative and with no clear picture it was decided to give a 3-day burst of methylprednisolone 125 mg QID and then go down to slowly to 40 mg, which if she survives she should continue for 2-3 months with a very slow [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] for pneumonitis/AIP.
CXR showed no new processes.
Her dry weight is ~164.
She had S3 on exam and increase JVP to the jaw.
Her echocardiogram showed preserved EF with diastolic dysfunction and no WMA.
Her CE were negative and there were no ECG changes.
Her CXR did never show clear alveolar infiltrates and she was too unstable and with too high oxygen requirements to be taken to the CT scanner.
After intubation and further data it was thought she had a pneumonitis (medication effect, AIP, etc).
This was changed to linezolid to also cover her VAP on [**4-13**].
All subsequent blood cultures (drawn [**4-6**] to [**4-10**]) were negative.
Her PTH is 39 with a target of 70-110.
Anemia - Pt with HCT of 24.3 with borderline normocytic (MCV 99) microcytic anemia with RDW of 25.1.
Iron 122, ferritin 249, TIBC 424, TRF 326 anemia of chronic kidney disease.
Repeat iron studies showed iron 81, TIBC 228, and Ferritin 723, though this was in the setting of previous blood transfusions.
It has been stable since with a HCT around 26.
thrombocytopenia - her plts dropped from 140s to 105 after starting cefepime and linezolid.
Her platelets should be checked every few days to ensure stability and improvement.
6. insulin humalog insulin per attached sliding scale 7. lab work please check platelets every 3 days until stable/improved.
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
You will need to have extensive physical therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation and close monitoring in an extended care facility.
