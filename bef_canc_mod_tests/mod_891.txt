Lips thought to be [**3-11**] biting but due to abdominal ecchomyses a Hct was checked and found to be down (28.2).
Transferred to medical floor where further labs revealed Creatinine 3.4 (elevated) and WBC 11.7.
Medical team was initially concerned about DIC, however fibrinogen was 551 and D-Dimer was 1.08/plt 404K, and INR was 1.2.
Given her renal failure, intial workup showed a positive UA growing GNRs.
She was started on levofloxacin on [**2156-10-10**], switched to fosfomycin due to her cultures growing ESBL presumably resistant to FQ's.
With her HCT drop, she was guiaced reportedly several times, all which were negative.
She had a Renal US which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or lithiasis in either kidney.
Her txplt kidney was 11 cm with no evidence of hydroneprhosis.

TTE [**2156-10-14**]: - Peak Ao grad 39, mean grad 20, peak velocity 3.1, Ao area 1.1 cm2 -There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35 %) secondary to extensive severe apical hypokinesis/akinesis with focal dyskinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
-Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-8-6**], there has been significant worsening of left ventricular and right ventricular contractile function.
CT abd without contrast [**10-19**]: 1.
TEE [**10-20**]: negative for endocarditis .
[**10-27**] Tagged WBC scan: 1.

Initial EEG interpretation [**2156-10-22**]: Diffuse theta slowing with superimposed bursts of delta slowing.
Pt's blood pressure remained lower than baseline, most likely secondary to worsening cardiac function and developing sepsis.
Her platlets and RBC counts dropped dramatically most likely due to DIC.
#  [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD:  Creatinine 3.4 on adm from baseline of approx 1.3-1.5.
No new medications per patient or medical history to suggest cause of AIN and urine eos negative.
OSH sensitivities only to carbapenems and cefotetan.
Repeat ucx on [**10-18**] showed persistence of multi-drug resistant Klebsiella likely colonization in the setting of clearing of pyuria on UA.
Pt had again repeat UA [**10-23**] which was neg.
Pt with repeat UAs on [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] with significant pyuria and many bacteria.
UCx from [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] returned with >100K Klebsiella, so pt restarted on tigecycline [**10-27**] with plan for 3wk course of complicated UTI.
Pt with CXR neg for infiltrate, negative cdiff, stool cx neg, no acute process on CT abd/pelvis and no evidence of endocarditis on TEE.
CMV VL and BK virus neg.
Tagged WBC scan showing focus in nose and RLQ.
WBC persistently elevated in 13-16 range; WBC count normalized [**10-31**].
Head CT neg.
Repeat head CT neg.
EEG was attached and showed moderate diffuse background slowing c/w encephalopathy.
EEG showed increased sharp wave activity suggestive of brain irritability.
Psych [**Month/Year (2) 6349**] the pt and agreed may be component of catatonia but treatment would be benzos; held off on benzos in the setting of lethargy.
CSF studies not suggestive of infection.
# Hypoxia: on ABG [**10-25**].
CXR c/w volume overload and vascular congestion, pulm edema and pleural effusions.
# Drop in plts in the setting of abnormal RBC smear: Plt count has decreased from 500-600s to low 200s where stable.
Cards recommends slow bolusing with close monitoring of volume status.
No evidence of volume overload on CXR or exam initially.
Pt had PPM interrogation which was unremarkable.
Cards said that pt is not candidate for revascularization after review of cath from [**8-/2156**] and valvular disease gradients not severe enough to merit valvular repair.
TSH elevated with low T4 and T3.
Information was obtained from webOMR OSH Record.
