Echocardiogram: [**2160-10-14**] The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-15**] , estimated pulmonary artery pressure is now lower.
[**2160-10-24**] RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Using the linear probe, grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal vessels were performed.
He was monitored on telemetry.
Pt spiked temps, had (+) bld and line cx's--bld cx grew enterococcus and PICC line grew coag negative staph.
Fevers thought to be due to bacteremia--bld cx's grew enterococcus (last (+) blood cx from [**10-14**]), which was sensitive to vanco.
Subsequent surveillane cultures were negative.
Pt underwent TEE which was negative for endocarditis or paravalvular abscess.
Given no clear source for enterococcal baceremia & plan for pacemaker in near future, ID recommended longer course of Abx--4 weeks total, starting from date of last positive blood culture [**2160-10-15**].
FK level monitored closely and adjusted for goal level of 4 to 6.
Baseline Hct mid to low 20's.
# DM2: Pt's glucose was managed with humalog sliding scale & daily glargine.
Baseline Crt 1.5 - 2.2; pt currently 1.9. .
Repeat echo (EF>65%) & mild LVH, trivial MR & TR.
Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate 15 g/60mL Suspension Sig: Two (2)  PO q2HR PRN hyperkalemia  for 1 doses.

MR. [**Known lastname 1182**] will require a number of blood tests be drawn regularly, see below.
Weekly, on Wednesdays, CBC with differential, BUN, & Crt, LFTs and vancomycin trough need to be checked.
Blood cultures need to be drawn at the rehab facility on [**2160-11-14**] and [**2160-11-21**].
