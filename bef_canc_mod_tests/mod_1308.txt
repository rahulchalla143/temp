CHF with an ejection fraction of 20%, 1+ AR, 2+ MR from a    [**2168-7-26**] echocardiogram.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of    2.0 to 2.5).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 97.3, blood pressure of 139/54, heart rate of 75, respiratory rate of 14, and O2 saturation of 97% on room air.
Heart exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a white count of 5.0, a hematocrit of 33.0, an INR of 1.1, a BUN of 48, a creatinine of 2.4, a CK of 22.
STUDIES:  An echocardiogram from [**2168-7-26**] with an EF of 20%.
A catheterization from [**2167-7-27**] shows 1-VD, status post RCA stent, severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
A chest x-ray from [**2169-8-17**] shows vascular redistribution in the upper zones consistent with edema; and no effusion.
EKG reveals AFib, V paced at 75 beats per minute, no concordance or ST elevations over 5 mm.
A repeat    echocardiogram was performed which showed an EF of 30% and    an increased TR gradient up to 60; representing worsened    pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient continued to    diurese well, although his creatinine started to climb up.
Creatinine stabilized at 2.8.
Over the next several    days, his creatinine increased to 3.2.
The patient diuresed well and    creatinine stabilized at 3.1.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: The patient stabilized his    creatinine at 3.1.
