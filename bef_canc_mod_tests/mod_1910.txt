She was at home, and earlier today developed substernal chest pressure that was persistent.
She was tachycardic to the low 100s, but BP remained stable.
She received nitro SL and morphine which improved her CP to [**2155-3-20**].
GI was called, and felt the patient should have reversal of her INR (4.5).
Her BP remained stable, and her HR improved to the 80s.
Her vitals prior to transfer to the MICu were 110/65, 89, 20, 98% 3L.
She did complain of some dyspnea/tachypnea prior to transfer, but her O2 sats remained 98% with 3L of O2.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
CXR [**2-3**]:Findings suggesting mild congestive heart failure.
CT head, CTA head/neck, CTP [**2155-2-7**] NON-CONTRAST CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial or parenchymal hemorrhage.
The bilateral basal ganglia show small hypoattenuations consistent with old lacunar infarcts.
CT PERFUSION: There is increased mean transit time in a large right MCA territory distribution in the right frontoparietal region.
Rotation of the C1 over C2 vertebra is likely positional in nature.
CT head [**2155-2-8**] IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
HbA1c 5.5 LDL 33   Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG with only patent LIMA-LAD, COPD, HTN, afib who presents with hematochezia, anemia, and angina, sent to MICU initally where she was transfused with HCT back up to 31, c/b NSTEMI with CHF.
Code stroke was called and pt was found to have R MCA embolic infarct on CT head.
Her coumadin has been re-started and her hematocrit has remained stable.
Her LDL was 33 and HbA1c was 5.5.
Her INR on day of transfer ([**2-14**]) was 3.1 and today's dose will be held.
Her hematocrit has remained stable in the low 30s.
Gastroenterology plans to perform a colonoscopy as an outpatient in [**6-24**] weeks.
Her lisinopril has been resumed and her blood pressure has been well-controlled.
Now with EF 20-30% severely dropped form 50% in [**2153**], likely due to NSTEMI.
Given her above h/o GIB complicated by NSTEMI, cardiology/GI consults recommended that due to her CHADS2 score of 3 she should be restarted on ASA 325mg once her GIB was stabilized.
Despite these efforts the pt suffered from an embolic stroke entailed above and therefore will be continued on coumadin with goal INR [**2-19**].
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Adjust as needed for goal INR [**2-19**].
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
