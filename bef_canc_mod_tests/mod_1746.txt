Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate but chronic linear densities at the left lung base and fine reticular pattern at days with improvement, but five days prior to admission, she developed cough productive of yellow sputum and fevers to 101??????
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.
Colonoscopy in [**2103-3-1**] with hyperplastic rectal polyp.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.7, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count 258.
Chest x-ray was notable for multiple patchy opacities of the right lower lobe and left lower lobe consistent with focal consolidation.
Of note, blood cultures were drawn after all antibiotics were started.
Chest x-ray demonstrated no change with numerous patchy infiltrates and diffuse linear pattern consistent with infiltrate versus interstitial fibrosis.
Past chest x-rays demonstrated small amounts of interstitial fibrosis consistent with underlying lung disease.
CT scan demonstrated ground-glass opacification mostly in the right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia.
A blood gas on [**2-8**] demonstrated 7.38, 63, 106, in a woman whose baseline pCO2 is in the 40s.

All sputum cultures have also been negative to date, as well as legionella, influenzae and other viral cultures.
If she continues to maintain her oxygen saturation on pressure support 5 and 5, extubation will be attempted today.
In addition, the urine culture that grew gram positive cocci, was likely treated by the above antibiotics.
C-diff times two was negative, but white blood cell count started to rise, Flagyl was added empirically, and soon after her white blood cell count normal.
She remains total body fluid overloaded but intravascularly depleted up until 2-3 days ago when her blood pressure stabilized.
She tolerated diuresis on the 26th quite well with no decrease in her blood pressures.
A lumbar puncture was performed which was negative for any bacteria or white blood cells.
The patient was then started on Versed drip once the lumbar puncture was negative and was maintained on this during the course of her hospitalization.

Endometrial stripe was within normal limits for a woman of this age.
The patient required blood transfusions at intermittent points during this hospitalization to maintain her hematocrit, but hematocrit has been stable for the last several days.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient has been maintained on tube feeds per her G-tube.
He also stated that if her immunoglobulins were within normal limits, she did not need an IVIG transfusion during this hospitalization.
