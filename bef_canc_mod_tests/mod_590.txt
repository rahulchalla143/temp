Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-2-28**] the atrial morphology has changed and the rate has slowed.
Coagulation studies were checked and found to be within normal limits.
During her admission she received 1 unit of PRBC and HCT then remained stable.
The GI service was consulted on admission and thought there was no role for colonoscopy for now as this likely represented a diverticular bleed.
Given that her HCT remained stable for three days post-initial transfusion, she was discharged home with follow-up.
Specifically, she will have a HCT check by VNA 3 days post-discharge and will be seen by her PCP 6 days post-discharge.
# Hypertension:  Anti-hypertensives were initially held given concern for potential hemodynamic instability.
Calcium 600 + D 600-400 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
You were found to have bleeding from your intestines, likely from diverticuli as you've had this in the past.
You were transfused one unit of blood and your blood levels have been stable since.
