She was evaluated with numerous electrocardiograms which showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia.
Heme:  The patient received one blood transfusion over this last weekend for a hematocrit which had drifted down slowly to 26.5 on [**10-11**].
She responded well to that and her hematocrit the following day was 30.2.
Several Clostridium difficile were sent which came back positive on [**10-6**] and Clostridium difficile cultures subsequent to that proved her to be negative.
She is receiving Vancomycin which was started on [**10-11**] after it was noted that her right groin incision had some serosanguinous discharge which was sent off for culture, which as for now is preliminarily negative with a Gram stain showing no organisms and 2+ PMNs.
Her white count is 10.6.
