History of congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 45%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 97.5, 60, 20, blood pressure 114/50, O2 saturation 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is unremarkable.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable.
Extremity examination shows warm extremities with two dry gangrenous lesions on the left hallux without erythema or drainage.
Neurologic examination is intact, nonfocal, oriented x3.
Pulse examination shows palpable femorals bilaterally, Dopplerable popliteal artery pulses bilaterally.
His white count was 9.2, hematocrit 35.3, BUN 46, creatinine 1.4.
Chest x-ray was obtained which was negative for congestive heart failure and pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram was a sinus rhythm bradycardic.
No wound culture was obtained at the time of the patient's assessment in the emergency room but urine cultures and blood cultures were obtained which finalized at no growth.
Patient underwent pulmonary vascular resistances of the left extremity which showed forefoot pressures of 7 mm.
His post BUN and creatinine remained stable.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed left atrium normal size.
Left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Compared with previous echocardiogram done [**2174-6-1**] there was no change.
Patient's calculated ejection fraction was 40 to 45%.
The resting and stress perfusion images demonstrated moderate reversible perfusion defect in the anterior wall and apex that is more prominent when compared to [**2174-11-21**].
Gated imaging revealed normal wall motion and the calculated ejection fraction is 49%.
They felt that there was no further cardiac evaluation indicated at this time.
Patient continued to do well and was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.
Postoperative enzymes were negative.
Patient's heart rate was well controlled on Toprol XL 25 mg and nifedipine CR 30 mg. Postoperative day #2 the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
The patient's Toprol was increased and his diltiazem was also increased for a goal heart rate of 60s to 70s and his beta blockade and calcium channel blocker would need to be adjusted for blood pressure greater than 110 to 120.
Patient was placed on drip and rate adjusted for rate control and blood pressure control.
Pulmonary vascular resistances were obtained.
His INR should be monitored on a daily basis until the patient is in a steady therapeutic state of goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
He will keep his foot elevated when not ambulating.
Status post echocardiogram with positive ischemic changes     and an ejection fraction to 40 to 45%.
Status post diagnostic arteriogram and left run off on     [**2176-8-25**].
