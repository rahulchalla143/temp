He had a head CT there which showed 2.5 cm left temporal hemorrhage.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, his BP was 220/98 and his speech was normal.
This resolved with BP was better controlled.
He had a head CT which was negative and echo which showed PFO and atrial septal aneurysm.

All antiplatelet agents were held and his INR was reversed.
He had an MRI/MRA with gadolinium to evaluate the extent of the bleed and to assess for vascular malformation or underlying mass.
MRI of the brain demonstrates an acute left lateral temporal lobe hematoma with mild surrounding edema, as seen on the CT scan of earlier in the day.
He had a repeat head CT on [**10-27**] which showed no progression of the bleed.
On hospital day #2, his blood pressure medications were transitioned to oral meds and his blood pressure remained resonably well controlled although he required several doses of IV metoprolol to maintain SBP<140.
An cardiac ehco was performed on [**10-28**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
He was transfered to the neurology floor on [**10-28**] where his neurologic exam remained unchanged.
His anti-hypertensives were increased to improve BP control.
He will have a repeat head CT in 6 weeks (on [**2140-12-28**]) and should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the following week ([**2141-1-3**]).
At his follow up visit, we will consider the option of re-starting Coumadin (perhaps low dose to maintain INR between 1.5-2.5).
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
Amyloid Angiopathy 3.
You should have a repeat CT scan of the head in six weeeks (see appointments below).
Your systolic blood pressure should be maintained under 140.
