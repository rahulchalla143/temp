She did have occasional episodes of minimal epistaxis which was managed with courses of afrin and supportive measures and her hematocrit remained stable after 3 total units of blood transfusions.
She did have some pressure headaches from the packing which was stable on percocet and dilaudid as needed.
2)s/p MVR: for severe mitral regurgitation 6 yrs ago-- stable for now-- initially coumadin held and reversed with vitamin K and 2units of FFP and eventually she was restarted on coumadin with goal INR around 2.5-3.0 as her risk of bleeding is significant.
During her stay she was bridged with heparin until INR was therapeutic.
She was transfused total of 3units of PRBC and her hematcrit remained stable above 30 during the rest of her stay, she was also restarted on her home epogen regemin.
