CXR was clear.
Urine culture and blood cultures are pending.
Patient's BP was in the 110s so hydralazine was stopped.
increase in cardiomegaly on CXR, she got an echo yesterday.
We did evaluated the PHTN with a VQ scan which was unremarkable, making chronic thromboembolic disease much lower on the differential.
She underwent CT head, and V/Q scan which were unremarkable.
Peritoneal dialysis cultures negative so far.
BCx, UCx (final neg), Peritoneal cultures negative at discharge.
# Anemia: Hct stable around 20.
S/p 1 U PRBCs in MICU with Hct 20.1 to 21.9.
Prior SVC thrombus: Physical exam with L arm swelling consistent with this.
INR 3.5 on ICU admission.
Blood pressures at baseline.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with high blood pressure and right leg/hip pain.
Your blood pressure then dropped which was caused by the pain medication, and you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) where you recovered quickly.
However, the cultures that were obtained were negative, and we discontinued the Antibiotics.
During your hospitalization, your blood pressure normalized on your home regimen, and your right leg/hip pain resolved.
You had an MRI of your hip done, which did not show an acute infection.
