Mr. [**Known lastname **] past history is remarkable for Stage 3 rectal cancer, status post pelvic exenteration performed in [**2187**] at an outside hospital with a subsequent development of an enterocutaneous fistula in the perineum.
On [**2188-3-11**], the patient underwent fistula repair along with J-tube placement after preoperative nutritional supplementation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 94, blood pressure 102/61, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The perineal examination demonstrates mild purulent drainage from a small fistulous opening.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies revealed white blood cell count 8.9 with a hematocrit of 27.1 and platelet count of 289.
The calcium was 4.7 with a magnesium of 0.3.
The creatinine was 1.1.
The urinalysis demonstrated greater than 50 white blood cells, although there were multiple species of bacteria present.
IMAGING:  A chest x-ray done at the time of admission did not demonstrate evidence of pneumonia.
His electrolytes were repleted and, prior to being evaluated by the Surgical Service, the right femoral vein line was placed.
Given his high volume of urostomy output and stool output he was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for volume resuscitation.
Given the purulent material witnessed at the site of the prior fistulous tract, a computerized tomography scan was done to assess for an intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic fluid collection.
The computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large 4 by 6 cm abscess present in the pelvis.
Using the prior fistulous tract, a computerized tomographic-guided drainage of this abscess was performed.
His blood pressure was stabilized with intravenous fluids and no pressor support.
His urostomy and colostomy output was repleted with normal saline 4 cc.
The patient's culture results from the abscess drainage demonstrated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus and Corynebacterium.
His drain output remained approximately 20 to 50 cc/day.
