He subsequently presented to LGH, where a CT abdomen was performed and demonstrated a large mass located within segment 7 of his liver.
Given this finding, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On initial evaluation, Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] was noted to be tachycardic to 115 and hypotensive to SBP of 85, with modest improvement s/p administration of 1L crystalloid.

centered within segment VII with marked amount of adjacent subcapsular and perihepatic hematoma causing mass effect, as well as large volume hemoperitoneum.
Nonselective Gelfoam embolization was performed successfully in the right hepatic artery.
This has not changed in extent significantly since the CT of [**2186-4-4**].
The estimated total liver volume is 5013 cm3, although assessment is limited by the discontinous hepatic contour in the dome.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] was admitted to the Hepatobiliary (West 1) surgical service on [**2187-4-5**] for management and evaluation of a bleeding hepatic mass.
A foley was placed for urine output monitoring, which remained more than adequate throughout his hospital stay.
Labs were drawn on presentation and were notable for a Hct of 32.
CV: The patient was tachycardic with HR 110s on admission and immediately post IR embolization of his R hepatic artery.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] was aggressively fluid resuscitated with both crystalloid and blood product (receiving 6u PRBCs in total).
Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] otherwise remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The results of this study were notable for dilated loops of bowel without air-fluid levels or distinct transition point.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] subsequently endorsed positive flatus and alleviation of his crampy abdominal pain and distention.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined every 4-6 hours during HD1-2.
Your blood levels (hematocrit) were closely monitored while in the ICU and on the floor and you were transfused as needed.
Your hematocrit has been stable for several days and you have required no further blood transfusions since [**2187-4-6**].
You underwent a procedure, an angiogram with right hepatic artery embolization, on [**2187-4-5**] to help stop the bleeding within one of your liver masses.
