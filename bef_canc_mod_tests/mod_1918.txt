Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
Patient bp improved as her underlying lung infection (see below) was treated.
Repeat chest x-ray showed no evidence of pna, but given her slowness to respond levoquin was added for question for bacterial superinfection-?
A pulmonary consult was obtained, and a chest CT was obtained (see results section).
In addition, wbc count began to increase.
Patient chest CT should a tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] distribution in both the right and left lung; this has a a Broad differential including mycobacteria, viral etiology, untreated bacterial infection.
The sputum cultures grew gram neg rods, and given her history of pseudomonal pna, patient was placed on gentamycin.
Also, patients sputum grew out stentrophomonas maltophilia that was sensitive to bactrim.
Patient began to clinically improve, however her aspergillus antigen came back at 3000, but antibodies were negative.
ID recommended repeat CT which showed interval improvement and resending the aspergillus antigen.
* 6. h/o PE- Patient was placed on coumadin, and at one point was supratheraputic with an inr of 6.3 (in the setting of starting bactrim and levoquin) and was guiac positive.
Eventually coumadin was restarted with heparin bridge until inr was therapeutic.
INR will need to monitored daily to assure stability (currently at 3.1, goal - 2 and 3).
Patient will need outpatient colonscopy * 7.
