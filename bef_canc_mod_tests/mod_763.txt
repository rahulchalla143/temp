He was given Epinephrine via his endotracheal tube, Atropine and his pulse and blood pressure were covered in the ambulance.
At [**Hospital 882**] Hospital he again arrested (PEA arrest), cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated again and he was resuscitated with 2 mg of Epinephrine, 1 mg of bicarbonate and his first arterial blood gas was 6.90 pH, pCO2 of 111 and pAO2 of 123.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed temperature 93.3, blood pressure 75/54, heartrate 129.
Ventilator settings, assist control 800 by 16 with a rate of 16, 100% FIO2 and 5 positive end-expiratory pressure.
In general he was intubated and not responsive to painful stimuli.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils dilated, not responsive to light.
Extremities, cool, mottled, positive dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 4.3, hematocrit 33.1, platelets 161, INR 1.4, PTT 38.5, ALT 314, AST 325, ALV 922, alkaline phosphatase 133, amylase 148, calcium 1.1, free calcium 1.17, lactate 6.9, sodium 142, potassium 3.3, chloride 101, bicarbonate 20, BUN 23, creatinine 1.1, anion gap of 20.
Phosphorus 7.8, albumin 3.0.
His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block, T wave inversions in V1 and V2, T wave inversion in V3.
Lower extremity ultrasound showed bilateral common femoral deep vein thrombosis and left superior clot.
Chest x-ray showed right upper lobe infiltrate.
Pulmonary - The patient underwent a computed tomographic angiography which showed multiple pulmonary embolisms.
He experienced hypoxemia and ventilatory failure secondary to pulmonary embolism but he also has a history of underlying lung disease including wedge resections, radiation, likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
On [**2166-12-5**], the patient had a self-extubation which failed.
His sputum grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Infectious disease - The patient had 2 out of 2 positive blood cultures from a left subclavian line that was discontinued and he was started on Vancomycin.
His peripheral cultures remained no growth deep.
His hematocrit remained stable.
Renal - Initially the patient had his creatinine bumped to 2.5, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis from his arrest and also in the setting of large diload for computed tomographic angiography and angiogram.
His creatinine trended down.
He had good urine output and his kidney function was normal at the time of discharge.
