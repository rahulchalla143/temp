Increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy, unclear if this could be reactive or malignant given history; review of clinical history is suggested and if the cause of lymphadenopathy is uncertain, then PET-CT or continued follow-up imaging could be considered.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Respiratory disress: Patient was noted to have moderate pulmonary edema on CXR and a BNP 2500, ECHO showed prserved ejection fraction (LVEF 55%).
CTA ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Echo was limited however did not show vegitations.
Urine culture returned with enterococcus suggesting bacteremia was from a urinary source.
MRI L spine did not show any signs of epidural abscess.
Last video speech and swallow in [**2172**].
