Abdominal CT revealed markedly abnormal R kidney with evidence of renal/perirenal hemorrhage.
Patient was seen by Urology, who recommended medical admission for reversal of INR, pain control, and serial Hct checks and repeat CT in two days.
On the floor, patient appears comfortable, but requesting further pain medications   Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Systolic heart failure, history of low EF with improvement on TTE [**12/2188**] (LVEF>55%) - Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2186**] - CAD s/p CABG [**2163**]; s/p DES to LAD in [**2186**]; history of MI - Atrial fibrillation/flutter - Diabetes mellitus, diagnosed 7 years ago, HgA1c 8.5% in [**August 2190**] - OSA on CPAP with 3 liters O2 - ?
Tense, obese abdomen, distended, bowel sounds present, tender to deep palpation on RLQ and R flank, abdominal exam limited by habitus, no shifting dullness or fluid wave appreciable, no rebound or guarding Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: No rashes or ulcers Neuro: CNII-XII intact, no focal abnormalities Motor: 5/5 strength in UE and LE Sensation: intact bilaterally in LE and UE DTR: 2+ bilaterally Coordination: [**Doctor First Name **] intact Gait: not assessed   Pertinent Results: On admission: [**2190-10-30**] 09:45AM BLOOD WBC-13.7*# RBC-4.49* Hgb-12.8* Hct-38.6* MCV-86 MCH-28.6 MCHC-33.2 RDW-16.8* Plt Ct-175 [**2190-10-30**] 09:45AM BLOOD Neuts-86.1* Lymphs-7.9* Monos-4.3 Eos-1.1 Baso-0.6 [**2190-10-30**] 09:45AM BLOOD PT-25.7* PTT-27.1 INR(PT)-2.5* [**2190-10-30**] 09:45AM BLOOD Glucose-215* UreaN-38* Creat-2.8* Na-146* K-4.5 Cl-111* HCO3-24 AnGap-16 [**2190-10-30**] 09:45AM BLOOD ALT-14 AST-17 AlkPhos-115 Amylase-66 TotBili-0.3 [**2190-10-30**] 09:45AM BLOOD Lipase-33 CT: CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post median sternotomy with right atrial and left ventricular pacing leads as well as right ventricular AICD lead; these are incompletely visualized on the current study.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and rectum appear unremarkable on this non-enhanced study.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are noted along the visualized thoracolumbar spine, particularly noted at the L2-3 and L5-S1 levels which causes some narrowing of the spinal canal.
If cardiac pacer is MRI compatible and patient's GFR allows administration of IV gadolinium, MRI may be helpful.
By the time he arrived to the ICU his CXR also showed signs of volume overload.
Following which, his Hct was noted to drop and he required aggressive volume and blood product resuccitation.
For volume overload, caused by aggressive IVF and blood procduct resucitation, diuresis was attempted, but he developed an oliguric renal failure in the setting of his hypotension and was unable to produce sufficient UOP for diuresis.
Blood pressure improved and HD was initated.
His kidneys showed some recovery and aggressive diuresis was undertaken.
(#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Pt initially presented with R flank pain, CT scan noted right retroperitoneal bleed possibly from renal cyst rupture.
Coumadin was reversed with FFP, but given worsening renal failure repeat CT was obtained which showed enlarging of the hematoma.
Hct also noted to drop a nadir of 20.2 (38.6 on admission)  He was given aggressive volume and blood product resucitation.
(#) Acute renal failure on Chronic Kidney Injury: He has history of chronic renal funciton with baselin creatinine likely in mid 2s, which was abruptly worsened in the setting of hypotension and he developed oliguric ATN.
Renal function was slowly improving at the time of discharge.
(#) Myocardial Ischemia: On transfer to the ICU, ST changes were noted on ECG which were considered to be artifact by the cards fellow.
ASA was held given the acute bleed.
(#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  He was noted to have a Klebsiella pneumonia (pansensitive) treated with ceftriaxone and pan sensitive Enterococcus UTI treated with Vancomycin.
All blood cultures were negative, although he was noted to have a pyogenic skin/line infection at the site of central LIJ.
# CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2188**] echo): Pt reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain.
ECHO was repeated given concern of change in heart failure in setting of possible MI, which showed EF of 35%.
Another repeat ECHO was performed to showed improvement with EF 45-50%.

A CT scan showed bleeding in the right kidney.
Your blood pressure was low resulting in kidney injury that required temporary hemodialysis.
There was a concern that you may be having a heart attack although the blood tests were negative for this.
