CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2161-11-4**] 6:00 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
At the lower pole of the left kidney, a single non-obstructive calculus is remaining measuring 5-6 mm.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2161-11-6**] 1.
Increased intrinsic signal abnormality within the L2-3 disc with surrounding endplate signal changes since the previous MRI of [**2161-9-19**].
Given the clinical suspicion of infection, further evaluation with repeat lumbar spine study with gadolinium is recommended.
Given patient's low EGFR, a consent could be obtained and, clinically, it should be determined whether the study is important for any decision making.
[**2162-1-10**] CT abdomen/pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Initial [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]: .
Blood culture from his HD line on [**2161-12-2**] grew coag negative staph.
CT abdomen pelvis on [**2161-11-4**] showed no acute findings concerning for infection.
Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed possible low grade discitis at L2-3.
Multiple consecutive blood cultures from [**11-2**] to [**11-12**] grew coagulase negative staph.
His continued bacteremia was concerning for a persistent source of infection.
Gallium and bone scans showed no evidence of infection except for the region of discitis at L2-3.
He has subsequent clinical deterioration with new low grade fevers to 100.0 on [**2161-11-23**] and 100.1 on [**2161-11-26**], blood culture positive for GPCs on [**2161-11-24**], and worsening back pain with new radiation to the buttocks.
Lumbar spine plain film on [**2161-11-26**] showed progressive destructive changes.
Lumbar spine MRI with contrast on [**2161-11-27**] showed increased collapse of the superior endplate of L3 and an epidural soft tissue mass spanning L2 and L3, which most likely reflects a phlegmon and causes moderate to severe canal encroachment.
He received dialysis immediately after the MRI study and again the next day.
Prior MRI on [**2161-9-20**] showed lower lumbar levoscoliosis with severe spinal canal stenosis and severe degenerative disc, endplate, and facet joint disease.
CT abdomen and pelvis did not show any acute changes.
Noncontrast MRI on [**2161-11-6**] showed possible low grade discitis at L2-3.
Later gallium and bone scans were consistent with an infection at this location.
Diagnostic paracentesis on admission showed no evidence of SBP, and subsequent therapeutic paracentesis has also showed no evidence of SBP.
His goal level was set at <5 and his Tactolimus doses were held briefly.
His Tacro level was 3.9 on [**2161-11-15**] and Tacrolimus was restarted at 0.5 mg every other day.
His levels have since dropped below 2. .
His glucose levels have been labile recently, likely due to the changes in his dialysis schedule, dietary changes, and the stress of infection.
He had an early session on [**2161-11-5**] prior to HD catheter removal and an HD holiday.
His electrolytes were closely monitored and he had back to back sessions on [**2161-11-10**] and [**2161-11-11**].
His phosphate levels have been mildly elevated, and he was started on Sevelamer 800 mg PO TID.
Wound culture from spine grew Coagulase negative Staphylococcus resistent to daptomycin, switched to linezolid at ID recommendation.
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast was obtained to look for retroperitoneal bleed, which was negative.
He had a CT scan demonstrating no evidence of bowel ischemia and stable ascites.
Upon transfer to the ICU pt had mild bloody emesis, so an NGT lavage was performed and was positive.
An EGD on [**1-11**] demonstrated hypertensive gastropathy with friable mucosa, but no local site to intervene.
His Hct was stable after transfusing 3U pRBC before the EGD.
On [**1-13**] Vancomycin/Cefepime was started as WBC increased from 6.1 to 13.9.
