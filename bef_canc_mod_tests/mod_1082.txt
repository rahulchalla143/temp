**FINAL REPORT [**2124-1-15**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2124-1-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
Extensive pre- and paravertebral soft tissue abnormality at the involved levels.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is mild upper zone paraseptal emphysema (2:16).
No large central pulmonary embolus is detected, though this examination is not optimized for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Since the [**2124-1-6**] examination, the patient has undergone laminectomy and posterior fusion of T11 through L3 via two posterior rods, one left paravertebral rod, and 13 screws.
Fluid tracks along the left posterior pararenal space (2:79).
A coarse calcification overlying the left psoas muscle (2:77) may represent a surgically-related loose body, as this was not visualized on the [**2124-1-6**] CT examination.
The evaluation of the solid abdominal organs is limited due to extensive metallic streak artifacts.
The gallbladder, stomach, spleen, right adrenal gland, right kidney, pancreas, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal.
Pathology: T12-L1 [**Year (4 digits) 500**], excision: Necrotic and viable [**Year (4 digits) 500**], cartilage and fibrotic tissue.
It consists of multiple fragments of red - tan [**Known firstname 500**] and cartilage measuring 5.0 x 4.7 x 0.8 cm in aggregate.
Cultures from the OR debridement grew non-albicans [**Female First Name (un) **].
#Transitional: Per Infectious Disease request an ESR, CRP and Liver function tests were obtained prior to discharge for them to follow up considering Fluconazole was started for treatment.
