Studies: [**2146-2-9**] CXR - CONCLUSION: Multiple vascular stents, unchanged since the prior examination.
[**2146-2-10**] CT abdomen, pelvis - IMPRESSION: 1.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar to [**2142-10-22**] and suggests chronic right phrenic nerve paralysis.

Klebsiella sepsis with hypotension: 7/8 bottles from OSH positive for Klebsiella and 1/2 blood cultures positive here.
Of note, the patient normally has systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
No evidence for intra-abdominal abscess or other source of infection on CT scan.
TTE on [**2-11**] neg for vegetations, so less likely endocarditis.

FENA 1% and Cr trended down to 0.4.
Hyperglycemia: Blood sugars in 300-400's while in MICU likely related to infection.
