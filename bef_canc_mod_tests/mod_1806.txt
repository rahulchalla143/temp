Uterine and cervical hyperplasia, status post uterus operation dilatation and curettage in [**2111-8-16**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 98.8, pulse 101, blood pressure 114/palp, respiratory rate 32, oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Coronary examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count 8.5, hematocrit 34, platelets 214.
Sodium 146, potassium 5.1, chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 46, creatinine 3.2, glucose of 94.
First set of creatine kinase enzymes revealed creatine kinase of 137, MB 3, troponin of less than 0.3.
A sputum culture was obtained with greater than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and greater than 10 epithelials; consistent with oropharyngeal growth.
Urinalysis was yellow, urobilinogen of 1, small bilirubin, negative leukocytes, negative blood, negative nitrites, 30 protein, and trace ketones.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, rate 95, intervals within normal limits, poor R wave progressions, and T wave inversions in leads I and III.
Chest x-ray with possible cardiomegaly, right middle lobe pneumonia, possibly left pneumonia.
It was felt that proteinuria noted in the patient's urinalysis could be expected from fever, infection, hypertension, and obesity, and the sepsis the patient appeared to be presenting.
Her creatinine was followed serially.
On [**3-14**] her creatinine was 2.2.
On [**3-15**] her creatinine was 1.
On [**3-16**] her creatinine was 0.7 and has been stable up until the time of discharge.
A urine protein electrophoresis was performed as well which revealed albumin bands in the urine.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes out of concern than an acute cardiac event could be accounting for the patient's congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
It was a suboptimal study secondary to body habitus, but also revealed hypokinetic inferior septum and wall.
A pulmonary embolus was also considered in the differential diagnosis; however, the patient was unable to obtain a CT angiogram to rule pulmonary embolus secondary to body habitus.
A LENI examination of the patient's lower extremity was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
It was recommended that the patient receive a sleep study in order to determine her eligibility for CPAP.
The patient's sleep study was completed on [**3-22**] to [**2112-3-23**].
Pending the results of the sleep study which were pending at the time of this dictation, the patient will be considered for CPAP.
Pulmonary function tests should be considered as an outpatient.
