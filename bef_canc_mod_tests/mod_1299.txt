She went to [**Hospital **] hospital and was noted to have ST segment depressions in V2-V6 and I,II, aVL along with STE in AvR/V1 which resolved with Nitrate therapy.
Cardiac enzymes were noted to be significantly elevated.
Troponin I 0.04 -> 10.32, CKMB: 1.5 -> 108.
Due to her diffuse EKG changes and recurrent chest pain, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Echocardiogram [**2189-11-29**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF=55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2189-11-29**] PROCEDURE: 1.
Left heart catheterization was performed via percutaneous entry of the right femoral artery under live ultrasound guidance with a 4 french JR4 catheter advanced the the left ventricle.
Coronary angiography was performed in multiple projections using 4 french JR4 and 4 french JL4 catheters advanced to the ascending aorta using manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild elevation in the LVEDP consistent with mild diastolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo F h/o HTN, + smoker, who presents from OSH with NSTEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization and stenting of LCx.
She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease involving LCx (90% ->stented, with 0% residual), and RCA (40% with possible ulceration).
Echocardiogram showed preserved EF of 55%.
To evaluate for cardiac risk factors, we checked a lipid panel, which was uremarkable, and an HbA1c, which was pending at the time of discharge.
We changed her labetalol to the more cardioselective metoprolol and titrated dose up to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
- Please schedule a carotid artery doppler study to evaluate for carotid artery stenosis.
We unblocked the blood vessels using stents, and the procedure was successful.
You will need to get an ultrasound scan of your carotid arteries as an outpatient to check for any potential blockages in the blood flow to your brain.
