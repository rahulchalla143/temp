Urine Cx PENDING x 1 All blood cx negative.
His HCT remained stable and he was without further episodes of hematemesis.
CXR revealed b/l PNA and the patient was noted to have increasing o2 requirements.
Found to be growing yeast and pan-sensitive E. coli on sputum Cx from [**8-22**].
Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial washings on [**8-25**] grew yeast and Respiratory viral culture on [**8-25**] was negative.
Radiographic imaging following the TLC placement revealed a tension PTX and the patient was noted to have low BPs requiring pressors.
24 hours after chest tube removal patient developed tachipnea and desats to the 70s he was emergently reintubated for respiratory distress, CXR did not show rexpansion of the PTX.
Bronchoscopy showed large amounts of thick sputum and while no obstructive plug was seen it was felt that his acute decompensation was due to mucus plugging.
TSH was checked and was 46 (up from 5, while the patient was in the ICU).
TSH levels will need to be checked in 6 weeks and levothyroxine dose adjusted accordingly.
[**Last Name (un) **]: The patient presented with a Cr of 2.3, increased from a baseline ~1.
Believed to be pre-renal in the setting of vomiting and blood loss.
?Colitis:  patient was found to have radiologic findings suggestive of colitis on CT without change in stool output.
C. difficile toxin was negative x 3, and empiric therapy was stopped after the patient completed his course of HCAP therapy.
Neutropenia:  patient was found to have a WBC count of 3.5 with a PMN count of 22% and a 19% bandemia in the setting of bilateral PNA.
Was maintained on a CIWA scale while extubated and did not require additional benzos.
Macrocytic anemia: Initial HCT was 24.1 with MCV of 119.
============================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will need to have his hematocrit followed (preferably at least every other day, initially) to ensure no further GI bleeding.
