The pt had a CTA showing massive pulmonary emboli and RV strain.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the pt was found to have VS 97.5 120 90/62 20 90% RA.
She had an EKG showing sinus tach, partial RBBB, TWI inf ant/lat.
Neurosurgery was consulted and felt it was safe to anticoagulate but requested a baseline CT head which did not show any bleed.
Bilateral lenis were done with DVT on R (non-occlusive).
On the floor, the pt was VS afebrile HR 120s, SBP in the 90s, satting 99% on 3L.
Initial skin biopsy was inconclusive but later, at the age of 3 years (in the [**2114**]'s), she developed an abdominal mass that was later diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

TTE [**2145-10-29**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-7-6**], RV dilation and systolic dysfunction are new.
Given her hemodynamic stability and her recent brain surgery, she did not meet criteria for lytic therapy.
Her INR was 1.5 on discharge, and she was scheduled to have biweekly INR checks to be drawn by a visiting nurse and was referred to the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Company 191**].
Her neurological exam was stable when compared with previous documentation in OMR.
