Upon arrival in the ED, his HR was > 160, BP was 100-120/70-90, RR 30.
He then received 10 mg IV Dilt -> BP dropped to 84/74 without any effect on the HR.
He also got 2.5 IV lopressor to which he dropped his SBP from 125 to 70 which reverted back to his baseline of around 120 within few minutes.
Cath from [**2169-4-7**] -- Three vessel coronary artery disease with patent LIMA to LAD and occluded SVG to Ramus and jump segment to R PDA.
-- Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction -- severe AS w/ peak gradient of 55 mmHg, valve area of 0.65m3 -- EF of 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities Hemodynamics: -- moderately elevated R & L sided filling pressure with RVEDP of 15mmHg and LVEDP of 18mmHg -- moderate PAH with a PASP of 50mmHg -- CI depressed at 2 L/min/m2   Past Medical History: - CAD s/p CABG x 3 in [**2158**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, and SVG to RCA) - S/P stenting [**2164**] of mid RCA, PTCA of proximal RCA and PDA - DM - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Left leg cellulitis - OA - Renal cell carcinoma (unchanged in 4 months) - Depression - Asbestos Lung - Spinal stenosis   Social History: Lives with daughter in [**Name (NI) 2312**] Denies EtOH use Quit smoking in [**2104**] .

[**2169-4-15**] ECHO Conclusions: The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-2-24**], there are new regional wall motion abnormalities c/w multi-vessel CAD.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2169-4-14**] for further evaluation of his aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
He was evaluated by the cardiac surgical service given that a recent cardiac catheterization revealed occluded vein grafts from his prior CABG in [**2158**].
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed an occluded left internal carotid artery and mild plaque in the right internal carotid artery.
Vein mapping was performed which revealed a patent right saphenous vein with dimensions ranging between 3.7mm to 6.7mm.
On postoperative day five, Mr. [**Known lastname 97733**] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
culture sent for diarrhea amd was negative twice.
