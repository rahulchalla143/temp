However, his latest INR drawn on [**3-6**] was 9.5.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 15% by echocardiogram in [**2108-12-21**].
b.i.d., vitamin C, and vancomycin (which is dosed at dialysis).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 95.9, blood pressure of 86/63, heart rate of 88, respiratory rate of 20, satting 100% on room air.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves were intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 10.9, hematocrit of 51, platelets of 189 (70 neutrophils, 4 bands, 12 lymphocytes).
Sodium of 142, potassium of 5.5, chloride of 104, bicarbonate of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 51, creatinine of 6.2, blood sugar of 131.
Albumin of 3.2, calcium of 9.6, phosphate of 4.6, magnesium of 2.1.
Iron of 100.
INR of 5.1.
Digoxin level of 4.2.
The patient's blood pressure on admission was notably low, in the 80s/50s.
According to his family, his blood pressure did run on the low side.
The patient was maintained on a dopamine drip for several days for a blood pressure in the 90s.
There was some confusion as to his volume status, not being clear whether he was dehydrated or volume overloaded, and with his low ejection fraction, he had been pushed off the Starling curve.
The patient was stable off dopamine for 24 hours with a blood pressure in the 90s, and he was transferred out to the floor on [**3-16**].
An arterial blood gas was done and revealed an acidosis with a pH of 7.22, a PCO2 of 50, and a PO2 of 129 on 4 liters nasal cannula.
A STAT chest x-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion, and when compared with previous x-rays was read as increasing bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
Fluid studies were pending at the time of this dictation.
Hematologic issues included the need for reversal of his supratherapeutic INR which was 9.2 on admission.
On [**3-19**], after a thoracentesis, the patient and family had a discussion with the attending and the decision was made to change the patient to do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%.
Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
The patient will also require close monitoring of his INR and continued followup of his digoxin level.
