RADIOLOGY: CXR [**2133-11-17**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CXR [**2133-11-18**]: IMPRESSION:  New right IJ central venous line.
CARDIOLOGY: EKG [**2133-11-17**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing  of [**2133-10-16**] previously seen J point elevation in the early precordial leads is not as prominent on the current tracing.

After aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors (norepinephrine), his BP increased and SBP remained stable 90-100.
Anion gap normalized at 0300 on [**2133-11-18**] and insulin drip was stopped several hours later and pt was started on glargine.
# GPC bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**11-17**] grew coagulase negative staph, so likely contaminant, though send surveillance cultures.
Stool was found to be guaiac positive in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and pt's hematocrit is stable in the 20s (baseline hct in the high 20s), likely due to iron deficiency and acute blood loss given recent admission for erosive esophagitis with coffee ground emesis.
Has been typed and screened on PPI, off fluconazole, which was put on by GI after last admission for empiric treatment of [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis (day1=[**10-17**], 2wk course).
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine trending down, 3.7 (admission) but improved to 1.8 on disharge.
Meds were renally dosed, creatinine was trended daily, and po intake was encouraged.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
