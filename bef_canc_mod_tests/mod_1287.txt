Exam was significant for gross bright red blood on rectal exam.
ECG showed a new TWI in V2, otherwise unchanged.
CBC showed a white blood cell count of 3.3K, and was significant for an initial hematocrit of 15.4, down from a baseline of 28.8 in [**2134-12-19**].
GI was called and recommended CT angio to localize the bleeding which did not localize actively bleeding vessel.
Vitals prior to transfer were 98.3, 77, 113/68, 20, 100% RA.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 98.6, 71, 155/76, 19, 99% on RA.
Of note, he radiation therapy for cervical CA was completed in [**1-/2134**], and radiation induced-enteritis was diagnosed after the patient had bloody diarrhea in [**2134-12-19**].
MRI earlier this month showed proctitis with large ulcer in the distal rectum extending to the R anterior mesorectal fascia with moderate surrounding inflammation.
Pelvic MRI on [**2134-1-8**] showed marked reduction in the size of the initial disease in the cervix in both parametria, with the uterus no longer appearing involved.
