Catheterization (approximately 18 hours after initial onset of symptoms) found proximal LAD occlusion.
His vital signs were stable: Blood pressure 140/80.
Pulse 75 beats/min and regular.
Respiratory rate 18 breaths/min.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death  Physical Exam: Blood pressure 140/80.
Pulse 75 beats/min and regular.
Respiratory rate 18 breaths/min.
The neck was supple with JVP of 8 cm.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Coronary angiography in this co-dominant system demonstrated an LMCA with 40% distal stenosis.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
[**2159-8-29**] ECHO  Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is [**5-24**]  mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**2159-8-30**] CT ABDOMEN PELVIS  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: 82-year-old man with ST-elevation MI, status post cardiac catheterization with right femoral AV fistula and hematocrit drop by ten points; evaluate for retroperitoneal bleed.
TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired CT axial images were obtained from the mid thorax through the symphysis pubis without contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Investigation of the visceral organs is limited by the absence of intravenous and oral contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
No CT evidence for hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis.
LAD flow was restored and a cypher stent was placed in the proximal LAD.
Subsequent echo showed a reduced LVEF of ~30% and apical hypokinesis.
Metoprolol was restarted prior to discharge once the hematocrit had stablized.
However, with the melanotic stools and hematocrit drop, coumadin was held.
INR and CBC should be evaluated one week after discharge to consider re-starting coumadin.
His heart rate was consistently in the 70-80 range during his stay.
#Heme Anemia: On admisison, his hematocrit was measured at 34.
However, after starting anticoagulation (plavix/integrillin/ASA/coumadin), hct trended down over 4 days to an hct of 23.6.
A CT was negative for abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding.
TIBC, ferritin, and haptoglobin levels were all within normal limits.
He was transfused with three units of packed red blood cells with an increase of hematocrit to 32.0 (and stable for two days) on discharge.
An EGD was done by GI, and found minor abrasions in the upper GI tract, but no signs of active bleeding.
#AV Fistula Following catheterization and subsequent sheath removal, a right femoral bruit was heard.
On discharge, creatinine had decreased to 1.4, and lisinopril was restarted.
These medications help to protect the heart and keep your blood pressure under control.
