[**2173-9-14**] ECHO: This study was compared to the prior study of [**2173-3-11**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-3-11**], the heart rate is now slower.
His initial blood cultures from [**2173-8-25**] were + Klebsiella and they presumed he had cholangitis as a source for his gram negative bacteremia.
His hemodynamics were stable and his WBC was coming down.
Based on an abdominal CT which was done on [**2173-9-7**] and showed multiple fluid collections, he was sent to IR on [**2173-9-2**] and had 2 drains placed and a 3rd site aspirated.
On [**9-8**] and 21 his blood cultures were positive for enterococcus therefore his PICC line was removed.
His chest xray showed an enlarging right effusion for which he underwent thoeracentesis and he returned to Interventional Radiology for manipulation of his drains to aspirate any undrained collections.
He will be discharged with [**Date Range 269**] follow-up for wound and drain care, and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks with a repeat abdomional CT.
Cholangitis, gram negative sepsis.
You will need an Abdominal CT the day before this appointment.
