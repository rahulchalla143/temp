REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for ischemic disease/infarction EXAM: MRI of the brain.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2147-11-18**].
The diffusion signal changes have decreased since the previous study, but the T2 abnormalities have increased with well-defined margins.
The appearances could still be suggestive of an evolving subacute infarct.
Therefore, correlation with lumbar puncture findings and a followup are recommended.
IMPRESSION: Slightly increased T2 hyperintensity and new enhancement in the medial right frontal lobe since the previous MRI examination of [**2147-11-18**].
The enhancement, which is new since the previous study could represent enhancement within a subacute infarct.
