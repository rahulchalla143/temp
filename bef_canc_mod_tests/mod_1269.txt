CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM, [**2185-1-9**]  INDICATION: 51-year-old male status post intubation, with hypercarbic respiratory failure, with new significant A-a gradient and failing to wean from ventilator.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 2.5 mm axial images were obtained from the lung base to the apex following the administration of 150 cc intravenous Optiray bolus per CT pulmonary angiogram protocol.
FINDINGS: No prior CT examination for comparison.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma reveals bibasilar consolidation, as well as partial consolidation within the right middle lobe.
Evaluation of the osseous structures reveals degenerative change of the thoracic spine.
Limited evaluation through the upper abdomen is grossly unremarkable.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.3 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Aorta - Valve Level: *3.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.5 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 240 msec  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-1-13**] 10:07 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o SAH  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with h/o pituitary tumor, recent PE on heparin (therapeutic) now with severe L sided HA, no neuro deficits appreciable.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are preserved.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Hypercarbic Resp Failure: CTA showed PE.
Patient evaluated by Pulmonary attending while hospitalized, who felt that current management appears to be optimized but a sleep study could determine if CPAP settings are appropriate.
Creatinine 1.1 normal.
He should follow-up with podiatry as an outpatient either at [**Hospital1 **] or [**Hospital1 2025**] through his PCP .
Hematocrit stable.
Low MCV and iron studies c/w Iron deficient -- On iron -- no record of colonoscopy - should have one as outpatient (malig can even explain a hypercoag state leading to PE).
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-10**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Bismuth Subsalicylate 262 mg/15 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO TID (3 times a day).
Warfarin 6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): titrate coumadin dosing to INR [**2-11**].
Notify a doctor or nurse in case of chest pain, difficulty breathing, weakness, numbness, tingling, lightheadedness/loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or other concerns.
Sleep Center, [**Hospital1 **]: You have an appointment for an overnight [**3-6**] at 8:30pm.
