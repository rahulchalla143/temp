Her parents note severe pain in both of her legs, which is chronic "phantom limb pain" and neuropathy.

Her exam was notable for dry gangrene on her right foot.
Labs showed a blood sugar of 744, a bicarbonate of 8, an anion gap of 30, ABG 7.12/30/106/10.
Labs were otherwise notable for a creatinine of 3.5 (from a baseline of 1), flat cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis to 19.8, thrombocytosis to 714, tox screen positive for cocaine, and a contaminated UA.
CXR was clear, EKG is not done, CT head pending, blood and urine cultures were sent.

CXR [**2112-4-3**]: PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The right IJ CV line distal tip projects in the right atrium and needs to be pulled by approximately 3 cm.
Modest ST-T wave changes are nonspecific and baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The etiology of the patient's DKA was thought to be medication noncompliance in the setting of polysubstance abuse, as her tox screen was positive for cocaine and she had no evidence of acute infection or cardiac ischemia.
A UA and CXR were nonfocal.
She was also initially managed with an insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until her blood sugar fell below 250 and her anion gap closed, at which point she was started on an ISS.
Her anion gap did widen to 17 on hospital day #2, [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and she was transitioned back to insulin gtt overnight.
Then with closed gap, she was transitioned back to [**Hospital1 **] nph 18 and 24.
Her finger stick glucose, lytes, and pH were monitored closely, and potassium was repleted prn throughout her ICU course.
Patient was given juice and crackers and blood sugar returned to the normal range.
Her Cr improved to 1.7 after intravascular volume repletion.
Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
