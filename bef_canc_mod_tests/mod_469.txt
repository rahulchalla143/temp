Her stomach cramps improved with the medication called in by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], her gastroenterologist.
Following the procedure, the patient received albumin 50 grams and was started on normal saline wide open with improvement in her systolic blood pressure to 89.
The patient was noted to have baseline hypotension with the systolic blood pressure normally in the 90s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.2, blood pressure 61/41, increased to 89/60 with IV fluids, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20, saturating 95% on room air.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with bilateral breast reduction scars noted.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 18, hematocrit 28.9 (35.5 on [**2100-11-22**]), platelets 373,000.
Sodium 133, potassium 4.2, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 51, creatinine 2.3 (prior 1.4), glucose 94.
The INR was 1.4 with PT 14.3, PTT 34.2.
ALT 23, AST 70, alkaline phosphatase 407, total bilirubin 5.6 (prior 2.4), albumin 2.4.
Peritoneal fluid revealed white blood cells 95, red blood cells [**Pager number **], polys 2, lymphocytes 5, monos 20.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2100-12-14**] secondary to hypotension as well as hematocrit down to 23.8.
She was stabilized in the unit with blood pressures maintained with systolic in the 80s to 90s and hematocrit up to 31.4 and then transferred back to the floor on [**2100-12-15**].
She was then transferred back to the unit on [**2100-12-23**] after worsening renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3 and decreased urine output.
Her urine output initially improved with a decrease in creatinine but has since dropped back down to 0-60 milliliters per hour of urine output off of the Levophed.
Her systolic blood pressure, however, has been maintained greater than 100.
She received free water IV fluid for hypernatremia and her sodium went down from 155 to 150.
Her urine output remained minimal.
However, her blood pressure has remained stable with systolic blood pressures in the 90s.
