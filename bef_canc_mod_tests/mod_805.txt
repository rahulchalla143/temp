An ABG showed 7.45/32/57 and the patient was intubated.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
A bedside echo was performed and showed new anterior hypokinesis with akinesis of the apex and anterior septum; overall LVEF of 25-35%.
He was taken to cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
Cardiac cath revealed 3 vessel disease.
An abdominal US was done to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.
A repeat TTE was done on and off the ballon pump on [**1-10**] which showed improved systolic function but he continued to have distal inferior wall hypokinesis and distal septal hypokinesis.
On POD 5 cholangiogram showed a complete obstruction of this anastomosis.
On [**1-12**] a HIDA scan was performed which showed a bile leak from the hepaicojejunostomy anastomosis.
A follow up cholangiogram determined the patient's bile leak to actually have been coming from the liver edge rather than the anastomosis.
A CT scan was performed which showed a 6 x 3 cm collection that was not drainable.
