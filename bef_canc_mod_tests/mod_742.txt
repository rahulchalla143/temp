[**2117-8-21**] - CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Pt intubated.
EKG ([**2117-8-21**]) demonstrated sinus tachycardia with inferior Q waves, no other specific ST-T waves changes.
Doppler imaging suggests an increased LV filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Similar findings to study [**8-21**].

A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on admission ([**8-21**]) and inital pressures were as follows: CVP 9, RV 26/17, PAP 30/26, PCWP 21, which were felt to be more consistent with sepsis then cardiogenic shock, in the setting of a recent surgery.
Lactate level decreased from 5.4 on admission to 1.7 the following day.
CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed ascites and free fluid in the pelvis, but no abscess or other site of infection was identified.
Her blood pressure remained normal with SBPs > 100 throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
Blood and urine cultures were followed from admission and all were negative.
She did experience subjective labored breathing which was significantly improved with albuterol/atrovent nebs.
Over the course of her hospitalization, her breathing improved substantially, and oxygen was weaned with O2 sats >95% on room air.
Lactic Acidosis: Lactate was elevated to >4 on admission.
Adrenal Insuff - Cortisol stimulation showed suboptimal bump in cortisol after 30min and 1 hour.
She was started on IV hydrocortisone which was tapered as her blood pressure responded to normal, then discontinued after six days.
has a history of an MI '[**03**], and ICD placement in '[**13**].
EKG with no specific changes.
The pain was reproducible with palpation of the epigastrium and did respond to treatment with Maalox.
