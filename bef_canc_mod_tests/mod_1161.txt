Right eye with bruising laterally CV: irregular, irregular tachy rhythm Chest: clear to auscultation bilat.
Pertinent Results: CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2109-8-23**] 2:06 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: rib fracture?
TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral view of the chest.
The common bile duct is not visualized adequately throughout its course, and the evaluation for stones is not reliable.
This likely represents an area of adenomyoma (malignancy is less likely, but also a diagnostic consideration).
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2109-8-23**] 3:27 PM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: bleed?
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci maintain a normal configuration.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2109-8-23**] 3:28 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: divertic?
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was reviewed.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
The pancreas, spleen, stomach, small bowel loops are unremarkable, and there is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic adenopathy.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a very mild bowel wall thickening of the colon that is nonspecific, and may be related to its collapsed state.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
TECHNIQUE: AP radiograph of the chest, compared with examination of [**2109-8-23**].
SINGLE AP RADIOGRAPH: Compared with examination performed 22:49 on [**2109-8-30**].
There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, similar in morphology to the preoperative examination of [**2109-8-23**], and likely representing pleural thickening.

[**2109-8-25**] 1:42 am BLOOD CULTURE     Site: ARM      1 OF 2.
An US showed acute cholecystitis with gallbladder stones and a CT confirmed a moderately distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall thickening and multiple gallstones, most consistent with acute cholecystitis.
A head CT was performed due to his fall injury and was negative.
GI: An ERCP on [**2109-8-24**] showed the major papilla appeared patulous suggesting recent stone passage.
Resp: s/p open cholecystectomy on [**2109-8-30**], he was difficult to arouse and dropped his Os sats to the 50s.
ID: A blood culture on [**2109-8-23**] was positive for ESCHERICHIA COLI and he was started on Levo and Flagyl.
A repeat blood culture on [**2109-8-25**] showed no growth.
His INR was 2.0 and he received 6 units of fresh frozen plasma prior to surgery.
A trigger was called for A-fib with a rate of 157 POD 4.
Outpatient Lab Work VNA - please check INR on Friday and inform Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5351**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] of the results.
