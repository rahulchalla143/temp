Initial CXR demonstrated bilateral lower lobes opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
He was also treated for COPD flare, as his lung exam was quite wheezy on initial presentation, so was treated with solumedrol, converted to prednisone taper, as well as combivent MDI.
His BP and volume status were optimized prior to 2nd extubation, but this also faiiled due to tachypnea --> autopeep, requiring re-intubation.
Also positive cardiac enzymes (elevated index and trop, but CK peak only 157).
ECHO during hospital course was of poor quality, but demonstrated a depressed ejection fraction of 45-50%, septal hypokinesis, could not assess for focal wall abnormalities.
Anemia:  Patient with Hematocrit drop from 34 --> 24 on admission.
Baseline Hct appears to be around 30.
Hct returned to baseline and remained at baseline during remainder of hospital course.
Urine culture grew e coli and enterococcus, now status post antibiotic therapy.
