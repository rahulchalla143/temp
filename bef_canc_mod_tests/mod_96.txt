On admission, CTA showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely secondary to a 6 mm aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery at the bifurcation.
Troponin of 0.4 on admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate of 81; blood pressure 129/52.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 7.8; hematocrit of 32.8; platelets of 196.
PT was 13.4; PTT 23.2.
INR of 1.2.
Gases were 7.51, 30, 133, 25, 2.
Cervical spine x-rays were negative.
On [**2116-6-2**], he underwent an angiogram with coiling of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm.
Anesthesia felt that it was prudent to intubate the patient at this time and a follow-up magnetic resonance scan was ordered.
A follow-up magnetic resonance scan was ordered.
For the next several weeks, the patient continued to spike temperatures and blood cultures were ordered.
Also, cerebrospinal fluid cultures were ordered as well on [**2116-6-7**].
At that point, all cultures were negative.
His ICP ranged from 6 to 11.
Blood pressure was maintained at 160 to 180.
Continue to follow blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid cultures.
After several stable head CT and neurologic stability, the patient's ventricular drain was discontinued on [**6-23**].
To follow cerebrospinal fluid cultures, serial lumbar punctures were performed.
They continued to follow cerebrospinal fluid cultures, sputum cultures, blood cultures and urine cultures.
On [**2116-6-27**], culture showed nosocomial meningitis, Pseudomonas.
Following cerebrospinal fluid, white blood cell count dropped.
Protein was dropping and glucose was rising.
They advised continued surveillance of sputum, blood cultures, urine cultures when febrile.
They advised to continue Vancomycin and Flagyl empirically and continue Ceptaz for pseudomonas and consider repeat chest x-ray if still with fevers.
We will perform serial lumbar punctures to follow his protein, glucose and culture cerebrospinal fluid.
The patient's final shunt cerebrospinal fluid profile prior to discontinuing drain was quite benign and initial lumbar puncture soon after, we discontinued the drain.
Neurosurgery would like to place a ventriculoperitoneal shunt when all cultures are negative.
As of [**7-13**], all cultures have been negative.
The patient's examination continues to be the same but does not follow commands.
Plan at this time, on [**7-15**], is to place ventriculoperitoneal shunt when cerebrospinal fluid protein is down and a renal consult is requested due to rising BUN with creatinine levels.
Will follow-up with repeat TFT's are back next week.
Blood pressure was below 160.
Beta blocker to keep heart rate around 60.
Neurologic examination remains unchanged.
His creatinine started to rise on [**7-8**] in the middle of the second cycle.
Check lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid culture off antibiotics ideally for a few days and then place ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Examination remained stable.
Lumbar puncture is to be performed daily.
Over the next several days, the patient's lumbar puncture continued to show elevated intracranial pressures.
Opening pressure between 12 and 20.
Cultures and laboratory studies continued to be negative.
Glucose was increasing over several days.
His laboratory studies were all within normal limits.
All vital signs were stable.
Hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110 or heart rate of less than 160.
