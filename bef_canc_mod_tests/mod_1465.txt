Sputum grew out E. coli and Pseudomonas.
A follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram did not reveal intra-cardiac thrombus.
Atrial fibrillation with transesophageal echocardiogram negative for thrombus on [**2111-4-3**].
Abdominal aortic aneurysm in [**2110-8-4**] which was measured to be 4.8 by 4.8 centimeters.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs were temperature 97.9 F.; blood pressure 193/86 which rapidly decreased to 137/69 in the Emergency Department; heart rate of 110; respiratory rate 30; and the patient was saturating 94% on 100% nonrebreather and 98% on Bi-PAP with 100% FIO2.
LABORATORY:  On admission included white blood cell count 27.4, hemoglobin 9.9, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 134.
Chem 7 with sodium of 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 28, creatinine 1.4 and glucose 121.
A chest x-ray was performed which showed left lower lobe consolidation.
An electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus tachycardia with poor R wave progression and no Q waves but ST depressions in leads I, II, V4 through V6.
Given the above the patient was sent for CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism.
While in the CT scanner, the patient had increasing respiratory distress and was intubated.
While these decisions were being made, the patient began to become more hypoxemic with decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart rate and bleeding through his endotracheal tube.
He had no spontaneous respirations, no heart rate, no response to painful stimuli and his pupils were unresponsive to light.
The presumed cause of death was respiratory failure due to combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumonia which were both evidenced on his CT angiogram that had since been performed.
