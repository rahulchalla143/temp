Pathology confirmed by [**Hospital6 1129**] as "organizing fibrinous pneumonia, (question infectious).
The Swan-Ganz catheterization during the hospital course at [**Hospital3 417**] revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 and transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function with 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

Oxygen saturation 95%.
Arterial blood gas 7.56/41/68 on mechanical ventilation settings of SIMV at a rate of 6 with tidal volume of 800.
LUNGS:  Auscultation of the lungs revealed rhonchorous transmitted upper airway sounds, anteriorly, with expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
A G-tube was in place.
SKIN:  Examination of the skin was notable for the crusted-erythematous lesions at the angle of the right mouth.

Review of the pathology slides from her wedge resection at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital showed no evidence of BOOP.
As a result, the intravenous corticosteroids were gradually tapered and she is now off steroids.
She remained on Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Diflucan for several days after admission cultures at that point ruled Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
In the last week, prior to discharge, the number of secretions gradually declined and her lung examination dramatically improved.
Followup chest CT in two to three weeks will be worthwhile to check for improvement in the left upper lung cavitary lesion.
