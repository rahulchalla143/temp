Her hematocrit responded to one unit of packed red cells appropriately and did not further drop.
Her lipase was mildly elevated to 78 on admission and remained elevated in the 60s throughout admission, however, this could be attributed to her advanced liver disease and she had no other s/s suggestive  of pancreatitis besides abdominal pain.
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed which showed no SBP.
In house u/s showed patent vasculature, however, and MRI showed no definite area of thrombus.
MRI also showed large duodenal varices.
Later in her hospital course, pt noticed a bulging sensation in her upper pelvis, which could be palpated on physical exam.
Upon further questioning she admitted that she had seen a gynecologist s few months ago who noted an abnormality on her bimanual exam and suggested she follow up with a transvaginal ultrasound, which she had not done yet.
Pt also admitted she no longer gets her period, so a pregnancy test was done and was negative.
You got a blood transfusion of 2 units.
You had an MRI to evaluate your abdominal pain, and it did not show a reason why you were having pain, or any evidence of blood clots in your abdomen.
