Echo TTE [**2141-7-13**] Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Discharged with lovenox until INR becomes therapeutic.
Pt's hematocrit had dropped from 35.2 to 28.7 and repeat was 29.7.
Per Ortho resident low concern for bleeding and the hct remained stable after this time.
PAfib: stable continued verapamil, restarted coumadin goal INR [**12-29**].
CAD: no hx of MI, but with EKG changes and hyperlipidemia, has presumed CAD, so continued statin, Repeat Echo essentially uncahnged from prior EF> 55% - mild demand ischemia likely source of mild troponin leak.
