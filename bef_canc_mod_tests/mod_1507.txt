He was given factor 8 and subsequently had a level of 107, which was as expected.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's STAT head CT revealed a small subdural hematoma over the left parietal lobe.

12 hours per Hematology's recommendation and his headache was controlled with Dilaudid and MS Contin.
The headache improved slowly over the days of hospitalization and a follow-up CT scan showed reduction in size of the left parietal subdural hematoma.
