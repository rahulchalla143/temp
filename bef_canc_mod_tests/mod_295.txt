The patient then experienced an episode of hypotension down to 75/48, fluid responsive.
Blood pressure normalized.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
Blood cultures were obtained.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  By review of systems, the patient came in with a fever of unclear etiology, but blood cultures grew out Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus, coag positive, and suspected to have an infected endocarditis.
On transthoracic echocardiogram was not shown to have any vegetations.
On transesophageal echocardiogram, 5 mm vegetation was found on the aortic valve on both sides of the leaflet without any abscess in the aortic root.
However, we also considered other possible sources of infection to be considered meningitis, and he was empirically started on ceftriaxone, consider chest x-ray which did not reveal any acute consolidations.
CT scan of the abdomen was negative.
Urinalysis was normal.
Once the blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus aureus, sensitivities came back, he was switched to oxacillin and gentamicin.
A lumbar puncture was performed and did not reveal an infection in that system, no meningitis.
Given the positive blood cultures, it was confident that it was sepsis, however, he had a depressed ejection fraction on echocardiogram again likely secondary to sepsis.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram after clinical improvement showed his ejection fraction improving to over 45%, closer to his baseline.
It was felt by ID and cardiology that repeat transesophageal echocardiogram was not necessary unless he had persistent fevers or blood cultures.
He went to urgent cardiac cath which revealed 3VD and had two vessels PTCA'd.
Hip:  He had a MRI that showed bony destruction of his right hip likely osteomyelitis.
Creatinine was very stable around 0.9.
He is continuing to have hematuria, but the clots were minimized and hematocrit was stable.
In terms of hematocrit, his hematocrit was low in the beginning we thought secondary to phlebotomy and boluses of fluid.
Blood sugar remained stable.
In terms of Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition: Electrolytes were repleted as necessary and large fluid boluses were given.
