She is being followed by [**Hospital **] clinic outpatient and blood cultures were sent on [**2202-2-15**] as part of the work up.
The cultures returned today with GPR and GNR and she was referred to the ED.
Still brown stool but occult blood positive in [**Hospital **] clinic recently per the patient.
In the ED, her vitals were T 99.6, BP 90/56, HR 88, RR 16, O2sat 96% RA.
She was given gentamycin 80mg IV x1 and blood clutures were sent prior to abx.

HCT was initially 39 and nadered at 24.9 with the LGIB.
LFTs were elevated but at her baseline: ALT-34 AST-89* AlkPhos-246* TotBili-0.7  [**2202-2-20**] 08:20AM BLOOD IgG-758 IgA-LESS THAN  IgM-28* [**2202-2-25**] 01:42PM BLOOD IgG-574* IgA-5* IgM-14* [**2202-2-27**] 07:50AM BLOOD IgG-1219 IgA-8* IgM-13*  STUDIES:  [**2202-2-19**] ECHO: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-5-7**], the findings are similar.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is seen.
[**2202-2-26**] KUB: Single AP supine view of the abdomen is obtained [**2202-2-26**] at 17:33 hours.
It is compared with the most recent study of [**2202-2-24**] at 10:32 hours.
The level of the hemidiaphragms is not included on the current examination.
Her hospital course is described below by problem:  # bacteremia: GNR and GPR growing in anaerobic bottles of two different sets of cultures which turned out to be bacteroides and clostridium.
Her subsequent cultures before and after antibiotics were negative for any bacterial growth.
Given her PMH and her murmur which may have been louder recently, she had an TTE which did not show any vegitations- it was unlikely anyway given the GNR and GPR (done before speciation).
Given these symptoms, she had an inpatient colonoscopy and stool cultures were sent.
All stool cultures remained negative (including yersinia, E. coli O157:H2, camplyobacter, shigella, salmonella, cyclospora, microsporidia, O&P x3, C. diff)- AFB still pending.
The day after colonoscopy she developed BRBPR with clots and her HCT dropped from 36 to 25 in 24 hours.
Her HCT remained stable around 25 after that.
Several AFB cultures to monitor for recurrence were pending at time of discharge.
EKG confirmed this prolongation.
She should have further EKG checks as an outpatient.
Repeat Ig levels were low and she was given another 35g on [**2202-2-26**].
Repeat levels prior to discharge showed an IgG of over 1000.
You had an ECHO (ultrasound of the heart) which was normal.
You also had a colonoscopy with biopsies which lead to bleeding.
You were given 9 units of PRBCs and your blood level is now stable.
