In the ER the patient received an EKG demonstrating low voltage, and CXR demonstrated a grossly enlarged heart.
Bedside echo demonstrated large cardiac effusion, and the patient was transferred to CCU for further management.

Blood cultures [**2114-4-1**] [**12-26**] likely contaminated with skin flora (GPC) otherwise no growth to date.
Pericardial fluid transudative, gram stain negative for organisms, no growth of organisms in culture, no malignant cells on cytologic exam .
Echo [**2114-4-4**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-4-2**], the pericardial  effusion is slightly larger.
Echo [**2114-4-2**] There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Echo [**2114-3-30**] 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are  normal (LVEF>55%).
ECG Study Date of [**2114-4-3**] Atrial fibrillation.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2114-3-30**] Subxiphoid [**Date Range 99607**] was performed with one pass, draining approximately 450ml of sero-sanguinous fluid.
The initial pericardial pressures were elevated with significant respiratory variation.
The mean pressure was approximately 24mm Hg.
A post-procedure echocardiogram demonstrated a moderate residual effusion and successful [**Date Range 99607**] of large pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2114-3-30**] The cardiac shadow is again grossly enlarged, however, there has been interval decrease in size.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2114-3-29**] There are no prior studies for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old female with increasing dyspnea upon exertion, found to have large cardiac effusion on CXR and echocardiography.
The patient had serial echocardiograms showing gradual reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid.
Fluid analysis revealed a transudate without evidence of infection or malignant cells.
Mammography was negative in [**2109**].
PPD was negative.
Chest xray did not suggest presence of parechymal disease.
Echocardiogram at admission demonstrated a large effusion approx 3cm in diameter,  EF>55% with normal LV function, global RV hypokinesis & dilation as well as LA/IVC dilation.
Repeat echo on [**4-4**] indicated the expansion of the effusion to about 1cm in diamter, appearing to be chronically accumulating (but not large enough to merit acute surgical intervention).
Per report, echo in [**2109**] had 4+TR, mod MR, moderately dilated RV with moderate hypokinesis, and a minimally dilated LA.
LV size and function was normal; no effusion was seen.
***FOLLOW UP: The patient is scheduled for surveillance echocardiogram on [**4-11**], and results were requested to be faxed to the PCP's office.
Also, screening of 5HIAA level to rule out carcinoid as a cause for effusion was still pending at discharge.
Anemia -For chronic anemia and history of iron deficient anemia, the patient received 2 units PRBC at admission that raised her hematocrit from 24 to above 30 where it then remained stable.
Stool was trace guaiac positive in the ED.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency and retic count was appropriate.
Hematocrit was stable in range of 27-30.
Chronic hyonatremia - Her sodium ranged in the high 120s and was thought chronically reduced in the setting of loop diuretic use and possibly SIADH after analysis of urine electrolytes and osmolality.
Fluid restriction of 1.5L daily.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need a follow up echocardiogram to check for recurrence of pericardial effusion.
Also, testing for 5HIAA level is still pending at time of discharge.
Echocardiogram: [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**Location (un) 470**] [**Hospital Unit Name 723**] [**Apartment Address(1) 99608**].
