Admission Date:  [**2124-3-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-3-10**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post a recent two-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on [**2124-2-17**], diabetes, hypertension, and a recently noted right upper lobe lung nodule on prior CT scan, who presents to the hospital on [**2124-3-3**] for wheezing and dyspnea noted by VNA at home.
He was initially admitted to Surgical Intensive Care Unit when found to have a sodium of 112 in the Emergency Department.
Over the next 72 hours, his sodium improved from 112-126.
Lung nodule as noted on prior CT scan.
Prior cerebrovascular accident found incidentally on head CT scan.
Echocardiogram report.
Pre-CABG was noted to have an ejection fraction of 60-79% with 3-4+ MR.  Cardiac catheterization pre-CABG by report:  Ejection fraction of 35%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT TIME OF TRANSFER FROM THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: Vitals:  Temperature 99.5, pulse 72-83, blood pressure 109-132/44-50, respiratory rate 19-20, and pulse oximetry is 95-98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular: Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
LABORATORY STUDIES: White blood count 8.2, hematocrit 27.5, platelets 598,000.
Sodium 126, potassium 4.9, chloride 97, glucose 79, magnesium 2.0, free calcium 1.11, cortisol 8.6.
Chest x-ray on [**2124-3-3**] showed an interval increase in the patient's small right pleural effusion with adjacent increased opacity in the posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe, question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.
From prior admission, chest CT scan on [**2124-2-16**] noted bilateral small effusions with adjacent atelectasis, an addition consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, atelectasis, versus aspiration, versus pneumonia.
His scars showed good evidence of healing.
Repeat chest x-ray after the patient was transferred to the floor showed additional interval increase in the patient's right sided pleural effusion which was thought to be possibly associated with a right lower lobe consolidation.
Given the patient's history of right upper lobe nodule on CT scan however, possibility of a malignant effusion was also considered possible.
As noted, the patient is noted to have an interval increase in the size of a right sided pleural effusion compared to last chest x-ray from prior admission and even an additional interval increase during the first several days of his hospitalization here.
Was noted to have a low grade temperature early on his hospitalization and chest x-ray did suggest the possible associated right lower lobe consolidation.
There were 1+ polys, no organisms noted on the Gram stain, and bacterial cultures were negative.
Given the presence of his right upper lobe lung nodule and the results of his urine electrolytes, the patient was thought to have SIADH.
He was initially placed on hypertonic saline and then on a strict fluid restriction, which resulted in improvement in his sodium to approximately 130 by the time of discharge.
PTH level was checked and pending at the time of discharge.
The patient is noted to have a low hematocrit to approximately 27-28 which was not substantially changed from his hematocrit at the time of his last discharge.
His iron studies revealed a low iron, a mid to low TIBC, and an elevated ferritin suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic disease.
He was also transfused 1 unit of total red blood cells during this hospitalization which raised his hematocrit to approximately 30.
Patient's family noted that on repeat evaluation he was noted not to have prostate cancer, although it is unclear of the exact workup.
His fingersticks remained within good control.
A home safety evaluation will also be performed.
The left groin wound should be dressed with wet-to-dry normal saline dressings with 2 x 2 gauze q day.
