Per EMS the patinet was confused and then one minute later was entirely unresponsive with GCS 3. .
There, head CT showed a small L posterior temporal SAH, which was confirmed on head MRI/A.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Electrolytes returned markedly abnormal and the patient reported had a 7 beat run of vtach, followed by wavering heart rates greater than 100 in afib, and then in NSR and in the low 60s.
They recommended repeat head CT to evaluate his SAH, and will assess for need for EEG based on his course and responsiveness.
They recommended repleting his electrolytes, however after this recommendation, repeat studies returned and were relatively unremarkable.

WBC 12.7 with no bands and 77% pmns.
Creatinine at baseline of 1.4 (unchanged from [**10-22**]).
Echo [**6-2**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast (rest injection only).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Head CT [**6-2**]: Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in left posterior temporal lobe unchanged from study 14 hours prior.
MRI would be recommended if clinical concern for infarct remains.
[**Location (un) 620**] chest CT with contrast performed for r/o dissection: NO EVIDENCE OF AORTIC DISSECTION.
[**Location (un) 620**] head CT: PROBABLE SMALL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR TEMPORAL LOBE.
CT C-spine: 1.
head MR/MRA (neuro attg read) from [**Location (un) 620**]: scattered FLAIR and T2 abnormalities c/w small vessel disease.
also have EKG rhythm strips showing several instances of sinus pauses up to longest of about 2 seconds interspersed with a narrow tachycardia.
UA: blood but negative for infection Blood culture: pending serum tox screen negative except for positive benzos urine tox screen negative .
Holter monitor [**6-21**]: 1.

Echocardiographic images reported separately and attached.
He was initially started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for possible aspiration, however when sputum cultures were negative antibiotics were discontinued.
EEG showed no epileptiform foci.
Lumbar puncture was negative for infection, and blood and urine cultures were negative.
Repeat head imaging showed a CVA in the thalami and Left caudate nucleus.
Echo showed no structural abnormalities and no patent foramen.
Leukocytosis: WBC 31 on [**6-14**], blood culture on [**6-12**] right PICC with coag neg staph in [**2-15**] sets (likely contaminant).
All cultures subsequently are negative to date.

Toxin B is still pending.
Anemia: Hct remained stable over the last few days at around 24-25.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
He should have a colonoscopy as an outpt when his medical issues become more stable.
