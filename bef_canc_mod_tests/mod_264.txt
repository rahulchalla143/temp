A CT chest would be helpful for further evaluation.
EKG: sinus rhythm at 90, normal axis, inverted T wave in V1 (old), T wave flattening V2, upsloping T wave in V2-5 (old) .
Chest CT ([**8-30**]): Since [**2147-5-6**] and [**2147-7-4**] diffuse ground-glass opacity and intralobular reticulations throughout the left lung and right upper lobe is new; the profusion is much less in the right lower lobe with relative sparing of subpleural parenchyma.
Chest CT [**2147-9-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Cell counts/diff, cytology, and cultures from BAL were unremarkable.
High resolution chest CT scan demonstrated new, diffuse ground-glass opacity with intralobular reticulation in the left lung and right upper lobe, less in the right lower lobe.
[**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, legionella urinary antigen, BAL for AFB and PCP DFA were negative, negative beta-glucan and galactomanan.
Complement levels were within normal limits.
CBC differential failed to demonstrate a peripheral eosinophilia.
