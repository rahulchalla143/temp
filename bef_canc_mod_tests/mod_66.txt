There is no good contrast enhancement of the abdomen and pelvis, which were done as an addition after PE study, and if clinically warranted, further evaluation can be done by multiphasic CT  Cardiac Cath: 1.
Hemodynamic evaluation on entry revealed mildly elevated right-sided pressures (mean RA was 10 and RVEDP was 14 mmHg), mildly elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 17 mmHg and LVEDP was 19 mmHg), and severely elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 70/29/49 mmHg).
The central aortic pressure was 105/55/71 mmHg.
The cardiac index was normal at 3.7 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was elevated at 305 dynes-sec/cm5.
Hemodynamic evaluation after 15 minutes of 100% inhaled oxygen revealed severely elevated pulmonary pressures of 71/30/50 mmHg.
The cardiac index was normal at 3.8 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
The PVR was elevated at 326 dynes-sec/cm5.
Hemodynamic evaluation after 15 minutes of inhaled nitric oxide revealed severely elevated pulmonary pressures of 65/29/42 mmHg.
The cardiac index was normal at 3.6 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
The PVR was elevated at 248 dynes-sec/cm5.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2105-4-24**], there has been no significant change.
He is usually on 3L NC at home at baseline with sats 88-90%.
CT chest showed pulmonary edema and effusions, LENIS negative for DVT, and TTE with bubble negative for shunt.
CTA was negative for PE.
After his catheterization, his baseline sats were lower in the 80s.
His saturations were 94% at rest and then decreased to low 80s with ambulation.
Lung biopsy slides from [**2103-5-25**] were obtained from [**Hospital1 2177**] and are under review here currently.
Obtained stress MIBI which showed moderate reversible inferior defect.
BNP 600s.
Cath without sig CAD [**5-5**], no interventions performed.
Possible diastolic CHF - Increased pulmonary edema by CXR and CT scan.
Repeat TTE in house w/ preserved systolic function, but increased pulm HTN.
Cath [**5-6**] without evidence of diastolic or systolic failure.
Wedge was 15.
Blood cx from [**4-28**] grew 1/2 bottles with micrococcus.
Cultures from [**4-29**] from line and peripheral also with G+cocci as well as tip of hickman.
DM - Glucophage was d/c'd secondary to renal insufficiency.
No Retroperitoneal bleed on CT scan.
Iron labs c/w ACD.
His HCT remained stable.
LBP - Percocet prn  Renal - Cr up to 2.3 likely secondary to overdiuresis vs cath dye load.
Urine lytes c/w prerenal etiology likely to diuresis.
ERCP with ampulla inflammation, needs repeat biopsy in [**4-8**] months.
Gastric emptying study normal.
Rash - Chest rash secondary to flolan.
Groin rash thought to be fungal in origen.
