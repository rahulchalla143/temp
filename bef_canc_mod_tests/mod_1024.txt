STD in I, II, AVF, V4-V6 and STE in V1 and AVR.
Past Medical History: # Cardiac Hx: Rheumatic Heart Disease - as a child Myocardial Infarction: [**2099**] A Fib: had a few episodes after MI in [**2099**] - but not known to have AFib since OSteoporosis Hypothyroidism (THyroid nodule removed) HTN Hypercholesterolemia Appendectomy Breast Lumpectomy x 4 B/L LE vein stripping # Baseline Hct: 30 ([**2-28**]   Social History: Retired school teacher No tobacco, No EtOH  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: ADmission Physical Exam: T: 98  BP: 85/55  HR: 70s HEENT: PERRL EOMI.
1+ edema   Pertinent Results: ECHO: [**2101-11-3**]: - LVEF: 70% - Marked LA enlargement - Mild symmetric LVH - Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
- Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: *4.2 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) .
Cath [**2101-11-3**]: - 0.9cm^2 aortic valve area with 60mmHg peak aortic valve gradient - consistent with aortic valve stenosis - 50% mid LAD - R dominant circulation - unchanged from [**2100-3-5**] .
[**2101-11-4**]: CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis: INDICATION: Asymmetric hilum on chest x-ray.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are heavy aortic calcifications and coronary artery calcifications.
There is a 3-mm nodule within the right middle lobe, as seen on image 38.
There is a 5-mm nodule within the left mid lung, as seen on image 26.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is residual contrast within the bladder.
Left renal mass, incompletely characterized on this study is indicative of renal cell carcinoma.
Lung bases show small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: 11.0 x 11.7 x 10.4 cm heterogeneous mass arising from the left kidney.
[**2101-11-6**]: CT Head w/ contrast - NO intracranial hemorrhages or masses .
[**2101-11-6**]: CT chest w/ contrast: IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple lung nodules smaller than 5 mm.
Lung nodules of this appearance and size in patients without malignancy generally represent benign findings; however, in the presence of a large left renal mass, the nature of these lesions are indeterminate.
This study was not performed for the purposes of staging an intra-abdominal mass.
Increased tracer uptake is seen approximately at T1, which is consistent with a collapsed vertebra as seen on a recent CT examination.
# Cardiac: On admission from OSH, patient was sent for cardiac cath which revealed: 1.
She also had an Echocardiogram which demonstrated: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
She was then admitted to the CCU on levophed and transfused for a Hct goal of 28.
She also had an MRI to better delineate the mass.
#Ischemia: - No significant ischemia by cath on [**11-3**] - 50% occ of LAD - on ASA, Statin, BB .
# Renal Mass: - 9.8 x 8 cm mass - contrast flowing through kidney per CT report.
# Fever/UTI: PAtient was found to have a temp to 101.6 via rectum -> culture x 2 sent She was found to have a UTI and was started on Levaquin.
Blood cultures were negative, but urine cultures eventually grew out E Coli, which was sensitive to Levoquin.
Hct stable from [**Date range (1) 54629**] after transfusion.
Date to be planned between patient and CT surgery.
