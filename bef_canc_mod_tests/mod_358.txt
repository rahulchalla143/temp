His blood pressure was down in the 80-90 systolic range and his BNP was in the 700's.
He was admitted, had no biomarker evidence of MI, was diuresed, and underwent an echocardiogram yesterday showing an EF of 30% which was essentially unchanged, but he was found to have new 3+ mitral regurgitation and hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Cardiomyopathy/chronic LV systolic heart failure with EF of 30% s/p ICD in [**2177**].
Lung cancer, s/p right upper lobectomy, chemo, & XRT 6.
VS: T 98.4  BP 107/69  HR 94  RR 18  O2sat 100% on 2 L/min NC HEENT: NCAT.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

Patient has had right upper lung and chest wall resection.
ECG [**2181-10-17**] 1:46:26 AM Sinus rhythm and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 143 bpm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2177-10-30**] paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has appeared.
Cardiac catheterization [**2181-10-17**]   1.
Selective venous conduit angiography was not performed as the SVG's were known to be occluded.
Abdominal aortography using an angled pigtail catheter just below the level of the renal arteries revealed no apparent renal artery stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic blood pressure with SBP of 101 mmHg, elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 13 mmHg and mean PCWP of 22 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
Echocardiogram [**2181-10-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with akinesis to dyskinesis of thinned inferior and infero-lateral walls.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
PCI [**2181-10-18**] 1.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel.
Cardiac catheretizations this admission showed PCW 22 and LVEDP 26 mm Hg with preserved cardiac index.
Abdominal aortography showed extensive aortic and iliac disease, precluding using of the Impella Assist Device.
Repeat echocardiogram here showed moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation, prompting the decision to revascularize the native circumflex in hopes of reducing papillary muscle ischemic dysfunction.
His filling pressures were elevated at catheterization.
He was evaluated by EP who felt that no further changes to his pacer/ICD settings were needed at this time.
With pre-hydration prior to catheterization and judicious diuresis, his creatinine had returned to a baseline of 1.2 on the day of discharge.
You had a catheterization that showed an artery that needed a stent.
You had another catheterization in which the stent was placed, and then you were monitored in the intensive care unit while you had a balloon pump helping your blood pressure stay high.
