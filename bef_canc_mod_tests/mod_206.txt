In the ED, his VS were 100.7, Tmax 102 89 120/68 18 97% RA.
EKG showed ST depression in V4-V6 as well as I and aVL and upsloping ST elevation in V1 and V2.
Troponin was 0.27 (last Trop 0.04 in [**10-22**]).
Allergies: Plavix--rash Simvastatin--myalgia Tape--rash HCTZ--unkown reaction  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use; quit 25 years ago.
Physical Exam: VS - 99.7 131/78 91 20 96% RA 175 pounds Gen: Pale-appearing middle aged male in NAD.
JVP of 5cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: LABORATORY DATA: CK 198 Troponin 0.27 CK-MB 4 Hct 25 Cr 2.3 .
EKG demonstrated NSR with old Q wave in V3 but new ST depressions in V5-V6 and I, aVL as well as ST elevations in V1 and V2 as compared with prior dated [**2154-7-25**].
CXR [**10-10**]: TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There are slight increased patchy opacities in the right lower lobe, which is seen to project posteriorly on the lateral view.
Echo [**10-11**]: The left atrium and right atrium is moderately dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-31**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more extensive (now involving the basal inferior and inferolateral walls), the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased, and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
PORTABLE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**10-13**]) FINDINGS: Limited grayscale images of the abdomen do not detect ascites and limited views of the liver suggest normal echotexture.
CXR [**10-13**]: Increased airspace disease is evident by progressive increasing density of the bilateral consolidations, the left now clearly expressing itself as such.
ABDOMINAL FILM ON [**2154-10-13**] INDICATION: Abdominal distention, increased dyspnea and difficulty breathing.
A single view of the abdomen shows nonspecific non-obstructed bowel gas pattern with predominantly gas-filled large bowel visualized.
CXR [**10-13**]: Increased airspace disease is evident by progressive increasing density of the bilateral consolidations, the left now clearly expressing itself as such.
Echo [**10-15**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Agitated saline contrast study is suggestive of intracardiac shunt with Valsalva release consistent with the presence of a patent foramen ovale (or ASD).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-10-11**], ventricular function appears similar.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital 1516**] Hospital course: Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] with NSTEMI with positive enzymes, (peak trop 0.54, CK 298, CK-MB 6), and EKG with inferolateral 1-2mm ST depressions, 1mm ST depressions in aVL and 1mm STE in aVR (has baseline 1-2mm STE in V1, V2).
Was treated with abx for PNA, and pulm also had plan for bronch/IBAL [**10-14**] but course was complicated by intermittent hypotension and hct drop to 25 for which he was transfused 3 units of prbc's and 1L of NS.
After receiving the blood transfusion pt started to experience acute SOB this am at around 2:30am.
Patient was given furosemide 40mg IV with urine output of 700cc in 2 hours.
He was also given morphine 1mg IV x 4, and lorazepam 0.5mg IV x 1.
ANCA was negative making Wegener's very unlikely.
# CHF with EF 35% Pt also arrived fluid overloaded and in acute on chronic systolic heart failure after the transfusions.
Repeat echo on [**10-15**] was unchaged from [**10-11**].
Patients creatinine was also >2 presenting another argument to hold off on doing a cath.
Plan was for f/u with cards in [**12-18**] weeks which was communicated with pt.
# Atrial Fibrillation On the evening of extubation ([**10-15**]) pt entered afib with a ventricular resonse rate of 100-120s.
# Metabolic acidosis/diarrhea/hypokalemia Pt had an anion gap of 22 when arriving to the floor, likely [**1-18**] uremia.
Pt was instructed to follow up closely with his PCP to have potassium checked on [**10-22**] and [**10-25**].
Tacrolimus was in therpeutic range at the time of d/c.
# Anemia to 25 with recent baseline hct 25-30 As mentioned above was given 3-4 units of prbc's prior to CCU transfer.
Blood counts in the CCU improved with hct in 32-33 range and no further transfusions were needed.
Pt was guaiac negative and no other source of bleeding was identified other than the DAH.
Perhaps a medication effect, although bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if persists and other causes are ruled out as an outpt.
Outpatient Lab Work Chem-10 and Tacrolimus level on [**2154-10-22**] and again on [**2154-10-25**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia NSTEMI Atrial fibrillation Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to pneumonia and anticoagulaion Acute on chronic systolic heart failure Acute on chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: STEMI d/c summ: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a pneumonia, Acute on chronic systolic heart failure, Acute on chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to pneumonia and anticoagulaion and a small non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
