He had an uneventful postoperative period until 5 AM with chest pain, shortness of breath, and anterior and lateral ST depressions 2 mm to 3 mm in size.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse pulmonary edema.
The patient subsequently ruled in for non ST elevation MI with CK over 1100.
Significant findings at catheterization included elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure of 28, 90% proximal LAD lesion, 70% mid left circumflex lesion and no significant right coronary artery disease.
The patient was also noted to have significant aortic stenosis with a valve area of approximately 0.8 cm squared and gradient of 39 mm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  Temperature 100.6, heart rate 81, blood pressure 114/56, oxygen saturation 100% on assist-controlled ventilation.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following: Peak CK 1158, peak MB 36, peak troponin I greater than 58.
White blood count 12.0, hematocrit 30.8, platelet count 137,000, sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride 105, total CO2 18, BUN 62, creatinine 3.2, glucose 269, INR 1.1, PTT 30.1.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
Echocardiogram on [**10-26**], revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction approximately 45% to 50% and inferior wall hypokinesis.
The patient was restarted on Metoprolol and Hydralazine when the blood pressure could tolerate it.
By the time of discharge, the patient's blood pressures had decreased to be in the range of systolics of 100 to 130 and diastolics 50 to 70.
The echocardiogram on [**10-26**] revealed aortic valve area of approximately 0.6 cm squared and a mean aortic valve gradient of 60 mmHg.
During the course of his afterload reduction, the patient's mean arterial pressures were monitored and maintained over 60 mmHg.
The oxygenation improved with diuresis and the ventilator was weaned and discontinued on [**10-28**].
The patient had interstitial markings on the chest x-ray.
The patient was treated for the pneumonia with a course of Ceftazidime and Vancomycin, which was changed to IV Levofloxacin and the cultures did not grow organisms.
Post extubation, the patient had good oxygen saturation and at the time of discharge, the patient was doing well on room air.
RENAL:  The patient was noted, prior to admission, to have baseline renal insufficiency and baseline creatinine of approximately 2.0.
After the catheterization, the patient's creatinine increased to a level over 3.5.
He was noted by urine electrolytes to be prerenal.
He also had casts in his urine suggestive of ATN.
Renal ultrasound was obtained to rule out obstruction in the ureters and bladder.
The ultrasound revealed no obstruction.
He was seen by the renal consultation service and a workup for cause of acute renal insufficiency on top of the chronic renal insufficiency was in progress at the time of discharge.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused two units of red cells for hematocrit that reached nadir of 22.6 on [**10-27**].
The hematocrit increased to over 30 and remained over 30 throughout the remainder of his admission.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was initially maintained on an insulin drip for blood sugar control in the CCU.
