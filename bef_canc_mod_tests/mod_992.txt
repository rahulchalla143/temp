# ARF: Likely prerenal, creatinine was up to 9 on admission and patient required MICU admission for hypotension and hyperkalemia.
Renal US was unremarkable for structural renal disease.
Stool studies for c diff and bacterial diarrhea were negative.
The pancreatic enzymes trended down.
# systolic CHF with EF 25%: She remained hypovolemic during the admission.
TO DO FOR PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] check blood pressure, weight and creatinine, BUN and potassium.
If patient blood pressure above systolic of 100, please increase carvedilol to 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **].
If the patient blood pressure is above systolic of 120, please restart lisinopril (but please check Cr and Potassium as well- Cr was 1.1 on discharge with baseline at 0.8).
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: acute renal failure diarrhea- viral gastroenteritis hypotension hypovolemic shock  Secondary Diagnosis: chronic systolic CHF with EF 25% CAD   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with low blood pressure and kidney failure.
You should discuss restarting this when you see your primary care physician for repeat labs 3.
