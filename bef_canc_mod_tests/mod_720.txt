On HD 2, perc drainage of L flank extravasation was performed and blood pressure was continued to be supported with fluid boluses.
Antibiotics was was changed to meropenum, gent and fluc based on clx results-pseudomonas grew from sputum cultures.
On HD 6, echo demonstrated normal cardiac function, pateint started trach collar trials, octreotide was started, physical therapy was started and patient was evaluated for a passy muir valve.
Also, RUQ US demonstrated GB sludge and repeat CT demonstrated near complete resolution of L fluid collection but persistent leakage of bowel contents in the anterior abdominal wall.
NGT was discontinued on hospital day 8, steroid wean was begun and urine output responded well to lasix.
His fistula output steadily decreased, but never entirely ceased.
Workup for PE was negative.
A repeat CT scan on [**6-2**] showed no new fluid collections.
A mild bump in his LFTs was attributed to his chronic TPN, and nutrient levels were adjusted.
Vanco and gent were discontinued on [**6-9**], and his pain control was changed to a fentanyl patch and prn morphine.The timing of his fistulogram was discussed at great length, and it was decided the optimal time would be after his discharge to rehab, to allow him time to gain his strength and regain mobility in preparation for the fistulogram and resultant operative assessment.
