Chest x-ray on admission demonstrated heart size within the upper range of normal with a tortuous aorta.
An EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with a rate of 52, with AV conduction delay.
Blood cultures on admission were subsequently found to be negative.
Bile culture demonstrated Citrobacter pansensitive, Enterococcus pansensitive and nonfermenter, resistant to Bactrim other pansensitive.

His creatinine started to increase on hospital day 4 to 2.7 from baseline of 2.
His Prograf level was 11, and IV fluid was decreased.
He underwent a cholangiogram to assess tube placement.
Compared to the cholangiogram performed on [**4-15**], the tip of the T-tube was lower than the prior location, but still located in the common bile duct.
A renal ultrasound was done to evaluate elevated creatinine.
A postop liver duplex was done that demonstrated normal Doppler study, small fluid collection adjacent to the right posterior aspect of the liver.
Pathology report from the liver biopsy from the recipient demonstrated extensive large bile duct necrosis with marked bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils.
He required packed red blood cells for hematocrits of 26.
An ultrasound was done.
On [**5-28**], he underwent a T-tube cholangiogram that demonstrated no leak, or obstruction, or intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Gradually, LFTs trended down with an AST of 24, ALT of 32, alkaline phosphatase of 154, and a T-bili of 4.4.
Creatinine decreased to 1.1.
Hematocrit was stable.
His creatinine trended down to 1.4.
He was transferred to the medical surgical unit on postop day 11, on [**2179-6-1**], and vital signs were stable.
Bedside swallow eval was done again.
Sodium increased to 140.
Sodium continued to stay elevated around 140-145.
His potassium was 5.1.
Respirations were 22-24 per minute.
His lung sounds were diminished at the bases.
Blood cultures were sent off on [**6-4**].
He was initially started on vancomycin and Levaquin, and upon finalization of blood cultures, he was switched to meropenem.
A UA was positive, and urine culture also demonstrated Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem and imipenem.
A chest x-ray demonstrated no pneumothorax, small bilateral pleural effusions that were unchanged with retrocardiac linear atelectasis unchanged.
His left IJ line was changed over a wire with placement confirmed.
He was given IV Lasix, as well as IV fluid, and his sodium trended down.
Creatinine continued to be normal at 1.0, hematocrit was stable, and his white blood cell count remained within normal limits.
Total bilirubin trended down to a low of 1.5.
A repeat bedside swallow eval was done with a video swallow on [**6-15**] which demonstrated mild delay in bolus formation with a single episode of penetration without aspiration.
Cardiac echo was done to assess for vegetations given Klebsiella bacteremia.
Findings included normal size left atrium, elongated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with an EF greater than 55%.
Heart rate was in the 70s with a BP in a range of 110/160 to a systolic in the low- teens.
His heart rate was a bit irregular.
He was monitored with telemetry without incident.
His labs on [**6-17**] were as follows: White blood cell count 9.6, hematocrit 32.8--this was stable, platelet count 365, sodium 136, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, CO2 27, BUN 40, creatinine 0.5, glucose 119, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 2.5, magnesium 1.8, AST 27, ALT 29, alkaline phosphatase 211--this was noted to gradually increase each day on [**6-8**] from 109 and each day gradually increasing up to 211.
His total bilirubin remained stable at 1.6, with an albumin of 2.4.
once daily, heparin 5000 units SC b.i.d., insulin - Lantus 30 units SC at bedtime with Humalog sliding scale starting at 121-160 - 2 units; 161-200 - 3 units; 201-240 - 5 units of Humalog; 241-280- 7 units of Humalog with Accu-Cheks q.i.d., lansoprazole 30 mg via NG tube once daily, metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o.
