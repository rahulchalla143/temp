Her blood pressure dropped to 95/43 and given lack of improvement after receiving 3L NS, she is being transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-9-12**] heart rate has increased.
[**7-2**]: KUB Single AP abdominal radiograph obtained, however, limited as only the superior portion of the abdomen imaged.
[**7-2**]: Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2137-2-7**] show slightly increased interstitial lung markings, which may represent mild edema with areas of new patchy opacity in the right lung base and left mid lung, which may represent atelectasis although aspiration/pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Chest [**2137-7-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2137-7-7**] MRI HIP FINDINGS: Please note that due to hardware failure, the complete sequences could not be obtained.
8/3 L HIP XR: IMPRESSION: 1.
Due to the patient's large size MRI may not be possible and CT scan may be the best alternative.
Her baseline SBP is between 110-120's.
After transfer to the floor on [**2137-7-4**] her BP remained stable SBP 110s-120s, no longer requiring IVF.
Her U/A was positive for leukocytes and nitrites but no WBCs and urine cx were negative.
Since her urine cultures and blood cultures were all negative, we explored other etiologies for her fever.
She had a CTA that did not show a PE but did show possible PNA.
MRI showed abnormal marrow signal of B/L ischial tuberosities near areas of decubitus ulcers c/w osteomyelitis.
She will also need follow-up of inflammatory markers which trended down during hospital stay.
CT head was negative.
8)COPD: Pt reports she has "lung disease" but denies known h/o COPD and PFTs in [**2128**] were normal.
