Now readmitted with increased SOB and weight gain (148 on [**11-13**], 153 on [**11-14**], goal is 132).
ABP 7.19/82/94 placed on bipap.
K was 6.2 and recieved 10 units of insulin/D50/2gm cal glu.
CXR showed worse right pleural effusion aas compared to previous.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
CHF - EF >55% 2+MR [**Month/Day/Year 31820**], RV dysfunction, moderate pulmonary HTN 4.
MDS 7.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T= 99.8, HR = 60-89, BP = 82/45 on dopa of 5, RR = 20 , SaO2 = 100% on AC 500, rate 18, Peep 8.
weight 153 lbs General: uncomfortable, mild distress, intubated HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic head, no nuchal rigidity, anicteric sclera, moist mucous membranes.
Chest: chest rose and fell with equal size, shape and symmetry, lungs with decreased breath sounds, left greater than right.
CV: PMI appreciated in the fifth ICS in the midclavicular line- hyperdymanic, afib, mechanical S1 and S2.
Comparison study taken 3 hours earlier.
An external electrode overlies the inferior aspect of the cardiac silhouette.
Repeat CXR showed increased right pleural effusion compared to the CXR after the thoracentesis.
Decompensated CHF: The patient came in with a weight of 69.4kg and his dry weight is 60kg.
As his urine output fell, he was started on a Lasix drip.
He was eventually switched converted to standing po Bumex 2 mg po bid and achieved his ideal wt of 60 kg and remained stable.
These medications were administered at bedtime since his SBP drops to 80's with these meds.
Pt achieved his ideal dry weight of 60.5 kg at one point, but wt returned to 63.5 kg which was thought to be secondary to sodium retention from the prednisone he took for gout flare.
His discharge weight was 62.8 kg.
Pt is very sensitive to ACEI and drops his BP in 80's, so it is given at bedtime.
It is emphasized that his baseline BP is in the 80's-low 100's, and no medications should be held for SBP of high 80's or 90's.
He was initially continued on iron and folate, but the EPO was given 10,000 units qMWF which is half of what he was getting on last admission to keep his Hct stable.
His Hct slowly drifted down, so the EPO was increased to 20,000 units qMWF with good response.
His Hct remained stable at 29-30.
His creatinine improved to his near baseline after aggressive diuresis to improved the cardiac output.
Coumadin was re-started with goal of INR 2.5-3.5.
INR was 3.5 on discharge.
FEN: Pt needs to be on 2gm sodium diet, cardiac diet, and fluid restriction of 1.5 L.  Pt needs to be weighed daily and be reported to MD if he has more than 1 kg of weight gain, so his medications could be adjusted.
Warfarin Sodium 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Please have INR checked frequently.
Warfarin Sodium 1 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO once a day: Please base the dosing on INR level.
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Pt should have his INR checked until it is at a stable level between 2.5-3.5, and have the coumadin dose adjusted accordingly.
