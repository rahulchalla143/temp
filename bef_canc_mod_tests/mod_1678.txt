MICROBIOLOGY: [**2201-1-24**] 6:51 pm URINE CULTURE (Final [**2201-1-26**]): NO GROWTH.
[**2201-1-24**] 9:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE PICC LINE: NGTD (final results pending)  IMAGING / STUDIES: # ECG ([**2201-1-24**] at 6:07:50 PM): Normal sinus rhythm with short P-R interval.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2201-1-21**] no diagnostic interim change.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 62 106 104 420/423 49 -33 68  # CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2201-1-24**] at 6:06 PM): FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
# CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2201-1-24**] at 9:41 PM): There are moderate simple bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, partially imaged.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a 7.8 x 3.6 x 7.1 cm right upper quadrant high density collection, most likely representing a hematoma adjacent to the entry of the J-tube.
Evaluation of the solid organs is limited due to the lack of IV contrast.
No abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 86 year old male with CAD, AS, DM2, HTN, HLD, and recent J tube placement and balloon valvuloplasty who presented with dyspnea and chest discomfort, and was found to have worse anemia due to an intraperitoneal hematoma at his J tube site.
He was initially admitted to the ACS service for evaluation and treatment of low Hct and an anterior intraperitoneal hematoma.
Troponin was < 0.01, and his EKG showed no acute ischemic changes.
CT abdomen showed a 7.8 x 3.6 x 7.1 cm hematoma in the anterior abdomen intraperitoneally near the site of his recent J-tube placement and lysis of adhesions.
His CT was otherwise reassuring, with only a small amount of free air consistent with his recent J tube placement.
He was admitted to the ICU, where his Hct was serially checked.
His Hct remained stable after the unit of PRBCs, and he did not experience any further chest pain.
He was transferred to the floor on HD2 and managed conservatively with serial hematocrits, which ranged between 22-25 from a baseline Hct in the high 30s.
# Aspiration: Video swallow study showed aspiration of all consistencies on [**2201-1-20**] during his prior admission.
The patient expressed an interest in eating, so a repeat video swallow evaluation was performed on [**2201-1-28**] to reassess his aspiration risk.
The video swallow exam showed improvement, but continued high aspiration risk.
Found to have pleural effusions and volume overload on CXR on [**2201-1-24**], but has remained close to euvolemic since transfer to floor.
EKG and Troponin on admission were negative for ischemia.
His initial hypotension was likely hypovolemic given his hematoma and emesis, with no fevers to suggest sepsis.
-- Blood cultures from [**2201-1-24**] showed NGTD but final results were pending at the time of discharge -- Will need follow-up CBC in [**1-15**] days -- Stopped SC heparin due to hematoma but given risk of DVT, could consider restarting within 1 week   Medications on Admission: 1. atorvastatin 40 mg Tablet [**Date Range **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You had a CAT scan of your abdomen and pelvis which showed a hematoma around your gastric tube site.
Your blood count was low on admission and you were given blood.
It was felt that your blood count was low due to the hematoma.
After you were given blood, your blood count remained stable.
You also had an evaluation by the swallowing team who felt that you were not currently safe to eat due to the risk of aspiration.
If your blood count is stable over the next 1 week, this should be restarted for DVT prophylaxis.
