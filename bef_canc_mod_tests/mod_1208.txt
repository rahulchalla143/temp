In the ED, had BNP newly elevated to 279 and had CXR showing increased interstitial markings, read by radiology as pulmonary vascular congestion without focal consolidation.
Labs in the ED were notable for K 2.4, Cl 74, HCO3 45, and glucose 336. .
Of note, his admission weight was 371 lbs and he was noted to have actually decreased his weight by 13 lbs since his last hospital discharge.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was given 60 po potassium and oxygenation improved to 90-92% on 6.5 Liters.

CXR notable for increase vascular congestion likely secondary to chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia as this has been shown to cause sodium retention due to aldosterone imbalance.
Since patient does not use supplemental oxygen at home to improve his hypoxia, and ?using BiPAP consistently, he was likely retaining more salt and water causing him to become more volume overloaded causing worsening hypoxia.
On transfer to medicine floor, total cumulative fluid balance was almost negative 6 L. Patient also had hypokalemia and was started on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
His electrolytes were stable on this diuretic regimen with minimal potassium and magnesium repletion.
Blood sugar was not well controlled, so glargine dose was increased to 50 units qam and 80 units qhs with a humalog insulin sliding scale.
