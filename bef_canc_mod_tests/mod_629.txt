A CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was obtained that did not show a PE, but a LLL pneumonia and a R posterior perihepatic fluid collection were visualized.
Cardiovascular:  Given the reported history of CHF, and findings on his CXR an echo was obtained on [**2158-8-15**].
This showed that LV and RV systolic function were normal(LVEF>55%).
His PA numbers improved and his swan was subsequently removed.
He was electively intubated [**2158-8-11**] and bronchoscopy was performed.
His effusions eventually improved and his oxygenation improved, but he continued to have a poor respiratory drive, requiring high pressure support.
A post-pyloric dobhoff was placed, and TF were advanced to goal of 120cc/h of [**2-9**] strength 1cc/kg formula (currently on impact w/ fibre).
Liver Transplant: LFT's and coags were normal on admission.
His creatinine peaked at 1.8, and subsequently came down to 1.2 and stabilized.
HEME:  Required blood transfusions initially for a borderline/low HCT of 28.
ID:  He was started on zosyn emperically, however his BAL grew multiresistant klebsiella, sensitive only to meropenem.
