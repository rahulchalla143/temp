She was treated with IV Lasix and a repeat TTE showed progression of the restenosis of her bioprosthetic valve.
Cardiac surgery was reconsulted for surgical evaluation Cardiac Echocardiogram: [**2125-10-16**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed tamponade.
She was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn while awaiting sputum cultures and these were discontinued once cultures came back negative.
She is to have daily Chem 10 labs checked to monitor renal function closely.
An ACE-I was not initiated due to her elevated creatinine.
Her renal function labs were stable at the time of discharge.
The patient spiked a temperature of 101 and blood cultures form [**11-3**] came back with SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
The infectious disease team was consulted and recommended Ciprofloxacin for a 14 day course from [**11-5**] (Blood cultures negative x 2 on [**11-5**]) Ciprofloxacin is to be continued until [**2125-11-19**].
Urine culture was pending and needs to be followed up.
She was afebrile and WBC was normal at the time of discharge.
She did have a moderate left effusion seen on discharge CXR and the CXR will be repeated on Friday [**11-16**] before follow up clinic appointment.
