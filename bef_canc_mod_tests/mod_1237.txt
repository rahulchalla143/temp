He returned, and then on returning he had [**6-1**] chest pressure with radiation to his left arm which he considers his anginal equivalent.
Thirty minutes later while in bed he had [**9-1**] chest pressure relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The physical examination on admission showed a temperature of 97.8, pulse of 50, blood pressure 122/46, 99% on 2 liters, respiratory rate 13, weight was 155 pounds to 160 pounds.
His head revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
His neck revealed there was no jugular venous distention.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination was nondistended.
Dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
His genitourinary examination showed guaiac-positive stool.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  Laboratory values on admission showed a first set of creatine kinases were actually negative at 45, troponin of less than 0.3.
His SMA-7 was unremarkable except for a glucose of 174.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with first-degree AV block, ST depressions in V4 to V6 which were new.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes, and he was subjected to a Persantine thallium test which showed a moderate reversible inferior wall defect with an ejection fraction of 65%.
The patient was then taken to catheterization on [**9-21**] which showed 2-vessel disease with left main coronary that was normal.
Left ventricular ejection fraction was 57%.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 12, which was considered normal.
On the night of [**9-21**], he began to experience chest pressure which was increasing in pain, and so the patient was taken for a re-look angiography.
Echocardiogram at this time showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, and echocardiogram on the next morning in the Coronary Care Unit showed no additional effusions.
Enzymes drawn that day showed evidence for a myocardial infarction with a creatine kinase of 1211, 97 MB fraction 8%, and the next subsequent creatine kinases were 1065, 1213.
His electrocardiogram actually showed over time evolving anterolateral non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
On [**9-23**] it was noted that his hematocrit had dropped from the lower 30s to 24%, and the patient also complained of new onset left shoulder pain; so, the patient underwent a CT angiography which showed no dissection.
The aorta and a CT of his abdomen and pelvis showed no retroperitoneal bleeds, no femoral bleeds.
Moreover, his hemolysis laboratory workup did not show evidence of intravascular hemolysis.
His hematocrit decreased isolated but then began to recover and improve to the point where on discharge he was below normal but above 30%.
It was never determined what the source of the decrease in hematocrit was.
