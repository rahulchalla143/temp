FINDINGS: Compared to the study of 6 hours earlier, there has been an improvement in the congestive heart failure pattern with decreased upper zone redistribution.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 10 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated (PA pressure was 47/18 mm Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were moderately elevated (mean PCW pressure was 21 mm Hg).
Central arterial pressure was mildy elevated (aortic pressure was 150/63 mm Hg).
Cardiac index was low (at 2.2 L/min/m2).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Anterior, septal, apical, distal inferior, and distal lateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
Her echo showed an EF of less than 30%, 2+ MR, overall left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed.
Anterior, septal, apical, distal inferior, and distal lateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis was present.
She diuresed well and became euvolemic with a base weight of 49.8kg.
Her cath showed 20% LMCA, 90% LAD which was stented, and a 60% OM1 lesion.
Her peak troponin 1.07 and peak CK of 354.
# Acute renal failure- The patient had an increase in her Cr here thought to be due to contrast.
Recheck in [**2-10**] weeks.
Her HCT decreased to 26 ans she was transfused 1 unit to a HCT of 32. .
# Abdominal Pain: The paitent had abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting daily at home and this continued here.
She should have a colonoscopy as an outpaitent and a HCT checked in 1 week.
Methyldopa 750mg po tid 7.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
