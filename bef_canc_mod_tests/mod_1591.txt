Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-1-25**], the pericardial effusion is larger in size and there is now more fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
Right heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right sided  pressures with diastolic equalization (mean RA 29mmHg, RVEDP 29mmHg) and elevated intrapericardial pressures (24mmHg).
Pulmonary arterial  pressures were elevated (58/31/39 mmHg) and left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean PCWP 39mmHg).
Limited resting hemodynamics after pericardiocentesis demonstrated significant improvement of intrapericardial pressures (to 10mmHg).
Pericardiocentesis was performed via a subxiphoid approach.
An echocardiogram performed after pericardiocentesis demonstrated significant reduction of pericardial effusion and resolution of tamponade physiology.
TTE ([**2-9**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-2-6**], the pericardial effusion is similar.
RADIOLOGY: CT Head ([**2-6**]) IMPRESSION: Although the sensitivity of non-contrast CT in the evaluation of intracranial metastases is limited, no obvious metastasis is identified.
Consider gadolinium-enhanced MRI for further evaluation as clinically indicated.
CT Torso ([**2-6**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old man with CAD (LAD and OM1 stents in [**2167**]), systolic CHF (EF 45%), HTN, HL, DM2, CKD (baseline Cr 3.0) presented with shortness of breath and was found to have cardiac tamponade physiology on echo in the ED.
Potential etiologies included uremia, infections, neoplasm, myocarditis, hypothyroidism (but TSH normal on [**2173-1-25**]).
Fluid gram stain was negative for infection.
After the evacuation, blood pressure was stable and pulsus was normal.
Repeat echo the following day showed no evidence of tamponade, although an echo-dense moderate effusion persisted.
TTE on discharge showed stable moderate effusion and newly-observed wall-motion abnormalities (though pt remained asymptomatic).
Creatinine improved to baseline after pericardiocentesis to baseline.
