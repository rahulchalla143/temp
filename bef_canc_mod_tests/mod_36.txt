Chills, hypotension and tachycardia was due to probable UTI with urine culture growth of E coli.
It seems as though his hypotension was a baseline blood pressure (at home per wife SBP 80-100) and his tachycardia was the major issue.
His toprol and digoxin at low doses were restarted and his amiodarone 400mg po daily was continued.
His tachycardia resolved, his BP remained 80-100 systolic and was asymptomatic.
He will continue on this but should be weighed daily at home and his torsemide should be adjusted based on his edema, weight and BUN/Cr.
CKD 3: creatinine remained stable around at baseline through diuresis.
DECREASED MOBILITY: subacute decline in mobility, patient has been walking much less with a walker at home per his wife, PT evaluated the patient and recommended rehab, which he and his wife refused (as she had a bad experience involving the development of pressure sores in the past) and instead PT recommended he stay for [**1-22**] inpt PT sessions then be discharged home w/ PT and VNA.
Please weigh yourself daily and call your doctor for any increase in weight by 3 lbs.
