Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for an intestinal bleed that lowered your blood pressure and red blood cell count.
We gave you IV fluids and blood, and this improved your blood pressure and red blood cell count, so you were transferred to a regular medical floor.
You also had an endoscopy where a tube with a camera was used to look at your esophagus and stomach.
Since you have done well on the medical floor and your blood pressure and blood count are stable, we will discharge you today.
