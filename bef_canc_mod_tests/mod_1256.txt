[**2184-9-12**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL Dual-lead right pectoral pacemaker with right atrial and right ventricular leads is unchanged from prior studies.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-2**], findings are similar.
Left ventricular systolic function may have been slightly underestimated on the prior study.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed the catheter tip in the right atrium with no kinks along the course of the catheter and no pneumothorax.
PPD was read as 0 mm induration on [**9-19**].
#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Admission CXR showed a moderately-sized right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
TTE [**9-14**] showed a dilated RV with mild global systolic dysfunction and evidence of volume overload, normal global and regional LV systolic function (LVEF 55-60%), and severe functional TR and mild AR/MR.
#UTI - Admission urinalysis showed [**5-11**] WBC, moderate bacteria, and trace leukocyte esterase.
She was treated with 3 days of ceftriaxone until urine culture revealed ~1000 colonies MRSA, likely a skin contaminant.
Coumadin was resumed after the procedure with a goal INR 2.0-3.0.
The patient will be discharged with VNA services to monitor INR and adjust coumadin dosing accordingly.
#Hypertension - Blood pressure was low-normal during the hospitalization and metoprolol was decreased to 25 mg qHS due to concerns for hypotension, particularly in the setting of hemodialysis.
Calcium and vitamin D were continued.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder Sig: One (1) tablespoon powder PO once daily as directed.
Warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Adjust dose as directed to maintain INR 2.0-3.0.
