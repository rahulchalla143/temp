ECG [**11-17**]: Sinus rhythm.
ECHO [**2172-11-11**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-14**], the aortic valve gradient has increased.
Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are similar.
Cardiac catheterization [**2172-11-11**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Chest CT [**2172-11-18**]: Unsigned at discharge.
[**Month (only) 116**] be consistent with mass or atelectasis. "
BP was quite high and responded to Hydralazine 50 mg TID.
She may require additional Hydralazine IV for SBP > 190.
Goal SBP is 120.
# HCT drop: Transfused [**11-14**] for total 2U pRBCs during LOS.
Creatinine down dramatically in the last few days.
Please monitor creatinine every few days until at baseline of 1.0. .
# Acute Diastolic dysfunction: CXR [**11-17**] showed improving pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion, thought [**1-21**] ischemia.
ECHO with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function (EF>55%).
Weight stable.
CXR with ?
Non contrast chest CT performed to further evaluation and final read was not available at time of discharge, but there were several areas concerning for possible masses that could look like atelectasis, thus it would be prudent to obtain a chest CT in 1 month as an outpatient.
Echocardiogram shows Mild AS, mild AR.
*****Incidental Finding on Chest CT: there are two featuers whcih are concerning for diagnosis other than a serous pleural effusion.
[**Month (only) 116**] be consistent with mass or atelectasis.
recommend f/u Chest CT in one month as an [**Month (only) 3782**].
You were in the CCU with acute kidney failure, diastolic heart dysfunction, high blood pressure and anemia.
An abdominal CT scan was done to check for bleeding and a mass was seen on the left ovary.
This is probably a cyst but an ultrasound should be performed after you leave rehabilitation to further assess the mass.
Start taking heparin injections to prevent a blood clot 4.
Start Hydralazine three times a day to control your blood pressure 10.
