She underwent a CTA of her chest which revealed subsegmental PEs.
Her EKG revealed an STE so a code stemi was called, cardiology fellow evaluated the patient and deemed this not to be a STEMI and suggested a CTA of her chest.

CTA Chest ([**4-2**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Follow up chest CT in [**9-19**] months is recommended.
Bilateral LE LENIs - IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus extending from the distal right common femoral vein into the mid superficial femoral vein and proximal deep femoral vein.
Echo ([**4-5**]) - The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-8-25**], the pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher.
She had lower extremity ultrasounds performed which showed nonocclusive thrombus extending from the distal right common femoral vein into the mid superficial femoral vein and proximal deep femoral vein.
She had an echo performed that did show evidence of right-sided heart strain, consistent with PE (see above for full report) but no evidence of right heart failure and was relatively unchanged from prior.
She had serial cardiac enzymes drawn which were stable.
She denied any chest pain on the medicine floor and repeat EKGs were without ST elevatoin.
# LLL nodule: Of note, imaging showed a LLL ground glass nodule that should have f/u CT scan in [**9-19**] months (see report) and also right infrahilar density which was decresae din size from prior but which recommended outpatient PET scan to determine if possible malignancy given history of lung cancer.

Since your coumadin levels were below therapeutic, your coumadin dose was titrated to bring your anticoagulation levels within the therapeutic range.
You will remain on the heparin drip until your INR (coumadin level) is in a good range for 48 hours.
