[**2142-7-21**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
# GI bleed:  Patient with known esophageal varices and rectal varices as well as prior admissions for variceal bleeds presented with BRBPR x1 day.
He was found to have a hct of 17 from a baseline of 25, and was transfused 2 units FFP and 1 unit PRBC in the ED.
NG lavage was negative and he had a grossly positive rectal exam in ED.
In the MICU, he received 4 additional units PRBC for a total of 5 units PRBC with hct 16.8 -> 23-24, which remained stable subsequently.
CT abdomen showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient underwent an EGD and sigmoidoscopy which showed no active bleed, but was significant for a small esophageal ulcer and distal grade I-II esophageal varices, gastric antral vascular ectasia, evidence of hypertensive gastropathy, and patchy rectal erythema consistent with colopathy.
RUQ US showed patent portal vein.
A pleural effusion was noted on exam thought to be hepatic hydrothorax without evidence of fever or cough.
# Indirect hyperbilirubinemia:  Differential includes hemolysis from blood transfusions v. Zieve's syndrome.
An EGD was done which revealed nonbleeding esophageal varices which are varicose veins in the esophageal lining.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed varicose veins in the rectum but no source of active bleeding either.
As a result, you may need a colonoscopy as an outpatient to evaluate the rest of your colon for a site of active bleeding.
