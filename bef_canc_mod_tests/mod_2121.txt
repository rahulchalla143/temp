Her oxygen saturation improved significantly with decreased oxygen requirement.
The patient underwent a CT scan to better define a right lower lobe mass in her lung.
The CT showed the density in place; however, it was not clear initially if this was a tumor or if this was some other kind of density.
She underwent a FDG PET scan which did not show any FDG uptake, making a tumor significantly less likely.
Hematology:  Hematocrit was trending down during the hospital stay, and one unit of packed red blood cells was transfused.
Iron studies are pending at the time of discharge.
Lorazepam 0.5 to 1 mg p.o.
