ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hematemesis/Acute blood loss Anemia:  Patient was initially admitted to the ICU for frequent episodes of hematemesis with stable blood pressures and heart rate in the ED.
GI was consulted and EGD was done on day of admission which showed likely Dieulafoy's lesion near anastatmotic site from prior gastric bypass surgery, and three clips were placed.
Followup Hct was 24 after EGD, transfused 2 units of PRBC.
Followup Hct suggested continued bleeding so she was transfused 2 more units PRBC.
Third EGD was done on [**2-16**] which showed no bleeding at anastamotic site and areas suggestive of ischemia around the anastamotic site.
Patient was evaluated by the surgical team who recommended no acute intervention and transfusion goal of Hct >30 and platelets >70, IR was made aware of patient who recommended no acute intervention.
Throughout course in MICU patient's blood pressure, urine output remained stable and patient was continued on protonix 40 mg IV BID.
Her Hct remained stable and she was transitioned to orals.
Abdominal exam remained benign.
# Cough: has been ongoing for about 2 weeks, no change with antibiotics and CXR with no acute process making PNA or CHF exac less likely.
