She denies any recent illnesses, fever, chills, weight gain or weight loss, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dysuria, bleeding, myalgias, or rashes.
A CXR revealed mild volume overload and a left lower lobe small opacity, which could reflect a combination of atelectasis and effusion, with possible superimposed pneumonia.
A CTA chest with and without contrast was obtained; prelim report found no evidence of PE or acute aortic pathology, but did note findings suggestive of infection, predominantly RLL superior segment.
A non-contrast CT head was also obtained, and the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] suggested no acute intracranial process s/p fall.
Patient received Lasix 20mg IV once, with initial urine output of 400mL.
An EKG revealed a fib; Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3-V6; diffuse ST/TW changes most pronounced inferiorly with concave ST segments but no clear contiguous ST elevations or reciprocal changes (per cardiology fellow).
Cardiac enzymes were sent, and initial values were CK 2122, MB 43, Trop 0.36.
BNP was 5125. .
She was hypotensive BP 70s/40s, with HR in the 80s-90s.

[**6-2**] CTA of chest .
Wet Read: PXDb WED [**2179-6-2**] 6:46 PM no PE or acute aortic syndromes Findings suggestive of infection, predominantly RLL superior segment   Final Report INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
TECHNIQUE: Helical CT acquisition from top of the lungs to upper abdomen with and without intravenous contrast and with multiplanar reformations.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No mediastinal hemorrhage, intramural hematoma or displaced intimal calcification on the non-contrast images.
There are numerous subcentimeter mediastinal nodes that are not enlarged by CT criteria.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
[**6-3**] Chest X Ray .
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2179-6-2**] obtained at 4:44 p.m.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, but there is increased bibasal consolidation accompanied by pleural effusion, findings that might be consistent with aspiration.
A CTA of the chest did not demonstrate a PE, but did reveal scattered groundglass and nodular lung consolidation, most apparent in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and compatible with pneumonia, as well as cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions and mild fluid overload.
The patient's SOB was thought to be secondary to CHF exacerbation in the setting of AF with RVR and possible NSTEMI, as cardiac enzymes were elevated on admission (on admission TnT 0.36 and max 0.63 with max CK-MB 47).
She received metoprolol 5mg IV in the ED for rate control, after which her BP dropped to the 70s/40s.
Further beta blockade was held, and the patient's BP rose to the 90s-100s.
She underwent continued diuresis with furosemide, with close monitoring of her fluid balance and electrolytes.
Metoprolol tartrate was added on [**2179-6-3**] for rate control, as the patient's heart rate remained elevated in the 90s-100s.
A TTE on [**2179-6-3**] demonstrated regional left ventricular systolic dysfunciton consistent with coronary artery disease, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was also treated empirically with levofloxacin for CAP, as CXR and chest CT findings on admission suggested possible focal consolidation, and the patient had an elevated WBC of 20.9 on admission.
Her furosemide was decreased to 40mg once daily on the day of discharge.
She remained afebrile and her antibiotics were stopped due to diarrhea (C diff negative x2) but her WBC continued to fall - WBC 13.4 on discharge.
It was thought the elevation was secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of a fib with RVR and the stress of the mechanical fall, and less likely to be due to ACS.
Her aspirin dose was later decreased to 81mg, and her Plavix was stopped.
She had a TTE on [**2179-6-3**] that revealed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunciton consistent with coronary artery disease.
She sees an outpatient cardiologist, and a stress test or cardiac cath may be considered in the future.
Patient was started on lisinopril 20mg daily and tolerated well with systolic blood pressures in the 90-120.
She was monitored on telemetry throught her hospitalization, and continuted to be in a fib.
Her metoprolol dose was changed to 25mg PO BID, however it was soon changed to 12.5mg TID as the patient's BP did not tolerate the higher dose.
Coumadin was initially held as the patient's INR was therapeutic on admission, but it was re-started on [**2179-6-5**] with close monitoring of the INR.
Non-contrast CT head did not reveal any acute intracranial pathology.
Her CK was initially elevated, but trended down quickly and rhabdomyolysis was not a concern.
C. diff toxin assay was negative X twice and colace/levofloxacin was discontinued given her diarrhea.
Her electrolytes and vitals remained stable and her diarrhea improved after less than one day.
