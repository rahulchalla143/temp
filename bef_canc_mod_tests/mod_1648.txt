EGD [**2150-12-4**]: Impression: Ulcer in the antrum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old female with history of PUD, DVT on ASA and coumadin, admitted for GI bleed and hypovolemic shock.
The patient was markedly anemic on admission with a Hct of 10 and evidence of end organ damage with ST depressions anteriorly.
Her blood pressures improved after fluid resuscitation of 1.5L NS, 1 unit UNMATCHED PRBCs and 2 units of FFP.
An endsocpy by GI in the unit showed a single chronic superficial non-bleeding 5 mm ulcer in the antrum.
Her Hct increased appropriately and was 32.9 when she left the ICU, and remained stable thereafter.
Likely this was exacerbated by patient's supratherapeutic INR (8.6) which was reversed.
Anticoagulation was held at discharge (see below).
Coagulopathy:  Patient's INR was likely elevated secondary to coumadin dosing in the seeting of decreased nutritional intake.
Though CXR appearred worse on second day of admission, patient remained stable without fevers or leukocytosis.
