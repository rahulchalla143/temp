However, the shunt has been over shunting and the patient presented with progressive decline in mental status with a CAT scan showing severe midline shift towards the left side and intracranial hemorrhage.
In the OR CSF was sent for culture which was negative.
He was monitored in the ICU for 4 days with a poor exam, he developed a right non reactive pupil on POD#1 and his exam was consistent with posturing.
His CT did show some improvement in midline shift for 48 hours but then later worsened on post op day 3  The degree of inward deformation of the right frontal-temporal convexity cortex is unaltered.
