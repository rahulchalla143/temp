# Urosepsis with Coag negative staph: Her altered mental status was caused by a UTI and bacteremia speciated out as coagulase negative staph aureus.
Her urine grew coag-negative staph; one blood Cx showed coag-negative staph; her sputum Cx grew methacillin resistant coag-positive staph, which was a colonizer of her chronic tracheostomy and did not cause her clinical symptoms.
A vanco trough was checked after 4 doses of the antibiotics, which came back subtherapeutic.
The vanco was redosed to 1250 mg [**Hospital1 **] and her trough was 17.
# Chronic respiratory failure: There were no signs of infection or respiratory compromise on CXR in the ED or in the MICU.
Her trach aspirate did grow out MRSA, but this was a chronic colonizer.
# h/o meningioma s/p CVA: Her neuro exam remained at baseline.
Her neuro exam is significant for a Left 3rd nerve palsy left pupil 6mm fixed, right pupil [**5-9**], L facial droop, wiggles toes on R, weak hand squeeze on R, strength intact on L side We continued her home keppra and decadron, and notified the neurosurgery team of her admission.
The patient's blood cultures have subsequently remained negative, but any positive results will be reported to the patient.
