She was referred for coronary angiogram after having an "abnormal EKG" at Dr.[**Name (NI) 9654**] office.
She initially complained of epigastric tightness radiating to her chest and EKG showed no acute ST changes.
Neck: Supple with JVP difficult to assess [**3-2**] prominent carotid pulse and EJ, but ~10 cm.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, slightly dry MMM, neck supple, JVP flat CV: RR, prominent S1, S2.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ DP thready Left: Carotid 2+ DP thready   Pertinent Results: REPORTS:  ECHO CARDIAC CATH [**2202-4-26**]: 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel CAD.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 162 mmHg.
Return to cath lab for LCX intervention on Thursday [**2202-4-29**] after hydration  CXR AP [**2202-4-27**]: IMPRESSION: New left mid lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
CARDIAC CATH [**2202-5-3**]: COMMENTS: 1- [**Name (NI) 50257**] PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with two overlapping (3.0x8 and 3.0x12 mm) Vision BMSs with excellent results (see PTCA Comments) 2- Unsuccessful attempt to revascularize the OM2 CTO.
3- Staged PCI of the mid LAD (+/- re-attempt to open the OM2) 4- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated  systemic arterial hypertension (154/68 mmHg).
Monitor renal function, continue with Mucomyst and hydration (add lasix to maintain urine output of 100 cc/hour) 6.
RENAL ARTERY U/S [**2202-5-5**]: 1.
CXR [**2202-5-12**]: FINDINGS: New left PICC terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 F with HTN, mechanical AVR, A fib s/p cardioversion, PVD admitted for coronary and renal angiogram.
Patient had chest pain following renal stenting, found to have new ST depressions on EKG and rising cardiac enzymes consistent with NSTEMI.
Pt needed cardiac cath but renal functions following renal artery stenting was elevated.
Patient was brought for cath on [**2202-5-3**], where she underwent a staged PCI of the mid LAD, following which was directly transferred to CCU for closer monitoring.
Overnight in the CCU the patient had more chest pain and concerning EKG changes which prompted a second cardiac catheterization on [**2202-5-4**] where she underwent a [**Hospital1 2177**] also placed in the LAD.
# Anuric acute on chronic renal failure: In the CCU, the patient developed anuric ARF after her 3rd catheterization on [**2202-5-4**] with a peak creatinine of 6.5.
The patient's creatinine continued to improve, on discharge her creatinine was 2.4.
Pt was aggressively fluid restricted down to 1L/day and heparin drip D5W solution was changed to NS and sodium improved on its own.
On discharge her serum sodium was 129.
The effusions were thought to be most likely secondary to CHF given the lack of fevers or white count even after antibiotics.
Given the red blood seen, this would suggest a lower GI source.
On discharge, her hematocrit is 23.8.
A repeat hematocrit will be checked at rehab.
Goal INR of 25.3.5 for the mechanical valve.
On discharge her INR was therpeutic at 2.6.
TTE on this admission shows regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, probable severe mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
Infectious workup was concerning for a pneumonia, which was treated with IV antibiotics.
Creatinine worsened in setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV contrast, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics, hypoperfusion of kidneys from hypotension.
On discharge her creatinine was trending down at 2.4.
