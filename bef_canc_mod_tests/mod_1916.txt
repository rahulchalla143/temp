Cardiac ROS: - positive for DOE, LE edema.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS: T 97.2, BP 161/105, HR 121, RR 22, O2 100% on 2l Gen: pleasant black male in NAD, resp or otherwise.
EKG demonstrated rate of 155, RBBB, atrial fibrillation.
Pertinent Results: Chest Xray [**2114-9-15**] No acute pulmonary process .
LLE LENI [**2114-9-15**] No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
Popliteal vein appears to compress normally in comparison to prior examination but exam was limited in this region.
CTA Chest [**2114-9-15**] No central or segmental pe.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%; this value represents the estimated ejection fraction following a normal left ventricular filling period).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-12-14**], the ventricular rate is now well-controlled and the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.
ETT performed on [**2112-10-4**] demonstrated: 4.5 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol (3.5METs) and stopped for fatigue.
Given 10meq PO Potassium as mildly hypokalemic during hospital stay.
No history of MI, stress uninterpretable secondary to RBBB - continue ASA, Statin, BBlocker, ACEI - f/u with outpatient provider.
-> CTA of chest showed no significant PE but ?
CT Scan of chest demonstrated lymphadenopathy noted on prior scans and stable RUL nodule.
Recommend repeat CT in [**5-8**] months for lymphadenopathy, and outpatient CT scan or PET scan for lymphadenopathy.
GERD, Hiatal Hernia - stable - Ranitidine decreased for Cr 1.4 to daily dosing.
Atrial Fibrillation, 2.
Lung Nodule 7.
Lymphadenopathy  Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of shortness of breath, and lower extremity swelling.
Repeat CT scan in [**5-8**] months for interval change in lung nodules.
Discuss with your PCP regarding PET scan or CT scan for lymphadenopathy in lung nodules.
