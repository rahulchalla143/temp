[**2148-10-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right have progressed in the interval, particularly in the right lower lung where there is also an increasing pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation and/or atelectasis.
[**2148-10-4**] CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O 1.
[**2148-10-2**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON 1.
[**2148-10-2**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 1.
Limited study due to motion artifact, within this limitation, no acute intracranial pathology.
[**2148-10-2**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-5-24**], the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis c/w an acute pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, etc.).
[**2148-10-2**] ECG Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-6-27**].
Recommend repeat study if clinical concern for seizures persists.
[**2148-9-30**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 57-year-old man with AML s/p matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2142**], complicated by GVHD on chronic prednisone with multiple admission for infections now presents with somnolence in the setting if increased sedative medication use, hypercarbic respiratory distress, cough and CXR with LLL consolidation found to have segmental PE.
TTE on [**10-2**] revealed large and hypokinetic RV and CTA showed segmental PE.
CTV showed no evidence of clot in IVC [**Month (only) 7448**].
Non contrast head CT was without hemorrhage, so started on heparin drip with intention to bridge to lovenox.
CXR with LLL consolidation.
Sputum gram stain with GPCs in clusters, GPCs in pairs and chains and GNRs and yeast.
Due to worsening CXR, vanco was changed to linezolid (day 1: [**10-6**]) per ID recs.
# Fungemia: Yeast in urine, sputum and mycolytic blood cultures positive.
Mycolitic blood cultures were sent daily.
CXR showed nodular areas, which was conserning for a mold pneumonia.
An MR head was performed which ruled out fungal brain extension.
Possible sepsis as patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia and leukocytosis with possible sources of infection including pulmonary given LLL opacity on CXR and productive cough.
Urine source also possible given dirty urinalysis in the setting of indwelling catheter.
ECG was without evidence of ischemia.
Hypovolemic shock also possible given that his PO intake had been down prior to admission and his BP was fluid responsive on admission.
His urine, blood, and sputum cultures all returned positive for budding yeast (ID is [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA), so he was initially started on IV fluconazole and was later transitioned to micafungin (day 1 = [**10-3**]).
His dyspnea was treated with either non-rebreather, venti mask, or bipap as tolerated in order to achieve sat > 90%.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.1 from baseline of 0.6-0.7.
Creatinine improved back to baseline with treatment of septic shock.
Has grown E. coli most recently, though did have a negative urine culture on [**9-26**].
His LFT's were mildly elevated at OSH, but has trended down while at [**Hospital1 18**].
His NPh was decreased to 10 units (from 15) due to low sugars.
Anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of back surgery and an IVC [**Year (4 digits) 7448**] was placed.
# Right axillary mass: Noticed by oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was planning on working up as outpatient with CT scan.
Per Spine, lumbar and thoracic spine x-rays were ordered -- these showed no significant interval change.
