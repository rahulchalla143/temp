CT abdomen/pelvis [**2172-2-1**]: 1.
Two large bore IVs were maintained, hematocrits were checked every 6 hours, IV PPI and H2 blocker continued.
Patient underwent EGD with GI which showed: Some contact induced bleeding was noted in the pharynx.
Given suspicion that PEG (per reports, tip in jejunum) might have migrated leading to feeds ending in stomach, a PEG/GJ study was done at the bedside with gastrograffin contrast.
GI was re-consulted and suggested contrast CT to evaluate for obstruction.
The patient was able to tolerate the contrast per PEG and had the CT [**2-1**] am.
# Atrial fibrillation: Regular rate on EKG on admission.
We then did a CT scan that showed that you had no obstruction in your bowels.
