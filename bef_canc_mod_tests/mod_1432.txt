MRI OF THE BRAIN: There are multiple FLAIR hyperintense foci, in the cerebral white matter, subcortical and periventricular in location, predominant subcortical white matter, in both cerebral hemispheres.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are normal.
MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: The distal left vertebral, basilar, posterior inferior cerebellar, and the posterior cerebral arteries are patent.
MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK: The origins of the arch vessels are patent.
Patient shas bilateral carotid artery stents in the distal common carotid and proximal internal carotid arteries, evaluation of which is limited on the present study.
Though there is decreased signal along the presumed course of the stents, with some hypointense areas on the medial aspect of the right cervical internal carotid artery which can be due to atherosclerotic calcifications, assessment is limited on the present study.
Pt was continued on ASA, plavix and a statin and anti-hypertensives and anti-anginals (imdur), and flomax were held upon admission to CCU to maintain pt's blood pressure at an adequate level post-carotid stenting.
Following carotid stenting the pt was placed on phenylephrine to maintain systolic blood pressures in the 120's.
Antihypertensives were held to promote cerebral blood flow.
The patient was instructed to follow up with outpatient cardiologist to restart Imdur when blood pressure tolerates.
Baseline creatinine was noted to be unknown but creatinine was stable at 1.3 (1.2 on admission) post-procedure.
His EKG was unchanged and the patient had no cardiac symptoms.
Hemoglobin A1C was within normal limits and a lipied panel was also within normal limits.
CT of the head did not reveal any acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI/MRA of head and neck showed multiple small acute infarcts in the right frontal precentral and right parietal postcentral subcortical in location, with patent major intracranial arteries, likely related to embolic etiology.
The patient had serial neuro checks which did not reveal additional neurologic deficits.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
When you follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday please he will re-start the Imdur after confirming that your blood pressure will tolerate it.
