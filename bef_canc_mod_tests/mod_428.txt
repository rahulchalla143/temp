Head CT was showed right mastoiditis but no ICH.
CXR showed multifocal PNA and slightly increased effusions from [**3-10**], cardiomegaly.
CT abdomen with po/IV contrast showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, CHF.
His labs were remarkable for WBC 28.9 and BUN 40/cr 1.4 and BNP 1870.
He also grew gram positive cocci [**3-6**] blood cultures - alpha hemolytic strep.
Of note, he was d/c'd from [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2-21**] for new diagnoses of nonischemic dilated CM and kappa light chain gammopathy/plasma cell dyscrasia - monoclonal.
Nonischemic dilated CM - EF 47% 2.
CRI 3. light chain gammopathy/plasma cell dyscrasia - monoclonal via SPEP/UPEP - had renal bx/BM bx 4.
Anemia with baseline hct 28 5.

CXR showed multifocal PNA (LUL, RLL, ?RML) and slightly increased effusions from [**3-10**], cardiomegaly.
EKG - LAD, sinus tachy @ 120, nl intervals, LVH, .
CT abdomen with po/IV contrast showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, CHF.
(of note, last CT at [**Hospital1 2177**] with pararenal hematoma after biopsy, lung bases pneumonitis) .
CT head at OSH: possible R mastoiditis, otherwise unremarkabel awith no intracranial mass or hemorrhage  ABG - 7.55/32/79 at OSH on RA -> 7.51/34/73 few hrs later -> 7.55/29/69 this AM .
CK 5, Trop I 0.25 ((0.1-1.5 - borderline on OSH labs) .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is  severely depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely  more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
IMPRESSION:  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-12-29**],  the LV function has decreased substantially with now global hypokinesis with  inferior wall akinesis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion to indicate acute infarct.
At the OSH blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started empirically on meningitis doses of ceftriaxone, although LP was not performed.
Head CT there showed only R sided possible mastoiditis.
CXR showed multifocal bilateral pneumonia, however the patient was recently treated for pneumonia at [**Hospital1 2177**] and it is cunclear what his CXR looked like at that time.
After OSH blood cultures revealed strep pneumonia, dexamethasone was started for a planned total of 16 doses.
CSF was consistent with bacterial meningitis, despite the patient being on antibiotics for approximately three days.
Echo performed while in the ICU showed EF 20% and new global and inferior hypopkinesis.
The patient has a known history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with last echo in [**Month (only) **] showing EF of 35-40% and a clean catheterization at that time.
We continued hte patien's home blood pressure medications, but decreased his lisinopril to 40mg po qday, and continued his home lasix.
The patient is being worked up as an outpatient at [**Hospital1 2177**] for possible vasculitis versus intrinsic renal disease with renal biopsy results pending.
He is also being worked up at [**Hospital1 2177**] for likely plasma cell dyscrasia with light chain gammopathy.
An HIV test was done given multiple infections over past few months.
