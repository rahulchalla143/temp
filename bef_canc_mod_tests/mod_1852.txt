Of note, her BP regimen was recently simplified [**9-28**] from 4 agents to only toprol XL and diltiazem ER, and she wonders if her BP is being effectively controlled.
ECG with ?
CXR showed mild congestion consistent with CHF although PNA could not be excluded.
Malignant HTN complicated by seizures ([**5-26**]) not on anti-epileptics and seizure free since this time; denies h/o CVA 3.
Diastolic CHF 6.

Prior studies - .
Echo ([**3-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59F h/o ESRD on HD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant, malignant HTN complicated by seizures, diastolic CHF, Afib, h/o medical non-compliance presented with SOB and hypertensive urgency.
BP 200/100 in the ED without focal symptoms, improved on nitro gtt.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, and she received morphine PRN for pain serial ECGs, and fluid and Na restricted diet with monitoring of both.
You were transferred to the general medical floor where your blood pressure came back down to your baseline.
