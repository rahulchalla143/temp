CTA 1.
Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then remained stable at 0.12.
Repeat EKGs showed no changes.
The pt's chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome.
Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.
Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal TIBC, ferritin.
DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an insulin sliding scale.
