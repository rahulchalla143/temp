There, she was lavaged, fluid bolused, and a CT scan with oral contrast (no IV contrast due to creatinine of 3).
She then got a CT scan which showed no free air, no free fluid, no evidence of pseudocyst, and the pancreas unremarkable.
At 11/8, at 2am, her insulin drip was discontinued and she was controlled with RISS, and her hypotension improved to the 110s/80s on IVF (her intake was 9 liters over 24 hours and her output was 25-40 cc/hr)  She was then trensferred to the floors once she was hemodynamically stable, her crit stabilized, and there were no signs of active GI bleed.

She also had associated epigastric tenderness with a h/o pancreatitis with calcifications seen on the CT in the ER.
Possible sources of bleed included [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, esophagitis, gastritis, or hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
CT scan with PO contrast showed no evidence of free air/fluid or any other intrabdominal process.
She is to follow up with GI for an outpatient EGD and to be maintained on Protonix daily.
Her sugars were then controlled with NPH insulin and eventually [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 18 units due to some high glucose levels throughout her course.
CT scan showed evidence of calcification in the head of the pancreas.
Due to her risk of developing necrotizing pancreatitis, she was started on levo/flagyl and her abdominal exam monitored serially.
