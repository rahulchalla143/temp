Subsequently, he went into AF with [**Hospital1 5509**] up to the 120's and his SBP remained in the 80-90's.

It is currently unclear why he developed AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**], as his Hct is at baseline.
His CXR suggested vascular congestion but this could have been caused by the AF.
ACS is unlikely as he has no CP or EKG changes consistent with ischemia and his trop 0.02 in the setting of Cr of 1.4.
His TSH came back normal as well at 1.7.
CHF: He has an EF 45% and his CXR shows signs of mild fluid overload, likely due to his AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**].
However, his Sats were 96-100% on RA.
AI hemolytic anemia: His admission hct was 26.6, which is at his baseline but hematocrit dropped to 22.
You also had a low blood count and you received several blood transfusions.
Your heart rate returned to a normal level and your condition was stable.
