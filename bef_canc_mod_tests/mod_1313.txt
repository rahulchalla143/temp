Coronary artery disease with clean coronaries and a catheterization in [**2121**].

Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admit hematocrit 35.3, white count 7.2, platelets 167, MCV 94.

ECG [**1-16**]:  Sinus bradycardia, left bundle branch old, normal axis.
Bright red blood per rectum:  The patient had a TAG red blood cell scan which showed active bleeding in the cecum.
Later the same day on the 18th, the patient had a colonoscopy and the GI team was able to find the bleeding lesion in the cecum, and cauterized it, and injected.

On the morning of the 18th, the patient received another unit, bumped his hematocrit to 32.1 and it was stable at 31.5 on the day of discharge.
The patient's beta blocker was instituted with decrease in heart rate and blood pressure.
On the day following the colonoscopy and the bowel prep, the patient did have blood pressure in the low systolics in the 90s, responded to IV fluids most likely representing dehydration in the context of being NPO with a bowel prep and a valvular lesion that is preload dependent.
Following appropriate IV hydration approximately 3 liters in 24 hours, patient's blood pressure was stable in the 140s and 150s range.
