IMAGING: CT neck [**2157-11-25**]: 1.
An MRI with contrast is recommended for further evaluation of this abnormality.
CXR [**2157-11-25**]: IMPRESSION: New bibasilar opacities, which given the clinical history are suspicious for aspiration, possibly developing pneumonia.
CT Neck/Chest w contrast [**2157-11-27**]: 1.
This finding should be interpreted in conjunction with the separate report of the neck CT scans performed on [**11-27**] and [**11-25**].
MRI Neck w/ and w/o contrast [**2157-11-28**]: FINDINGS: The patient is intubated and there is a nasogastric tube in place.
Chest x-ray [**2157-11-29**]: FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube sits 4 cm above the carina.
Video Oropharyngeal swallow [**2157-12-1**]: FINDINGS: Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
There is slight prominence the posterior soft tissues as better demonstrated on the CT of the neck from [**2157-11-27**].
IMPRESSION: Aspiration and penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
CT neck showed retropharyngeal edema, likely infectious, but no drainable collection.
Levaquin switched to meropenem once patient's UA showed pyuria as he has a history of resistant UTI.
Repeat CT showed very focal, circumferential area of inflammation limited to trachea, not extending past vocal cords.
A MRI was performed to better evaluate for fluid collection, and confirmed that there was no drainable collection.
A gastrograffin swallow study was performed to evaluate for potential esophageal leak, and none was found.
He was evaluated by speech/swallow and had a video oropharyngeal swallow study which showed aspiration and penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids,osteophytosis, and a small esophageal Zenker diverticulum.
# Pleural effusion - CT scan of neck noted large R. pleural effusion.
CXR after chest tube placement showed no persistent focal infiltrate.
In addition, repeat CT scan showed no reaccumulation of fluid.
Cardiac enzymes negative.
On discharge, INR was 1.8, still subtherapeutic.
# Grade [**3-22**] spondylolisthesis C7 on T1: These findings were seen on MRI.
Robitussin Chest Congestion 100 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1) PO at bedtime.
You will not need to have another CAT scan of your neck at this time.
In regards to your neck, imaging showed that you have an old small fracture in your neck from the fall you had 10 years ago.
