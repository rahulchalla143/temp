Underwent cardiac catheterization, w/ BMS to OM2, D1, LCx.
Had peak troponin of 0.33 at that time.
He was in the shower with onset of [**10-22**] squeezing chest pressure without radiation.
These past episodes are similar to daily chest discomfort, but more severe.
He was started on a heparin and nitro drip, and and was admitted for further evaluation and management.
On arrival to the floor, patient's  T 98.6, BP 137/61 P 80 O2 100 % on 2L.

TTE [**3-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demosntrated two vessel coronary artery disease.
The 30% proximal LAD lucency seen on prior angiogram was  unchanged.
Resting hemodynamic assessment revealed a 12 point step-up from the SVC to the PA. A full saturation run was performed (see table above) and The findings were consistent with a possible small left-to-right  intracardiac shunt at the upper chamber (RA) level.
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (134/46 mmHg) and the pulmonary arterial pressure was mildly elevated (39/12 mmHg).
The mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was mildly elevated (11 mmHg).
Final angiography revealed a 20% residual stenosis in the stents, no dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments)  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Patient presented with complaints of chest pain, similar to prior MI.
Hct drop of 10 pts from baseline was thought to be exacerbating factor.
He underwent cardiac cath with PTCA of the LCX/OM2.
# GI Bleed: The patient presented with a hct 10 pt lower since [**Month (only) **] with history of colon CA and guaic positive stool.
Endoscopy was deffered until stable from a cardiac view point, and patinet scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] upon discharge.
You had a cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty of the left circumflex and OM1 arteries.
