An arterial blood gases on the 100 percent rebreather was 7.28/60/102 and the chest x-ray revealed right sided opacities in the right upper, right middle and right lower lungs.
An echocardiogram in the Emergency Department was obtained for increased jugular venous pressure which was negative for any pericardial effusion.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils were equally reactive to light with scleral icterus.
Neck was positive for shotty cervical lymphadenopathy and a jugular venous pulse of 11 cm.
Cardiac exam was notable for tachycardia.
LABORATORY:  Laboratory data on admission:  White count was 10.8.
Hematocrit, 33.5; platelets, 130; MCV, 122.
Differential is 84 percent neutrophils with 11 percent bands, 4 percent lymphocytes and 1 percent monos.
Of note, the creatinine was 1.2.
Liver enzymes on admission were notable for an AST of 148; ALT, 54; alk phos, 168; amylase, 31; total bili, 4; lipase, 7; LDH, 435; albumin 2.7.
An arterial blood gas on admission is noted in the HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS.
A urinalysis was negative.
A chest x-ray revealed dense consolidation of the right upper, middle and lower lobes with air bronchograms.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 60% without pericardial effusion.
Serum toxicology was negative.
Urine toxicology was positive for benzodiazepines, Methadone and opiates.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring of his respiratory status.
On hospital day #2, the patient was also started on Vancomycin given a gram stain sputum positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was also ruled out for tuberculosis with acid fast bacilli negative x 3.
The patient maintained saturations greater than 94% throughout the admission, however on hospital day #7 the patient had an episode of acute desaturation with a decrease in O2 saturation to 68% on room air.
He was placed on 100 percent nonrebreather and a blood gas at this time revealed a pH of 7.24/CO2 95%/O2 139.
A repeat gas was notable for a pH of 7.4/61/79 on six liters.
Upon discharge, the patient continues to require six liters of nasal cannula in order to maintaine oxygen saturations greater than 92%.
Anemia - Upon admission, the patient had a hematocrit level of 33.5.
However, after receiving his PICC line, it was noted that his hematocrit levels had dropped even further with a few readings measuring about 22%.
However, peripheral hematocrit levels drawn at this time, not off of the PICC line, revealed a hematocrit level of 26.5.
Multiple stool guaiacs were negative and hemolysis sites were negative.
The patient hematocrit was 26 on the date of discharge and the patient was hemodynamically stable.
If patient shows signs of acute narcotic withdrawal, the patient may be given an additional 10 mg dose of Methadone as needed with careful monitoring of his respiratory status.
