Admission Date:  [**2167-5-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-6-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-6-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old man with catheterization in [**2161**] showing a normal left main, left anterior descending, 60% proximal in mid, diagonal 70%, diagonal II 70%, intermediate 80%, left circumflex 80%, proximal 70-80%, OM1 70%, right coronary artery 95%, LVEDP 16, RVEDP 10, pulmonary hypertension, CF 39%, and a hypokinetic anterior lateral septal, apical, and posterior walls.
The patient is also status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four and a catheterization in [**2163**] with left main 20%, left anterior descending 40%, proximal diagonal 80%, left circumflex total ramus 80%, patent grafts, and a PAECW of 18, pulmonary hypertension, and global hypokinesis, with a 23% ejection fraction, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The treadmill test was stopped, and the patient was given sublingual Nitroglycerin times two with relief of pain.
?, pulse 88, respirations 18, blood pressure 128/60, 96% on 4 L.  HEENT: Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and minimal symptoms of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 60, wide QRS with ST depression in V2-V6 and in lead II.
CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 11.3, hematocrit 41.9, platelet count 198,000, 67% neutrophils, 22% lymphs, 8% monos; INR 2.1, PT 17.9, PTT 26.7; CK #1 86, troponin less than 0.3; sodium 138, potassium 3.7, chloride 101, bicarb 22, BUN 30, creatinine 1.0, glucose 97.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's CK enzymes were cycled.
He was to have possible catheterization in the morning.
The patient was taken to Catheterization where he was found to have three-vessel disease.
Coronary angiography of the native vessels revealed a right dominant system with three-vessel disease.
Graft angiography showed a patent LIMA left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft posterior descending artery graft.
Right atrial pressure was 13 mmHg with PCP 26 and LV 115/24.
This was suspicious for thrombus, moderate size ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and successful rheolytic thrombectomy, and PTCA stenting of the SVG jump segment from R1 to OM1.
The patient was sent for abdominal CT which showed a retroperitoneal bleed.
Three units of packed red blood cells were transfused, and hematocrit was stabilized.
Heart rate reached the 130s.
On [**5-30**], the patient was without any complaints until 1 p.m. that day when he was walking with Physical Therapy and experienced shortness of breath and a tachycardiac atrial fibrillation rhythm to 106 with maintenance of good blood pressure.
He was found to have atrial fibrillation in the 130s with a blood pressure of 100/60, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 L oxygen nasal cannula.
The patient's symptoms resolved, and the heart rate decreased to the low 100s.
Chest x-ray was negative for congestive heart failure.
Heart rate still rebounded in the 110s to 120s, and an additional 40 mg of Verapamil was given.
He was sent down for an angiographic CT to rule out PE and was found to have multiple PEs on the left, more than the right, with a large clot to the left main.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for critical care evaluation and evaluation by Pulmonary.
Heart rate stabilized so that he was changed to p.o.
Diltiazem with a heart rate maintained in the 60s to 80s.
Duplex venous ultrasounds were done of the patient's right leg which showed positive DVT in the right popliteal and femoral veins.
Heart rate was in the 80-90s.
Respiratory rate was 20-24.
Blood pressure was 115-120/60 and 96% on room air.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
TTE from [**6-1**] showed a moderately dilated left atrium and left ventricle, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Labs on the day of discharge revealed a CBC with a white count of 12.5, hematocrit 31.9, platelet count 218,000; sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, bicarb 21, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8, glucose 91.
Diltiazem, rate controlled less than 100, with no complaints of shortness of breath, and now with right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Infectious disease:  White blood cell count has been decreasing since the time of admission.
The patient is also to follow-up with Electrophysiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks for an EP study or with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] in two weeks.
