He was seen by his PCP and had an Magnetic resonance scan of the cervical spine which was reportedly unchanged from previous.
He was admitted for further workup of his weakness.
Hip abductors was 5- on the right and 5 on the left.
Ankle everters was 4+ on the right and [**1-13**] on the left.
Ankle inverters were 4+ on the right, [**1-13**] on the left.
We decided to do an lumbar puncture as well as an EEG for further evaluation of this.
His Cerebrospinal fluid protein was 157, his glucose was 65, four white cells and 75% lymphs.
The remainder of his laboratory studies, white count was 14.5, hematocrit 27.3, platelets 157, this was after transfusion.
His INR was 1.4, his PTT was 1.4, his creatinine was normal.
We at this felt after the results of his lumbar puncture is most consistent with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
On [**2134-3-4**] he did have an episode of hypotension with lightheadedness on the day prior during his phoresis however, this responded well to normal saline bolus and he did well after holding his Lisinopril, we changed his Atenolol to Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day and watched the blood pressure closely.
His blood pressure normalized and he had no further problems with this.
On [**2134-3-7**] his BUN and creatinine rose to 31 and 2.0.
He had some difficulty with elevating his blood pressure and had an episode where his systolic went to the 60's and due to his hypotension and acute renal failure we decided to admit him to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit service for close follow-up.
We had arranged emergent plasmapheresis that night and used Dopamine for blood pressure support.
His vital capacity was checked q 4 and we put him on normal saline.
His labs remained stable and platelets on [**2134-3-8**] were 57.
We continued to watch him closely in the Intensive Care Unit, his renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
His EMG showed consistent findings with Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
Labile blood pressure may have in fact reflected the involvement of autonomic fibers.
They noted a recent downward trend of his platelets were 19 on [**3-13**] when he was seen which was down from 20 on the 4th, down from 26 also on the 4th, 23 on the 3rd, 32 on the 2nd, 35 on [**2134-3-9**], 39 on [**3-8**] and 57 on [**2134-3-8**] despite therapeutic phoresis.
His chest x-ray was done on [**3-13**] which showed mild cardiomegaly with interstitial edema.
We gave him some Lasix with a platelet transfusion as we wanted to repeat the lumbar puncture again and send off further laboratory tests.
Lumbar puncture on [**3-14**] showed 4 white cells, 64 red cells with 5 polys and 82 lymphs.
The cerebrospinal fluid protein remained elevated at 117 and his glucose was 69.
Latanopros .005% drops one GGT q h.s.
