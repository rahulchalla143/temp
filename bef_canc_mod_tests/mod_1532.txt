ECHO [**2135-8-1**] Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-4-7**], no resting LVOT  gradient is identified on the current study.
[**4-9**] ECHO Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).

DIFFICILE TOXIN URINE CULTURE (Final [**2135-7-30**]):    NO GROWTH AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2135-8-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
Her blood cultures from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] and [**Hospital1 18**] were all negative for growth during her hospital admission.
A chest xray performed showed a left lower lobe infiltrate which was characterized later as most likely being atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
An echo performed during her hospital admission did not reveal any signs of endocarditis.
Her HCT was in her baseline throughtout her hospital admission.
Prior to discharge, her creatinine was at her baseline.
Decreased Platelets- During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission, she was noted to have a Plt count in the 300s in mid [**Month (only) **], but prior to discharge she had dropped to the low 100s.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw platelet count and communicate results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 395**],[**First Name3 (LF) 25**] M. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3070**].
