[**2172-9-4**] 8:32 PM CHEST (PA & LAT) HISTORY: Fever spike, question pneumonia.
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest is compared to prior study [**2172-8-28**].
[**2172-8-26**]-spirometry-Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are mildly reduced, while the FEV1/FVC ratio is   elevated.
This picture is most consistent with an advanced stage of calciphylaxis, however a combination of calciphylaxis and "metastatic calcification" cannot be excluded.
ECG Holter [**2172-9-8**]-Long-term ECG monitoring was performed using a Continuous-Loop Recorder ("[**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts") to evaluate this patient with palpitations to rule out significant arrhythmia.
The baseline recording was sinus tachycardia at rates 102 to 104  BPM with 8 isolated APBs and 1 atrial couplet.
On [**2172-9-8**] the baseline intervals were as follows: rate 102 BPM; QT .34 (slightly prolonged), QRS .08, PR .16.
[**9-11**] chest/abdomen/pelvis CT 1.
[**9-13**] CT head w/o contrast-No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
[**9-23**]-left lower extremity CT-Status post below the knee amputation.

He underwent left BKA with right first toe amputation on [**2172-9-3**].
His imaging studies showed calcification of the medium and small sized vessels.
His course in the vascular ICU was complicated by mental status changes, EEG and head CT were negative and the cause was attributed to his pain medications.
The caspofungin was for treatment of his candiduria, and the vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] was for empiric coverage of pathogens entering through his necrotic skin lesions.
All imaging studies (including scrotal u/s,TEE RUQ u/s, chest, abdomen, pelvis CT) were negative for infectious source.
After transfer he remained afebrile and his blood pressure was stable.
His caspofungin course was completed on [**9-29**] and urine culture afterward was negative.
His calcium phosphate product was stable in the low 20's.
Urology continued to follow him, a bladder scan showed 900cc urine and a coudet catheter was placed.
