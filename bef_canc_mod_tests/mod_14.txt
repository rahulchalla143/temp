Further evaluation with MR would be optimal.
However, given the patient's renal failure, US as an initial study is recommended.
Head CT ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CXR ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Correlation with prior imaging to confirm stability is recommended.
Renal US and doppler ([**3-19**]): FINDINGS: There is a partly cystic/partly solid isoechoic mass again seen in the mid portion of the left kidney which corresponds with the recent CT findings.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained.
Bone Scan ([**3-21**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Renal Scan ([**3-26**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Differential renal function of 39% left kidney and 61% right kidney.
# Renal mass:  The patient was found to have a new renal mass on the CT of her abdomen/pelvis done in the ED to evaluate her flank pain.
On her admission CXR she was found to have a sclerotc focus in her left humeral head which was concerning for metastesis.
This was evaluated with a bone scan which showed no evidence of metastesis.
Urology was consulted and felt that more information was needed before a definitive plan for diagnosis could be developed so a renal scan was preformed to assess the functionality of her kidneys and showed differential renal function of 39% from the left kidney and 61% from the right kidney.
# Hypertensive urgency: Her initial BP was 221/71 with worsening of visual blurring and flank pain.
# Chronic renal failure: The patient had an admission creatinine of 3.4.
Patient had brought labs with her showing Cr 3.0-3.29 in [**2198-12-23**].
FENA of 4.24 consistent with intrinsic or postrenal etiology.
CT abdomen showed no stones, or obvious obstruction.
# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8.
HCT of 31.1 on [**2199-1-20**].
# MGUS: As part of the workup for her chronic renal insufficiency UPEP and SPEP were sent which returned showing a monoclonal IgG lambda protein spike.
There is concern that her kidney disease could be due to amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease, however a kidney biopsy would be necessary to diagnosis this and at this time cannot be preformed given her renal failure.
This was held while she was hospitalized and she was covered with a sliding scale, monitored with qid fingersticks, and kept on a diabetic diet.
Your blood pressure was controlled with medications.
Your scans showed a mass in your left kidney which was concerning for cancer.
A bone scan done for this was normal, which is good.
We did a special kidney scan to take a closer look at the kidney mass.
An appointment was made for you to follow up with your primary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 760**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a blood pressure and blood work check on Monday [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.
You will also need to ask him for a referral to a kidney specialist (nephrologist) and a kidney surgeon (urologist) in [**State 760**].
