C1 esterase inhibitor, C1 inhibitor and tryptase - pending  Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the MICU given concern for airway protection, treated with Famotidine IV, Solumedrol, and IV Benadryl.
He was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.
Patient is on ACE inhibitor and also started Macrobid recently for presumed UTI (Urine culture shows < 100k GNRs); however, he had previously tolerated Macrobid without event.
- Quickly improved with resolution of tongue swelling, no difficulty breathing, ambulatory oxygen saturation on room air on hospital day #3 95-96% - SPEP displayed no specific abnormalities - Normal TSH - Primary care physician should follow up C1 esterase inhibitor, C1 inhibitor, and Tryptase .
UTI: Urine culture from [**5-10**] likely consistent with contaminant in this patient with chronic foley, given <100K colonies.
- Macrobid discontinued, patient noted no penile or scrotal pain - Urine culture from this hospitalization preliminarily was growing >100K colonies of E. Coli, most likely colonization due to chronic foley.
- Considered the need to uptitrate medications with discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, but blood pressure remained normotensive.
