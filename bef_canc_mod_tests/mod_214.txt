CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2186-3-10**] 10:08 AM Opacification at the left lung base has improved, consistent with clearing atelectasis or even earlier aspiration.
CT BRAIN PERFUSION  [**2186-3-9**] 1:21 PM CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute infarction.
CT PERFUSION: The perfusion maps appear normal with no evidence of delayed transit time, reduced blood flow, or reduced blood volume.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenoses.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-3-10**] OBJECT: EE, [**3-9**] TO [**2186-3-10**].
THE HEART WAS MONITORED BECAUSE DISORDERS OF HEART RHYTHMS [**Month (only) **] PRODUCE NEUROLOGICAL COMPLAINTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS SEIZURES, WHEN SYMPTOMATIC, [**Month (only) **] PRODUCE CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
The EEG showed  movement artifact but no electrographic seizure.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-3-9**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: The background rhythm was disorganized throughout the record and generally remained with a 6 Hz maximum in most areas.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were occasional bursts of generalized delta slowing with a bifrontal emphasis.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular tachycardia with a rate of approximately 110.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2186-3-11**] 8:25 AM BRAIN MRI: There is no evidence of mass, midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Following gadolinium no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates an approximately 3-mm aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery.
She was monitored on a CIWA scale but this was discontinued due to low suspicion after a few days.
MRI head/c-spine showed incidental finding of 3mm ACOM aneurysm, otherwise no focal findings.
EEG 24hrs showed no seizures, but some encephalopathic background.
Once this is reached, her dilantin should be tapered down with the assistance of her neurologist - has outpatient neuro f/u w/ Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**] on [**2186-3-30**] at 4:30pm, she will arrange outpatient EMG if the patient is still profoundly weak at that point - fall precautions, OOB to chair - cont thiamine/folate - monitor electrolytes (particularly magnesium) every 2-3 days, replete with IV mag .
# Urosepsis: The patient's blood pressure improved after 2 hours of levophed and IVFs in the MICU.
Once on floor, she did not need any other inverventions and her BPs were 110-120's.
She did spike a fever to 100.6 on evening of [**3-9**], but CXR was negative for pneumonia (was at aspiration risk) and she was not started on antibiotics.
Blood and urine cultures sent and have been negative so far.
One set of blood cultures are pending at this time and should be followed up on by her doctor.
She had a NGT placed on [**3-8**].
Tubefeeds were discontinued and her NGT was pulled on [**3-13**] as the patient's strength improved and she was able to swallow per speech and swallow eval.
