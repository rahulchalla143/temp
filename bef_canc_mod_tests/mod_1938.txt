Studies: ECHO [**2135-2-11**] The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-2**], the right ventricle is not well-visualized on the present study.
Right heart catheterization is recommended if definitive knowledge of pulmonary artery pressure is required.
CXR [**2135-2-8**] IMPRESSION: Trace bilateral pleural effusions with pulmonary vascular engorgement consistent with CHF exacerbation.
CXR [**2135-2-10**] IMPRESSION: Improvement in the mild pulmonary edema and right basilar opacity with a persistent retrocardiac opacity.
The patient remained intubated for 48 hours, with O2 saturation goal>85% and CO2 at his baseline, ~90s.
He was maintained on 3-4L NC during the day, and maintaining O2 saturations >85%.
While on the general medicine floor, the patient's vital signs were stable, with heart rates on the day of [**Month/Day (2) **] ~60s.
There was a low suscpicion for sepsis, adrenal insufficieny, and cardiac event, as the patient was fluid responsive.
While on the medicine floor, the patient's blood pressures were stable.
# diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic CHF, with most recent EF 60% in [**2135-2-11**].
On transfer from the MICU to the general medicine floor, the patient had a creat bump to 1.5, likely from being diuresed.
