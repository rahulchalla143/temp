Rectal dark brown/black stool G+, NG lavage blood tinged, mild [**Year (4 digits) 13223**] and hypotension, also transient EKG change w/ ST depression, given 1L IVF, txn'ed 2u RBC (1st unit [**Unit Number **] mins, second unit over 2 hrs).
Admitted to MICU for further monitoring of hct in setting of likely GIB.
Pt had a colonoscopy on [**2153-8-7**] significant for two nonbleeding polyps in the sigmoid colon.
She also had an EGD on the same date which was significant for erythema, edema, and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis in addition to erythema in the proximal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Occult GI bleed [**7-/2153**] with studies as above 7.

Further incubation showed contamination       with mixed fecal flora.
EGD [**2154-1-22**]: Impression: Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb consistent with duodenitis.
CXR [**2154-2-17**]: An endotracheal tube is present, with the tip in the proximal right main stem bronchus.
CXR [**2154-2-18**]: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved since 6:30 p.m. on [**1-28**].
Tip of a right supraclavicular dual channel central venous line project over the SVC.
CXR [**2154-2-20**]: There is interval resolution of the pulmonary edema.
EGD [**2154-2-21**]: - Normal esophagus.
An A-line was placed.
Her CXR confirmed pulmonary edema.
Her enzymes were trended and remained flat.
She subsequently underwent another HD session on [**2-18**] and was extubated on [**2-19**] as her O2 requirement was markedly decreased and her CXR showed improvement in her edema.
She underwent an EGD which again showed GAVE and argon cauterization was performed.
She continued to have some blood in her stool, but her Hct remained stable.
She was discharged with a Hct of 37.7. .
She required 4 units of pRBCs on [**2-17**] to keep her Hct >28 with a concern for demand ischemia given her h/o CAD.
Her Hct subsequently remained stable.
Her EKG changes resolved with correction of her Hct and her enzymes remained unchanged.
# CHF: Mrs. [**Known lastname 13224**] has a h/o CHF with preserved EF of 60-70% per ECHO on [**2154-2-18**] with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 13225**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7216**] dysfunction.
Her weight and her I/O were closely monitored with a goal of I/O even.
Her electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted prn to keep K>4 and Mg>2.
Secondary diagnosis: Diabetes mellitus type II Diabetic neuropathy/nephropathy ESRD on HD since [**11-30**] CAD Anemia CHF with EF 60-70%, 3+ MR, 2+ TR Gout   Discharge Condition: Good, BP 110/60, HR 86, RR 18, sats 99% on 2L   Discharge Instructions: 1.
You should weigh yourself every morning and call your PCP if weight > 3 lbs.
You should follow-up with the GI department as previously scheduled for a repeat EGD on [**2154-3-7**].

Per your GI doctors, you should be transfused for any hematocrit less than 25.
