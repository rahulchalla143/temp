Mild O2 requirement, 93% on 3L NC, WBC 16.5, and CXR with old L base opacity, started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for empiric treatment of CAP.
RR 28, desatted to 84-88% RA, 90-91% 4L NC.
Repeat CXR showed possible new RML opacity.
CHF- last TTE in [**11-29**] with EF 50-55%, mild LVH, severely dilated LV with intrinsically depressed systolic function [**1-28**] valvular disease 2.
Aortic Regurgitation- 3+ on last TTE 3.
Mitral Regurgitation- [**12-28**]+ on last TTE 4.

EKG Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2102-6-30**] the rate has slowed and ST-T wave abnormalities previously recorded in leads I and aVL are less prominent.
STUDY: CT scan of the pelvis without intravenous contrast.
L-spine IMPRESSION: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis.
Bedside evaluation showed overt aspiration and video evaluation reveals silent aspiration so patient is now on aspiration precautions and modified diet.
His CCB was changed to a BB which he continues on currently.
