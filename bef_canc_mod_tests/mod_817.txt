Hyperdense 6-mm foci in the distal common bile duct raise concern for choledocholithiasis or soft tissue.
Moderate perinephric stranding is slightly worse compared to [**2194-2-27**] and is more prominent on the left versus the right, non-specific, but could relate to acute renal failure.
Findings may be due to ileus, although an early small-bowel obstruction cannot be entirely excluded.
Pus was noted from the biliary tree.
[**2194-9-25**] CT Head: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2194-9-29**] CT Chest/Abdomen: 1.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased from previous examination, and bibasilar atelectasis.
Prior right partial nephrectomy; no definite evidence of recurrent disease on this non-contrast CT although retroperitoneal lymph nodes remain borderline.
[**2194-10-5**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.
A gallbladder ultrasound may be obtained for further evaluation if one has recently not been performed.
[**2194-10-11**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating stable appearance of the intrahepatic catheters with residual abscesses, with interval improvement in intrahepatic bile duct dilation and pneumobilia.
Florid leukocytosis with bandemia and elevated LFT's were noted on admission with evidence of dilated CBD on CT abdomen.
Emergent ERCP ([**9-16**]) was done on admission and showed CBD stricture with frank pus.
As described below, CT also showed liver abscesses which were drained by IR and required repeat drainage and catheter placement given reaccumualtion.
RUQ ultrasound done on [**2194-9-19**] to monitor the size of the abscesses showed they were stable in size but not significantly improved.
Blood Cx grew pan-sensative E. Coli species and Abx switched to Zosyn.
LIVER ABSCESSES: Multiple hypodensities seen in the left lobe of the liver on CT were concerning for abscesses.
Blood cultures ([**4-6**] vials from admission) as well as cultures from one of the abscesses grew pan-sensitive E coli as noted above.
Plan for repeat Abd CT to be scheduled during follow-up appointment in infectious disease clinic on [**2194-11-7**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2324**].
Creatinine maxed at 5.0 with BUN 56.
Urine output slowly increased and subsequently entered a post-ATN diuresis.
His creatinine subsequently decreased but remained elevated around 2.5-2.7.
Recommendation was made to stop the amiodarone and uptitrate the metoprolol which was done over the next week.
Pt underwent an extensive work-up for causes of infectious and non-infectious diarrhea while still in the ICU, all of which ended up being negative including multiple samples sent for C. diff tox.
He was started on coumadin for his atrial flutter and his INR increased to 4.1.
He then had BRBPR as above and his INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K. Coagulation parameters normalized but the decision was made not to further anticoagulate him acutely [**2-4**] to the GI bleed.
Thrombocytopenia: Pt developed decreasing plt levels while in the ICU.
HIT work-up was negative and falling plts were deemed [**2-4**] to PPI so this mediation was stopped and H2 blocker started as GI bleed prophylasix.
ADDITIONAL ITEMS IN NEED OF OUTPT FOLLOW-UP:  1) CALCIFIED GALLBLADDER: Noted on CT ABD.
2) PRESACRAL FLUID COLLECTION: He had multiple abdominal CT scans that showed a presacral fluid collection that was stable in size compared to previous.
3) LYTIC LESION: Patient had CT head while in the MICU which showed a new, moderate-sized lytic lesion in the left frontal bone with some soft tissue component that was felt to represent a metastatic lesion.

You were started on antibiotics and initially required medications to support your blood pressure and intubation to support your breathing.
A stent was placed in your bile duct and drains were placed in two abscesses which developed in your liver  Initially you were also found to have a fast heart rate in atrial flutter that did not respond to shocks.
Followup Instructions: Repeat CT without contrast of your abdomen will be scheduled at your infectious disease clinic visit.
