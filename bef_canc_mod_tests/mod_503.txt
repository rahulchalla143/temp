Admission Date:  [**2117-10-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-10-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**] MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history significant for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, with a history of bilateral pneumonia with chest tube placement, status post VATS without a diagnosis, and status post decortication and empyema, history of congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2117-8-4**] with an ejection fraction of approximately 40%, with positive wall motion abnormality, also a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and C. difficile, who presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department on [**10-16**] with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath, along with hypoxia and lower extremity swelling.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on 6 liters of oxygen.
Initial physical examination, laboratories, and initial radiologic studies will be dictated as an addendum to this discharge summary.
Oxygen saturation status improved after thoracentesis.
The patient was seen in consultation by Interventional Pulmonology, who did not feel that a repeat thoracentesis was appropriate at that time.
Pleural effusions, being transudative, were most likely secondary to congestive heart failure.
The patient's oxygen saturation status was markedly improved from that upon admission, however, she continued to require 2 to 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula in order to maintain oxygen saturations around 93%.
In order to evaluate cardiac ischemia, the cause of the patient's acute congestive heart failure decompensation, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction in the Medical Intensive Care Unit by cardiac enzymes.
The patient's blood pressure was generally well controlled.
A renal ultrasound was also undertaken.
On this regimen, the patient's blood sugars were consistently low.
Further workup should be pursued as an outpatient.
A TSH should be rechecked as an outpatient in three to four weeks.
Iron studies were checked.
Her hematocrit did climb during the remainder of the hospitalization.
OTHER FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should have a TSH level checked in three to four weeks.
