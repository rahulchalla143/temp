Head CT was without enhancing lesions or hemmorrhage and LP demonstrated a mild lymphocytic leukocytosis consistent with known HIV infection but was otherwise within normal limits.
Upon admission, his urine tox was positive for benzodiazepines and methadone, both of which he denied recently taking.
His platelets were trending up in the 60s at his time of discharge.
The patient's Hct remained stable in the mid-20s with an appropriate reticulocyte index and bone marrow findings consistent with a normal amount of erythroid precursors.
In addition, he should have repeat EGD and c-scope done as an outpatient.
Given the patient's initial hypotension and leukocytosis w CT findings suggestive of penumonia, the patient was covered broadly with meropenem, fluconazole and vancomycin for an 8 day course.
He should have repeat imaging as an outpatient to ensure improvement.
His AST and ALT were trending toward normal at his time of discharge.
While the ID service felt a renal biopsy could be helpful, renal declined biopsy due to low likelihood of gaining any helpful information.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of your malaise, low blood pressure, and labs showing new findings of liver cell inflammation and low platelets (thrombocytopenia).
Bone marrow biopsy and bronchoscopy have not revealed a reason for your symptoms and your lab abnormalities to date.
Lumbar puncture results were within normal limits.
