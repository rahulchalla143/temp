Post-operatively, his hospital course was complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR when he was NPO following surgery, at which time he was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] requiring an esmolol gtt.
A KUB demonstrated question of ilieus or partial small bowel obstruction.
He was also noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate in the 130's.
He was initially admitted to the urology service, however his heart rate remained 120-140 on the floor, with a systolic blood pressure in the low 90's.
Given tachycardia, hypotension, and inability to do an amiodarone drip on the floor, patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder who was initially transferred to the ICU from the floor for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
TSH [**2-24**] was 3.4.
Last echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF.
He had not been anticoagulated, and reports taking an aspirin; he states he was supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss [**Name9 (PRE) 2786**] after his surgery, but had not made it to that appointment yet.
At time of arrival to ICU, his blood pressure was stable, so he was given IV beta-blocker and loaded with digoxin, as wished to avoid potentially chemically cardioverting.
He was started on anticoagulation, and INR will need to be followed by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 197**] was increased to 5 mg daily on [**3-29**], but INR trended up to 4.1 quickly.
[**Month/Year (2) 197**] was held for 2 days and INR was 3.1 on day of discharge ([**4-2**]).
Pt was asked to started taking 2.5 mg of [**Month/Year (2) **] daily after discharge and will need INR checked at least twice weekly while on antibiotics.
Digoxin oral was then restarted at 0.125 mg daily with level of 0.6.
Pt then had 2 second pauses  digoxin was stopped per cardiology recs (in addition, pts BP was higher so did not required digoxin anymore).
Prior to discharge, pt was having several 2 second pauses while sleeping (this could be due to sleep apnea, increased vagal tone), but heart rate would still go up into the 130s with little activity.
PCP aware of INR monitoring while pt is on antibiotics.
After discussion with urology, it was felt he likely had a soft tissue infection of his neobladder based on description of his urine, urine analysis, and fevers.
Cystogram was performed and pts foley was removed by urology.
# Hypotension: It was felt that the patient's hypotension was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR and poor forward flow.
There was also concern for developing sepsis given leukocytosis, fevers, foul smelling urine and urine analysis consistent with infection.
His lactate was within normal limits, and his blood pressure normalized within several hours of admission after his rate control improved and he was given fluids.
He began to develop loose stools and a c. difficile toxin assay was positive.
His abdominal examination remained benign, although he continued to have gas cramps and loose stools.
# Acute renal failure: Patient's baseline creatinine 0.8-1.0.
On admission, his creatinine was up to 1.6.
His creatinine eventually decreased to 1.1-1.2  after fluids and improvement in his blood pressure.
A renal ultrasound demonstrated mild hydronephrosis, which per discussion with urology is expected after neobladder formation, although a bump in creatinine is not typically expected.
