In the ED, patient was triggered for an initial BP of 73/43.
A femoral CVL was placed and she was given vanc, zosyn, hydrocort, and norepi with improvement in her SBPs to the 100s-120s.
Her labs returned notable for WBCs 7.8 with 23% bands, creat 1.5, K 6.6 and lactate 3.7.
U/A was negative for evidence of UTI.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn.
EKG revealed peaked T waves so she was given insulin, dextrose, bicarb, and Ca gluconate.
CXR was c/w a retrocardiac opacity.
VS prior to transfer were: 101/65 85-90 16 93% RA.
HCV Cirrhosis, diagnosed [**2151**], nonresponder to interferon / ribavirin, s/p TIPS [**11-8**] for ascites.

MICRO: Blood Cx ([**7-2**]): Pseudomonas aeurginosa Urine Cx ([**7-2**]): no growth Stool Cx ([**7-2**]): no C. diff, Salmonella, Shigella, or Campylobacter Blood Cx ([**7-4**], [**7-5**], [**7-6**], [**7-7**]): no growth Stool Cx ([**7-6**]): no C. diff CMV viral load ([**7-8**]): not detected Stool Cx ([**7-8**]): no C. diff, Cryptosporidium, or Giardia .
IMAGING: Portable CXR ([**7-2**]): 1.
Abdominal U/S ([**7-3**]): Minimal amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
PA&LAT CXR ([**7-3**]): Chronic bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities/atelectasis, possibly due to chronic aspiration.
RUQ U/S ([**7-3**]): 1.
CT abdomen/pelvis w/ contrast ([**7-4**]): 1.
U/A was negative and urine culutures showed no growth.
A CXR revealed a LLL consolidation suspicious for PNA, however the pt denied respiratory symptoms and was not hypoxic.
An abdominal U/S revealed an unchanged cirrhotic-appearing liver, w/o evidence of abscess or ascites.
An abdominal CT revealed wall edema in the distal rectum suggestive of proctitis.
She was empirically treated for SBP with vanco, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin and received albumin.
Blood cultures came back positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however no source was identified.
Several repeat blood cultures were all negative.
# ARF: On admission the pt was noted to have a Cr of 1.5 which was felt to be prerenal secondary to hypotension.
She was treated with fluids and her creatinine normalized.
Cr was 0.6 upon discharge.
# [**Year (4 digits) **]: On admission the pt was noted to have a K of 6.6.
An EKG revealed peaked T waves so she was given insulin, dextrose, bicarb, and calcium gluconate and her potassium normalized.
Stool cultures were negative for C. diff, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, or Giardia, and CMV viral load was undetectable.
An abdominal CT revealed wall edema in the distal rectum suggestive of proctitis, however this was felt to be unlikely to explain her watery diarrhea.
# Poor dentition: There was concern that her dentition may be a source of infection so dental x-rays were done and dentistry was consulted.
