Vital signs were stable and was extubated on [**2195-7-30**].
GI was consulted and pt underwent upper endoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding.

Upon reaching the floor on [**2195-8-5**] until discharge, patient's hematocrit remained between 30.4 and 37.3. .
ECG ([**2195-7-29**]): Tracing 1.
TTE ([**2195-7-29**]): IMPRESSION: RV strain c/w acute pulmonary embolism.
CTA Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2195-7-29**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
ECG ([**2195-7-30**]): Tracing 2.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-7-29**] the QRS voltage has decreased in the limb leads.
ECG ([**2195-7-31**]): Tracing 3.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2195-7-31**] artifact is present.
T wave inversions are less pronounced in lead V3 and the T waves are more upright and normal appearing in leads V4-V5.

Hematocrits were measured closely and fell from 40 on admission to 30 following heparin initiation.
GI was consulted and pt underwent upper endoscopy which showed no active source of bleeding.
Patient was called out to the floor on [**2195-8-2**], but given persistence of maroon stools with BRBPR, patient returned to the MICU the following morning for bowel prep for anticipated colonoscopy with close monitoring of vitals and hematocrit.
His hematocrit stabilized but because he had a clot in his lower extremities in combination with concerns regarding his ability to tolerate anticoauglation in the short term, an IVC filter was placed on [**2195-8-4**].
Patient was called out to floor on [**2195-8-5**] with a stable hematocrit greater than 30.
Vital signs remained stable without any requirement for supplemental oxygen.
On the floor, heparin gtt was continued with bridge to therapeutic INR with Coumadin.
Hematocrits were monitored closely and remained stable.
Patient's INR slowly elevated over the course of this admission, reaching therapeutic INR (2.2) on [**2195-8-14**].
He will likely need anticoagulation for at least 3 months, with repeat LENIs to determine if clot burden is still present.
EGD showed no acute bleeding but colonoscopy showed diffuse crohn's disease.
Hematocrit was measured frequently, stabilized around 30 on [**2195-8-3**] and remained at or above this level throughout this admission.
On [**2195-8-15**], Hct was noted to be 37.2.
All other vital signs remained stable and patient did not experience any signs of hypotension or anemia.
In the MICU, an EGD showed no upper GI bleeding and a colonoscopy showed an active crohn's flare with no intervenable bleeding areas.
# Type 2 Diabetes:  With the administration of increased steroids, it was suspected that blood sugars would run higher.
It was difficult to control dinner and evening sugars, which spiked in the 300's.
After several days of continued stabilized of the hematocrits and vital signs, lisinopril was restarted.
Blood pressures remained stable following re-initiation of this medication.
Patient was noted to have a creatinine of 1.4 on presentation.
Warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Please follow up with your PCP as scheduled to check your INR, with goal INR of [**1-27**].

Your vital signs and hematocrit continue to remain stable.
You were given coumadin to thin your blood and now your INR levels are therapeutic.
Your primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] tell you whether to increase or decrease this medication to keep your INR between 2 and 3 -ADDED Prednisone 30mg by mouth daily.
You will need to have your blood levels monitored closely over the next few weeks.
Primary Care Doctor:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], check INR Wednesday [**8-19**] at 12:00pm.
