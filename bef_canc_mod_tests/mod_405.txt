Daughter-in-law called oncologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10351**]) with report that patient is unwell.
Temperature is 100.3 and blood sugar elevated after pedialyte.
In ED, initial vs were: T 99.0 HR:135 BP:87/68 RR:22 O2Sat:97.
She triggered on arrival because tachycardic to 130s, BP systolic 80s.
EKG consistent with either flutter or MAT.
Was given IVF bolus of 3L NS but remained tachycardic in the 130s and then got 10mg IV dilt with BP in 100 range.
CXR showed possibility of acute on chronic aspiration, possible early developing infiltrate and had crackles on exam.
Labs revealed leukocytosis and hyponatremia.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
Upon admission to the floor: VS: 97.7, 115/80, HR 79, RR 22, 97% on 3L General: Alert female in NAD.
Gtube in place Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.

Since the previous tracing of [**2176-3-6**] the ventricular response is markedly increased.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-4-19**] sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats has replaced atrial fibrillation.
Her tachycardia, thought to be MAT or AFlutter, was postulated to be contributing to the low BPs as well so a diltiazem gtt was started with moderate decrease in HR but minimal improvement in BP.
Gtt was weaned off as pt was started on metoprolol and diltiazem po, both increased to more than home dosing.
N/V/D: Pt noted to have profuse diarrhea prior to arrival in the ICU however stool output was very modest while keeping pt NPO.
C.diff toxin and stool cultures were checked and were negative.
# FEN: tube feeds that pt receives for poor pos/dysphagia related to her cancer were continued  Medications on Admission: Diltiazem 120mg SR daily Prozac 20mg daily Advair 250/50 1 puff twice daily Magic mouthwash swish and spit Meformin 850mg twice daily Methadone 5mg/5mL-- 1m: per g tube and 0.5mL in PM Metoprolol 25mg daily Omeprazole 10mg daily Zofran as needed Prochloperazine 10mg every 6 hours as needed Simvastatin 20mg daily Tylenol 650mg daily Loperamide 2mg every 6 hours as needed Nebulizer 4times day Insulin 70/10, 11 Units in the AM, 8 with dinner.
You initially required oxygen while you were in the hospital but your oxygen saturation improved and you no longer required oxygen by the time of discharge.
You should also check your blood sugars very carefully over the next several days as we have been giving you steroids which make your blood sugars increase.
Call your doctor if your blood sugar is greater than 350 or less than 80.
Changes to your medications: Changed diltiazem SR to diltiazem (short-acting) 90mg by mouth four times daily Changed metoprolol SR to metoprolol tartrate 50mg by mouth twice daily  Followup Instructions: You have the following appointments scheduled:  Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12633**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Date/Time:[**2176-5-17**] 10:30 Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6198**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Date/Time:[**2176-5-17**] 10:30 Provider: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 41**] Date/Time:[**2176-5-17**] 11:40
