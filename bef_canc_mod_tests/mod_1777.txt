It appears that the previous culture grew two strains of klebsiella, only one was sensitive to cefepime, so it was possible that it was incompletely treated.
Pt's sputum culture grew Pseudomonas and received 8 days of meropenem for presumed HCAP.
A CXR was performed which was slightly improved from prior.
Sputum Cx were sent, however there was low concern for infection given he had finished his 8 day course of meropenem the day prior.
His lasix 40mg IV BID was restarted out of concern for fluid overload.
Of note, on the day of discharge it was noted that his sputum culture had grown Pseudomonas so [**Hospital 100**] Rehab was called and the physician taking care of him there was personally advised to continue Meropenem for a total of two weeks (with a planned stop date of [**2168-6-30**]) in an effort to completely and optimally treat this Pseudomonas.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt's CHADS2 score of 4, but anticoagulation was held initially due to supratherapeutic INR.
Coumadin restarted once INR was below <2.
His INR was difficult to control likely due to antibiotic therapy and decreased hepatic clearance.
Today INR was 2.8 and warfarin can be restated at 2.5mg.
INR should be rechecked on [**2168-6-25**] and warfarin dose can be adjusted at that time.
Guaiac stools were negative and no obvious acute bleeding was found during MICU stay.
Hematocrit remained stable.
We continued pt on ISS and serum glucose remained in mid 100s.

Your sputum cultures confirmed that you had a pneumonia and you tolerated the 8 day course of antibiotics very well.
