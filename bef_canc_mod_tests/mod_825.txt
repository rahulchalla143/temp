Past Medical History: (No changes since last admission) # Large B cell lymphoma, s/p sibling-matched allogenic SCT in [**6-/2167**] - c/b severe GVHD of skin, GI/mouth - had been receiving photopheresis -> stopped, now on rituxan - TPN dependent (via PICC) # Migraines # h/o vaso-vagal syncope with blood draws # h/o bacteremia - coagulase neg Staph [**10-5**] and [**1-15**] - Step Viridans [**1-15**] - tx w/ 6wks of vancomycin; pheresis catheter was removed - vancomycin started [**1-19**] - TEE deferred given severe GI GVHD # Steroid myopathy # Moraxella sinusitis - + sputum [**12/2090**], s/p 10d levaquin # Cardiomyopathy - TTE [**4-5**] EF 45-50% - Likely multifactorial: chemotherapy, radiation, GVHD, tachycardia # Fungemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], in process of treatment with caspofungin .
Follow up PET scan on [**2167-1-30**] demonstrated recurrent persistent uptake in the spleen, mesentery, and with new liver and pulmonary lesions.
Liver biopsy demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and he was treated with three weekly doses of Rituxan but continued to progress.
He was treated with salvage therapy with one cycle of MINE chemotherapy as an inpatient starting [**2167-4-23**] and CT scan demonstrated response in the lung and liver with stable disease in the spleen.
Cardiac: Tachycardic, regular, S1, S2, no m/g/r.

CTA Chest ([**2170-4-7**]) 1.
CT Chest ([**2170-4-14**]) 1.
Echo ([**2170-4-17**]) The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-3-15**], the heart rate is faster.
Blood cultures grew strep pneumo pan sensitive and patient was narrowed to nafcillin but then later changed to ceftriaxone given its improved activity against strep infections.
CT of the chest confirmed lobar infiltrate in RLL w/o evidence of significant effusion.
CXR demonstrated minimal pleural effusion on right at site of infiltrate and moderate L-pleural effusion thought to be related to fluids.
A repeat chest CT was obtained which confirmed the presence of a large left effusion; the pulmonary service was consulted and a thoracentesis was performed though only a few cc's of fluid were able to be aspirated.
Fluid analysis demonstrated an exudate that had no micro growth at the time of discharge.
His tacrolimus dosing was uptitrated based on his serum levels.
