His BP was 80/60 on admission.
According to OSH notes, the pt's PPM was checked and had back-up rate at 39 bpm and was functioning properly.
TTE at OSH showed EF 50% with mild MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was also noted to be somnolent with PCO2s (79-91) in the prior 48hrs before tx.
ABG was 7.25/90/111 on 3L NC.
He was then noted to be bradycardic to the 40s and SBPs dropped to the 60s.
His SBPS trended up to the 120s on dopamine.

TTE [**2116-6-2**]: LA: elongated.
Pulm Artery Pressure: The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top normal.
cardiac cath [**2113**]: 1.
Selective angiography of this right-dominant system revealed  three-vessel and LMCA disease.
The OM1 branch had serial 70% lesions proximally and mid vessel with distal luminal irregularities.
Entry hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of 140/81 mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 29%.
Echo was done to evaluate cardiac function and showed nl EF with ?
CTA was then done and was negative for PE.
He completed 8 days of levaquin to cover for a PNA and had sputum cx that had rare growth of coag + staph, but this was thought to be colonization.
Pt continued to have difficulty with tracheal secretions, resulting in repeat bronchoscopy on [**6-18**], and again on [**6-19**].
Manual bagging was commenced, an an emergent bronchoscopy was performed which revealed ball-valve clot/soft-tissue obstruction at distal trach with complete luminal occlusion during exhalation.
A Cook catheter was passed via trach distal to obstruction allowing ventilation with improvement in O2 sats from 70%->96%, but tidal volumes remained low.
His CXR also showed a consolidation.
His OSH records showed growth of enteroccocus in the urine, sensitive to vancomycin.
His cultures here later showed growth of methicillan resitant coag negative staph in a bcx from [**6-8**] and enterococcus in the urine on [**6-8**] as well.
Pt also had a cotrosyn stimulation test and the initial cortisol level was low, so he completed a dose of stress dose steroids for 7 days.
TEE was negative for endocarditis and all abx were stopped at that time.
His ucx from [**6-13**] showed continued growth of enterococcus so foley was changed on [**6-16**] and ucx re-checked.
EKG here at one point showed bradycardia with high degree heart block and junctional escape rhythm.
His back-up rate was changed from 39 to 55.
During his stay his UOP dropped and Cr slowly trended up.
Renal u/s was unchanged and urine lytes suggested pre-renal source.
