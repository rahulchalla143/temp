The patient had a Bentall procedure performed on [**2184-5-19**] and underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3928**] postoperative course including mental status confusion, reintubation for pulmonary secretions, and chest tube for a worsening right sided pleural effusion.
The patient presented to the emergency department in the evening of [**2184-6-2**] where Cardiology performed an echocardiogram which showed a moderately large circumferential pericardial effusion, moderate right ventricular invagination, no overt evidence of cardiac tympanode, and no significant aortic regurgitation.
JVD was noted upon neck examination.
Abdomen was normal, nontender, nondistended and with positive bowel sounds  External examination did not show evidence of an obvious click.
ADMITTING LABORATORIES:  White count of 14, hematocrit of 27.
Chem 7 showed a glucose of 120, sodium 130, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, bicarb 20, BUN 37 and a creatinine of 1.3.
Chest x-ray showed a moderate right sided pleural     effusion, increased cardiac size and a displaced sternal     wire in the mid to lower sternal pole.
The patient was transfused a total of six units of FFP as well as .5 mg of Vitamin K in order to correct a coagulopathy of an INR of 3.6 so that a right sided chest tube could be placed to drain the right side of the pleural effusion.
An echocardiogram of [**2184-6-4**] which showed an enlarged pericardial effusion.
A CAT scan with contrast was obtained at this time which helped to distinguish between pleural effusion and pericardial effusion for this patient.
It became obvious after the CAT scan that most of the fluid visualized on initial chest x-ray was essentially representative of pericardial fluid.
It was also noted that the sternal edges did not align properly, though there was no free fluid or signs of infection present along the sternal incision.
The patient remained having a small O2 requirement of two liters nasal cannula which maintained his O2 saturations in the mid 90's.
Operative cultures as well as other cultures taken at the time of admission all turned out to be negative.
The patient's INR at the time of discharge was 1.4.
until INR is between 2.5 to     3.
through the [**Hospital6 407**] until his INR is between the therapeutic range of 2.5 and 3.
The patient is to have blood drawn on [**2184-6-16**] for an INR level and then as needed afterwards.
The patient is then to have his INRs monitored through his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 11139**], [**0-0-**], who will adjust his Coumadin appropriate to maintain an INR of 2.5 to 3.
