Mother had borderline DM and died of a heart attack.
Physical Exam: Preoperative visit PE on [**2159-1-26**]:  Vitals: T: 97.2; HR: 66; BP: 140/76; RR: 12; Sat: 100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, ostomy retracted with some erythema on skin inferiorly, +gas/stool in bag Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused  Physical Exam on discharge:  Vitals: T: 97.8; HR: 80; BP: 176/60; RR: 20; Sat: 97% RA GEN: A&O, NAD CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, vertical midline incision with some fibrinous exudate at base being packed with dry dressings, ostomy over transverse incision where prior ileostomy was, drainage continues to be low ouput and no skin breakdown Ext: Mild LE edema, LE warm and well perfused   Pertinent Results: [**2159-2-27**] 01:56PM   WBC-18.4*# RBC-4.15* HGB-10.8* HCT-32.6* MCV-79* MCH-26.1* MCHC-33.2 RDW-15.5 [**2159-2-27**] 01:56PM   PLT COUNT-347 [**2159-2-27**] 09:31AM   PT-10.8 PTT-23.8* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2159-2-27**] 01:56PM   GLUCOSE-139* UREA N-57* CREAT-1.7* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-5.3* CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-18 [**2159-2-27**] 01:56PM   CALCIUM-8.7 PHOSPHATE-5.9*# MAGNESIUM-1.7  [**2159-2-27**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-12-7**] ST-T wave changes are no longer present and inferior R waves are smaller.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2159-3-4**] CT abd and pelvis: 1.
However, oral contrast has not yet reached the anastomosis, limiting assessment.
[**2159-3-5**] CT abd and pelvis: 1.
No extraluminal oral contrast identified; however, there is increased extraluminal gas compared to next preceding study suggesting an anteriorly located bowel wall leak given the intraluminal air-fluid level seen at the anastomosis and continuation of extraluminal gas with small bowel loop.
[**2159-3-8**] CXR AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position.
Pre renal according with FENA, creatinine 1.9 from 1.3 [**Year (4 digits) 5348**].
Creatinine remained stable.
She had an ECHO performed that showed EF >55% but severe pulmonary HTN.
On POD 2 and 3 she continued to have marginal but improved UOP and was given boluses intermittently and 1 unit of pRBCs for hct 22.3.
Her respiratory status remained stable on exam and by CXR and she was transferred back to the floor on POD2.
The fascia was intact on exam but more murky fluid was expressed and the wound was packed.
She had a CT scan done on POD 5 that showed no evidence of contrast extravasation at the anastamosis however there was extraluminal air near the anastamosis  that could represent a leak.
By POD8 the fistula output began to decrease significantly.
Medications on Admission: Amlodipine 5mg daily, atenolol 50mg daily, levothyroxine 25 mcg daily, pantoprazole 40mg daily, prednisone 5mg every other day, simvastatin 20mg daily, MVI, ASA 81mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1. insulin regular human 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) inj Injection ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): Per attached insulin sliding scale.
PAIN [**Month/Year (2) **]: It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal surgery.
