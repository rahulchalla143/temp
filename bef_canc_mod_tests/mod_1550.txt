PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 160/72, pulse 60.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was unremarkable.
Pulse examination shows palpable carotids, radial pulses bilaterally, abdominal aorta is nonprominent.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable.
Rectal examination is stool guaiac negative.
Bone/joint examination is unremarkable.
The neurological examination is unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admitting laboratory data included a complete blood count with a white count of 8.1, hematocrit of 28.6, platelet count 102,000.
Electrolytes, sodium 139, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 47, creatinine 2.1, glucose 76.
Chest x-ray was acute cardiopulmonary disease.
The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with a normal axis with premature ventricular contractions and a right bundle branch block with probable inferior infarct of undetermined age.
She underwent an urgent arteriogram on [**2169-7-27**] which demonstrated a 95% right renal artery stenosis.
She was transferred to the Vascular Unit for continued monitoring and care.
A noninvasive arterial study for graft duplex was done the following morning which demonstrated that the distal half of the graft was occluded.
Because of the urgency of the vascular procedure, the patient proceeded to surgery after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.5.
Her hematocrit was 25.6.
She was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.
She required an additional transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells over the next 24 hours and her intravenous Lopressor dose was increased.
Her BUN was 29, creatinine 1.4 with a potassium of 4.2.
Her lung examination was unremarkable.
Abdominal examination, she has soft, clean, dry incisions.
Her pulse examination showed bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right and absent pedal pulse examination on the left.
Her chest x-ray was negative for pneumothorax.
Her white count remained stable at 4.4, hematocrit stable at 27.4.
Her BUN was 21, creatinine 1.2 with a potassium of 4.4.
The dorsalis pedis was dopplerable with a biphasic signal and the posterior tibial was monophasic.
We continued Lasix to continue diuresis and Lovenox was begun while awaiting therapeutic INR levels.
Her abdominal examination was nontender, nondistended.
Her left leg showed a proximal incision staining with sanguinous fluid.
She underwent an arteriogram at that time along with a renal artery angioplasty with stent placement.
Hematocrit was 25.2 post transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells.
Her hematocrit was 31 which has since remained stable.
Her vital signs at the time of the incident were 130/78, 18, 74, 96% on room air.
Her electrocardiogram showed ST depressions in V leads 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Recommendations were serial enzymes and electrocardiograms to allow the patient's renal function stabilize post angioplasty and angiogram, and they strongly recommended the patient to undergo a cardiac catheterization.
Her troponins remained flat and CK MBs remained flat.
Her electrocardiogram returned to baseline.
Cardiology's final recommendation if the serial enzymes were within normal limits and there were no further events, the patient was resistant to any further diagnostic cardiac procedures.
There was no erythema and the pulse examination was unchanged.
The patient should also be followed by Cardiology service or her own primary care physician one week after discharge for further cardiac evaluation and monitoring.
Coumadin dosing adjust to maintain an INR between 2.0 to 3.0 2.
Metopralol 50 mg b.i.d., hold for heartrate less than 55 or systolic blood pressure less than 100 8.
Blood loss anemia, corrected 4.
