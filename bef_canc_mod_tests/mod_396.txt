Admission Date:  [**2116-12-17**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2042-8-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 2048**] [**Known lastname 10680**] is a 74-year-old female with extensive past medical history including breast cancer, status post mastectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 359**], and cardiac catheterization showing three-vessel disease status post stents times two.
She was doing well until [**12-17**], when she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest, felt to be secondary to a primary respiratory arrest in the setting of mucus plugging.
Chest x-ray, status post cardiopulmonary arrest, showed a large left pleural effusion, left main-stem cutoff and opacification of the left lung which shifted the mediastinum with left lung collapse.
Coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease by cardiac catheterization status post stent.
CURRENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the patient to be afebrile with the heart rate of 80, blood pressure 120/60, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 99% on ventilator setting of pressor support of 15; PEEP 5, FI02 40%; observed tidal volumes ranging from 280 to 350.
Neurology examination is nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  The most recent labs revealed a white count of 11,000, hematocrit 33, platelet count 222,000, PT 13.8, PTT 26.4, INR 1.3, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate 30, BUN 20, creatinine .5, glucose 147, ALT 11, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 69, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium 7.7, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.8, albumin 2.6.
Chest x-ray on [**12-28**], showed some improved re-aeration of the left lung status post bronchoscopy, but persistent collapse and some shift of the heart and mediastinum to the left.
The most recently chest x-ray on [**1-4**], showed slight interval improvement in the degree of atelectasis in the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion, unchanged when compared to prior films.
Chest CT performed on [**1-1**], showed again, slight interval improved aeration of the left lower lobe with persistent collapse of most of the left lower lobe, small left pleural effusion, which is stable in size, as well as a moderate right sided pleural effusion.
Note was made of a blood clot in the junction of the left pulmonary vein and left atrium, which had been noted on a prior CT scan and had been evaluated by echocardiography and felt to be a lower embolism given its location in a vein, which was then tied off during left upper lobectomy and not in communication with a dynamic contractile structure.
Abdominal films showed an ileus without evidence of small-bowel obstruction.
It is felt that the patient will likely need serial bronchoscopies to manage her sections and control her ventilatory status.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient required escalating doses of Captopril in order to maintain her blood pressure in a normal range.
She is currently hemodynamically stable on Captopril 50 mg three times a day with blood pressures ranging in the range of systolic pressure of 110 to 140.
The abdominal examination currently remains benign with slight distention and normal bowel sounds.
HEMATOLOGY:  As previously mentioned the patient was noted on CT scan to have a clot in the left pulmonary vein at the junction of the entrance into the right atrium.
The patient underwent both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram to further evaluate the clot in this vessel.
It is not felt that this clot represents a significant risk of thromboembolism because it resides in essentially a blind pouch, which is not communicating with blood flow or contractile organ.
DISPOSITION:  The screening process has been initiated for the patient to return to a pulmonary rehabilitation facility.
