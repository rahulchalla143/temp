In the ED, his initial vital signs were pulse of 83, blood pressure 140/80, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
His EKG revealed ST-segment elevations in leads II, III and avF inferiorly and V4-6 anterolaterally with depressions in I, aVL, V1-V3.
Angiography revealed a mid-RCA lesion.

[**11-1**] EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at ~66 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, no LAA, no RAA, no LVH, no RVH, ST-segment elevations in II/III and aVF inferiorly (III>II) and V4-V6 anterolaterally with depressions in I aVL and V1-V3, normal RWP.
[**11-1**] Cardiac Cath 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demostrated one vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and elevated left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and mean PCW of 31 mmHg.There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 40 mmHg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.8 L/min/m2.
There was  moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP of 170 mmHg.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Final angiography demonstrated no  residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow throughout.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow throughout.
STEMI - The patient experienced a strong vagal reaction after his left groin sheath was pulled, necessitating IVFs and dopamine briefly for blood pressure support.
He did have persistent bradycardia in 40's and 50's (sinus with occasional junctional escape with HR in 40's at night) that was asymptomatic.
Given his NSVT, he will undergo outpatient monitoring with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.
A followup echocardiogram in 4 weeks is recommended to reassess his cardiac pump function.
He also should undergo an exercise stress test in 4 weeks time, as cardiac catheterization also showed distal 40% LMCA and 40% diagonal ostial lesions in addition to his RCA stenosis.
His lipid panel should be repeated as an outpatient.

You will need a heart monitor ([**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart monitor) to evaluate your heart rhythm once you leave the hospital.
We recommend that you have an exercise stress test and repeat echocardiogram in one month.
