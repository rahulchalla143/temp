With regards to the bone flap infection, the patient was ultimately cleared by ID for crainplasty.
Past Medical History: (1) a left hemicraniectomy on [**2196-6-24**] to [**2196-6-25**] for removal of a hemangiopericytoma at [**Hospital6 1129**], (2) a craniplasty with placement of a synthetic bone graft on [**2196-9-27**], (3) a wound revision on [**2196-12-10**] to remove MRSA-infected cranioplasty, (4) s/p Cyberknife radiosurgery radiosurgery to the tumor from [**2197-6-19**] to [**2197-6-23**] to 3000 cGy (600 cGy x 5 fractions) at 83% isodose line.
RLE [**5-23**] IP, Quad and ham 3-4/5, o/5 distally.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of interpretation of the study on [**2198-9-21**] at 3 p.m.  [**9-22**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**9-22**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intrathoracic, abdominal or pelvic mass.
Postoperative changes with cranioplasty as seen on the recent CT examination.
A ventricular drain is identified.
[**9-26**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**9-30**] CTH 1.
Further evolution of the extra-axial collections and right basal ganglia and left temporo-parietal hemorrhage.
An EVD was placed and was leveled at the tragus.
On post op exam he was not following commands but localizing his LUE and withdrawing both lower extremities.
His JP drain was taken off suction and his EVD output did increase.
His exam did improve and was following commands with his left side and was more awake.
Head CT showed good placement of EVD catheter and a subgaleal fluid collection.
His EVD output did increase as his JP drain output decreased.
[**9-25**]- CT head showed slight interval decrease in subgaleal fluid collection and his JP drain was removed by the plastic surgery team without difficulty.
His ICP remained in a range of 0-6 and his EVD output averaged 80cc per shift.
[**9-28**] WBC count increased to 21.8 from 16.1 and ID team was re-consulted.
CSF was sent due to the fever for culture, glucose,protein and cell counts.
Patient's exam improved throughout the day, he was much more alert and following commands moving his LUE and LLE purposefully.
Head CT showed no change in ventricle size after removal of EVD and he was transferred to the step down unit in stable condition.
CXR showed no new infiltrate or fluid overload.
This study was negative and consistent with pneumonia.
His O2 saturations did improve and had no further episodes of decreased sats.
His vancomycin level on [**10-7**] was 19.2 and no change to his dosing was made.
On [**10-10**], MRI was obtained to evaluate metastatic lesion and revealed no evidence of tumor progresison.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
