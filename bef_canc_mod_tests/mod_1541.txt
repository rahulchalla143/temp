VS = 102 175/85 30 91% on unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] settings.
BP dropped to 92/50 after intubation for which she received 4L IVF.
Labs notable for leukocytosis 26 with bandemia 14%, lactate 6.2, CRE 2.1 (bl ), NA 131, HCO3 16.
CT HEAD was unremarkable.
Neurology consult was obtained with exam limited by sedation.
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated and sedated, minimally responsive to noxious stimuli (responds minimally to sternal rub, withdraws to pain), with RR 20s (overbreathing [**Name2 (NI) **]).
?s syndrome - s/p cholecystectomy - chronic anemia [**2-7**] recurrent GI bleeds, source unclear (extensive GI workup including capsule endoscopy on [**11-26**] showed no significant source for bleeding), on procrit [**2-7**] CRI, PPI for GIB prophylaxis.

Inferior/lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia/myocardial infarction Since previous tracing of [**2202-12-27**], rhythm new, axis more right inferiorly, shorter Q-T interval and peaked T waves - consider hyperkalemia - clinical correlation is suggested .
[**2203-6-7**] CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process.
[**2203-6-8**] CT head w/o contrast: No significant change since the prior study dated [**2203-6-7**], unchanged areas of encephalomalacia involving the bilateral temporoparietal lobes and left frontal region, likely consistent with prior chronic ischemic events.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-12-20**], there is no significant change.
She underwent TTE that was non-diagnostic but a TEE showed vegetations on the mechanical MV.
On further discussion, given that she was failing medical therapy and was not a surgical candidate focus was shifted towards comfort.
MRI head showed multiple likely septic emboli.
