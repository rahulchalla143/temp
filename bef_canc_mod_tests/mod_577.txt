Neuro She underwent code stroke evaluation with CT scan of head as well as CTA of head and neck which showed  hypodense areas within the right cerebellum and complete occlusion of right vertebral artery.
The MRI showed "multiple infarcts in bilateral posterior circulation territory in the setting of a very irregular distal right vertebral artery with a short segment of high-grade stenosis versus a short dissection.
She was closely monitered with neuro checks Q1H.
She was started on heparin IV with goal; PTT between 50-70.
Coumadin was added on day 2 with therapeutic goal INR [**2-5**].
Heparin was stopped and she was discharged on coumadin with an INR  Cards She was frequently monitored on telemetry for any arrthymia such as fibrillation.
She underwent ECHO which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal biventricular systolic function; mild mitral regurgitation.
Blood pressure goal initially was MAP 95-110 and pressors were used to increase cerebral perfusion, however after 24-48 hrs, pressors were tapered off and Blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate.
Her BP mediations will be slowly re-added as an outpatient.
INR check   Sig: One (1)   on [**2116-6-26**].
You were placed on anticoagulation and will need follow up with your PCP to check your INR levels.
