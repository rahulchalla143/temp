On postoperative day #2 the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 208 and a blood pressure of 120/60.
She received Lopressor 5 mg times three with a response in heart rate decreasing to the 140's.
She was also given Diltiazem 5 mg times one with heart rate returning to the 100's.
EKG showed mild ST segment depressions which resolved with decreasing heart rate.
Hematocrit at the time was 29.8.
She was given IV Diltiazem drip at 10 mg per hour which was titrated to a heart rate of 80-100.
The patient was seen by the cardiology team who recommended a decrease in the Diltiazem drip to titrate for systolic blood pressure greater than 110.
She had an EKG the following morning which showed no ST segment changes or no acute signs of ischemia.
Her rate was well controlled and she was transfused for a hematocrit of 29.
Her postoperative hematocrit was 33.
Her neurologic exam remained stable throughout with 5/5 strength in all distributions in lower extremities.
On [**2177-1-20**] her hematocrit was found to be 28, secondary to acute blood loss anemia.
