PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's temperature is 98.6, pulse 98, blood pressure 133/56, respiratory rate 16, and satting at 97% on room air.
Her neck examination was notable for a left surgical pupil, but reactive to light.
Her Chem-7 was remarkable for a sodium of 116, potassium 5.2, chloride 74, bicarb 25, BUN 17, creatinine 1.3, glucose 127.
She had a white count of 16.8 with 85% polys, 9% lymphocytes, hematocrit was 37.7, platelets 305.
PTT was 28.0, INR 1.4.
Her calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal.
Her serum osmolality is 1:2 to 2:1, urine osmolality 307, her lactate was 3.5.
She had a urinalysis that showed greater than 50 red cells, 21-50 white cells, and many bacteria.
Her first set of enzymes included a CK of 230, MB of 7.2, and troponin of 0.66.
She had a chest film that showed a left pleural effusion, left lower lobe opacity that is most likely atelectasis.
Her sodium was checked every eight hours to ensure that she was not rising too fast since that can be devastating.
Over the next 2-3 days, her sodium continued to rise appropriately with simple IV fluids.
She was requiring a nonrebreather to sustain oxygen saturation greater than 95%.
Her examination was notable at the time for diffuse rhonchi throughout.
In addition, she also had an echocardiogram done previously that day which showed right ventricular failure as well as left ventricular failure that was new.
Given the possibility that this was a pulmonary embolus, she went for a CT scan.
Was not able to do a full CT scan since she was not accepting the dye because that required an IV.
However, the chest CT showed worsening congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure:  Given the patient's worsening respiratory status and CHF, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed that revealed biventricular failure that was new of unclear etiology.
Despite increasing the amount of oxygen, we were unable to reduce the rate and were unwilling to use nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] without more close monitoring.
Her blood pressure tended to go lower towards the end of her hospitalization, which also made this more challenging.
Her initial urine showed possible infection and so she was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl.
Urine was repeated several times.
Pneumonia:  It was possible that some of the findings on chest film and CT were consistent with a pneumonia including possibly tuberculosis as she had a right upper quadrant spiculated pneumonia.
She was thus transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring of her blood pressure and the ability to follow her cardiac index as they diuresed her.
