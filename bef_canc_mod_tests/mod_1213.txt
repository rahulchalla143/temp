Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3 hours), rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, repair of ventral hernia, post colostomy.
Routine CT scan on [**4-21**] showed new onset left hydronephrosis.
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a recent CT scan in [**Location (un) 620**] showing a chronically obstructed left kidney.
A #8 French tapered catheter was gently inserted into the left distal ureteral orifice and 5 cc of contrast dye was injected which revealed a distal ureter with complete retrograde obstruction.
Beyond the level of obstruction, was a very faint calcification, roughly 5- 8 mm in diameter, possibly consistent with the calcification seen on CT scan.
She underwent radiation which remedied whatever the lesion was.
She underwent resection and then a protective colostomy because of the fact that the anastomosis never seemed to heal and indeed the most recent barium enema revealed that she did not have adequate healing and as a matter of fact had several leaks, probably disruptive of the anastomosis either because of tension, which I had doubted, or because of the previous radiation.
A closure of the hernia was done internally first with approximating the fascia from within with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures and then closing the peritoneum under it with a #1 Vicryl suture.
Two sponge counts and needle counts were reported as correct by the nurse in charge.
Estimated blood loss was 750 cc.
Urine output was scanty at about 60 cc for the entire case but it picked up as soon as we took her out of Trendelenburg.
The following day she underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, and repair of ventral hernia.
Hct was stable at 30.
Urine output was marginal, but WNL.
ECG was WNL.
Chest xray showed bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
WBC remained elevated at 19.9.
Repeat ECG, cardiac enzymes, and echo were WNL.
TSH was WNL.
Lactate was 2.1.
A moderate amount of clear-amber fluid was found draining from her rectum and was +creatinine at 32.
CT cystogram and CT urogram were completed which showed large left retroperitoneal uroma which appeared to leak from distal left ureter.
CT scan of abdomen/pelvis/chest showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis; abdominal and pelvic ascites and focal fluid collections in the left abdominal and pelvic retroperitoneal regions; and active extravasation of contrast suspicious for ureteral injury.
She was transfused for a Hct of 24.5.
WBC count was 20.5 from 27.
Peritoneal fluid was negative for growth.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
CXR showed bibasilar pleural effusions and linear opacities.
WBC count was 14.7 At POD 15 a repeat CT scan was completed showing continued abdominal fluid collection.
The scan did not reveal a communication between the collection and bowel.
WBC count was down to 9.9.
Urine cytology was sent which was negative for malignant cells.
At POD 31 an interval CT scan was performed to evaluate abdominal fluid collection, as drain output had greatly decreased.
The scan showed no new fluid collection with marked resolution of drained collection.
A repeat CT scan showed no residual fluid in the area of the pigtail catheter.
WBC was  12.6, but repeat CT scan showed no new fluid collection and no interval change in the drain site.
