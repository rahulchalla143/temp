CXR [**11-11**]: FINDINGS: AP portable radiograph reviewed.
ECG [**11-11**]: Baseline artifact.
CXR [**11-13**]: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**2122-11-11**].
ECG [**11-13**]: Sinus rhythm.
Since previous tracing of [**2122-11-11**], sinus tachycardia absent and low amplitude T waves improved.
ECG [**11-13**]: Sinus tachycardia.

UA clear, CXR read as clear.
CT neck showed no abscess.
His urine culture was negative and his blood cultures were no growth to date.
Two blood culture bottles drawn [**11-11**] were positive on [**11-16**], later determined to be propionibacterium acnes, most likely contaminant.
