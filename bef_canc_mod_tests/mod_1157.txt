COMPARISON: CTA abdomen [**2116-5-20**], MRI abdomen [**2118-5-21**].
[**2118-12-12**] CT scan abdomen COMPARISON: MRI dated [**2118-5-21**] and CT torso dated [**2117-2-17**].
Arterial, venous, and delayed phase imaging was obtained.
Coronal, sagittal, and MIP images of the hepatic vasculature were created.
Multiple low-density lesions are again identified throughout the liver which are unchanged in size and appearance compared to most recent MRI of [**2118-5-9**] and thought to represent bilomas with internal debris related to hepatic artery occlusion.
Intrahepatic biliary dilatation which is more prominent when compared to the prior MRI of [**2118-5-9**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 63532**] transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase improved on their own prior to ERCP, with reduction in total bilirubin from 7.9 to 2.8.
Following ERCP, his labs trended upward again likely due to mechanical manipulation of the structures around the biliary tree, and then trended downward again the day following admission.
His neurological exam was fully intact with no focal deficits.
His serum CK was > 13,000 on admission, and trended consistently downward with IV fluids and cessation of gemfibrozil and simvastatin.
However, urine myoglobin screening (conducted when CK was ~8,000) returned "presumptively negative."
Creatinine at admission was elevated to 1.4 on admission from a baseline of 1.0, but trended down to 1.2 and then 1.0 at discharge with IVF.
His rapamycin level on admission was elevated for this stage post-[**Known lastname **] to > 9.
