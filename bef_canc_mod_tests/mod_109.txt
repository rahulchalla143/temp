Sputum Cx ([**1-13**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
Urine Cx ([**1-13**]): Pansensitive ENTEROCOCCUS SP Catheter Tip Cx ([**2-25**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
IMAGING: CXR ([**1-8**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CT Head ([**1-8**]): IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
Elements of it appear new since the study of [**2180-5-10**], but the absence of ethmoidal or maxillary hemorrhage argues against an acute fracture.
Bilateral LENIs ([**1-10**]): IMPRESSION: Essentially occlusive thrombus throughout bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins as well as greater saphenous vein.
CT Head ([**1-11**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**1-11**]): The new intended right subclavian line turns abruptly lateral at the upper margin of the right clavicle.
The position of the tip is not consistent with a central intravenous location.
TTE ([**1-12**]): The left ventricle is not well seen.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Carotid Series ([**1-12**]): IMPRESSION: Minimal focal scattered calcific plaque, no associated ICA or CCA stenosis however.
EEG ([**1-13**]): IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations or electrographic seizures.
CT/CTV Head ([**1-23**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Torso ([**1-26**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI can confirm this.. 2.
Additional hypoattenuating liver lesion not appreciated on prior non- contrast study in segments II/III of the liver anteriorly, also somewhat concerning but probably representing focal fat.
EEG ([**1-28**]): Impression: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured 4 pushbutton activations without clear electrographic correlate.
EEG ([**1-29**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured 2 events with rhythmic activity seen over the right hemisphere and one event with generalized rhythmic activity.
EEG ([**2-2**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations, but did capture numerous periods of rhythmic theta activity seen broadly over the right hemisphere, and with extension to the left frontal region as well.
EEG ([**2-3**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured 4 pushbutton activations for episodes of left arm shaking, sometimes accompanied by unresponsiveness and rhythmic movements of the mouth, with no clear EEG correlate.
There was one event when the patient turned to the left and the EEG showed semi-rhythmic right frontal delta frequency activity for about 50 seconds.
EEG ([**2-11**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG in the awake state due to possible sharp features seen in the right frontal area suggestive of cortical irritability in that regiona.
CT Head ([**2-22**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**2-23**]): UPRIGHT AP CHEST: A right PICC is seen, with tip overlying the subclavian/axillary vein.
The tip has retracted several centimeters compared to the prior study where it was located in the distal SVC.
In the ED, vitals were T 97.9 P 96 BP 180/90 R 32 O2 sat 97% on 2L.
A neck CVL could not be placed due to patient combativeness.
CT head was negative for acute bleed but did show an orbital fracture that was felt to more likely chronic without surrounding hemorrhage.
CT head at that time showed new intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left posterior parietal cortex and code stroke was called.
Repeat CT scans showed stability of his hemorrhage with expected progression of infarction.
With regards to his orbital blow out fracture seen on CT head at admission, it appeared chronic.
He is currently on Keppra 2g [**Hospital1 **], Phenytoin 200mg TID, Zonegran 200mg/500mg, and Trileptal 1200mg [**Hospital1 **] plus standing Ativan but continues to have intermittent clinical seizures responsive to 2mg to 6mg of IV Ativan or 10mg IM Diazepam.
He should have his anti-seizure medication levels checked every 6 months.
Anticoagulation complicated by poor access and difficult blood draws.
Ct venogram showed partial recannalization of thromboses suggesting response to anticoagulation.
He should have bone density testing performed as an outpatient.
To establish antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, he will need repeat testing in 6 weeks.
Bilateral UE ultrasounds were negative for clots.
Factor V Leiden was also negative but anticardiolipin ab positive although not conclusive for antiphospholipid syndrome as noted above hence will follow-up in Heme [**Hospital **] clinic as outpatient.
Last CT was removed [**1-19**] without evidence of recurrent pneumothorax on repeat CXRs.
His hypoxia with O2 requirement likely had multiple potential etiologies including emphysema, recent pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, and possible PEs given suspected thrombophilia.
He should have PFTs performed as an outpatient.
PICC line was subsequently discontinued prior to discharge as antiepileptic levels and labs had been within normal limits and stable.

Recheck anti-seizure medication levels (Dilantin, Zonegram, Trileptal, Keppra) every 6 months or sooner as indicated by your outpatient epileptologist.
You have an outpatient repeat MRI and MRV of your head on [**2181-3-20**] at 9:00 am in the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Building, [**Location (un) **].
You have a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] a PCP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]) on [**2181-4-10**] at 10:10 am.
