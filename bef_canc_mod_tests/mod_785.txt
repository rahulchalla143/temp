The patient was initially diagnosed at age 16 when her fingers swelled up and 6 months later a kidney biopsy confirmed the lupus nephritis.
In the ambulance she was discovered to have a systolic blood pressure of about 300.
Later, the nifedipine was weaned for a concern of renal insufficiency and a NTG drip was started at which point her systolic blood pressure decreased to 180.
A head CT was obtained which was negative but she did have papilledema per the ED notes.
An EKG showed strain.

HTN: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a hypertensive emergency, as evidenced by EKG changes, papilledema, and head CT changes.
She was then transferred to the intensive care unit for uncontrolled BP accompanied by head ache.
Of note, her complement levels were low, her DS DNA was positive and her anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM were within normal limits.
Her rise in creatinine was dramatic, from baseline of 1.2 in [**Month (only) 958**] to 5.2 at presentation.
Her ACE inhibitor was initially held, and her creatinine continued to worsen.
Her blood pressure remained difficult to control, requiring another trip to the MICU for administration of IV antihypertensives.
Her haptoglobin was low and LDH was high, concerning for hemolysis.
DIC was considered unlikely since her coagulation studies were within normal limits but [**Doctor First Name **], TTP/HUS were considered a possibility.
A peripheral smear showed schistocytes, so the Heme service was consulted, however this presentation could also be secondary to a malignant hypertension inducing shearing of erythrocytes and platelets.
Of note, her ADAMST 13 studies were not consistent with TTP, although these studies are still investigational.
These findings were compatible with mild gastritis but did not account for the HCT drop.
