Mucosa: Multiple diffuse erythematous linear superficial erosions of the mucosa with oozing and fresh adherent clot were noted in the fundus and stomach body.
Impression: Blood in the esophagus Erythema with superficial ulceration in the gastroesophageal junction Blood in the fundus and stomach body Erythematous linear superficial erosions in the fundus and stomach body Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Routine post procedure orders Supportive measures with continued HCT monitoring and PRBC's as needed to maintain HCT >30.
Repeat endoscopy in [**3-11**] days to assess for resolution.
Hct on admission was 39, which then dropped to 31 after episode hematemsis.
He was transfused 1u PRBC (HCT 28->31) and his HCT has remained stable thereafter.
EGD done [**9-17**] which showed gastritis, esophagitis without bleeding.
H.pylori positive on serology from [**9-17**], EGD with biopsy planned for today to verify H.pylori.
EGD repeated [**9-19**] which showed no active bleeding.

Initially you were admitted to the general medical floor, but after an episode of vomiting, your blood count dropped and you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer observation.
The Gastroenterologists did an Upper Endoscopy which showed that you had some irritation of your esophagus and stomach, but there was no bleeding found.
Your blood counts remained stable and you were transferred back to the general medical floor where you remained without bleeding.
A follow-up Upper Endoscopy was done on [**9-19**] during which time biopsies were taken of the area that was likely the cause of the original bleeding.
Follow-up with the Gastroenterologists for your biopsy results with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3037**] on [**2192-10-10**] at 3PM.
