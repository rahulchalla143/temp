The patient was seen in the Emergency Department and was found to have electrocardiogram findings of ST elevations in I, L and V6, as well as deep T wave inversions inferiorly.
He was therefore referred for a cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vitals on admission:  Blood pressure 139/93, pulse 71, temperature 96.8, oxygen saturation 90% on 7 liters, respiratory rate 16.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive, extraocular movements intact, mucous membranes moist.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly, with occasional crackles at the bases.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.2, hemoglobin 14, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 281.
PT 13.4, PTT 33.3, INR 1.3.
Glucose 175, BUN 34, creatinine 1.7, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 28.
CK 106 with an MB of 8 and a troponin of 3.6.
The patient had a chest x-ray that showed moderate cardiomegaly with interstitial edema, however, an element of underlying interstitial lung disease could not be excluded without prior studies for comparison.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal intervals, normal axis, ST elevations in I, AVL, V6.
Post-PCI showed normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, and mild ST elevations in V4 and V6 with resolution of the prior ST elevations.
Catheterization results revealed three vessel coronary disease, elevated left-sided filling pressures, lateral wall acute ST elevation myocardial infarction with revascularization of the diagonal branch with good results.
The patient was started on aspirin despite his past history of bleeding and would be monitored carefully with guaiac testing of all stools.
The patient's CKs peaked at 3033 with an MB of 392 and an index of 12.9.
The repeat CK showed a level of 2484 with an MB of 287 and an index of 11.6.
Echocardiogram on [**2198-8-23**], showed a mildly dilated left atrium with a left ventricular cavity that was mildly dilated, showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral akinesis/severe hypokinesis.
Basal inferior akinesis, mid-inferior hypokinesis, and mid to distal inferior hypokinesis and mid to distal anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably worse.
Anteroseptal hypokinesis was not noted in the earlier report.
Anticoagulation was not pursued for left ventricular thrombus prevention in light of the patient's relatively productive ejection fraction.
The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospitalization, and had no other arrhythmias throughout the hospitalization.
He was diuresed aggressively and, despite improvement of his lung examination and improvement radiographically on chest x-rays, the patient remained hypoxic disproportionately to his likely congestive heart failure.
It was thought, based on both radiographic and physical examination findings, that the patient may have an underlying interstitial lung disease that has been previously unrecognized.
The patient's creatinine initially decreased with large diuresis on hospital day one.
The urine was sent for analysis and was found to be positive for a urinary tract infection with positive nitrites, positive leukocyte esterase, and positive finding of white blood cells in the urine, along with large amount of red blood cells.
Urology was consulted on the [**8-24**], and their input included continuing the bladder irrigation until bleeding was stopped, consider Foley catheterization after the cessation of bleeding, and follow up CT of the pelvis along with cystoscopy in outpatient fashion.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit was 40 when he was admitted, and this dropped to 35 by hospital day three after both PCI and hematuria.
The patient's hematocrit was checked daily.
