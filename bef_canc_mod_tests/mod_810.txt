Electrocardiogram at this time revealed atrial flutter with 3:[**Street Address(2) 51851**] changes in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF); more prominently in lead III.
Cardiac enzymes were notable for a CK/MB of 11.9 (which increased to 65) and a troponin T of 0.6 (which increased to 0.66).
The catheterization showed multiple lesions of the right coronary artery with 90% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery and a 70% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery.
Aright heart catheterization showed a cardiac output of 2.3, a cardiac index of 1.4, and systemic vascular resistance of [**2134**], pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was elevated at 43 with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary artery pressure of 38%.
Upon completion of cardiac catheterization, the patient was noted to have a large left femoral hematoma.
On further note, an echocardiogram done on [**2120-7-23**] revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, moderate mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, with pulmonary artery hypertension, a pulmonary artery pressure of 49, and an akinetic apical septum.
Electrocardiogram on [**7-28**] revealed ST segment elevations in leads II and III, with reciprocal changes in the lateral leads, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy.
Electrocardiogram still demonstrated evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and the patient was in atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed vital signs with a temperature of 95.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 86, blood pressure was 91/61, respiratory rate was 19, and oxygen saturation was 97% on 4 liters of oxygen.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm with atrial flutter and 2:1 conduction.
Extremity examination revealed pulses were 1+.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 13, hematocrit was 31.4, and platelets were 175.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 136, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 25, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 132.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature congestion, with a diffuse reticular pattern concerning for interstitial disease given the patient's long-term smoking history.
The patient's heart rate was unable to tolerate the dopamine.
The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.
The patient was soon weaned from the Levophed with a heart rate in the 70s and a systolic blood pressure in the 110s.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to be 34 on admission to the Coronary Care Unit and slowly decreased during the course of her hospitalization.
Concern for active bleeding was taken into account; however, her hematocrit levels remained stable for 48 hours.
The patient was transfused appropriately to maintain a hematocrit of above 30 (and is currently not requiring any blood).
Oxygen saturations were stable.
Heart rates remained in the 70s and were stable.
The patient's oxygen saturations were stable.
Pertinent laboratory studies revealed the patient had a hematocrit of 31.5.
The patient's white blood cell count was noted to be elevated at 12.4; however, the patient did not demonstrate any clinical signs of infection.
Oxygen saturations were greater than 93% on room air.
Kidney function remained stable with a blood urea nitrogen of 19 and a creatinine of 0.7 on discharge.
Her physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**] was to follow her as an outpatient for her anticoagulation and atrial flutter.
The patient was started on a beta blocker for adequate control of her blood pressure.
with INR to be checked on Monday.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient's oxygen saturations were stable prior to discharge to the floor.
The patient's pulmonary artery diastolic pressures were less than 20.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Hematocrit remained stable around 30.
Physical Therapy stated that the patient was stable to go home and was to follow up with her as an outpatient for cardiac rehabilitation.
The patient was to have her INR checked on [**8-4**], [**8-6**], and [**2120-8-8**].
The patient was to follow up with INR checks.
INR check.
Fingerstick checks for blood glucose.
