He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2114-11-20**] and had an EKG which was suspicious for an MI.
He was started on Lopressor and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2114-11-21**] which revealed an ejection fraction of about 30% with 1-2+ MR, anterior basal hypokinesis, anterolateral hypokinesis, apical dyskinesis, and inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis.
He also had an echocardiogram which revealed an EF of 50% and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
The vital signs were stable.
His carotids were 2+ and equal bilaterally without bruits.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 6.2, hematocrit 41.3%, platelet count 539,000.
Potassium 3.8, BUN 16, creatinine 1.2.
The EKG showed sinus rhythm in the 60s with ST elevations in the inferior leads, ST elevations in V2, V3, and V6.
He was noted to have profound hypotension and underwent TEE which revealed hypokinetic anterior wall but was actually better than the immediate postoperative TEE.
His chest x-ray did show a left-sided pneumothorax and he did have a new chest tube inserted on that side which showed reinflation of the left lung.
By postoperative day number eight, it was decided that his Coumadin should be held in case the plan for EP study and insertion of a ICD would be done this admission.
He continued to be treated with heparin and have his Coumadin held while the Electrophysiology Service sorted out his echocardiogram and decided when would be the best time to do his studies.
He did have a rise in his white blood cell count on postoperative day number nine and cultures were sent.
His chest x-ray did show a left lower lobe consolidation and he was started on levofloxacin.
During that time, it was felt that he would not need to have EP studies during this admission and the plan was for him to return after discharge to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] for further electrophysiology workup.
By postoperative day number 12, his INR had drifted down to 1.9 and his pacing wires were discontinued without incident.
He was restarted on his Coumadin and was awaiting elevation of his INR to be discharged home.
By the second attempt at anticoagulation, his INR drifted down to 2.6 and he was started on 1 mg of Coumadin and was discharged on this dose.
DISCHARGE EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 74, blood pressure 115/64, respirations 18, 02 saturation 98% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.3, hematocrit 40.6%, platelet count 334,000.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride 103, C02 25, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, blood glucose 96.
PT 20, with an INR of 2.6.
Discharge chest x-ray showed his lungs to be clear with a very small left apical pneumothorax.
on the night of discharge and then as needed to maintain an INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
