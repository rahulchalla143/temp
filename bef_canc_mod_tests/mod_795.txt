# Hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ED, but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her BP was coming down too fast).
She required 1L IVF bolus since her baseline SBP is thought to run in the 130-170 range.
BP meds were held and later that night her SBP was in the 220s.
MRI and plain films were ordered and showed no acute pathology.
CK was normal.
Received 2u pRBC while inhouse for Hct in the 18-19 range.
INR elevated on day of discharge.
