CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: 1.
*)CHF - on admission, there was no evidence of fluid overload on exam, and his home medications, including furosemide, were continued, in addition to close monitoring of fluid status.
However, he  had difficulty maintaining his blood pressure while on lasix, ace inhibitor and beta blockers resulting in an admission to the ICU for hypotension.
The patient was minimally symptomatic during this admission and was called out once his blood pressure stabilized.
His blood pressures remained low but stable throughout his admission and cardiology was consulted to help titrate his furosemide, ace inhibitor and beta blocker while maintaining normotension.
An ECG did not show significant change from prior, and he did not endorse any chest pain, palpitations, or other cardiac symptoms.
