During his most recent admission, a CT scan was done and demonstrated generalized additional abnormality involving both lungs with associated areas of ground-glass opacity, which had slightly progressed since the prior study.
Echocardiogram from that admission demonstrated an EF of 50% with a moderately dilated LV cavity mildly depressed LVEF and the normal RV and normal right ventricle aorta, minimal AS, MR, 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] that was estimated as moderate.
FVC of 1.29, 42% predicted, FEV1 is 0.94, 47% predicted; and FEV1/FVC ratio is 73, 111% predicted.
Today, he was seen by visiting nurse today for INR check but was found to be in CHF exacerbation (SOB, edematous, 02 sat 87% on 3L, crackles 1/2 up.
BP 110-120.
Labs were significant for BNP 6843 and trop 0.02 (baseline), Cr 3.0 (baseline of 1.8), INR 10.1 and Hct 28.7.
Physical exam was significant were crackles at the bilateral lower lung fields and erythema of the b/l lower extremity.
A chest xray demonstrated moderate congestive heart failure.
His saturation improved with BiPAP, however, his sats fell to the 90 and he developed retractions on trial off BiPAP.
Vitals on transfer: 70 107/74 33 100% on non-rebreather.

[**2119-11-7**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Since [**2119-9-12**], bilateral interstitial thickening and ground-glass opacities have progressed, new multifocal peribronchial consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions, right side more than left, are concerning for concurrent multifocal lung infection and pulmonary edema in the background of pre-existing interstitial abnormalities.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
PORT - The right kidney measures 10.2 cm and the left kidney measures 10.2 cm.
A cyst is seen at the upper pole of the right kidney on the posterior margin measuring 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.4 cm.
A cyst is also seen at the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.
[**2119-11-8**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - There is an unchanged region of cystic encephalomalacia in the posterior left parietal lobe resulting from an old infarct.
[**2119-11-9**] EEG - This continuous monitoring continues to show a diffuse encephalopathy that does not have any clear focal or lateralizing features.
[**2119-11-12**] CXR - Since the prior radiograph there was interval insertion of right internal jugular line with its tip terminating in the level of cavoatrial junction.
[**2119-11-24**]   Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 1.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-11-25**] 11:54 AM Bedside frontal radiograph centered at the diaphragm shows nasogastric tube ending in the proximal duodenum, and the distal portions of a transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator and left ventricular pacer leads, as well as a right PICC lead that ends in the upper right atrium and retained epicardial leads.
EEG Study Date of [**2119-11-11**] IMPRESSION: This continuous monitoring continues to show a diffuse encephalopathy that does not have any clear focal or lateralizing features.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 M w Hx of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 50% in [**2119-8-26**]), CAD s/p CABG (SVG-LAD, SVG-OM1), PCI with LCx, mitral valve repair in [**2115**] (28 [**Doctor Last Name **] physio ring), biventricular ICD implantantation, and atrial fibrillation s/p AV-nodal ablation in [**2114**] (on Coumadin, INR 10.1 on presentation), who presented with worsening shortness of breath x 1-days duration found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, coagulopathy and anemia with thrombocytopenia, which all fortunately resolved.
He was also aggressively diuresed (with good diuretic response) on admission with a Lasix gtt and his CXR appeared worsened with worsening pulmonary status.
The bronchoscopy demonstrated evidence of blood, although the hematocrit from the sample was < 2.0%.
A chest CT was obtained that demonstrated bilateral diffuse interstitial thickening and multifocal peribronchial opacities and moderate right and small left new pleural effusions suggest a combination of multifocal lung infection and edema.
These CT features did not favor pulmonary hemorrhage nonetheless.
We sent a number of vasculitides laboratory studies given the concern for a primary lung, renal and dermatologic process (see below), which included: a negative ANCA, negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative HIV antibody, anti-GBM, anti-histone, cyroglobulins, anti-lupus antibody, C3 and C4 levels were normal.
He received 5 mg PO Vitamin K, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (for an INR of 10.1 on admission, which improved) and 2 units of packed red cells total given an HCT of 21%.
The patient presented with a known CHF history; 2D-Echo from [**8-/2119**] showing a moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with mildly depressed LV systolic function and mid- and apical septal hypokinesis with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis (LVEF 34-50%, discrepancy with perfusion imaging and 2D-Echo).
Per his VNA, he has been more edematous with increasing dyspnea, oxygen saturations in the 87% range on 3L NC, and his wife notes that he had been coughing up dark-red sputum, but he has remained afebrile.
U/A negative, urine and blood cultures drawn and CXR showing pulmonary congestion without focal consolidation on admission (but CT imaging later showing multifocal consolidation and edema), lower extremity venous stasis changed noted) vs. dietary indiscretion vs. medication non-compliance vs. uncontrolled hypertension (unlikely) vs. worsening valvular disease (s/p MVR repair with 2+ MR noted on 2D-Echo from [**2119-8-26**]) vs. ACS/MI (EKG stable, Troponin 0.02) vs. Bactrim interacting with his heart failure medications vs. progression of restrictive lung disease (PFTs showing restrictive ventilatory defect).
We entertained the possible need for right heart catheterization to evaluate his PCWP, filling pressures to better understand his diastolic function in the setting of his respiratory decompensation, but this was deferred.
stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging [**2119-9-1**] showing stable moderate predominantly fixed defect in the inferior, inferolateral walls and apex with inferior wall hypokinesia and an LVEF of 34% with no anginal symptoms on stress testing.
Serial EKGs were closely monitored.
His EKG demonstrates a V-paced rhythm.
His INR trended down nicely.
Given his 2 prior ischemic stroke events, we judiciously held anticoagulation when his INR dropped below 2, but his bleeding concerns were more of an issue at the time.
His Coumadin was resumed on [**2119-11-14**] after his INR and coagulopathy had normalized and his diffuse alveolar hemorrhage concerns subsided.
Patient presented on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation with a supratherapeutic INR of 10.1 given his recent initiation of sulfa drug (Bactrim) for presumed lower extremity cellulitis vs. chronic venous stasis changes.
His INR could also have been elevated in the setting of poor PO intake.
His HCT was 28.7% on admission guaiac positive in the ED with some mixed blood-stool on rectal exam, but remained hemodynamically stable.
His INR was serially trended and improved following administration of vitamin K and FFP while holding his anticoagulation.
Given the concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (see above), his anticoagulation was held, we transfused him 2 units of packed red cells for a HCT of 21%, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma for INR reversal and dosed 5 mg of PO Vitamin K. An active type and screen with adequate IV access was maintained at all times.
He developed significant marcocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia to the 70s over his length of stay.
A DIC panel was overall reassuring, with some transient hyperbilirubinemia, but negative peripheral smear.
Hemolysis was considered, but a DAT was negative.
Hematology was consulted and felt that marrow suppression was most likely, but other factors were contributing, such as low iron utilization in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia and active infection.
The patient presented with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.5 based on our records; renal insufficiency has been attributed to diabetic nephropathy in combination with diastolic dysfunction and poor perfusion pressures.
Now presented with creatinine of 3.0, hyponatremia to 132 and some hyperkalemia with evidence of volume overload on exam during admission ??????
urine lytes demonstrate FeUrea of 38.45% (FeNa of 1.73% but on diuretics) consistent with intra-renal or post-renal process ??????
As noted above, vasculitides studies were sent but were all reassuring.
His electrolytes were closely monitored, his creatinine was trended and we avoided nephrotoxic medications and renally dosed his medications.
His creatinine steadily improved.
Exam on admission was notable for prominent ecchymoses in many stages of evolution with superimposed chronic venous insufficiency changes.
# CONCERN FOR SEIZURE ACTIVITY - The patient presented with no history of seizure activity or epilepsy, but was noted to have a single episode of some mild, myoclonic jerking motions which prompted a head CT which showed a stable prior ischemic infarct in the left posterior temporal/occipital areas, unchanged from [**2115**].
An EEG was obtained and was without epileptiform foci or concerning activity.
An H pylori antigen returned positive, however after discussion with his PCP and gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**], we decided against triple therapy as the risks of infection outweighed the benefit of treatment.
# NUTRITION - On day 3 of intubation, while the patient remained NPO, we started Isosource tube feeds for a goal rate of 45 cc/hr given Nutrition's recommendations, which he tolerated well.
Once his delerium cleared, he passed speech and swallow video study on [**2118-11-28**], and was advanced to a dysphagia diet.
