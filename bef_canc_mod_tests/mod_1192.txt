[**2179-6-28**]: PICC line insertion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old female diagnosed with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma by wedge biopsy in [**2179-2-26**].
She presented to clinic on [**5-25**] with foul drainage from [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 5283**] [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain.
CT chest/abd demonstrated a complicated hydropneumothorax with layering debris and moderate exudate adjacent to a 2.5 cm rent in the right hemidiaphram with collapse of the right middle lobe and pleuritis.

[**5-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
The cecum and ileocecal valve were not visualized, an underlying abnormality at the level of the cecum and right colon cannot be excluded.
Congestion in the right lung is improving.
Congestion in the right lower lung persists.
[**6-3**] ERCP: The scout images show two surgical tubes in the right upper quadrant.
[**6-4**] CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSIONS: 1.
On CXR, she was found to have a large PTX on the right and a large fluid collection with a white count of 66,000.
She was started on abx (vanco, meropenem, fluc) and was also noted to have a sodium of 115.
Daily chest xrays were performed (see above for reports).
A CT was also obtained which showed a "large right PTX causing RUL/RML collapse, and compression of RLL.
Fluid level in right pleural space communicates w/ peritoneum via defect in R hemidphragm, which is transited by surgical drain.
On [**5-26**], an ERCP was done which showed: "Plastic stent was found in the major papilla.
A JP study was done on [**5-28**] which showed communication with the chest; a gastrografin enemawas then obtained which showed transit to the mid transverse colon and with no leak.
ID recommended changing Fluc to Caspo for growth of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] in her cultures on [**6-1**].
On [**5-31**], the patient's chest tube (posterior apical) was noted to have bilious drainage, confirmed by sending the fluid for a TBili.
She was hence scheduled for an ERCP on [**6-3**], which confirmed a biliary leak likely due to stent migration.
On [**6-4**], she had a CT chest/abdomen performed which showed improvement of her fluid collections and no new focal collections amenable to drainage.
She had a PTC on [**6-7**]; on the same day, her chest tubes were placed to water seal per the thoracics service.
Repeat chest and abdominal films on [**6-9**] showed progression of contrast to her distal colon and sigmoid and no new cardipulmonary processes.
She went for a repeat ERCP on [**6-11**], during which they were unable to place a stent.
On [**6-13**], her apical CT was removed by thoracics and she spiked a temp to 101.2 later in the evening.
Cultures were sent, and a CT was done the following day which showed an undrained fluid collection.
On [**6-16**], she went for a repeat CT-guided drainage which showed adequate drainage of this collection.
Pt's chest tube was noted to have decreased drainage on [**6-18**]; hence, a CXR was done which showed a small amount of fluid within the right lateral basal pleural space, unchanged from prior films.
TPN was d/c'd as Kcals were ~1500-1700.
The CT drained ~10cc per day.
On [**6-25**], WBC increased to 15 and LFTs began to rise (AST went from 38 to 139, ALT from 57 to 142, and alk phos from 343 to 587).
On [**6-25**], a torso CT demonstrated decreased subhepatic fluid collection with appropriate position of pigtail drain and nearly resolved right medial pneumothorax and foci of loculated air along prior chest tube tract.
Stool was sent for C.diff, which was negative.
A urine culture grew only yeast.
Blood cultures were still pending on discharge.
On [**6-25**], meropenem and daptomycin were restarted; ertapenem was stopped.
Voriconazole was continued until [**2179-6-28**], when it was stopped due to concerns about its effects on liver function; her LFTs were still elevated at that time.
Following the switch, they began to decrease (AST 88, ALT 124, alk phos 348).
