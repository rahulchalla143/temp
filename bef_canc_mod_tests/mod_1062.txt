Given the lack of intravenous contrast and near absence of oral contrast, the study is nondiagnostic for infection or diverticulitis as requested.
There is a large umbilical hernia which should be apparent on clinical exam (though not provided in the given history).
No proximal small bowel dilatation, to CT criteria, is noted.
CXR [**2154-2-4**] In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], there is again substantial left pleural effusion.
Further investigation revealed that pt had pre-renal failure due to dehydration and not hepatorenal syndrome.
Fluid rehydration with IVF as well [**Date Range 61990**] was done with improvement in creatinine levels daily.
His BP improved and IVF, [**Date Range 61990**] was eventally discontinued.
Dig level 3.2 on admission, however held dose and redosed for dig levels < 1.
There was no evidence of infectious etiology per physical examination, labs or imaging.
CT abdomen/pelvis unrevealing for SBO, but study lacked oral contrast thus limited.
+cardiac cirrhosis, negative HIT antibodies, no evidence of schitocytes on smear and negative DIC labs.
Max sodium level was 151. .
We discontinued his Metolazone & furosemide daily as pt did not appear to be fluid overloaded, would recommend diuresis with evidence of overload while closely monitoring renal function.
# Complicated UTI: +UA noted on admission, urine culture with pansensitive P. mirabilis.
# Coagulopathy: INR 1.5 on admission, remained close to that baseline.
Known cardiac cirrhosis, received vitamin K po x 3 days in ICU.
