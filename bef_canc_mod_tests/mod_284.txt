[**Name (NI) **] report, her oxygen saturation upon arrival of the EMS, was in the 80's.
She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers with improvement of her oxygen saturation from 90% to 94%, also on 100% nonrebreather.
Restrictive lung disease, believed to be secondary to morbid obesity.
PRIOR STUDIES:  Echocardiogram of 12/99 revealed mild left axis deviation, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Exercise tolerance test MIBI was without angina, no ischemic changes, left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 64% with normal wall motion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature on presentation was 99.1 F, pulse is 84, blood pressure was 116/50, breathing at a rate of 19, 96% on 100% nonrebreather.
Weight was approximately 286 pounds.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat: pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally, oropharynx is clear.
Chest examination reveals diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes and crackles with a prolonged expiratory phase.
Cardiovascular examination is of regular rate and rhythm without evidence of murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities reveal trace bilateral upper extremity edema with 2+ to 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema, 1+ bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses, and 2+ bilateral radial pulses with stage I stasis dermatitis of the bilateral ankles.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Include a white blood cell count of 8.2, hematocrit of 39.6, platelets are 310,000.
Chemistries showed a sodium of 138, potassium of 5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate is 34, BUN is 17, creatinine 0.6, serum glucose is 231.
Urinalysis was negative for blood, nitrates, with 30 protein, greater than 1,000 glucose, negative ketones, and no cells.
Troponin on admission was 1.4, CK on admission was 176 with an MB fraction of 2.0.
Second CK was 153 with an MB fraction of 3.0.
Calcium was 8.3, albumin 3.5, magnesium 4.9, phosphate 1.9.
Chest x-ray on admission showed florid congestive heart failure with no evidence of pleural effusion, but perihilar haziness and more confluent of opacification of the lung bases and retrocardiac region.
Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block, stable from comparison electrocardiogram of [**2165-10-30**], with no acute ST-T wave changes indicative of ongoing ischemia.
The patient was aggressively diuresed with 80 mg of IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and oxygenated with face mask O2 as needed to keep oxygen saturations greater than 92%.
An arterial blood gas was measured at this time which revealed a pH of 7.2, pO2 of 42, pCO2 of 104.
The patient was sent for a stat CT scan angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism.
Repeat arterial blood gas prior to discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was pH of 7.36 with CO2 of 87 and a pO2 of 61.
Upon returning to the Medical Floor, the patient was noted also to have intermittent alarms on telemetry of paroxysmal multi-focal atrial tachycardia and frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia.
For further characterization of the patient's congestive heart failure, a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained to assess the patient's systolic function for any further causes for possible diastolic dysfunction.
Echocardiogram windows were severely limited secondary to the patient's body habitus; however, preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was of a sustained systolic function.
Fingerstick blood sugars throughout the hospitalization remained well controlled and the patient was covered with insulin sliding scale.
At this time she will also be scheduled for further outpatient pulmonary follow up for characterization of her restrictive lung disease and for further evaluation of possible obstructive lung disease.
