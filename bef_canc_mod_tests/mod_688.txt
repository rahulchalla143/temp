Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-10-2**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
CXR ([**2141-10-13**]): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2141-10-13**]): There is a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, similar in appearance from [**2141-10-13**].
Evaluation of the great vessels is limited without IV contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been interval development of a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air, that layers anteriorly and along the anterior abdominal wall.
These findings are all new from the prior CT on [**2141-10-13**], but free air was present on chest radiograph performed [**2141-10-25**].
Evaluation for wall thickening is limited without IV contrast.
Limited non-contrast views of the liver demonstrates a rounded 1.6 cm x 1.2 cm hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver, previously characterized as a hemangioma.
The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands demonstrate no gross abnormality.
Evaluation of solid organs is limited by lack of IV contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Uterus and rectum are grossly unremarkable.
However, as foci of air is seen in the region of the proximal stomach and GE junction in the setting of a recent endoscopy, perforation cannot be excluded, though no frank extravasation of contrast is identified.
Gastric Biopsies ([**2141-10-18**]): Antrum:  Corpus-type mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
The patient was empirically placed on IV flagyl, but this was discontinued when stool samples were negative for C.difficile.
Serial abdominal exams showed no peritoneal signs.
CT of the abdomen on [**10-13**] showed evidence of multifocal small bowel thickening and gastric wall edema, but no acute process.
Surgery was consulted and felt that the patient did not have an ischemic bowel as serial lactates were negative and serial abdominal exams showed improvement in pain.
On [**10-18**], GI performed an EGD which showed erosion in the gastroesophageal junction yet an otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to third part of the duodenum; biopsies of stomach antrum and proximal jejunum were negative.
Pericarditis was considered, but her EKG was unchanged from prior studies and there had been on interval increase in her pericardial effusion since [**2141-10-13**].
However, her abdominal CT on [**2141-10-26**] showed a large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis.
As a result, the patient underwent an exploaratory laparotomy on [**2141-10-27**].
# Hypertensive urgency: The patient was initially admitted to the MICU with a blood pressure of 240/180.
However, her blood pressures finally stabilized when she was placed back on her oral home regimen, which includes nifedipine, clonidine patch, labetalol, aliskiren, and hydralazine, with a hydralazine sliding scale for SBPs > 180.
Her Creatinine on admission was 7.9, which was near her baseline of 8 - 9.
Prior to her exploratory laparotomy, she was scheduled to have peritoneal dialysis four times per day over 4hrs with 2% solution at 1.2L per PD.
After her exploratory laparotomy, surgery strongly advised the medical team that she should not restart peritoneal dialysis until she was at least 3 weeks out from her surgery.
# Anemia: During her admission, the patient's HCT was monitored daily with HCT to low-mid 20's.
On [**2141-10-17**], she was found to have guaiac positive stools and her HCT was found to have dropped to a low of 18.6.
Between [**2141-10-23**] - [**2141-10-24**], the patient had a HCT drop from 26 to 20 in the setting of occult positive emesis.
She received two units of [**Month/Day/Year **] and her HCT returned to 28.
GI was aware and planned to perform a non-urgent EGD on [**10-25**] or [**10-26**] as the patient was hemodynamically stable and her HCT returned to baseline.
However, this did not occur as the patient went for an exploratory laparotomy on [**2141-10-27**] and her HCt remained stable and near baseline for the remiainder of her hospital course.
Her INR on admission was 1.2.
After her surgery, her coumadin was held and she was off the heparin drip, but her INR continued to drift up, getting as high as 2.6 on [**2141-10-30**].
As a result, she was given a test dose of vitamin K, which she responded to well (Her INR came back down to 1.4).
At discharge, her INR was still sub- therapeutic at 1.4.
As a result, she underwent upper extremity venous ultrasound on [**2141-11-2**], which showed no evidence of a DVT within the left upper extremity and the previously noted thrombus within the left subclavian vein was not seen as well.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient was noted to have OSA based on clinical nocturnal exam during admission.
The paitent stated that she would pursue further work-up and treatment for OSA as an outpatient.
