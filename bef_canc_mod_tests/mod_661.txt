Radiology: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-1-20**] 10:50 AM FINDINGS:  Postoperative changes of the left frontal craniotomy are again noted.
There is persistent pneumocephalus, decreased in comparison to prior study from [**2194-1-16**].
Further characterization may be obtained with an MRI and MRA if not CI.
MRI  BRAIN AND MRA HEAD/NECK W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-1-20**] 3:46 PM FINDINGS:  MRI HEAD:  The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy for resection of recurrent tuberculum sellae meningioma.
The cerebral sulci, ventricles, and extra-axial CSF containing spaces are otherwise normal in appearance, and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The intracranial internal carotids, vertebrobasilar, and anterior, right middle, and posterior cerebral arteries are patent with normal flow-related enhancement and branching pattern.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-1-22**] 6:17 AM FINDINGS: Post-left frontal craniotomy changes are again seen with a small subdural collection and trace pneumocephalus as well as overlying skin staples.
PORTABLE HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2194-1-23**] 7:59 AM FINDINGS:  Current examination is highly limited by streak artifacts from metallic device about the calvarium.
Allowing for such, there is no significant interval change in the caliber of the lateral ventricles as compared to most recent preceding exam to indicate increased mass effect.
Parenchymal assessment is highly limited.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2194-1-24**] 2:01 PM Cardiac size is top normal.
Cardiology: Portable TTE (Congenital, complete) Done [**2194-1-22**] at 12:16:07 PM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Neurophysiology: EEG Study Date of [**2194-1-21**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There are intermittent few second runs of blunted sharp waves in the left temporal area phase reversing at F7/T3.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background activity is asymmetric showing an [**7-10**] Hz rhythm on the right and a mixed theta and delta activity on the left reaching maximum [**5-8**] Hz posteriorly.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel shows a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 62 bpm.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 60-70 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of asymmetric background with significant slowing over the left hemisphere.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel shows a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 54 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of asymmetric background with slowing over the left side indicative of cortical and subcortical dysfunction in these regions.
At the start of the exam, the systolic BP was 138.
The SBP decreased to 128.
The total length of recording time was 22 minutes.
Four of the microembolic signals were seen at a depth of 67mm and one microembolic signal was seen at a depth of 56mm.
Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Report [**2194-1-24**] TCD Results: Transcranial doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed with insonation of the left middle cerebral artery for 32 minutes at a depth of 63mm.
No microembolic signals were seen, representing an improvement from the TCD study on [**2194-1-23**].
Initial neurological examination was unremarkable.
MRI showed scattered recent left frontal craniotomy with interval reduction of left frontal subdural fluid collection, evolution of scattered infarcts involving the left basal ganglia, inferior and lateral frontal, and left temporal lobes with an increase in the size of the left frontal lobe and most significantly a high-grade stenosis at the proximal aspect of the left M1 segment with small caliber of the more distal branches on MRA.
Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 5.3%, FLP Chol 192 TGCs 125 HDL 58, LDL 109.
EEG LTM was performed which was asymmetric and demonstrated right [**7-10**] Hz and left sided theta and delta slowing.
Concern was for hypoperfusion given her very significant left MCA stenosis and stat CT-head showed no new infarct and EEG bedside monitoring showed pronounced left hemisphere slowing but no seizures which could be compatible with hypoperfusion.
Echo with bubble on [**1-22**] showed no cardiac source of embolism and EF 60-65% with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
She was initially trialled on the floor and latterly stepdown unit with aggressive IVF resuscitation but her SBP was only maintained in 120s and deemed not sufficient to maintain perfusion, with persistence albeit with some improvement of her symptoms she was transferred to the ICU on [**2194-1-22**] for initiation of pressors.
Her EEG was stopped when in the ICU as there had been no seizure activity seen.
In the ICU she was continued on pressors and had a PICC line inserted, which kept her SBP in the 130-140's.
We then weaned her off the pressors, and her neurological exam remained stable.
Patient was having microemboli felt due to her likely MCA dissection noted on TCD on [**2194-1-23**] but this had settled by [**2194-1-24**].
Patient was assessed by PT/OT and deemed safe for discharge home and warfarin was therapeutic with INR 2.2.
Patient was therefore discharged on warfarin which will be managed by her PCP and had instructions to have her INR drawn on [**2194-1-27**].

Outpatient Lab Work INR to be taken on [**2194-1-27**] and faxed to patient's PCP DR [**Last Name (STitle) 43880**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43881**].
MRI showed strokes on the left side of your brain which had also been present post-operatively.
As a result, you were started on IV heparin which is a blood thinner in addition to warfarin to stop blood clots forming at the site of this dissection and causing further strokes.
You were briefly transferred to the ICU and treated with IV medications to maintain higher blood pressures after a further episode of word-finding difficulty and this improved and we were then able to be transfer you back to the floor.
In order to improve blood flow to the left side of your brain, given this narrowing in the blood vessel, we started you on a medication to increase the blood pressure called fludrocortisone.
We also monitored you on EEG and as there was no evidence of seizures, we have tapered and now stopped the keppra medication you were taking.
You have been started on a medication called warfarin (as above) which is a blood thinner and as a result, the major side-effect is bleeding.
In addition, if you have a head injury, you are at risk of bleeding and should always present to the ED for evaluation if this were to happen.
Medication changes: We STARTED warfarin 5mg daily - as above please have your INR drawn tomorrow We STARTED fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily We STOPPED dexamethasone as you have now finished your taper We STOPPED keppra We STOPPED lisinopril to allow for higer blood pressures given your brain artery narrowing  Followup Instructions: Given that we started you on warfarin you should have your warfarin level (INR) taken tomorrow and checked by your PCP as your dose may need to be changed.
In addition, we have arranged the following neurology stroke follow-up:  Department: NEUROLOGY When: FRIDAY [**2194-3-14**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 858**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  You also have the following existing Neuro-oncology followup where you will also be seen by neurosurgery:  Department: NEUROLOGY When: MONDAY [**2194-2-3**] at 9:30 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4861**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) 858**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
