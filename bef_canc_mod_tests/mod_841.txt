Since that time, he made full recovery and has been followed by serial CT scans.
A CT scan in [**2153-12-20**] was notable for an extensive aortic dissection extending into the great vessels of the chest.
These findings were not changed since prior exam in [**2153-6-20**].
Based on the above results, he underwent re-evaluation and was admitted for further evaluation and surgical intervention.

He was taken to the OR on [**2154-3-20**] and underwent a redo sternotomy with endostent placement of his Asc aorta/arch/desc aorta, innominate to Left carotid artery bypass, right axillary to right femoral artery bypass performed by Dr[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1290**], [**Doctor Last Name **], and [**Doctor Last Name **].
Overnight he had a low SVO2 and hemodynamic instability for which a bedside TEE was obtained and showed a possible pericardial tamponade.
A bedside sternotomy was performed and clots were evacuated from the pericardial cavity.
On POD2 A CT chest and lower extremity U/S did not show evidence of thromboembolism.
His lumbar drain was removed.
He became febrile to 101F for which blood and urine cultures were sent and antibiotics started.
On POD 9 He developed new onset aphasia and mild right sided weakness.
A postoperative embolus was suspected for which cerebral angiogram, lower ext doppler, and carotid U/S were performed which did not show any evidence of embolus or occlusion.
On POD 12 a chest CT revealed sternal dehiscience for which he was taken back to the OR for sternal rewiring and mediastinal exploration.
Pan cultures remained essentially negative except for a mediastinal culture which grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus.
A repeat head CT scan prior to discharge was unremarkable.
Medications on Admission: Labetolol 400 [**Hospital1 **], Protonix 40 qd, Norvasc 10 qd, Aspirin 81 qd, Advair.
