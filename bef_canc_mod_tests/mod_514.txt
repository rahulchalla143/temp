He was taken to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department where he had a heart rate of 110, blood pressure of 78/45.
Nasogastric lavage was performed and returned blood clots and was not able to be cleared.
He received one liter of normal saline and one unit of packed red blood cells after being noted to have a hematocrit of 24.7, that went up to 25.0 with those fluids.
He then received a second unit of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Room with an increase in his systolic blood pressure to 110.
Gastrointestinal was called and saw him in the Emergency Room, who requested that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy be performed in the Intensive Care Unit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature was 97.8 F.; heart rate 93; blood pressure 103/48; respiratory rate 22; 100% O2 saturation on room air.
Jugular venous pressure was flat.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheeze, no rhonchi.
Neurological examination was alert and oriented times three, speech was slightly slurred; no focal findings.
LABORATORY:  Initial laboratory values included a hematocrit of 24.7; his baseline hematocrit was 37.4 noted in [**2124-11-12**].
Hemoglobin was 8.8, white count 8.8 with a differential of 75 polys, one band, 17 lymphocytes, 3 monocytes, platelets 264.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 43, creatinine 0.6, glucose 134, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.8.
PT 13.0, INR 1.1, PTT 27.0.
Chest x-ray done in the Emergency Room was clear.
EKG noted atrial fibrillation with a rate of 84, normal intervals, axis of 60 degrees.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further work-up where he had an urgent endoscopy by the Gastrointestinal Service which showed evidence of old esophagitis.
Blood was noted in the stomach with clot that was adherent and unable to be sufficiently removed.
Gastric petechiae were noted consistent with gastritis and blood with clot was evident in both limbs of his prior small intestinal anastomosis.
At the conclusion of the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the patient vomited a fairly large amount of blood and was immediately placed on his side and able to cough up most of the bloody emesis, however, there was a concern for possible aspiration, although patient's respiratory status remained stable with normal respiratory rate, O2 saturations at 100% on two liters nasal cannula which he had been put on prior to the procedure and a chest x-ray was obtained that was clear.
His hematocrit was checked at 02:00 a.m. and was noted to be 23.2.
Blood pressure was increased following a 500 cc normal saline bolus and two additional units of packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit on hospital day two was up to 32.8, and he was begun on a diet of clear liquids.
The patient continued to be monitored in the Intensive Care Unit and remained hemodynamically stable through hospital day number three at which time his hematocrit went to 28.2 in the morning and then on repeat went to 31.2 prior to discharge.
Repeat chest x-ray on the morning of hospital day two showed a slight improvement in a retrocardiac opacity that was noted on the initial chest x-ray following the question of aspiration and the patient's white count which had increased to 14.8 on hospital day two, decreased to 12.3 on the day of discharge.
Given the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeds and history of partial gastrectomy, iron studies and B12 were added on to his initial laboratory tests and he was noted to have a low B12 as well as iron deficiency, and so he was started on B12 oral replacement and iron sulfate.
The patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician in the next three to five days for a repeat hematocrit check.
He is also to follow-up with the Gastrointestinal Service on [**8-31**], at 09:30 a.m. with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12589**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12590**], for a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
