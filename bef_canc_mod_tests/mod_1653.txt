PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2107-5-6**] 3:57 PM FINDINGS: The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach.
The examination is markedly limited by technique.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2107-5-12**] 9:26 AM FINDINGS: The left hemidiaphragm is slightly more sharply seen, raising the possibility of some improvement in the retrocardiac atelectatic change.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 M hx CAD, hx Afib, now w/cholangitis/cholecystitis, s/p [**Month/Day/Year **] sphincterotomy, stent placement ([**5-3**]) and GNR bacteremia (E.Coli)/sepsis  .
He underwent RUQ U/S on arrival to MICU, which demonstrated gallbladder wall edema but no pericholecystic fluid, with a CBD of 6mm diameter.
He met the SIRS criteria - fever and tachycardia and bands from the GNR's bacteremia from the cholangitis, decreased urine output, and borderline MAP > 55 despite volume resuscitation.
Hypovolemia was less likely given persistent hypotension despite IVF and clinical appearance.
Cardiogenic shock [**1-22**] rapid afib causing poor LV filling was initially considered but the patient's tachycardia did not respond significantly to diltiazem gtt.
His EF was 64% on cath [**10/2095**].
A sputum Cx was sent - Check sputum ctx - Goal MAP > 55 - central line was deferred at this time given response to IVF - Treatment for PNA and cholangitis empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Cholangiogram showed a dilated biliary tree with atleast two large stones in the CBD.
His LFT's, Amylase, Lipase trended down and abdominal pain was much improved.
His abdominal pain improved and he passed a swallow evaluation and was allowed ground solids and thin liquids.
He was Monitored on telemetry.
Initially his INR of 5.1 was reversed with Vitamin K 10 PO and 4 units of FFP.
EKG shows atrial fibrillation with RVR.
CEs were negative x3.
A lipid panel and HgA1c showed ASA 325 daily and Atorvastatin 20 daily were continued and Coumadin and Enalapril (in the setting of hypotension) were held.
DM: Blood sugar > 243.
Anemia: In ICU HCT 31.1 down from 39.2 on admission.
His HCT was checked [**Hospital1 **].
Thrombocytopenia: Hi plateltets dropped from 225 on admission to Likely dilutional.
Medications on Admission:  Albuterol 90 1-2 puffs''''prn, Atorvastatin 20, Diltiazem 240, Enalapril 5, Fluticasone 110 2 puffs'', Pantoprazole 40'', Rosiglitazone 8, coumadin 5  Discharge Medications: 1.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution [**Month/Day/Year **]: .25 mg Injection [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cholangitis, Choledocholithiasis cholecystitis septic shock atrial fibrillation Diabetes ICU Delerium   Discharge Condition: Good Continue tubefeeding and wean as PO diet increases   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the ER for any of the following: * You experience new or worsening abdominal pain.
