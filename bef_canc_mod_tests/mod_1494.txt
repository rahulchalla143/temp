On admission, he was found to have bilateral crackles, elevated BNP (althought not drastically above previous levels), lower extremity and cardiac wheeze on exam which were consistent with CHF exacerbation.
In light of CHF exacerbation and history of AS a repeat echo was obtained and demonstrated normal cavity size and global systolic function (LV > 55%) as well as minimal aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 21 torr.
TSH was within normal limits.
#.CAD: We doubted ischemia as a cause for the CHF exacerbation as he denied chest pain, CE were negative, and EKG does not meet Sgarbossa criteria.
#.ESRD s/p TRANSPLANT: Cr 2.6 on admission which is close to baseline for him.
