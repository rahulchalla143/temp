She did not require intubation; her vital signs were closely monitored.
Her blood pressure remained wnl during admission, and her home medications were continued.
Her high serum glucose levels were treated on a regular insulin sliding scale.
Her glyburide, which was temporarily held in the MICU, was restarted on the medical wards.
In addition, blood glucose levels were found to be elevated due to prednisone.
Your symptoms improved with this regimen, you were evaluated by physical therapy, were found to be stable and fit for discharge to home with visiting nursing services to monitor your oxygen levels and blood sugars.
You may notice that your blood sugars are a bit higher when you leave the hospital.
You should continue the insulin while on the prednisone and then follow up with you PCP about further blood sugar control as your blood sugars will be lower once you stop the steroids.
