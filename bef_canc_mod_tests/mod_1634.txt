Sputum Cx [**2167-5-25**]: [**12-3**] PMNs and < 10 epis, with no microorganisms seen, and no growth.
Except for blinking and a bit of head turning, seizures had no clear clinical signs on video.
CT HEAD [**2167-5-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited study due to motion, however, there is no evidence of gross hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction.
CXR [**2167-5-21**]: IMPRESSION: Streaky bibasilar opacities which could represent aspiration versus bibasilar atelectasis=.
KUB [**2167-5-21**]: IMPRESSION: Nonspecific, nonobstructed bowel gas pattern.
CXR [**2167-5-22**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lung opacities are more conspicuous in comparison to prior radiographs from yesterday and in the view of clinical history, concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
EEG [**2167-5-22**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
EEG [**2167-5-23**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.

The background rhythm remained slow and was better seen on the right.
ECHO [**2167-5-28**]: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-2-23**], the right ventricle was not previously assessed due to patient position, but was noted to be normal in size and function on the current study.
She was found to have a temperature of 102.9 F axillary.
Lumbar puncture on [**2167-5-22**] showed 210 WBC, however no organisms grew from culture, and HSV PCR was negative.
Fluid from the baclofen pump on [**2167-5-24**] showed 15 WBC, but again culture was negative.
Cryptococcal antigen, fungal culture, HSV PCR, and Bartonella serologies were negative.
TTE was negative for vegetations.
# SPASTICITY: The patient has spasticity in all extremities, legs greater than arms, secondary to hemorrhagic parieto-occipital stroke in [**2158**], s/p baclofen pump placement in [**2159**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 54184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**] ([**Hospital1 2177**] orthopedics - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94375**] or pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94376**]).
[**2166**]) but, per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27853**] (covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94377**]), the pump was replaced on [**2166-10-28**], and recently the reservoir was refilled on [**2167-5-12**], with plans for another refill on [**2167-7-30**].
A KUB showed no obstruction.
PENDING RESULTS: [**2167-5-23**] BCx [**2167-5-24**] CSF from baclofen pump EEG final read [**2167-5-27**]  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need to be followed to ensure that she does not have any fevers now that she is off of her vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
