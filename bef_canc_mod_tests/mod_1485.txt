Sepsis: The patient was transferred to the MICU hypotensive and septic from a likely respiratory source based on preliminary culture data.
The patient's blood pressures remained labile hypo- and hyper-tensive often associated with bouts of atrial fibrillation to the 120s.
His sputum culture showed pan-sensitive Morganella.
Urine lytes were c/w ATN.
He was fluid resuscitated and his creatinine and urine output improved while in the ICU.
His baseline Cr is 1.1-1.3 and he was 1.3 on discharge.
Hypernatremia: The patient was admitted with an inital Na of 170.
Metoprolol was used intermittently (when the patient was not on pressor support) but was ineffective at rate control and compromised his blood pressure.
Coagulopathy:  The patient was found to have an INR of 1.8 without clear explanation and no history of anticoagulation.
CAD:  The patient's admission EKG indicated ST depressions with T wave inversions in the setting of a rapid rate.
Troponins were mildly elevated as the patient was in renal failure, but no clear evidence of infarction was discovered.
Anemia:  The patient experienced a hematocrit drop from 37 to 33 after significant fluid hydration.
Latanoprost 0.005 % Drops [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic HS (at bedtime).
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
You were inturbated, given broad-spectrum antibiotics and treated with medications to support your blood pressure.
