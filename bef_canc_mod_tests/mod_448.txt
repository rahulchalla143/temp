She was noted to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.2 and a complete blood count with a left shift.
Her leg was evaluated by Vascular Surgery who thought it was consistent with previous lymphedema and recommended conservative measures.

Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal and reactive to light.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular.
Extremity examination revealed right leg erythema and thickened skin extending to the knee.
