The patient came to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and he had dry heaves but without vomiting.
Echocardiogram in [**2196**], demonstrated an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with aortic valve of 1.0 square centimeters and moderate aortic stenosis and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 102, blood pressure 148/80, heart rate 106, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 87% in room air and 90% on two liters oxygen.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - Extraocular movements are intact.
Cardiovascular - S1 and S2 irregularly irregular and are obscured by systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border that is III/VI.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination is guaiac negative per Emergency Department.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.1, hematocrit 44.1, baseline around 37.0, platelet count 55,000, MCV 101.
Blood urea nitrogen 22 and creatinine 1.9.
ALT was 11, AST 131, LDH 293, amylase 287, lipase [**2211**], total bilirubin 3.1, alkaline phosphatase 69, CK 67, troponin 0.09.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed common bile duct of [**9-16**] millimeter diameter and gallbladder containing gallstones.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted but cannulation of the biliary duct was unsuccessful despite multiple attempts because the patient became very agitated and uncooperative and therefore, the procedure was aborted.
It was decided to attempt another endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, this time under anesthesia.
Original impression was that this elevated troponin represented demand ischemia imposed on the heart by the pancreatitis and the cholestatic picture in the setting of aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation.
The cardiac catheterization showed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease, as was known from before.
These results confirmed the results of a transthoracic echocardiogram that had been done on [**2198-12-14**], and had shown an aortic valve area of 0.7 square centimeters, left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Following these results, it was decided that the patient could have the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and as of the time of this dictation, the patient is scheduled for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the morning of [**2198-12-24**].
As of [**2198-12-23**], the pancreatic enzyme levels as well as the total bilirubin level have returned towards normalization, and the patient is free of abdominal pain.
The patient's platelet count on admission was 55,000 and remained in the 40,000 to 50,000 range until the patient was transfused platelets prior to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure.
DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient as of [**2198-12-23**], is expected to be discharged to home pending endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2198-12-24**], and with recommended follow-up by primary care physician as well as by his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1399**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17915**] and it has been recommended that he follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of cardiothoracic surgery for an outpatient evaluation and potential consideration of an aortic valve repair.
