Her electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V3 through V6 resolved after the patient became pain free.
She underwent a catheterization in [**2125**], which showed three-vessel disease including 80% right coronary artery, 90% left anterior descending coronary artery, 80% circumflex, and an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year, which showed normal left ventricle and right ventricle with an ejection fraction of 55% and no abnormal wall motion activity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission showed vital signs afebrile, heart rate 90-120, blood pressure 100-130/70-80, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 96% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed mucous membranes moist; pupils equal, round and reactive to light; extraocular movements intact.
Heart sounds showed a regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmur, no jugular venous distension.

Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended; guaiac negative rectal examination.
Neurological examination was alert and oriented x 3, grossly intact.

Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure or infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 115, normal axis, normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V3 through V6; [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in 2; T wave inversions in 2, 3, and V3 through 6, that was with 8/10 chest pain.
When the patient was pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous nitroglycerin as well as heparin, the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 92 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V4 and 5 and T wave inversions in V3 through 5.
In summary, the catheterization showed 40% left main, 90% left anterior descending coronary artery, 95% circumflex coronary artery, and 90% right coronary artery.
The patient was seen by CT Surgery and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.
On postoperative day one the patient was weaned from the intra-aortic balloon pump, which was discontinued at that time.
Her cardiac function was good.
At the time of transfer the patient's physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs - temperature 98.8, heart rate 80 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 145/85, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 96% on room air.
Her weight preoperatively was 92.2 kg; at discharge was 97.4 kg.
Laboratory data showed an hematocrit of 28, potassium 4.2, BUN 22, creatinine 0.9, magnesium 2.
Her breath sounds were clear to auscultation on the right, diminished at the left base [**1-11**] of the way up.
