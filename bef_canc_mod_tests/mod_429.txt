The patient was awoken from sleep at 11:30 am with symptoms; he denies  In the Emergency Department, his initial vitals were a heart rate of 120, blood pressure 100/palp, respiratory rate 32-36, O2 saturation 79% on room air, increased to 93% on 100% nonrebreather.
An electrocardiogram was a poor tracing, but it was relatively unchanged from previous, with no ischemic changes noted.
Blood cultures sent, chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating an interval improvement/resolution of a left upper lobe infiltrate, however, new infiltrates at the bibasilar regions concerning for pneumonia.
Arterial blood gas was done which revealed 7.23/75/55/33/0 on 100% nonrebreather.
Question of pulmonary hypertension; echocardiogram in [**2134-8-7**] was suboptimal for evaluating the pulmonary arterial pressures.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had lung cancer at age 65, mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 63, brother had a CABG at age 43, sister has congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 30.3, hematocrit 49.3, platelets 277, MCV 88.
Differential includes 89 neutrophils, 3 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes.
Sodium 134, potassium 4.1, chloride 90, bicarb 39, BUN 11, creatinine 0.6, glucose 103.
CHEST X-RAY:  Interval improvement/resolution of left upper lobe infiltrate, new infiltrates at bibasilar regions concerning for pneumonia.
Blood cultures x2 were pending and sent off from the Emergency Department.
Chest CT scan was obtained on [**1-11**] to rule out pulmonary embolism.
The study were consistent with no pulmonary embolisms, however, mass-like densities were noted at the right lung base with inflammatory changes at the left lower base.
Our recommendation is to repeat CT scan in four-six weeks from [**1-11**].
Echocardiogram was obtained on  [**1-12**], to look for pulmonary hypertension.
The study demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction of 60%, small pericardial effusions, RV dilatation, decreased RV systolic function.
Pulmonary arterial pressures, however, could not be determined given technical limitations to this study.
MICU course included cycling of cardiac enzymes to rule out demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and sepsis.
Cardiac serial enzymes were negative x3.
Blood cultures remained no growth to date by the time of discharge.
Sputum cultures were no growth to date by day of discharge.
Regarding the suspicious nodular densities demonstrated on CTA of the chest, the recommendation will be for the patient to followup with a repeat CT scan in four weeks.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and she will consider this treatment option as an outpatient.
There his oxygen saturation should be kept between 90-95% (He is a CO2 retainer with severe congestive obstructive pulmonary disease).
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16315**].
CT scan of the chest on [**1-11**] with suspicious spiculated-appearing nodules in the left lower zone (patient needs followup CT scan in four weeks).
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable; O2 saturation greater than 90% on room air.
