Pt was at OSH from [**11-3**] to [**11-12**] for 2 months of SOB, wheezing, sputum production, found to have LLL PNA and large mediastinal mass deviating the trachea to the right.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-12**] for further evaluation.
Course c/b ARF, MRSA PNA and [**Female First Name (un) **] tracheitis, treated with 8d of Vanc and 5d of Fluc.
DVT of LUE PICC and R CVL IJ treated with heparin gtt (transiently on argagroban for plt drop but HIT neg x2) and transitioned to coumadin.
Pt unable to see endocrine and onc as outpt b/o ventilator and family requested transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further inpt management.
During her rehab stay, she spiked to 102, grew MRSA from cath tip and in blood and Proteus (intermediate sensitivities to FQ) in trach aspirate and cath tip.

Thyroid US [**11-16**]: 1.
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a large vascular left thyroid nodule without immediate complication.
CT Torso [**11-13**]: 1.
Diagnostic considerations include a large thyroid mass or multinodular goiter with retrosternal component, much less likely a thymic lesion.
Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is advised to exclude an endobronchial lesion or extrinsic compression at the left hilum.
If indicated, further assessment could be performed with a dedicated renal ultrasound.
