Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed with mild global hypokinesis and severe hypokinesis in the basal to mid inferior and infero-lateral walls..
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-4**], the overall LVEF has decreased.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 16 mmhg, PCW = 23 mmhg), with depressed cardiac index.
Left heart catheterization revealed systemic hypertension.
The patient was intubated in the field and found to have a SBP of 220's.
Serial CKs were negative with mild elevation of troponins (0.21 peak).
Echo revealed global LV HK and severe HK of the PDA territory.
Following catheterization the patient had no further chest pain or dyspnea.
ESRD [**1-7**] FSGS- As above, hemodialysis was initiated on this admission.
Calcium acetate was started as a phosphate binder, and he was also given epogen with dialysis.
As above, patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stents to OM1/2.
CHF with EF 40%: As above, volume control with hemodialysis which was initiated this admission.
-We have started new medications, including captopril, calcium acetate, nephrocaps, plavix, and an iron supplement, which should be taken as prescribed.
