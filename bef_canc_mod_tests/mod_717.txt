[**3-13**] CT Head: 1.
[**3-13**]: CT C-spine: No evidence of acute fracture or listhesis.
[**3-13**] CT Orbits/face: 1.
[**3-30**] Most recent head MRI: This study, slightly degraded by patient motion artifact, is compared with recent contrast-enhanced MR examination dated [**2102-3-20**]; the overall appearance is unchanged.
CXR [**2102-4-11**]: The heart size is moderately enlarged, unchanged.
Dementia work up was initiated, and she completed an MRI of the head.
The dementia workup was negative and the MRI (limited study) was significant for no acute stroke.
The pt's electrolytes were checked and repleted.
On the morning of transfer to the floor the pt has a CT head that showed an isolated fracture of her mandible.
A day after initiation of these medications, there was an interval increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.2.
The pt's fall did not appear to be a syncopal event and her labs and urinalysis were unremarkable.
Her head CT revealed chronic microvascular angiopathy likely representing dementia.
A metabolic workup was negative.
During a neurology team evaluation the pt was noted to have ?mild myoclonus of toe.
A STAT EEG showed markedly abnormal brain activity indicating severe encephalopathy.
[**3-19**] the patient was noted to have tonic extension of her arms thought to be a generalized seizure.
Her dilantin level was found to be subtherapeutic at 2.5.
Blood and urine cultures were ultimately unrevealing.
A lumbar puncture was performed and found to be negative.
Her EEG showed evidence of a deep encephalopathy.
Thyroid function tests were repeated and were once again unremarkable; ammonia was sent and was normal.
In the stepdown unit, her exam improved slightly - she began to open her eyes and keep them open to sternal rub, and then spontaneously opened her eyes on [**3-31**].
MRI was repeated and showed stable subcortical white matter changes.
As she did not follow commands, further workup was pursued, including sending anti-TPO antibody to check for Hashimoto's encephalitis.
Multiple blood and urine cultures were sent which showed no signs of infection.
She also had several days of EEG monitoring with no evidence of seizure, and only showing encephalopathy.
Her creatinine eventually normalized.
BP was elevated upon arrival to medical ICU; this was thought to be likely secondary to agitation.
Blood pressure stabilized after transfer to neuro ICU and finally to SDU.
She also had an element of mild fluid overload on some of the CXRs.
Most recent CXR [**4-11**] was normal.
A large work-up, including MRIx4, LPx2, and multiple blood tests yielded no reason for her symptoms.
Her exam currently is that she opens her eyes to sternal rub and keeps them open, but only looks midline.
Her brainstem reflexes are normal, with normal corneals, gag, cough, OCRs, nasal tickle, and pupils.
