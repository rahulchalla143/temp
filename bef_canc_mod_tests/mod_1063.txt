PNA with Severe Hypoxia: Had right multilobar PNA with MRSA/Pseudomonas growing from sputum, with WBC count of 9,000 and bandemia as high as 22%, elevated anion gap, and elevated lactate to 2.4.
The patient will be discharged with need for  continued O2 suppplementation to keep sats >90% and <94% with O2 weaning as possible.
Chest Pain: Had right sided chest pain, which is diffuse and pleuritic, likely due to PNA.
A KUB showed a non-obstructive bowel gas patterns and the patient's ostomy continues to drain well.
C. Diff was negative x 1.
