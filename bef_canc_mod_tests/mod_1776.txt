RUQ ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver without lesions and evidence of ascites.
A CT of the abdomen showed two small liver lesions that were concerning for HCC.
The patient's sodium improved with fluid restriction and holding of his diuretics.
His sodium on discharge was stable.
A renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys bilaterally.
The patient was treated conservatively with twice daily hematocrits and transfusions to keep his Hct > 21.
The patient continued to drop his blood counts, so a CTA was done to try to localize an active bleeding vessel.
His Hct on discharge was stable at 26.
He will have his Hct checked as an outpatient.
Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D level low on recent labs for screening for transplant.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have a hematocrit drawn on [**Telephone/Fax (1) 766**] [**4-12**] and results faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 110634**] Fax # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92410**].
You required multiple transfusions in order to keep your blood counts stable.
Your hematocrit on discharge is 25-26.
You will need to have your blood count checked on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-12**] to make sure that you are not still bleeding.
