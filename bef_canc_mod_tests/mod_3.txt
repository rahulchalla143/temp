Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly unremarkable.
His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which was new.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation and management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 99, heart rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils 2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.
Pulmonary examination - The patient had diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds on the right.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies at the outside hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of 11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.
The differential on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes.
Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium 5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.
Prothrombin time was 22.4, partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0.
Arterial blood gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a 100% FIO2.
Urinalysis was within normal limits.
CKs were 41 and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.
Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.
A Transesophageal echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and apical hypokinesis.
A CT angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.
On [**2175-9-19**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.
The patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101 while urine culture grew E. coli.
Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture sites with some thick secretions.
Over the weekend of [**2175-9-23**], and [**2175-9-24**], the patient defervesced with decreasing white blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications with stable blood pressure.
Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.
Lipid panel indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137, LDL of 133 and HDL of 41.
The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the 30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228, transferrin of 175.
Carotid Doppler studies were performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis and mild plaquing bilaterally.
The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic control during hospital course.
He was also to follow-up in [**Hospital 191**] Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and was to follow-up with his primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] firm.
Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex.
until INR is greater than 2.0.
