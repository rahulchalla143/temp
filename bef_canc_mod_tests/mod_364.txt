Admission Date:  [**2165-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-9-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-8-17**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease including two prior coronary artery bypass grafts, myocardial infarction in [**2139**] and a lung nodule who had presented for catheterization pre-operative work-up for lung mass resection.
Echocardiogram was done The patient was brought up to the CCU for monitoring and management of his hemodynamics.
He had a catheterization in [**2160**] which revealed a patent saphenous vein graft to his left anterior descending and a saphenous vein graft to his posterior descending artery.
His vitals were temperature 92.9, pulse 96, respirations 16, blood pressure 128/64.
HEENT:  Mucus membranes slightly dry, no jugulovenous distension, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Bilateral groin hematomas were tender but no bruits were present.
LABORATORY DATA:  Upon admission his white blood count was 9.9, hematocrit 32.9 with baseline of 40, platelet count 233,000, Chem 7 136, 3.3, 104, 18, 18, 1.1 with baseline of 1.0 creatinine and 230.
INR was 1.3.
CKs have been 42 and 45 and EKG on admission revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 120 with left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray revealed no cardiomegaly, no pneumothorax with mild to moderate CHF but no effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient arrived in the CCU and after approximately 30-40 minutes became severely hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 40's to 50's.
Code was called and his pressure was stabilized on pressors and finally on Epinephrine.
Echocardiogram was done which did not reveal any effusion.
Second concern was that of hemodynamic status and a Swan Ganz catheter was passed from his left femoral sheath which revealed a central venous pressure of 6, right ventricular pressure of 31/5 and a wedge pressure of 11 consistent with mild hypovolemia.
His pressures again had increased with Dopamine and Epinephrine.
He was sedated and intubated and an abdominal CT scan was done because of the concern of enlarging bilateral groin hematomas.
The abdominal CT revealed stranding of right groin consistent with small hematoma but no retroperitoneal hematoma was found.
He tolerated po well and had good urine output after Foley was removed.
He should also follow-up in cardiac rehab and our plan would be to increase his Captopril dose to 12.5 mg po bid and possibly 25 mg po bid if his blood pressure tolerates it.
