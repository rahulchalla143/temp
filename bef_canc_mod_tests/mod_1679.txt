Limited evaluation for focal liver lesions.
TTE [**9-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2153-1-12**], the right ventricle now appears dilated with low-normal function.
LENIs [**9-28**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both lower extremities including the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms without evidence for intraluminal thrombus.

Stools studies for E.Coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and C diff were negative.
There was evidence of cecal to ascending bowel wall thickening on his admission CT abd/pelvis but this was in the setting of no accompanying abdominal pain and an unimpressive lactate thus making an embolic or frank ischemic colitis less likely.
UA on [**9-29**] showed 39 WBC and muddy brown casts on sediment suggesting ATN.
Renal U/S showed no postrenal obstruction.
AST/ALT ratio c/w of alcoholic hepatitis and liver US suggestive of hepatic steatosis or cirrhosis.
Abd CT showed area of increased hyperattenuation in R lobe, raising a concern for HCC.
All imaging did not show frank obstructive lesion that could cause obstructive cholestasis.
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed upon admission that revealed a SAAG > 1.1, no SBP, and negative cytology and cultures.
He will f/u with hepatology as an outpt and will need an outpt liver MRI as well as outpt EGD.
Was found to have a small subsegmental PE on chest CTA on admission, which was not thought to be a big contributing cause to his complaints of worsening SOB.
TTE showed no evidence of L sided heart failure.
He will continue on coumadin for an INR goal [**2-8**] indefinitely for atrial fibrillation and PE.
Diltiazem, sotalol held on admission due to hypotension initially on presentation.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).
