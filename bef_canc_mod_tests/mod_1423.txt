VC was 0.95L with NIF of -40 on this date.
On arrival to the ER her NIF was -30 and her vital capacity was 1.4.
NIF on transfer was -45 with a vital capacity of 1 L.  On review of systems she currently denies fevers, chills.
Stroke, [**2121**] - felt to be [**2-9**] hypertension - residual weakness in BLLE 3.
Spine surgery, [**2120**] 11.
JVP not elevated Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rales or ronchi, reduced inspiratory air entry noted bilaterally Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.

On the night of [**4-26**], the ICU team was called to reassess for worsening NIF and vital capacity (-32 and 750 cc).
On exam she did not endorse worsening dyspnea but reported feeling weak persistently since transfer to rehab.
Her ABG was notable for a compensated chronic respiratory acidosis.
Infectious workup initiated on admission has been unrevealing.
CXR was negative for acute cardiopulmonary process.
Echocardiogram during this admission was unremarkable.
In the MICU other causes of weakness were evaluated and the CT head showed no evidence of new infarction.
Pt also had a chest floroscopy study to evaluate for phrenic nerve injury given her recent AAA repair.
The floro study was negative - pt had good diaphragmatic movement bilaterally.
Pt remained stable while on the medical floor, and her NIF remained -40 to -50, with a VC 0.9 to 1.5L.
After discussion with transfusion medicine, we decided not to pursue plasmaphoresis for multiple reasons: no fatigability or physical signs of active [**Month/Year (2) 15099**], risks associated with putting phoresis catheter in her right atrium with new onset a. fib, and it would pull off her coumadin and make anticoagulation more difficulty.
Her BB was not changed, and afib remained stable.
On the neurology floor her INR was 1.3 the day prior to and the day of discharge so lovenox subcutaneous was started while INR is subtherapeutic.
Coumadine was increased from 5mg 5x/week and 2.5mg 2x/week to 5mg daily.
- Follow daily INR and adjust coumadin as needed - Continue lovenox while INR is subtherapeutic  #.
Her Uosm and Sosm continue to be c/w SIADH, along with her urine NA level.
Pt began to improve on a 1.5L fluid restriction, and may need a 1L fluid restriction for full improvement.
Her urine and serum osmolarity are consistent with this diagnosis.
She has a history of small cell lung cancer (per pt) which can be attributed with SCLC but no neoplasm was seen on CT chest done [**4-7**].
On the neurology floor she complained of hip pain and CT pelvis was done to evaluate for hematomas at catheter sites or avascular necrosis given pt's treatment with prednisone.
