His blood pressure remained stable off pressors.
Blood and urine cultures as well as c diff toxin were sent and were negative.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis and US of the abdomen revealed persistent but unchanged fluid collections.

Fluid cultures from the abdominal collection eventually grew out Lactobacillus and the patient was started on Augmentin.
In addition he had a bandemia, fever, and ARF which is concerning for sepsis.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained and he was admitted the MICU and was started on Daptomycin (cover VRE, MRSA), cefepime (GNR), and flagyl (anaerobes).
He recieved IVF boluses to keep CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 40 cc/hr.
Additionally C. Diff and sputum cx were also obtained, and serial abdominal exams were performed.
A RUQ U/S failed to reveal the soucre of the infection.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] became hemodynamically stable off pressors on the day after admission and a tagged WBC scan was performed to attempt to localize the source of his left lower quadrant tenderness that seemed musculoskeletal in origin.
The tagged WBC scan showed uptake in a fluid collection in the left paracolic gutter and a drain was placed in the fluid collection which returned fluid with gram positive rods identified as lactobacillus.
# Acute renal failure: Initially presented with a serum creatinine of 2.1.
His last sodium was 133 two days prior to discharge.
