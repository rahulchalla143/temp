Over the next 2 days, it was noted that the patient's creatinine had increased and that her urine output had decreased.
In the MICU, subsequent radiographs (CXR and CT [**9-2**]) showed moderate pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia with lobar collapse.
She was eventually intubated on [**9-5**] for her progressive hypoxia and serial radiographs showed massive pulmonary edema with superimposed multifocal pnuemonia.
Bronchoscopy was performed and was unrevealing.
CXR from [**9-14**] s/p extubation showed marked improvement in pulmonary volume overload and pleural effusions.
Was easily weaned down to 2L NC with sats in the high 90's.
Despite resolution of her hypoxia, her renal function did not improve and she required HD on [**9-15**].
She also developed dysphagia after EGD and variceal banding, which has resolved.
Repeat US abd showed lack of flow in right and left portal vein.
Recent abdominal CT shows no evidence of obstruction.
Pt will need liver [**Month/Day (2) **] eventually, currently due to her renal fuction it is unclear whether she will need a renal [**Month/Day (2) **] concurrently (see below).
On [**9-1**] pt had 3 pt hct drop, complaining of RUQ pain, U/S suggests left portal vein thrombus.
&#9658; RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.
[**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
D/c nadolol and norvasc [**3-11**] low BP Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however, no tapable effusion noted on US.
CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior.
Bronchoscopy was done [**9-12**] was concern of ongoing infection, however, unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.
&#9658; RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine 1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now downtrending to 3.1.
Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related as per renal.
HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.
No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
Had good response to increased Hydralazine for preload and afterload reduction, however holding to avoid hypotension with HD at this time.
HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation worsen or hgb below 7.0 - on [**Hospital1 **] PPI - no need for repeat EGD now that pt is s/p TIPS  &#9658; DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II difficult to control, at home on large lantus doses, approximately 60 Lantus [**Hospital1 **] BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
No abdominal ascites on previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
[**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions.
Source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso.
&#9658; CAD: Known 3VD on cardiac cath in [**2151**].
- at this point ASA has been contraindictaed given GIB on ASA - she will defer statin and ACEI at this time as per discussion with her during last admission, she wished to discuss with her cardiologist.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: End stage liver disease Refractory Ascites from NASH cirrhosis Acute on chronic kidney disease .
Call your doctor or go to the ED for any of the following: chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, worsened abdominal distention or ascites, swelling in your legs, confusion or any other symptoms.
