CT of her torso was performed, which ruled out dissection, but did show distended gallbladder with common bile duct, increase in diameter as well.
CT scan also showed some stranding of the colon.
She was given prophylactic antibiotics because of the CT findings.
Angiographic evaluation was declined at that time.
Her last echocardiogram showed systolic congestive heart failure with an LV ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent, apical left ventricular aneurysm and diffuse wall motion abnormalities.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  T-max 97.8, heart rate 70, blood pressure 106/27, respiratory rate 17, saturation 98 percent on room air.
Abdominal exam:  Mild distention, tympanic to percussion in the epigastric and right upper quadrant region.
LABORATORY DATA FROM ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8.4, 65 percent polys, 30 percent lymphocytes, 2.4 percent monocytes, 2.4 percent eosinophils.
Hematocrit 37.1, platelets 302 and MCV 93.
Chemistry profile notable for a BUN of 39, creatinine of 1.2, ALT 18, AST 37, alkaline phosphatase 85, total bilirubin 0.4, amylase 652, lipase 2,642, CK 63, troponin 0.06.
Her saturation dropped to 76 percent on room air with a blood pressure 205/142 and a heart rate of 105.
Lungs exam were notable for diffuse expiratory wheezes and chest x-ray showed evidence of pulmonary edema.
Her pressure dropped to 70/44, but subsequently responded to BiPAP and Lasix, with a normalized pressure, and saturations returned to 96 to 97 percent on room air.
Her laboratory studies were notable for a rising troponin of 1.08 with normal CK.
EKG showed pseudonormalization of T waves in the lateral precordial leads, otherwise it was stable from prior studies.
Repeat echocardiogram was performed on the 14th, which showed an EF of 30 percent, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, moderate MR, worse from prior study, most likely in the setting of having decompensated congestive heart failure.
Cardiac enzymes began to trend down upon the time of discharge.
Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressure was normalized upon the time of discharge.
Urinary tract infection:  Urine cultures were negative and the patient was asymptomatic, and therefore, antibiotics were held.
The patient had iron studies that were sent.
Guaiac studies were negative.
