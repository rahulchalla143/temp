However, when an endotracheal sample grew out Strep pneumoniae his antibiotic regimen was switched to ceftriaxone.
A CT scan of the patient's chest was obtained.
With the severity of the patient's pneumonia, ceftriaxone was again added to the patient's antibiotic regimen to ensure broader coverage.
Acute renal failure:  The patient on presentation had acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.8.

In addition, his creatinine began to improve and returned to [**Location 1867**] at the time of discharge.
He was fairly aggressively diuresed with Lasix and required dopamine to maintain his BP & UOP.
At the time of this dictation his acidosis had completely resolved, his anion gap had closed and his lactate levels were normal.
His blood was sent in a special tube for platelet analysis.
This revealed that he did, indeed, have thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 33,000.
The thrombocytopenia was thought to be secondary to hypersplenism as evidenced on his CT scan.
Further evaluation is deferred to his outpatient PMD.
A DIC panel was relatively  unremarkable with FDP of 10-40 and a fibrinogen greater than 400.
In the setting of broad spectrum antibiotic use, his INR increased to 3.1.
