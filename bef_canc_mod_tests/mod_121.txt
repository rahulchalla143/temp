He was given an additional 2.5L with stabilization of his blood pressure and improvement of his tachycardia.
Blood cultures (1/2 bottles) returned positive for pan-sensitive coagulase negative staph.
Repeat CXR in the ED revealed improvement in RML infiltrate from prior on [**8-14**].
His chest x-ray is much improved from prior admission.
Hematocrit is stable since discharge making acute blood loss an unlikely explanation for orthostasis.
He was given IV fluids in the ED with reported improvment and had negative orthostatic blood pressures prior to discharge.
