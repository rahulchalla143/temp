This was changed to a #4 fenestrated cuffless on [**1-27**] with a Passy-Muir valve, which the patient tolerated at the time of discharge.
Interval CT on [**2155-1-19**] showed no new collection or seroma.
CT of the neck and upper torso was inadequate to assess the patency of the internal jugular.
A repeat ultrasound demonstrated patency of this ruling out a DVT.
A follow-up CT on [**2155-1-28**] done due to failure of the edema to resolve showed no change in the fluid collection.
The patient had a left subclavian Port-A-Cath removed on [**2155-1-29**] after which the swelling seemed to decrease.
