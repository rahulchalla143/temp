HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 16762**] is a 73-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for CAD, status post three vessel CABG in 3/00 with non Q wave MI in [**7-29**], status post proximal LAD OM1 stenting with PTCA of the left circ, also with metastatic renal cell cancer status post bilateral nephrectomy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.
Cardiac catheterization showed the following:  Inferolateral inferior hypokinesis, EF 45% with an LVEDP of 24, proximal RCA 100%, proximal LAD 80% with diffuse distal disease, 80% D1, 30% proximal circ, 50% mid circ with 70% OM1.
The patient had a TTE [**2164-4-27**] which showed left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement, EF 20-25%, continues to have minimal anginal symptoms and was referred for an exercise mibi on [**2164-4-30**] for preoperative evaluation.
Nuclear images showed inferior apical lateral partially reversible perfusion defects with global hypokinesis in the context of preoperative for right nephrectomy he underwent elective cardiac cath [**8-17**] and [**8-20**] which showed an LVEDP of 30 mmHg, severe native three vessel disease, sequential 50% and 70% proximal LAD with small aneurysm proximal to D1, severely diseased D1 with twin LAD up to 95% proximal stenosis, rotablated PTCA stent in origin of the mid C1, left circ 90% proximal, 40% diffuse in the lesions, proximal lesion involving OM1 origin, SVG 100% proximal discrete lesions times three.
Cath [**8-20**], left circ intervention, PTCA stent OM1 with rescue PCA left circ, 70% stenosis distal to proximal LAD stent, PTCA stent of LAD.
An EKG in dialysis showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V1 to V3.
In the Emergency Room the patient had a V fib arrest, cardioverted with 200 joules times one, reverted back to sinus rhythm.
The patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 1444**] cath lab which showed 80% proximal LAD, 60% mid LAD, 90% proximal D1, mid D1 90%, proximal left circ 70%, OM1 90%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD status post three vessel CABG in 3/00, systolic heart failure, recent [**State 531**] Heart Association class II, EF 20-25%,renal cell carcinoma, status post left nephrectomy in [**2153**] with high dose IL-2 for pulmonary mets [**2153**], status post resection of penile recurrence [**2158**], right renal mass in [**2162**], status post IL-2 low dose, acute renal failure secondary to right renal hemorrhage treated with embolization [**3-29**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 96.7, pulse 48-54, blood pressure 116/58, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 100%.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 133, potassium 5.6, chloride 95, CO2 23, BUN and creatinine 72/7.7 with glucose of 146, hematocrit 38.1.
EKG showed 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in 2, 3, AVF, V6 and 1 mm depressions in 1 and also had [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in V1 through V3, status post cardioversion, these elevations somewhat resolved.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit status post a catheterization during which he had PTCA of the LAD, D1, left circ and OM1 with kissing balloons at the left circ and OM1.
At baseline his systolic blood pressure was 90 with very still heart rate in the 30's to the 38's, not responsive to Atropine.
He was brought back to the floor on a Dobutamine infusion with a heart rate of 75/minute, no ectopy and systolic blood pressure of 100-120.
He was thought to need a pacemaker.
Upon return to the floor, the patient's blood pressures became to drop on the Dobutamine.
Ultimately Levophed was started with good blood pressure response.
The patient subsequently had a Swan Ganz catheter placed which revealed PA pressure 57/23 with a wedge in the 17-19 range, maps at this time were 38-74, CVP was 5, FVR was calculated at 437 with a cardiac output of 6.7.
The patient continued with his blood transfusions which stabilized his blood pressure.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient denied any chest pain throughout the entire hospitalization following his interventions.
His EKGs remained unchanged without any evidence of active ischemia in the days after his acute arrest.
Following the transfusion of 18 units of blood and the patient's stabilization, we gave him a pressure support trial.
He maintained excellent oxygen saturations on room air and was able to work with physical therapy without dropping his saturations.
The patient had mild congestive heart failure and fluid overload on chest x-rays which were subsequently improved after hemodialysis throughout the hospitalization.
The patient should have a hematocrit checked on a weekly basis at the outpatient rehabilitation facility and should follow-up with the gastroenterology division within 4-6 weeks for an outpatient colonoscopy on an elective basis.
Questionable aspiration pneumonia with normal white blood cell count and no fevers following extubation.
