CXR revealed RLL consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions.
WBC 17.4, HGB 11.8, Na 121, Cre 0.8.
On [**4-30**], pt desaturated to the the 80s, with BP 180-200, she was placed on BiPaP and transferred to the ICU and ultimately intubated.
Blood cultures from [**4-29**] returned positive for GPCs x2 sets (strep salivaria), for which ID consult obtained, and patient started on vancomycin 1g Q12H, azithromycin stopped.
Cardiology consult was obtained given concern for CHF on CXR and known severe aortic stenosis.
TTE on [**4-30**] was obtained which revealed normal LV function and critical AS (0.2cm).
Repeat TTE on [**5-7**] raised concern for mitral valve vegetation.
An emergent bronchoscopy was performed, while pt was on coumadin and lovenox, which revealed bleeding from the inferior segment of the lingula on teh left, into which 10mL of epinephrine were injectied in addtion to cautery.
An area of exposd vessel was also noted at the carina beween the anterior an lateral subsegement of the LLL was also cauterized.
CXR at that time revealed an effusion on teh right side which was drained via thoracentesis, removing 800cc of yellow fluid.
A urology consult was obtained given hydronephrosis [**2182-4-30**] (R kidney 10.9, left 10.2, with mild hydronephrosis), which recommended monitoring the patients creatinien and consideration of CT ABD/PEVLIS.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-10-28**] there is frequent atrial ectopy.
Gallbladder sludge with wall thickening, which may be secondary to the patient's low albumin.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-10-20**], the left atrial myxoma is no longer present.
[**2182-5-17**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: .
[**2182-5-17**] CT NECK W/O CONTRAST: .
CT Chest showed hemorrhage, atelectasis and evidence of severe COPD.
Sputum cultures grew only yeast which was thought to be contaminant.
Bronchoscopy was performed and showed blood near lingula -> likely from suction trauma in setting of high INR.
Hct was followed and remained stable.
Cultures from OSH grew Strep salivarius sensitive to PCN, and abx switched from Vanc to PCN on [**2182-5-11**].
ID consulted and recommended continuing PCN x 6 weeks with evaluation of oral cavity for abscess.
All blood cx here neg to date.
TTE here showed critical AS with valve area of 0.5 and peak gradient of 151.
Renal u/s showed potential chronic UTI, especially fungal.
Urine cx grew yeast despite foley changes; ID recommended no further treatment as the fungal infection would only return in 14 days after treatment.
LFTs normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51, amylase 238.
Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence of RUQ process, although though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
Head CT showed likely emboli, and MRI showed multiple foci of emboli.
Neurology was consulted and said may need to reassess the need for CT surgery.
