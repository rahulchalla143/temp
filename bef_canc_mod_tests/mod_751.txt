At [**Hospital **] Hospital she was noted to have a saturation of 84% on a nonrebreather.
ABG showed pH of 7.14, and pO2 of 66.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
She had received Lasix that resulted in decrease in her blood pressure to the 140s from the 180s with a good urine output.
Her first CK and troponin were flat.
The patient had a catheterization one year ago that showed as follows:  LAD with a 99% proximal stenosis, circumflex with a 90% discrete proximal stenosis, RCA with a total occlusion in the proximal segment.
She had an echocardiogram one year ago that showed the EF of 15%.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the pulse of 58, blood pressure 132/65.
Vent was at IMV with a rate of 10, tidal volume of 500, FIO2 of 100% and a PEEP of 5.
LABORATORY DATA:  Data on admission revealed the following: Labs at the outside hospital were significant for a CK of 37, troponin of less than 0.2, normal CBC and chemistry, lipase of 347, and amylase of 107.
Upon arrival here, white count was 14.2, hematocrit 37, platelet count 791,000, sodium 134, potassium 4.4, chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 25 and creatinine 1.0 with a glucose of 102, CK 70, troponin 1.8, INR of 1.7 and PTT of 139.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 57 with normal axis and normal intervals with Q wave in three and T-wave flattening in 1, AVL, and V6.
The CKs and troponins were cycled.
She had a peak troponin of 2.6 on the 27th.
She was hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 78% on a nonrebreather.
Medications were limited based on initial hypotension, which gradually improved, such that her blood pressures were in the high 90s to the one teens.
She was weaned off O2 and at the time of discharge the saturations were 95% to 100% on room air.
On repeat x-ray this resolved and sputum cultures were negative for infection.
The patient should have her I&Os monitored closely, as well as her weights with a goal I&O even to negative until she is adequate diuresed.
