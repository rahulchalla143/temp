(Preliminary read) PA/Lateral X-ray (Foot) OSH read: pathologic avulsion fracture of the calcaneus involving the Achilles attachement.
She was further resuscitated with IVF and her potassium was aggressively repleted.
As further work-up, CXR was unremarkable, cardiac enzymes were negative, and pregnancy test was negative.
OSH wound cultures grew Staph aureus and Serratia Marcesans sensitive to levofloxacin so she was swiched to IV levofloxacin on [**8-15**].
MRI showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Trending of hematocrit levels showed no changes; should be monitored to establish future baseline.
