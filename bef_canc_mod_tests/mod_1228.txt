She was recently discharged from a hospital stay for headaches and hypertensive urgency with BP in the 260's systolic.
Of note, she has a history of wide differential between the systolic blood pressure in her left vs her right arm.
During her hospitalization, her blood pressure was controlled with her home blood pressure meds as well as hydralazine.

Physical Exam: Gen: awake, alert, sitting in bed, NAD Neck: no JVD CV: reg rate, SEM LUSB Chest: CTA Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: distal pulses intact  Pertinent Results: [**2166-7-5**] 06:25AM BLOOD TSH-1.5 [**2166-7-5**] 06:25AM BLOOD Cortsol-21.0* [**2166-7-5**] 06:25AM BLOOD Metanephrines (Plasma)-PND .
ECHO [**2166-7-2**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2166-6-30**]: 1.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2166-7-3**]:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
Hypertensive urgency:  On admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 63469**] was found to have systolic blood pressure elevations in the 200's with, of note, large bp differential in her right and left arms.
In the ED, her blood pressure was controlled on a nipride drip.
In the 24 hours following her admission to the CCU team, she continued to have labile BP readings ranging from systolic pressures in the 90's-170's, but was also noted to have good response to antihypertensive medications.
As an inpatient, she underwent a work-up for secondary causes of hypertension which included the following studies: TSH, 24 hour urine metanephrins, random cortisol, MRA of her renal arteries.
(d) Pump: LVEF > 55%.
She was advised that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] may recommend MRA of the neck as an outpatient to further examine the unilateral carotid stenosis.
Her CR remained near baseline (1.2) throughout the hospitalization.
Type II DM:  At time of discharge, blood glucose levels were well-controlled (120's - 130's) on Glipizide alone.
AAA 3.6 x 2.9 cm, with dissection at level of celiac artery.
You have been started on a regimen on three medicines for your blood pressure.
With your visiting nurse, you should learn how to monitor your own blood pressure at home.
3) You are scheduled for a renal angiogram to be performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 487**].
