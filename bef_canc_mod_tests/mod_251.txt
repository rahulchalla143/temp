[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depressions in V4 through V6.
The patient subsequently went for cardiac catheterization which found occlusion of saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with widely patent saphenous vein graft to diagonal and OM.
Hematology - On admission, the patient had a hematocrit of 32.0 which decreased to 28.0 with hydration.
The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells with increased hematocrit to 32.0.
Anemia laboratories were sent which showed a low iron, low TIBC and high ferritin consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Vitamin B12 and folate levels were both within normal limits.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at 32.9 at the time of discharge.
The patient's Lipitor was discontinued with resolution of transaminitis at the time of discharge with an AST of 34 and ALT of 60.
