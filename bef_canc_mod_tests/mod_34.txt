pCXR [**1-2**]: 1.
Abd ultrasound [**1-3**]: 1.
Echo [**1-3**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CTA chest [**1-5**]: 1.
Hilar lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive.
If the patient has a known malignancy, a one-year followup is recommended or comparison with prior CT scans.
He underwent an echo [**2155-1-3**], which showed EF of 70%, so likely diastolic CHF.
D-dimer was elevated so CTA chest was performed and negative for PE.
Cardiac enzymes showed flat CK and trops, slightly elevated to 0.03 in setting of hypoxia.
ACE-I was started and BP has been well controlled on Lisinopril.
His neuro exam was wnl.
Requires O2 at all times.
Your oxygen levels were noted to bee too low and you will therefore require home oxygen therapy.
Two small nodules were discovered on your CT scan.
We recommend a stress test to be done as an outpatient to evaluate your arteries in the heart.
