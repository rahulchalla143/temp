On [**2106-2-16**], she was noted by her family to be unresponsive at the rehabilitation facility except to painful stimuli, hypoxic and febrile to 104.6 F., tachycardic and tachypneic.
On [**2106-2-19**], her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ceftazidine and on [**2106-2-21**], the antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia - antibiotics directed per sensitivities.
Her right arm was also found to be swollen and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed which noted a clot it the cephalic vein.
The patient's monitor revealed asystole.
After approximately five minutes of additional CPR (15 to 20 minutes total), the monitor revealed ventricular fibrillation.
Following this, the patient was noted to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with a systolic blood pressure in the 110s and a palpable carotid pulse.
Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic ( ejection fraction of greater than 75% ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, vital signs were temperature 102.4 F.; pulse 119; blood pressure 106/46 (on Dopamine at 5 mics per kg per minute).
LABORATORY:  On transfer, hematocrit 28.2 decreased from 32.3.
White blood cell count 36.9.
Platelets were 149,000, decreased from 323,000 on [**2-23**].
Coagulation studies demonstrated PT and PTT of 16.6 and 72.4 respectively.
Sodium is 156, potassium 5.7, chloride 117, bicarbonate 27, BUN 65, creatinine 1.7, calcium 8.8, phosphorus 6.6, magnesium 2.9 (labs obtained during code).
ALT 24, AST 68, CK 16, alkaline phosphatase 214, total bilirubin 3.8 (falling from 6.1).
Troponin I was less than 0.3.
An arterial blood gas obtained during the code demonstrated 7.16/73/225.
Labs on discharge are:  White blood cell count 19.2, hematocrit 23.7, platelets 98,000.
Sodium 145, potassium 4.1, chloride 108, total bicarbonate 23, BUN 67, creatinine 1.1, glucose 99.
Calcium 8.8, phosphorus 4.0, magnesium 2.2.  NOTABLE STUDIES:  Post code EKG demonstrated reversed on leads of I and AVR.
Next study [**2106-3-2**], abdominal ultrasound demonstrated no interhepatic bile duct dilatation.
CT scan on [**2106-2-16**]:  There was no central pulmonary embolism.
CT scan of the head on [**2106-2-16**], demonstrated minimal mucosal thickening present in the right maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells; otherwise there was no acute processes noted.
On [**2106-2-19**], right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of cholecystitis.
On [**2106-2-24**], upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated an occlusive thrombus within the right cephalic vein.
NOTABLE MICROBIOLOGY:  All blood cultures taken were negative for growth.
Sputum from [**2-18**] was significant for Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus.
IMPRESSION:  Miss [**Known lastname 96805**] is a 77 year old female with end stage metastatic ovarian cancer complicated by obstructive uropathy, small bowel obstruction and liver and lung metastases, re-admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with likely hypoxic cardiac arrest and possible sepsis.
She was intubated during the code and remained intubated with decreasing levels of mechanical ventilatory support.
Her thrombocytopenia improved to the point that a tracheostomy was still considered high risk, but was pursued after discussion with the family.
During the next several days, she was intermittently on vasopressor support for systolic blood pressures in the low 80s, not responding to Crystalloid.
The patient's examination and vital signs were consistent with a distributive shock physiology.
On [**2106-3-4**], a core sintropium stimulation test was performed which demonstrated a pre-stimulation level of 17.5, with a 30 and 60 cortisone level of 16.1 and 15.4, respectively.
After initiation of the hydrocortisone on [**2106-3-5**], the patient's blood pressure continued to rise and was elevated to systolic blood pressures in the 190s and diastolic blood pressures in the 90s.
The patient's blood pressure responded to Lopressor intravenously and this medication was titrated up to effect.
Her steroids were increased to previous levels and she did not tolerate the weaning with the increase in her temperature as well.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Fever - the patient was cultured upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2106-3-1**], including blood cultures with fungal isolators, chest x-ray, urine cultures, sputum cultures with Gram stain.
Sputum was positive for Gram positive cocci, likely Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Repeat sputum cultures from [**3-4**] and from [**3-6**] demonstrated no growth of the Staphylococcus aureus.
Blood cultures from [**3-1**] and [**3-6**], including fungal isolators on [**3-1**], were negative for growth.
Urine cultures continued to be negative.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**3-2**], to explore an intra-abdominal source for her fevers.
This study was negative also.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**3-4**] and her temperature curve was followed.
Sputum, blood and urine culture at this time.
Sputum was positive for multiple organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, three types of Gram negative rods and yeast.
Chest x-ray performed on [**3-18**], demonstrated no infiltrates or evidence of pneumonia.
Her urine from [**3-16**] was also positive for Gram negative rods, speciated Klebsiella pneumonia, pan resistant except to meropenem and Zosyn.
The Foley catheter was changed and urine was resent.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**3-2**], demonstrated multiple fluid collections surrounding the porta hepatis and medial aspect of her liver consistent with her known metastatic disease.
Her INR was elevated as well to 1.8 which corrected with the administration of Vitamin K.  Her last INR on [**3-15**] was 1.1.
A HIT antibody was sent and was negative.
Her transfusion threshold was a hematocrit of less than 21 during this admission in the Intensive Care Unit.
The blood loss was likely secondary to GI losses, known occult blood positive NG tube suction contents, and decreased production from chronic disease.
NEUROLOGY:  Encephalopathy - the patient was followed by Neurology on the Medical Floor as noted in the HPI.
RENAL:  Renal failure - On admission [**2106-2-16**], her creatinine was elevated above baseline at 1.8 (baseline of 1.0).
The etiology was felt to be an obstructive uropathy as CT scan on [**2-16**] demonstrated hydronephrosis in both kidneys.
She continued to have excellent urine output and her creatinine remained stable throughout admission.
On [**3-13**], her creatinine began to trend down and continued to do so until it was 1.1 on the day of discharge.
Hydronephrosis was confirmed on [**2106-3-2**], but abdominal ultrasound.
[**Name2 (NI) **] BUN and creatinine was monitored daily while admitted.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had electrolytes including calcium, magnesium and phosphorus monitored daily as she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition.
She required replacement of her potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus which was accomplished mainly through the TPN.
Her HIT antibody was negative but her platelets continued to rise after discontinuing heparin flushes and subcutaneous heparin (possibly a HIT type 1 reaction).
Sodium chloride 0.9% flush three meals intravenously q. day.
Metoprolol 10 mg intravenously q. four hours; hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 60.
Daily CBC, transfuse for hematocrit less than 21.
