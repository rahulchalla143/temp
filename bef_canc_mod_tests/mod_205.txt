An abdominal CT done on POD 3 showed no evidence of dilated loops of bowel.
No CT finding to explain abdominal pain on this limited non-contrast evaluation.
On POD 4 his creatinine was noted to be rising (highest value on POD 6 of 5.5) Transplant U/S showed minimal simple-appearing perinephric fluid collection, with otherwise normal transplant ultrasound with appropriate arterial and venous waveforms and resistive indices.
Biopsy also performed on [**5-20**] for the rising creatinine, it was determined that the kidney disfunction was a result of donor problems and was not rejection or TMA.
Creatinine has improved to 3.2 on day of discharge with urine output of about 1300cc/day.
