[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test to evaluate for renal insufficiency was within normal limits.
White blood count was not elevated.
Chest x-ray was clear.
All blood and urine cultures were no growth today.

Abdominal CT scan showed no leak or rupture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and there was no retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient's hematocrit was stable at 33 at the time of discharge.
Urine anion gap was positive.
The patient was found to be in acute renal failure on hospital admission with creatinine of 2.3 from his baseline of 0.9.
Renal ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis, which immediately resolved following flushing of the Foley and removal of the mucous blood obstructing the neobladder outlets.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine was 1.2.
