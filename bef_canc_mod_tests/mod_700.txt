ECHO [**2152-7-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-11-26**], the findings are similar.
EKG [**2152-8-9**]: Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-6-2**] atrial ectopy has appeared.
Pelvic ultrasound to further evaluate continues to be recommended.
ADDENDUM: The left lower quadrant cystic structure is unchanged in size and character from the prior CT of [**2151-10-5**].
However, it is new from the CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2149-6-10**].
The lung volumes are still small and the hemidiaphragms are elevated, but the extent of the right-sided pleural effusion has markedly decreased.
Weight gain/abd distention: The differential diagnosis broadly is primary hepatic vs cardiac.
No ascites was noted on a repeat ultrasound on this admission and vessels were patent.
Cardiac causes including MI/CHF were also considered, however, an echo on [**7-21**] showed a normal EF.
She had a good response to these diuretics with her weight decreasing from 112+kg on admission to almost 102 kg.
Diuretics were held when she entered the MICU on [**8-14**] and were restarted the morning of [**8-16**] at which time her weight was 103.5 kg.
Her weight on the morning of discharge was 104.5 kg.
The first EGD showed no intervenable varices but the repeat EGD showed 2 bands of grade II varices and 2 bands of grade I varices and 2 bands were placed.
Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.3-1.7.
Her creatinine remained within this range during most of her admission.
Her creatinine on the morning of discharge was 1.8. .
Pelvic cyst: The patient has a cyst on the broad ligament, previously visualized by CT scan in [**2150**], although this finding is new compared to a CT scan in [**2149**].
CAD: The patient has had a previous CABG and known 3 vessel disease on cardiac cath in [**2151**].
Iron studies revealed that she is iron deficient, and she was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation.
Her hematocrit has remained stable between 24-27.
The abdominal ultrasound study that was performed did not show any ascites.
The abdominal ultrasound also showed a cystic structure in your pelvis that was noticed 2 years ago on a CT study, but was not seen on a study 3 years ago.
The radiologist recommended another pelvic ultrasound in [**7-20**] months to confirm that the cyst is not changing in size.
In addition, the echocardiogram that was performed on [**2152-7-21**] was significant for some diastolic dysfunction.
Followup Instructions: - [**Location (un) 620**] Cardiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1016**], [**9-26**] at 11:30 am - Gynecologist of your choosing  You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on Wednesday, the 16th at 3:00 PM.
