IMAGING / STUDIES: # CHEST XRAY ([**2127-12-27**]): IMPRESSION: Consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia.
# CT CHEST ([**2127-12-28**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive consolidation, which may be chronic, involving primarily the right upper lobe with smaller ground-glass opacities seen in the left upper lobe and right middle lobe and lymphadenopathy.
Bronchoscopy with lavage may be helpful .
# CT CHEST ([**2128-1-2**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
# CXR ([**2128-1-6**]): FINDINGS: Single portable AP radiograph was obtained of the chest.
A CT Scan was done out of concern that there was an underlying mass given his significant smoking history, and out of concern that there would be a need to treat for a post-obstructive PNA.
The CT Chest revealed consolidation without obvious mass in the RUL, however unable to r/o mass.
Sputum Cxs were attempted, however unable to be sent as not able produce phlegm.
His BP remained normotensive--> elevated during his floor course, and thought was that level of insensible losses was high requiring fluid repletion.
He remained afebrile starting HD2, and his white count normalized on HD2--> to mildly elevated on HD3 (11.3).
Repeat set of vitals at the time showed hypoxia to 60s on 3L, increased to low 90s on 100% NRB mask.
ABG done at time showed severe retention of CO2 and acidosis.
Multiple EKGs done which show sinus tach.
Sputum cultures revealed gram positive cocci and GNR on gram stain, but nothing has grown out so far.
A sputum culture with cytology showed no malignant cells.
A Chest CT was repeated to look for empyema or other cause of worsening ventilatory status which showed progression of right sided PNA with cavitation in the right upper lobe and progression of consolidation in the right lower lobe.
He was diuresed and underwent bronchoscopy on [**1-3**] which showed some purulent sputum which was suctioned and cultures were sent.
He will need repeat imaging and follow up with pulmonary in [**1-15**] weeks as an outpatient.
Head CT without acute process.
Upper extremity u/s revealed superficial thrombophlebitis involving the left cephalic vein with no deep venous thrombosis present so his PIV was pulled and heat packs/elevation were started.
Plans were made for repeat chest imaging, pulmonary outpatient appointment, and repeat bronchoscopy in [**3-17**] weeks.
# HTN: He was initially hypertensive but his BP was better controlled after starting HCTZ.
# Anemia: His Hct trended up after he was transferred to the floor and was 30.7 on the day of discharge.
# Followup: -- No pending labs or reports -- Followup appointment with his PCP scheduled one week after discharge -- Followup in Pulmonary clinic on [**2128-2-5**] -- Repeat chest imaging and bronchoscopy will be needed to guide further treatment   Medications on Admission: None   Discharge Medications: 1. hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
START: Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (Augmentin) 875 mg by mouth twice daily  Your blood pressure was found to be elevated during your stay and you were started on the blood pressure medication Hydrochlorothiazide.
It is very important that you keep this appointment to set up repeat imaging and guide your future treatment.
