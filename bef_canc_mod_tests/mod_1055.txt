There were no preceding symptoms of vision changes, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, palpitations, recent fevers or chills.
Physical exam at that time was notable for BP 132/60 and P82, with no focal neurologic deficits.
Upon evaluation by EMS, his vitals were BP 140/60 P 36 RR 16 O2 100% on room air.
His EKG showed complete heart block with intermittent pacer capturing.
He was administered atropine 0.5mg once, with transient rise in his heart rate to 72, subsequently returning to 20's-30's.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were T 98 P 28 BP 119/52 RR 18 100% RA.
His physical exam was unremarkable aside from bradycardia.
Review of systems is positive for stroke and TIA.

Vincents ([**Hospital1 1559**])  Social History: He quit smoking ~40 years ago, but intermittently smoked for ~20 years sometimes heavily (3ppd).
Family History: Non-contributory   Physical Exam: T98 P28 BP 119/52 RR 18 O2 100% room air (pre transvenous pacer) General: Pale but well appearing elderly man in no acute distress HEENT: RIJ with transvenous pacer in place, moist mucous membranes CV: Regular rate S1 S2 no m/r/g Pulm: Lungs with few crackles at left base that persist after coughing Abd: Soft, +BS, nontender Extrem: Warm, trace ankle edema bilaterally.
2+ radial pulses, 1+DP, 2+ PT pulses Neuro: Alert and oriented, somewhat tangential speech but re-directable, no gross deficits, moving all extremities  Pertinent Results: EKG left axis, Complete heart block with occasional pacer capture, ventricular rate approximately 36bpm, atrial rate ~130, inverted T's  2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**4-15**] demonstrated: EF 50% mildly dilated LA, 1+ MR, 1+AR, trivial TR.
PA systolic BP could not be estimated on this study.
ETT performed on [**4-15**] demonstrated: reached 77% predicted HR on [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol, stopped secondary to fatigue, no anginal symptoms.
LABORATORY DATA: CBC: 8.0 > 35.8 < 271 Chem: 142/4.4/105/29/18/1.6<155 INR 1.0, PTT 34.9 CK 61, MB not done, Tropn<0.01  CXR SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable and within normal limits.
A dual-lead right-sided pacer is in place with unchanged appearance of pacer wires.
A left perihilar opacity seen on the previous exam is no longer visualized and may have represented loculated pleural effusion.
Pump: EF 50% with history of diastolic heart failure, clinically euvolemic.
