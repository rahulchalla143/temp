Pigtail drains were placed in the retroperitoneal abscess and VATS was performed to debride the empyema.
Cultures from the residual pleural effusion and retroperitoneal mass were negative at that time.
A CXR showed the known RLL effusion as well as a possible new infiltrate in lingula.
BNP was 1100, TnT was 0.17, and INR 2.5.
Given the possible PNA, he was treated with azithromycin 500mg plus ceftriaxone 1g IV for CAP and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by Thoracic Surgery here.
Given his ongoing somnolence, an ABG was done which showed significant hypercarbia (pH 7.29 pCO2 94 pO2 81 O2Sat 95%).
Given his history of PE, a CTA was done which showed no PE and stable to improved RLL infiltrates.
A CT of the head showed no bleed or process to explain his respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction ([**4-/2181**])with CABG in [**2182**] - Atrial fibrillation - Moderate aortic insufficiency - Moderate mitral regurgitation - Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45% nuclear study [**2186**] - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - GERD - Prostate cancer [**Doctor Last Name **] score 6 - Hypothyroidism - Bilateral ankle edema - Kidney stones - Right retroperitoneal abscess and right empyema, which grew Pantoea spp (a beta lactamase producing, Gram negative, Enterobacter-like bacteria) which was resistent to cefazolin and ampicillin, but sensitive to fluoroquinolones.
Past Surgical History: - CABG [**2182**] - Permanent pacemaker placement [**2183**] - Left thoracotomy with total lung decortication ([**Hospital1 18**] [**2183-12-5**]) - Left thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy and drainage of pleural fluid ([**Hospital1 18**] [**2183-11-10**]) - Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs - Bilateral total knee replacements - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  Social History: The patient is a retired tool and dye maker; he worked around chemicals but no asbestos.

Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year-old man with s/p recent VATS and drainagae of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib, admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology of the patient's respiratory failure is thought to be multifactorial, with likely aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of the patient's underlying lung abnormalities (right pleural effusion, PE, retroperitoneal abscess) and hypothyroidism (TSH 35) all contributing.
Repeat videoswallow study in [**1-4**] weeks either as an outpatient.
Admission CTA showed no further PE.
-He must bridge to an INR of 2.0 -lovenox 80mg sc bid until then .
His cardiac enzymes were cycled without elevations, and he was monitored on telemetry without events.
While you were in the ICU you were on antibiotics and your Coumadin was lowered to 2mg,  we restarted your home dose of 5, however your INR was low at 1.6.
This is only until your INR is greater than 2 as checked by your VNA.
