A cervical collar was applied to the patient and he was sent orthopedics the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room for further evaluation.
A CT scan in the Emergency Room was positive for a grade three high grade C7-T1 bilateral pedicle fracture with subluxation of C7 anteriorly onto T1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pertinent for cardiomyopathy with the left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
The records indicate a history of increased PSA and that the patient refused further workup at the time of discovery of the elevated PSA.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 99.2.
Blood pressure 183/44.
Respiratory rate 17.
There were no cervical nodes and trachea examination was further deferred due to the presence of a hard cervical collar.
Chest and lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion.
Abdominal examination showed the bowel sounds to be present in all four quadrants, nontender, nondistended abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly.
Neurological examination revealed the patient to be awake, alert, conversant and oriented times three with fluent speech and the smile was equal and tongue was midline.
The strenght of the bilateral deltoids were [**4-22**], biceps [**4-22**], triceps 4+/5 bilaterally equal.
Wrist extensors and finger flexion grasp was [**4-22**].
Interosseous was 4+/5 bilaterally equal.
Sensory examination was intact to light touch and pin prick and two point discrimination throughout.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally equal in the arms and legs with the exception of mildly diminished, but equal 1+ deep tendon reflexes at the Achilles and the plantar responses were down going bilaterally.
Rapid alternating movements showed finger to nose and heel to shin all within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 18.1 with 93.1 neutrophils, 4.4 lymphocytes, 2.2 monocytes, .1 eosinophils and .1 atypicals.
The hematocrit was 36.6, platelets 223, coags were within normal limits with an INR of 1.2.
His electrolytes were within normal limits, BUN 31, creatinine 1.6, glucose 125.
A type and screen showed O positive blood with a negative screen.
CT scan of the cervical spine showed a positive wedge compression fracture of the body of T1 and bilateral pedicle fractures of C7 with anterior subluxation of C7 and T1 grade 3 consistent with a high grade subluxation.
The plain C spine films showed a malalignment of C7-T1 with the body of T1 not well seen and the posterior displacement of the spinous process evident.
The blood pressure was 200/70 and the patient emergently was taken for a CT scan to rule out intracranial hemorrhage or massive cerebrovascular accident or a pontine angle hemorrhage.
The cranial CT demonstrated some blood in the bilateral occipital horns and a small amount of convexity traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Due to the improvement in his clinical condition, the ventricular drain was removed and the patient spent the next several days in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit with stabilization of his mental status and he remained hemodynamically stable.
The patient was subsequently discharged to a rehab center with a PICC line in place for continuation of the Vancomycin antibiotic treatment for his positive culture and he was discharged to rehab on the [**2147-12-11**] with follow up to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in the clinic in approximately two weeks time.
