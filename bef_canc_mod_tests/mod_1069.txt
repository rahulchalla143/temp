BP at OSH was 176/64, and a head CT showed a 5x4cm hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe with two hypodensities in the left frontal lobe.
INR 2.04 and she was given 2 u FFP, 10mg vit K, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Here INR was 1.8, got 3 more units of FFP and INR went down to 1.3.
SBP was in the 180's and thus labetolol gtt was started -> bp down to 140's.
Repeat head CT showed stable right parietal bleed (per neurosurgery attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
DVTs (multiple) on coumadin, INR difficult to control per daughters, recent INR was in the range of 4.

Right hilar fullness, which may indicate lymphadenopathy.
Blood layering in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] has been resorbed.
The area of hemorrhage is identified in the right posterior temporoparietal region as seen on the CT of [**2122-7-17**].
Neurological: Intracranial hemorrhage: The neurological exam at admission was significant for a left homonomous hemianopsia and mild left leg weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern.
CT showed an intracerebral hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe with some surrounding edema.
Repeat head CT 6 hrs later is stable, without signs of enlargement, hydrocephalus, or shift.
MRI of the head with and without gadolinium did not demonstrate a mass, but follow-up MRI in [**5-13**] weeks was recommended to re-evaluate once hemorrhage has partially resorbed.
An EEG showed no epileptiform discharges but was remarkable for mild encephalopathy.
Her blood pressure goal was <140 SBP.
The supra therapeutic INR was decreased by multiple units of FFP and Vit-K.
Peripheral blood flow cytometry study revealed involvement by a CD5 positive, CD23 positive, CD20 (dim) B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immuonphenotypically consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
There was no recommendation for treatment at the present time, however, WBC count will be followed as an outpatient.
Pulmonary: Chest XR on admission demonstrated hilar fullness which was concerning for mass.
A CT-chest showed no evidence for pulmonary or hilar masses.

Please have your electrolytes checked at rehab (K and Mg).
You will also need a MRI abdomen with gadolinium to look at the kidney as this could not be scheduled while you were in the hospital.
