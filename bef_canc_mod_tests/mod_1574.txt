Admission Date: [**2170-5-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2170-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-12-30**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes type 2 with last hemoglobin A1C in [**7-/2169**] of 11 percent who was in his usual state of health until the morning of admission when he noticed that his blood glucoses were abnormally high in the 500 to 550 range and that he felt nauseated.
At the outside hospital he continued to have dry heaves and CK was 13.13, MB was pending, AST 174, ALT 174.
The patient's EKG at the outside hospital revealed an isolated Q wave in Lead III and ST elevations in V1 through V3.
CK at the [**Hospital3 **] initially was 2200 with an MB of 200 and troponin 6.1.
EKG was unchanged from prior at the outside hospital.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes; most recent hemoglobin A1C in [**7-/2169**] was 11.
Blood pressure medicines that are unknown at time of    admission.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 13.7, hematocrit 36.4, platelet count 196, neutrophils 92, 5 lymphs, 1.6 monos, 0.4 eos.
Coags:  13.8 for PT, PTT 22.1, INR is 1.3, CK 2289, MB 200, index 8.7, troponin 6.17.
Lytes:  136 for sodium, potassium 6.5, chloride 96, bicarbonate 30, BUN 51, creatinine 2.2, glucose 150.
EKG:  Sinus rhythm, 88, normal axis, normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevation V1 through V3, 0.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions V5 and V6, Q waves in Lead III, evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial abnormally.
Chest x-ray is consistent with congestive heart failure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vitals are as follows: Temperature is 98.2, blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate is 12, patient is satting at 96 percent on 3 liters.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1, normal S2, and positive for S3, pulmonary bibasilar crackles, right greater than left; no rales.
He had a right heart coronary angiography, rotablator, and drug-eluting stent of proximal mid left anterior descending.
Patient's cardiac output was 4.6, index 2.16.
His pulmonary capillary wedge was 10, PA pressure 27/12, mean was 19, and the results of the catheterization were as follows:  Left anterior descending 90 percent proximal long, 70 percent mid, diffuse disease distally up to 80 percent first diagonal, 70 percent proximal, 90 percent distal of the left circumflex, and 99 percent PDA bifurcating obtuse marginal 1 with 80 percent upper branch and 70 percent lower branch, right coronary artery 100 percent origin, probably nondominant.
Patient also had an intraprocedure echo performed which revealed a depressed ejection fraction at approximately 20 percent with a relative preservation on inferolateral wall.
Patient's hematocrit dropped to 32.9, had been 36.4.
Chest x-ray was performed which revealed no congestive heart failure with patchy infiltrates.
He was taken to the Catheterization Lab for a re-look which revealed that all stents were patent, and at that time he was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump.
His status overnight worsened and patient's hematocrit dropped to 23.7.
He received four units of packed red blood cells, four units of fresh frozen plasma, one bag of platelets, 10 units of vitamin K.  Had a CT which was positive for right-sided intrapleural hematoma as well as an extra pleural hematoma.
On further view of the CT films it became evident that the patient had a cracked rib.
His blood pressures remained mildly hypertensive to normotensive.
Patient's creatinine bumped to 3.6 on the Natrecor along with p.r.n.
Patient also had a Swan placed as line status and his numbers were as follows:  RV 30, number 12 at 30 cm, pH 139/21 at 42 cm, pulmonary capillary wedge 15 at 53, cardiac output 9.1, index 4.2, and SVR 413.
Patient's cardiac output and index continue to improve on antibiotics and by date of transfer his cardiac output was 6.2, index 2.89, SVR 890.
His creatinine remained stable.
The patient's electrolytes were kept off.
Patient had minimal drainage at these chest tubes and in the setting of a mild decrease in hematocrit, a noncontrast CT was obtained.
His creatinine bumped to a high of 3.6 felt likely secondary to overdiuresis as well as sepsis.
Lines:  Patient's lines at time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit included a right art line, right-sided Swan, and a left IJ.
Infectious Diseases:  Patient, in the setting of hypotension and elevated cardiac output, as well as decreased SVR and sepsis, blood cultures were sent off which, by time of transfer, were no growth to date.
Patient also had a urine sent off which was no growth.
A sputum culture was consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Patient also had a stage 2 decubitus ulcer on his coccyx which were managed with DuoDerm as well as air mattress.
