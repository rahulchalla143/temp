In the emergency department at [**Hospital **] Hospital, her initial vital signs were 97.2 F, heart rate 109, blood pressure 139/86, respiration 18, and oxygen saturation at 99%.
She was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
MRI showed a left parafalcine mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.6 F, pulse 97, blood pressure 115/68, respiration 22, oxygen saturation 98% (ventilator setting AC, TV 500, RR 16, PEEP 5, and FIO2 60%) GENERAL:  Intubated, sedated SKIN:  No rashes or skin breakdown HEENT:  ETT in place, neck supple CARDIOVASCULAR:  RR, NL S1S2 no S3S4 MRG PULMONARY:  CTAB anteriorly ABDOMEN:  She has diminished BS, soft, NTND, no masses or HSM, no stigmata of chronic liver disease LIMBS:  No lower extremity edema, + dorsalis pedis pulses  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
Her muscle strengths are [**2-11**] at proximal right upper extremity and 4-/5 distally in right handgrip.
Her reflexes are 3+ at the right upper extremity, 2- in the left upper extremities, 3+ at the right knee, and 2- at the left knee.
Sensory examination is notable for decreased touch in right lower and right upper extremities.
Coordination examination reveals dysmetria commensurate with her weakness on the right side.

EEG [**2118-7-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, which are much more prominent than the previous day's recording, with occasional brief periods of generalized suppression.
EEG [**2118-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, similar to yesterday's recording with occasional brief periods of generalized suppression.
EEG [**2118-7-8**]: PENDING  EEG [**2118-7-11**]: PENDING  CT-Head [**2118-7-4**]:  Slightly limited study secondary to patient motion, nevertheless with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Portable CXR [**2118-7-4**]:  An endotracheal tube is new and ends ~3.7 cm above the carina.
Lung volumes are low and note is made of left retrocardiac atelectasis.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] with & without Contrast [**2118-7-9**]: 1.
However, there is no gross change noted in the size and appearance compared to the prior studies of [**2117-10-6**].
This was seen on the series 11, image 9 of the study done on [**2117-10-6**].
Attention on followup studies can be considered.
CT Head without contrast [**2118-7-10**]: 1.
EEG showed diffuse encepahlopathy (though initially concern for persistent seizure) and after a prolonged trial after propfol the patient awoke.
(1) Seizures and Altered Mental Status:  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with seizures thought to be secondary to subtherapeutic levels of levetiracetam, however serial EEGs showed no electrographic evidence of seizure.
She was monitored for DVTs while inpatient and given heparing SQ TID.
