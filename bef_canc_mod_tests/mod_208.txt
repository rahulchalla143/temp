MICROBIOLOGY: [**2158-2-17**] BAL: no bacterial growth, no [**Month/Day/Year 14616**], no PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB, no CMV **All blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative** .
IMAGING: [**2158-2-13**] CT SINUS: Bilateral sphenoid sinus, frontal sinuses, and ethmoidal air cell mucosal thickening.
[**2158-2-13**] CT CHEST: Progression of bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions concerning for progression of pneumonia.
[**2158-2-21**] TTE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Chest CT on [**2158-2-13**] demonstrated bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions concerning for progression of pneumonia.
As ANCA returned moderately positive (see below), patient underwent bedside bronchoscopy on [**2158-2-17**] to rule out bronchial or alveolar hemorrhage.
Bronchoscopy revealed erythematous airways but no obvious hemorrhages.
BAL was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], AFB, CMV, fungus or micro-organisms.
Unfortunately, during a speech and swallow evaluation the following day, he had a significant aspiration event, which shortly required reintubation secondary to respiratory distress.
He underwent another speech and swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate POs  He was stable on room air at discharge.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Mr. [**Known lastname 18118**] baseline Cr was 2.4 as he is s/p renal transplant ([**2153**]) and his creatinine slowly increased during his admission, with Cr peak at 5.4.
The renal transplant team followed the patient closely during his hopsital course, monitoring his renal function and immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate.
Tacro levels were checked daily and adjusted accordingly.
Pt's urine sediment was consistent w/ ATN showing muddy brown casts but no acanthocytes indiciative of glomerular injury.
Cardiology was consulted to determine whether patient could safely go off [**Date Range **]/[**Date Range **] for biopsy but given pt's multiple cardiac risk factors and severe CAD, he was kept on [**Date Range **]/[**Date Range **], with only SC heparin being held for the biopsy.
Biopsy was consistent with ATN without evidence of Wegener's or rejection, but final pathology is pending.
Creatinine started to trend down after peak of 5.4 on [**2-16**] and was 3.7 at discharge.
He should continue to have creatinine monitored as well as tacrolimus trough (weekly) and should follow-up with renal as an outpatient.
A STAT head CT revealed an infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory, that was likely several days old per radiology without mass effect, midline shift or hemorrhage.
Neurology was consulted who felt the patient's exam was out of proportion to the size of the infarct and that his mental status changes could be secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
Neurology also recommended repeat TTE w/ bubble study which showed no LV or atrial thrombus and no clear PFO although this was a limited study.
He will be discharged on coumadin with INR goal 2.0 - 3.0 and should continue to have coag panel monitored .
He had several negative stool cultures and Cdiff tests.
#Abdominal Wall Hematoma: On transfer from the unit to the medical floor, it was observed that the patient complained of significant pain on palpation of his RLQ (location of renal graft).
Renal US was performed and was initially read as a renal hematoma w/ concern for ?renal aneursym.
Transplant surgery recommended a CT scan which revealed that the hematoma was actually an abdominal wall hematoma with concern for active bleeding from R inferior epigastric artery.
He was transfused PRBC and his Hcts remained stable.
He underwent CT sinus on [**2158-2-13**] revealed sinus air cell tickening.
