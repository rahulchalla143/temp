Repeat ABG showed resolution of acidemia.
# Hyperglycemia/Insulin Dependant Diabetes:  Pt had a blood glucose of 547 upon transfer to the MICU as well as an AG of 36.
The patient had no clear source of infection (clinically afebrile with negative blood cultures and negative abdominal CT and CXR).
Leukocytosis was most likely in association with DKA.
=================== TRANSITION OF CARE: - Pt had leukocytosis during hospitalization, no suspected infectious focus: please recheck CBC at PCP appointment, and follow up blood cultures - Pt needs more diabetes education (possibly reusing lancets for fingersticks)  Medications on Admission: INSULIN PUMP (HUMALOG INSULIN) MOEXIPRIL [UNIVASC] - 15 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day SIMVASTATIN ASPIRIN [BABY ASPIRIN] MULTIVITAMIN WITH MINERALS PYRIDOXINE [VITAMIN B-6]   Discharge Medications: 1. moexipril 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
You were admitted to the hospital with high blood sugars (diabetic ketoacidosis).
Your white blood cell count was also higher than normal, but we found no sign of infection and your white blood cell count has decreased over the past two days.
