ECG was unchanged from prior.
Her bp was in the 80s/40s and she was begun on neosynephrine.
CXR showed low inspired lung volumes but no clear [**Month/Year (2) **] edema.
BPs rose after 200cc fluid and 300 rinseback given.
EKG post hemodialysis showed ST depression in V3-V6?
Around this time the patient was noted to have an enzyme leak with trop 2.54 (was .34 before), Ck 2064 (was 306),  MB 127 (was 11).
During hemodialysis pt went into atrial fibrillation, hr to 150s and sbp to 47.
A subclavian line was placed and swan showed PCWP of 28, CVP 18, PAS/PAD 55/34 and Co/CI  5.2/2.65 and estimated SVR 761.
A GB u/s showed no evidence cholecystitis and no ductal dilitation but showed a dilated GB.
This was eventually weaned off and the pt ran SBP in the low 100s.
However, during HD she frequently became hypotensive and levophed was again started for a few hours to maintain her SBP over 100.
Since [**8-6**] vasopressin was used in the peri-HD stage to maintain her BP because of concern of possible bowel ischemia.
Her CXR showed CHF vs possible pneumonia which was treated with vanco/zosyn.
She had significant SOB and CXR evidence of CHF along with b/l pleural effusions.
Tagged RBC scan was unrevealing.
Her Hct remained stable for the week prior to d/c though she continued to be guaiac positive.
She again required transfusion (3u) and was taken to colonoscopy which demonstrated a 4mm sessile polyp that was not removed.
However, when orthopedics took out the staples on her leg wound, the wound dehisced and the internal hardware was open to the environment.
This problem was exacerbated by the fact that her BP could only be taken on her L forearm as she had a PICC line in her R upper arm and a fistula in her L arm.
Multiple different strategies were employed to keep her BP above 85 on the floor including frequent NS boluses, PRBC transfusions, and alterations to the amount of fluid taken off during HD.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] consulted on the patient and an ECHO was obtained to evaluate her heart.
Her LV and RV function were improved since her last echo but she had severe MR and AS on ECHO.
She had a CT of the chest to look for PE/mucous plugging that may have accounted for the PEA arrest.
Her electrolytes were normal.
