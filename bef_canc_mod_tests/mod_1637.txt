PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination prior to paralysis, the patient had a temperature of 102, pulse 100, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/70 and oxygen saturation 100%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, trachea midline.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 7.1, hematocrit 34.2, platelet count 336,000, sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, bicarbonate 28, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 109, prothrombin time 12, partial thromboplastin time 24, INR 1.1, lactate 1.7, free calcium 1.15, lithium 1.1, acetaminophen 25, and serum toxicology screen positive for opiates.
AST was 1,243, ALT 455, alkaline phosphatase 132, lipase 104, calcium 8.8, phosphorous 3.3, magnesium 2.1, CPK 326, vitamin B12 701, folate 7.3, serum osmolarity 298, TSH 2.1, free T4 0.9, digoxin level 2.1, rechecked on [**2159-9-29**] 0.3, and lithium 1.3 on admission, rechecked on [**2159-9-27**] 0.2.
On transfer, white blood cell count was 7.9, hematocrit 30.6, platelet count 335,000, glucose 90, BUN 17, creatinine 0.5, sodium 145, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 32, ALT 91, AST 20, alkaline phosphatase 89, CK 76, total bilirubin 0.2, calcium 8.4, phosphorous 3.8 and magnesium 1.8.
Head CT scan on admission showed evidence of white matter disease, no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chest x-ray the day prior to transfer showed no evidence of consolidation of effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax; there was evidence of osteopenia with no evidence of vertebral compression fractures in the thoracic spine.
A toxicology screen was positive for opiates with an elevated acetaminophen level.
Her liver function tests, APAP and lithium levels were initially elevated, but were followed and trended downward.
Post extubation, she had oxygen saturations in the low 90s.
A chest x-ray was noted to be without evidence of consolidation or infiltrates.
The patient was encouraged to use her incentive spirometer, with improvement in her oxygen saturations.
Her digoxin level was noted to be elevated on arrival and digoxin was held during the course of her hospitalization.
Her CKs were elevated on admission, thought to be secondary to her paralysis and drug overdose.
Her CK/MB was not elevated and her electrocardiogram showed no ischemic changes.
