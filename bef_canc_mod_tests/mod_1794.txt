If clinically indicated, chest CT could be recommended for further evaluation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
His platelet count had dropped from 99 to 61, WBC 8.6 to 3.2 and Hct 32 to 27 at the OSH.
A peripheral smear, iron studies and B12/folate were unremarkable.
HIT was not likely given that patient has chronic thrombocytopenia and the platelet count did not drop to [**2-9**] of what is was originally.
Outpatient chest CT was recommended for follow up.
In addition, his INR was elevated and may be related to impaired synthetic function of the liver given a history of hemachromatosis and cirrhosis.
