# Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli were seen on chest CTA on [**3-1**].
We initiated coumadin 2.5mg on [**3-2**] given an INR of 1.5 and the fact that the patient was on antibiotics.
His INR came back at 1.3.
His dose was then increased to Coumadin 5mg [**3-3**] and his INR went to 1.8.
He received Coumadin 6mg [**3-4**] and his INR went from 2.1 to 3.5 both measured on [**3-4**].
On [**3-6**] his INR was 2.5.
He was then instructed to take Coumadin 4mg daily based on his average dose requirement with instructions to have his INR checked on [**3-8**].
[**First Name (STitle) 437**] based on INR results which will be obtained by VNA and faxed to her office.
Frequent neuro checks showed no change in neurologic status.
The patient had a head CT when his INR became therapeutic which showed no bleed and no changes.
His Cr rose and peaked at 1.4 and improved with hydration back to 1.0.
His Cr remained stable at 1.0 for several days raising the question of whether this is his new baseline.
An MRI from [**12-28**] showed evidence of treated tumor, unchanged.
During his stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 67736**] remained afebrile and his white blood cell count was within normal limits.
