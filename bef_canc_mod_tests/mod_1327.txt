RADIOLOGY [**3-19**] CXR: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old man with now with hypoxia and neurological changes REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
Increased opacification of bilateral lungs which could reflect pneumonia.
... [**3-18**] CT A/P: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There has been interval worsening of the consolidation at the right lung base.
There has been interval decrease in the size of collection at the hepatic resection site which now measures 45 x 61 mm compared to the prior study when it measured 78 x 55 mm.
The stomach, duodenum and loops of small bowel and large bowel appear normal.
Follow-up MR scan is needed to more completely assess this finding.
1.5 cm rounded anechoic structure in the mid pole of the left kidney is not fully characterized given the limitations of the study and likely reflects a simple cyst, and unchanged from [**2167-12-21**].
Color Doppler and pulse Doppler waveforms were obtained.
IMPRESSION:  Subtotal occlusive thrombus and reversal of flow within the main portal vein extending into the right branch, similar to prior exam from [**2169-2-15**].
... [**2-6**] CT A/P: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Small lymph nodes are seen particularly in the mediastinum that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Again noted is a fluid collection at the resection margin.
Limited study secondary to lack of IV and oral contrast.
CT of Abdomen gave the following findings: -Cirrhotic-appearing liver, status post resection of the right [**Month (only) 3630**], with post-surgical appearance of the operative site.
Paracentesis showed WBC [**Numeric Identifier 4395**] with 88% polys with culture growing Coag + Staph aureus.
In summary briefly, he was noted to have rising LFTs and bilirubin prompting a liver ultrasound on [**2-15**] which showed a portal vein thrombus.
Over the past week he had developed acute renal failure with his creatinine rising.
A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
A CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done showing likely aspiration event.
