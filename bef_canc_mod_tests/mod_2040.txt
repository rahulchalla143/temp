Recent Imaging: [**2182-3-26**]: CXR - A dual-lumen right subclavian dialysis catheter and left subclavian central line remain with tips projecting over the junction of the brachiocephalics with the SVC.
[**2182-3-23**]: MRI head - Slow diffusion in the left occipital lobe with subtle enhancement, these findings would indicate subacute infarct.
Diffuse increased signal in the sulci and fluid-fluid levels in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles are indicative of proteinaceous material within the CSF spaces and correlation with lumbar puncture is recommended to exclude infection.
[**2182-3-23**]: MRI C-spine - Since the previous MRI examination, the fluid at the laminectomy site has decreased.
TTE [**3-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**3-18**]: RUQ US - 1.
If there is strong clinical concern for this, then further correlation with HIDA scan should be considered.
[**2182-3-8**]: CTA - 1.
[**2182-3-8**]: CT abd/pel - 1.
[**2182-3-6**]: CXR portable IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe pneumonia.
[**2182-3-4**]: CT Cspine There is left lateral fusion at C6-C7 via pedicle screws and a spinal rod.
A sample of the fluid was sent for various microbiological and biochemical analysis, as requested.
[**2182-2-17**]: MRI C spine: COMPARISON STUDY: [**2182-2-9**] cervical spine MR imaging.
Comparison with the prior study reveals persistent extensive posterior fluid within both the interspinous and paraspinous soft tissues.
[**2182-2-17**]: MRI brain with contrast: CONCLUSION: Unusual tiny areas of high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, more evident on the left side.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-4-15**] 5:51 PM CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please evaluate for interval worsening pulmonary process.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Compared to the prior study, the previously seen left lower lobe consolidation appears smaller.
Again seen are multiple mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes that do not appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement, unchanged from prior study.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are not significantly changed from prior study.
Sludge within the dependent portion of the moderately gallbladder(less distended than previous scan of [**2182-3-16**]).
Further evaluation with HIDA scan could be considered if cholecystitis remains a concern.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-4-18**] 4:01 PM  INDICATION: 70-year-old with multiple medical problems; pneumonia complicated by MRSA, meningitis, PE, and fungemia.
COMPARISONS: CT chest of [**2182-4-6**] and CT abdomen of [**2182-3-8**].
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Persisting left lower lobe consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left.
The abdominal and pelvic viscera are not well evaluated without IV contrast.
Multiple subcentimeter retroperitoneal nodes, none pathologically enlarged by strict CT criteria.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are large acute to subacute hematomas within the iliac muscles bilaterally and left psoas muscle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-4-23**] 12:54 PM INDICATION: 70-year-old with multiple medical problems, MRSA pneumonia, fungemia, followup iliacus and psoas hematomas.
COMPARISONS: CT torso of [**2182-4-18**] and CT torso of [**2182-3-8**].
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Stable size and appearance of hematomas involving the iliacus muscles bilaterally and the left psoas muscle.
IMPRESSION: 1) Stable bilateral iliacus and left psoas hematomas.
This was present on prior CTs, however, appears more prominent on the current study.
5) Limited evaluation of the abdominal and pelvic viscera without IV contrast.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-4-23**] 12:53 PM  [**Hospital 5**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old man with CAD, DM s/p fall complicated by c7 fx, complicated course including MRSA meningitis, CSF leak, MRSA PNA, PE on heparine, Acute renal failure, who is still encephalopathic.
Exam is compared to prior study of [**2182-4-3**].
FINDINGS: The exam is somewhat motion limited.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 8**] ED where he was found to have C spine MRI which revealed a posterior fluid collection from C2 to T1 without evidence of epidural abscess, intraspinal fluid collection or cord compression.
LP done [**2-10**] consistent with bacterial meningitis complicating the wound infection and CSF leak.
The pt also had a CXR [**2-13**] showing LLL PNA, sputum growing out MRSA.
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA brain, repeat LP w/ HSV PCR, echo, and eventually pt was dx with encephalopathy [**1-17**] infection/metabolic.
MRI/A of the brain showed new signal in occipital horns, infection vs. SAH, and MRI Cspine showed persistent, extensive fluid collection in the intra/paraspinous soft tissues, persistent epidural enhancement, mild sc compression along the posterior surface.
Then, on [**3-5**], he started spiked temp 103.6, with all cx (blood, Ua, urine negative, cxr--resolving PNA).
C. diff checked and negative.
He was noted to have a pulm embolism and was started on heparin gtt and transferred to medicine floor team for further management.
Initial ABG 7.43/39/85 and pt CXR not revealing for new infiltrate.
It was thought that this did not constitute a failure of anticoagulation and IVC filter was not pursued at the time.
He was started on CVVH and then HD when his BP stabilized for fluid removal.
Lates Ct Scan chest showed sligly decrease of left lower lobe consolidation.
He had an echo which showed EF of 30%.
Last PMIBI [**1-21**] showing normal Initially Trop 0.12 with CK-MB 6.
TTE did not show evidence of focal WMA.
Suspect component of demand ischemia w/ decreased clearance of enzymes in setting of renal insufficiency.
LDL was low and statin was deffered.
# CHF: EF 30% though to be secondary to sepsis.
BC/UC/Stool cultures have been unrevealing.
Aggressive search for a source of infection was unrevealing which included RUQ US, repeat LP, MRI/CT of C-spine, MRI head, and multiple blood, urine and stool cultures.
Sputum cultures have grown MRSA, but given no definite infiltrate and scant sputum, it was thought more likely to be a colonizer.
After culturing over the next two days and repeat LP without meningitis meropenam was added on [**4-6**] for nosocomial PNA.
Blood cx on [**2182-4-15**] showed [**Female First Name (un) **], patient was started on Caspo and then switch to voriconazol given elevated Alk phoph and LDH.
Repeat LP did not show evidence of continued meningitis.
Head CT did not show evidence of acute hemorrhage.
MRI head showed evidence of a small subacute left occipital infarct.
MRI was attempted 4 times and it was unable to be performed due to cooperation.
Last Ct did not reveal any gross abnormality but was limited [**1-17**] motion adn lac of contrast.
Patient underwent repeat MRI head and C spine.
His impression was that the C7 lesion near the hardware was not worse then before and this would not explain his neuro exam.
# L occiptial infarct:  On repeat MRI of head, L occiptial lesion had persistent T2 hyperintensity and there was concern for abscess.
Neurosurgery was consulted and they recommended continuing antibiotics and a repeat MRI in 4 weeks.
We have been unable to get a new MRI due to lack of cooperation by time of discharged.
Urine sparse for exam but did reveal urine eos and FENA less than 1%.
Urine lytes did initially show pre-renal physiology.
Renal u/s negative for obstructive physiology.
K slightly elevated in last morning labs, 5.5, no EKG changes, kayexalate was given.
U/S done did not show [**Last Name (un) 11498**] duct dilatation, but repeat CT does reveal biliary sludge.
His rash on BUE progressed to blistering lesions which were thought to be due to edema from fuid overload.
Iron studies with likely anemia of chronic disease.
#Iliacus Hematoma/psoas:[**2182-4-19**] Ct abdomen reveal along the iliacus muscle.
HCT remained stable.
[**2182-4-23**] CT abdomen revealed stable hematomas.
He will also continue on Heparin for his PE as his HCT is stable and his repeat CT of his RP bleed is stable.
