At that time, his wife reported that he had no chest pain, nausea, sweating, [**Date Range **], chills, vomiting or dizziness and he was directed to [**Hospital6 33**] for further evaluation.
CXR was negative and pBNP was 3969.
He was also given a dose of IV Levaquin out of concern for infection but his respiratory rate declined and his ABG's demonstrated severe respiratory acidosis so he was intubated in the [**Hospital3 **] ED.
CE's rose with CK's peaking at 229 and Troponin levels peaking at 0.45.

PULSES: Right: DP 1+ Left: DP 1+ NEURO: CNII-CXII intact, able to follow commands, easily conversant, moving all extremities   Pertinent Results: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2141-11-27**]: OSH, EF 45-50%, with aortic valve area of 0.8cm2 and [**1-10**]+ aortic insufficiency.
An eccentric jet of mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2136-5-18**], the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed, mild aortic regurgitation is now seen, left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.

RESISTANCE 214 .
CT Abd/pelvis Noncon [**12-31**] CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Lung bases are clear without consolidation or pleural effusion.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Large bowel demonstrates residual oral contrast material, possibly from the CT of [**2141-12-13**] or from an outside hospital study.
[**1-1**] abd x-ray Single supine portable abdomen radiograph was obtained.
Labs at admission: 9>31.8<142 (WBC peaked at 15.3 on [**12-31**] in the context of steroids) N 90, L7.1, M2.2, E0.6, B0.2 PT 12, PTT 116, INR 1.0 (normalized at discharge) 137/3.8/99/30/25/1.3<171 (Cr peaked at 2.6 on [**12-31**] and was 1.2 at discharge) ALT 46, AST 45, LD 262, CK 124, Alk Phos 48, TB 0.4 (this was peak CK), other LFTS normalized before discharge  Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old man with a complicated history including CAD s/p CABG, PAD, systolic CHF (EF 45-50% in [**10-16**]) w/ diastolic dysfunction, severe COPD, severe AS (0.8cm2) & AI and a severe ventral hernia who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for respiratory failure.
After rapid stabilization of his respiratory status, he went for a cath with PCI with DESx2 to the RCA on [**12-29**].
# Small bowel obstruction Patient has history of severe ventral hernia s/p laparotomy for colon resection and intermittent abdominal pain, last on [**2141-12-13**].
He received a CT ABD with contrast that was negative for SBO at that time.
Surgery followed and his NGT drainage decreased and he started to have BMs on [**1-2**].
His creatinine at d/c was 1.2, at his baseline.
He is on 2L of continuous O2 as well as Albuterol, Advair, and Tiotropium at home and over the past 3 months has required multiple intubations for respiratory distress despite repeated courses of Prednisone & antibiotics, most recently approximately 2 weeks PTA.
He was intubated on [**12-26**] at [**Hospital1 34**] for an ABG of 7.12/91/62/32 and was extubated on [**12-27**] AM to CPAP prior to transfer after improved respiratory status.
By [**12-31**], he was on 2 litres, saturating at 97%.
He was able to tolerate room air with good saturations on day of discharge.
# Systolic Heart Failure   Diasolic Heart Failure   Aortic Stenosis, Severe   Aortic Insufficiency Patient with known systolic heart failure, last EF in [**11-15**] demonstrated EF 45-50% with severe AS (mean gradient 47 mm Hg and area 0.8cm^2) and [**1-10**]+ AR.
CXR's from OSH have not demonstrated e/o congestion or effusions and clinical exam does not support fluid overload, but pBNP was elevated at 3969.
His last cardiac catheterization in [**2138**] demonstrated three vessel coronary disease with a patent LIMA, but occlusion of all vein grafts.
CE's trended down from OSH levels (peak CK 229) and patient was CP free.
# RHYTHM: Patient without known history of arrythmia, but micro-Q waves in II, III, and AvF suggest prior inferior infarct not seen on ECG from 11/[**2140**].
Blood pressures at OSH and in CCU were well-controlled.
His EtOH screen on [**12-26**] at [**Hospital1 34**] was negative and his wife reported that his last drink was on [**12-25**].
ASA 325 and Pentoxyfylline SR 400mg TID were continued.
Iron studies during this hospitalization were normal and he was continud on his home B-12 1,000 mcg daily.
A Cardiac catheterization showed blockages in your arteries which may have made your breathing worse.
You should CONTINUE taking: -Imdur 120mg daily -Metoprolol 25mg three times a day -Tylenol 325-650mg every 6 hours as needed for pain -Albuterol nebs four times a day and every 2 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - Amitriptyline 25mg nightly - Celexa 20 mg twice a dy - Advair 500/50 twice a day - multivitamin daily - trental 400mg three times a day - Seroquel 12.5mg twice a day - Spiriva 18 mcg daily - Fish oil - Vitamin B1 and B12 - Ativan 1mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety.
