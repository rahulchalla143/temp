The pt underwent a TEE to rule out thrombi in the heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and underwent successful cardioversion on [**2111-11-20**].
Pt was feeling unwell, and electrocardiogram showed underlying atrial fibrillation in a fully ventricularly paced rhythm at 60 beats/minute; the right ventricle is paced from the outflow tract.
ICD interrogation showed a low OptiVol fluid index.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 14cm above the RA CARDIAC: irregularly irregular, normal S1, S2.

The imaging appearance would favor postoperative ileus, but early small bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Followup imaging should be considered.
LV systolic function appears depressed.

The beginning of the procedure was complicated by inadvertent arterial puncture x3 in the left groin.
He was supposed to have a PVI which was aborted because of the arterial puncture mentioned above.
His rate remained well controlled during this admission.
He had a cath in [**10/2110**] which showed non-obstructive coronary disease and did not report any chest pain during this admission.
There were no focal neurologic defecits noted, however there was ongoing concern that his mental status was declining and a non-contrast head CT was obtained.
A CT perfusion was obtained which showed no evidence of ischemia.
After the lasix drip was stopped, we slowly added back his home dose of oral lasix as his blood pressure tolerated.
At discharge, his weight is 92.6kg and his volume status is slightly hypervolemic.
CHRONIC CARE #Hypertension - He was hypotensive upon arrival to the CCU and, as above, his Coreg, ramipril and eleprenone were initially held.
#Hyperlipidemia - Continued atorvastatin and Zetia  #COPD - Noted on CT scan prior to admission, not reporting any wheezing at admission.
You underwent direct cardioversion, which was well tolerated and you were returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.
Please note the following changes to your medications: - START dofetilide - START Cefpedoxime for 5 more days - START Potassium - CHANGE carvedilol to 3.125mg twice a day - CHANGE Lasix 120mg each morning; 80mg each evening - CHANGE ramipril to 2.5mg daily - STOP amiodarone - CONTINUE the remainder of your medications as directed  Please be sure to follow up with your physicians.
