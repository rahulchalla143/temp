After the second day of hemodialysis, the patient was transferred to the floor with a creatinine of 3.0; however, the patient was becoming oliguric.
The patient's BUN and creatinine remained the same after 3-4 days of Lasix at this dose; however, the patient's urine output increased remarkably up to 2 L a day.
The patient will need follow-up iron studies in one month as iron studies here remained normal.
If the patient has a weight gain of over 3 lbs and/or urine output is decreasing, the patient may need hemodialysis per the Renal Team.
Ideally his blood pressure should remain above systolic of 100 to maintain renal perfusion.
Cardiovascular:  Of note during his MICU stay, the patient had an urgent cardiac catheterization showing severe jugular venous distension, including lesions in his left anterior descending coronary artery which were severe diffuse disease up to 80 percent in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery.
Of note, the patient has multiple wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram including an akinetic apex.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient has an ejection fraction of 20 percent.
The patient is to continue diuresis upon discharge with a goal of negative 500 to negative 1 L I&Os.
The patient in the Medical Intensive Care Unit had a negative MRI and negative head CT.  Additionally, EEG showed diffuse changes consistent with a broad differential.
Speech and Swallow evaluation was done on the floor which the patient passed and is to be maintained on a pureed diet.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Anemia:  Again the patient needs to have iron studies done in one month, as he is on Epogen.
The patient additionally is to have daily weights check with a goal of another 500 cc negative 1 L initially.
If his weight increases more than 3 lbs, the patient's Lasix dose may need to be increased.
