At OSH, EKG showed afib with RVR and received digoxin and lopressor.
His enzymes cycled and Trop peaked at 0.03 with negative CKs.
Stress on [**12-24**] showed mild fixed apical defect and decreased EF so he was planned for cath on [**12-27**].
Cath on [**12-27**] showed prox LAD calcification with occlusion of D2 and occluded mid RCA.
Echo was perfomed which showed no effusion.
The following day the chest pain had completely resolved and a repeat Echo showed only physiologic effusions.
Because of a hematocrit of 26.1 and his recent cardiac events he was transfused with 1 unit of blood.
