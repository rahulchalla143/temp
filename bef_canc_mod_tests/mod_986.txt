[**2108-12-13**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
Clinical correlation and serial evaluation are suggested.
Pericardial drain placed with initial CI 2.46 up to 3.01 l/min/m2 and RA pressure 18 down to 10 mmHg.
[**2108-12-17**] ECHO Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2108-12-17**] Cardiac MRI Impression: 1.
Pericardial tethering on tagged images is consistent with, but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
His previous episodes were managed at an outside hospital.
On admission, the patient had an Echocardiogram that was suggestive of tamponade but he was hemodynamically stable with IV fluids.
Repeat Echo also showed probable tamponade physiology, and the patient was then taken to the cath lab for further evaluation.
During this hospitalization, a complete workup was done for the cause of the recurrent pericarditis, and now tamponade.
The patient had a slight elevation in his LFTs, but hepatitis serologies were negative.
The patient's TB test was also negative during this admission.
The pericardial fluid was negative by cultures, AFB, and negative for malignant cells on cytology.
Viral cultures were also pending at discharge.
At discharge, his symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain had improved and the patient was able to tolerate activity without difficulty.
A cardiac MRI was done prior to discharge as well.
The patient had a RUQ ultrasound which showed gall bladder wall edema, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
