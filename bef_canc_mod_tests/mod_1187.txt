Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2146-9-21**] Femoral line placement [**2146-9-27**] Hemodialysis [**2146-9-28**] Transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells [**2146-9-29**] Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram [**2146-9-30**] Laminectomy of L5-S1 for removal of epidural abscess [**2146-9-30**] Removal of surgical drain [**2146-10-6**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76-year-old male with no significant past medical history who was transferred from an OSH for 6 weeks of fevers and acute onset lower back pain.
Due to the severity of lower back pain, he presented to MWMC where he was found to have fevers to 102.4 and a leukocytosis of 19.6.
He was also noted to be in renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 (baseline unknown), thus an MRI with contrast was not performed.
He was given ceftriaxone and metronidazole and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the Emergency Department, vital signs were T=102.4 rectally, BP=195/95, HR=122, RR=18, O2sat=97%RA.
Laboratory data was notable for a leukocytosis to 18.6, renal failure with BUN/Cr 40/2.2, anemia with HCT 30, urinalysis with large blood and [**2-17**] RBCs.
A neurosurgical consult recommended an MRI of the L spine.
An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained without contrast, which showed moderate canal stenosis at L4-L5, severe canal stenosis at L5-S1, and impingement of the L5 nerve root by the disc.
A CXR showed mild pulmonary edema with no pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Wheezes were appreciated in both lung fields and CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
EKG was significant for ST depression of <1mm in leads V4-V5.
Serial cardiac enzymes were elevated, ruling the patient in for NSTEMI.
The patient was placed on heparin for 24 hours and metoprolol for blood pressure control.
ACEi, hydralazine, and isosorbide mononitrate was also recommended for blood pressure control, but ACEi was held as pt was in acute renal failure.
Cath was deferred since he was febrile and infected.
TTE was negative and TEE showed an aortic valve vegetation.
MRI L-spine with and without contrast shows pt has multiple epidural abscesses.
He received a WBC scan to look for other sources of infection.

RUQ ultrasound ([**10-3**]): INDICATION: 76-year-old man with epidural abscess, now post-op day #3.
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen of [**2146-9-26**].
Left LE ultrasound ([**10-5**]): INDICATION: 76-year-old man with asymmetric lower extremity edema.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler images were acquired of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, tibial and peroneal veins.
MRI C-T-L spine w/ contrast ([**9-28**]): 1.
Normal overall appearance of the spinal cord and conus medullaris, with no pathologic leptomeningeal, intramedullary or nerve root enhancement.
T2-3: Left paracentral disc protrusion-osteophyte complex effaces the ventral CSF, barely contacting, without indenting, the upper thoracic spinal cord.
MRI Brain w/o contrast ([**9-25**]): 1.
A small focus of negative susceptibility adjacent to the left vertebral artery is of uncertain nature (series 8, image 108) and it is unclear if this relates to the orientation of the vessel or a focus of calcification; less likely a focus of aneurysm and this can be better assessed with CT angiogram.
MRI Brain w/o contrast ([**10-3**]): IMPRESSION: Evolving deep white matter infarcts without evidence for new infarct or other acute findings when compared to the most recent MRI one week prior.
Given the patient's history, it is possible the infarcts relate to underlying infection, and a repeat examination with gadolinium could be considered as indicated clinically to look for evidence of meningitis.
EEG ([**9-27**]): IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in the waking and drowsy states.
Transesophageal echocardiogram ([**9-20**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
An eccentric jet of mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Transesophageal echocardiogram ([**9-30**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**MD Number(1) 71681**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  L5-S1 epidural abscess.
Ultimately the patient underwent an MRI that demonstrated an L5-S1 epidural abscess.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent and preoperative laboratory values were verified, the patient was brought into the operating room and he underwent general anesthesia and intubation without difficulty.
All pressure points were padded.
A lateral x-ray of the lumbar spine was obtained to verify the localization.
The subcutaneous layers were closed with a combination of 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl.
[**MD Number(2) 71682**]  Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 71683**]  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 76-year-old male with a past medical history of benign prostate hypertrophy, gout, and chronic kidney disease, who presented from [**Hospital6 1109**] for workup of 6 weeks of fevers and acute onset of lower back pain.
# Enterococcal Bacteremia / Aortic Valve Endocarditis The patient's subacute history of fevers was concerning for endocartidis, and blood cultures on the day of transfer grew gram positive cocci ultimately speciated as enterocccus faecalis that was vanc/amp sensitive.
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a vegetation on the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
He underwent transesophageal echocardiogram intraoperatively (during the epidural abscess drainage) that showed persistent vegetation on aortic valve, with mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
Blood cultures taken during the last two weeks (since [**9-21**]) have been negative.
Cultures from [**Date range (1) 23927**] are still pending at the time of discharge (they may be followed through Medical Records at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 39110**]).
# L5 Epidural Abscesses The patient's complaint of back pain prompted additional imaging with tagged wbc scan and ultimately MRI with gadolinium that was positive for several small epidural abscesses around the area of L5 with some thecal sac impingement on the right side, and possible L5-S1 discitis.
The patient's neurologic exam was notable for decreased strength left>right in dorsiflexion >plantar flexion.
Tissue and fluid samples were sent for gram stain, culture and pathology, but did not yield the identity of the causative organism (sterile after prolonged treatment with ampicillin and ceftriaxone).
Cardiology has recommended for 2 months of anticoagulation with follow-up in cardiology clinic and repeat transesophageal echocardiogram at that time.
He should begin heparin gtt today titrated to PTT of 60-90, and begin coumadin 5 mg PO today titrated to goal INR of [**1-18**].
# NSTEMI / Demand Ischemic Event The patient was transferred to the medical ICU in the setting of hypertensive emergency with SBPs > 200, pulmonary edema requiring bipap, and a rise in CK/CK-MB/troponin with question of lateral ECG changes/ST depressions.
Echocardiogram showed mild apical hypokinesis.
CXR did not show evidence of pneumonia and patient was asymptomatic.
# Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Disease The patient had a creatine of 2.0-2.5 during recent admission, with baseline estimated at 1.5-low 2s with h/o BPH, h/o TURP and obstructive symptoms.
His creatinine at time of discharge is ~2.0, consistent with previous baseline.
A temporary right femoral line was placed for hemodialysis following the MRI with gadolinium to prevent nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
He underwent EEG that was negative for seizure activity.
He had a brain MRI that showed areas of restricted diffusion in the deep white matter that could represent embolic infarcts.
A follow-up MRI showed evolution of these infarcts but no new lesions.
Overall, his tremors and upper extremity jerks were felt to be secondary to a toxic-metabolic state from the underlying infection.
His hematocrit at time of discharge was 29 and remained stable in the high 20s post-operatively.
A liver US was negative for any pathology.
High-dose statin, which was started in context of troponin leak in the ICU, was stopped in the setting of elevated LFTs as it too may have been a contributing factor.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check patient's CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase at least weekly, and ESR/CRP at least monthly.
Monitor PTT Q 6 hours while on heprain gtt, and INR ~weekly while on coumadin.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital6 **] to the [**Hospital1 1535**] for workup of your six weeks of fevers and your acute lower back pain.
A blood culture showed you were growing bacteria in your bloodstream.
A transesophageal ultrasound showed you had a vegetation on your heart valve (endocarditis) which was likely the source of the bacteria in your blood.
You were started on intravenous antibiotics and subsequent blood tests showed you were no longer growing bacteria in your bloodstream.
MRI of your brain shows several small lesions that may represent bacteria that have traveled to the brain.
During an echocardiogram of your heart, you were found to have a blood clot in your right atrium.
We have made the following changes to your medication regimen: - BEGIN TAKING Ampicillin (last day = [**11-11**]) - BEGIN TAKING Ceftriaxone (last day = [**11-11**]) - BEGIN TAKING Coumadin (last day [**12-7**] or as directed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] - BEGIN TAKING metoprolol for high blood pressure - BEGIN TAKING amlodipine for high blood pressure - CONSIDER TAKING medications to treat constipation, pain, and SOB as needed (these will be provided for you at the rehab facility) - STOP TAKING medications for gout and BPH until directed to do so by your physician(s)  Please keep/arrange the follow up appointments as outlined below.
