At about 1600, he had a straight catheterization after bladder scan showed 350 cc in his bladder.
At about 1700, the patient was found to be febrile to 102.6 with heartrate in the 180s on routine vitals check; his blood pressure at the time was 110/74.
EKG demonstrated ?
Therefore, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
Throughout this time, the patient's blood pressure remained stable in the 110-140s and he was asymptomatic.
For his fever, cultures were sent and he was given a dose of vancomycin as his prior urine culture (from [**9-4**]) has MRSE.
Initial heartrate remained in the 160s and blood pressure transiently dropped to the 90s systolic.

- continue monitoring on telemetry - 2nd set of enzymes with AM labs - consider echocardiogram in the morning - cardiology consulted by urology, will touch base with consult team in the morning for further recommendations - replete electrolytes as necessary .
He does have MRSE in his urine from [**9-4**] and unclear which antibiotic he was treated with prior to admission.

- add on diff to earlier CBC - vancomycin to cover MRSE - given recent instrumentation of the GU tract and ?
of complicated UTI, will also given zosyn - zosyn and vancomycin would also cover potential lung sources of fever - blood & urine cultures pending .
# Hypertension: Will hold usual HCTZ given relative hypotension in this setting.
EKG showed SVT.
The adenosine did break the rhythm and his rate was now 80.
His foley was removed POD 3 and a voiding trial was performed.
