The cath also revealed normal right-sided filling pressures, low-normal left-sided filling pressures with a depressed cardiac index and elevated systemic vascular resistence.
Today, patient developed substernal chest pressure, diaphoresis, received nitro and morphine which dropped his blood pressure, not given aspirin or heparin.

CXR ([**9-28**])- A left subclavian pacemaker is in situ with the tips projected over the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.
Cardiac cath ([**9-29**])- 1.
EKG ([**9-29**])- Ventricular paced rhythm and intermittent intrinsic A-V conduction in the context of background atrial fibrillation  ECHO ([**10-1**])- Severe regional hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
An apical thrombus cannot be excluded, even after the use of contrast.
EF 15%   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with Afib, CAD s/p MI with stenting to RCA, LAD, h/o CHF with biV ICD and EF 15-20% on latest Echo who presented with chest pain taken to cath on [**9-29**], on [**9-30**] patient developed multiple episodes of chest pain which were relieved by nitro SL, overnight patient continued to have chest pain.
CEs on arrival CK=360, MB=57, trop=0.67; repeat CK=635, MB=103, trop=1.63 with suggestion of ST elevation in precordial leads but difficult to interpret in the setting of his LBBB.
Patient was taken to cardiac cath on [**9-29**] where LAD was stented (minimal dye load given).
Angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Previous cardiac cath in [**10/2106**] showed right-dominant system with three-vessel coronary artery disease (90% RCA ostial in-stent restenosis, 50% proximal LCX stenosis, 50% mid vessel LAD stenosis).
Pain was initially described as mild pressure ([**3-20**]) that occurred at rest.
EF 15-20% as per Echo on [**10-1**], and s/p biV ICD.
Was diuresed and weight on discharge 73 kg.
# RHYTHM: underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation with LBBB morphology, now with biV ICD, rate has been 50's-60's SR with few episodes of NSVT.
Now BP is well controlled with BP 90's-120's.
Pt is now on Lovenox, can stop when INR > 2.0. .
# Positive U/A at [**Hospital3 24768**] - OSH U/A showing 2+ leukocytes, 80-100 WBC, + nitrite.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Goal INR 2.0-3.0.
Carvedilol 6.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for SBP < 90, HR <55.
Lovenox 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: 0.7 ml Subcutaneous twice a day: To be given until INR > 2.0, dose is 70 mg [**Hospital1 **].
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed extensive coronary artery disease.
Coumadin 5 mg daily to prevent blood clots and strokes.
Start aspirin to prevent a heart attack 3.
Start digoxin to control your heart rate 4.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
