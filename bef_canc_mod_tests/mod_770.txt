An LP was attempted in IR but she became hypotensive from the afib and was therefore not done.
Her MRI was completed once she was hemodynamically stable and this showed a small infarct which was felt to be the cause of her seizure.
She had a TTE which did not show any thrombus or structural abnormality but the mechanism of her stroke was felt to be secondary to afib.
A TSH and CE had been checked and were normal.
Repeat hematocrit was 21.6, CT abdomen revealed large right sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
A conventional abdominal angiogram was performed, and did not reveal any source of active bleeding.
A second cardioversion was planned but was averted after the paitent returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhtyhm.
A mini-Maze was tentaively planned for 2 weeks post-discharge, with the initial pre-operative evaluation (including MRI of the heart) completed as an inpatient before departure.
She was started on a 3-week course of vancomycin 1 g IV q 12 for treatment of MRSA+ wound culture from the right wrist.
