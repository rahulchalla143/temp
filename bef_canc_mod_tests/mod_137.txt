Pt also received gentle IVF (1L NS), potassium and D50 as her BG was in the 60s and her K was 2.7.

Reports:  CXR [**5-5**] - AP upright and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
CT head [**5-5**] - IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, edema, or fracture.
CT chest [**5-6**] - CONCLUSION: 1.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged since the prior examination and may be assessed further to exclude indolent lymphoma.
Echo [**5-13**] - A small secundum atrial septal defect is present (cine loop #34).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT of head [**5-13**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**5-13**] - IMPRESSION: 1.
Therefore, an MRCP is recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
Bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size since the prior exam.
CXR [**5-22**] - Increased consolidation of left lung, which could be compatible with pneumonia or aspiration.
EEG [**5-25**] - IMPRESSION: Possibly normal EEG in an extremely drowsy patient.
EKG [**6-1**] - Compared to prior tracing irregular sinus mechanism at rate about 55 has replaced atrial flutter.
Pt had a an ECHO in the ICU that showed dilated, hypokinetic RV w/ 4+TR.
Neuro was consulted and EEG showed no seizure activity.
LP was performed w/o evidence of bacterial meningitis, however pt was placed on acyclovir.
HSV PCR was negative and acyclovir was stopped..  Pt has gone in and out of aflutter, but was transfered to the floor in sinus rhythm with 2-3 beat runs of NSVT.
Pt was transfered to the medicine floor on [**2156-5-19**], with vitals of 113/45, 84 (sinus), 20, 99% on 2L.
The differential consists of seizure (EEG x2 did not show seizure activity) or encephalitis (HSV-but PCR was negative, and CSF studies WNL) or a global hypoxia or a metabolic encephalopathy.
Likely cause of mental status changes was multifactorial - including metabolic derangements from kidney and liver disease.
CTA negative for PE.
Echo showed no pericardial effusion or tamponade.
CXR showed worsening pleural effusion and collapse of LLL initially.
Sputum cx was negative.
Pt was monitored on telemetry and had intermitenty ectopic beats, NSVT up to 3 beats, which may have been related to hypokalemia.
Pt then converted to NSR with HRs in 60s.
Prior fluid analysis showed exudative process, w/o identifiable cause, cytology negative as well.
No evidence of liver pathology on any imaging studies.
HD was continued while in pt, pt on Phoslo, and renal labs were closly monitored.
Was on D10W for several days and still had blood sugars in 60s and 70s.
She passed a speech/swallow test and was started on ground food and thin liquids.
Per swallow team, she can have repeat study with her denturs if she is to be made full diet.
Insulin level was low and c-peptide was likely elevated because it is usually cleared by the kidney.
Stool culture was positive for C.diff.
# Megaloblastic anemia: B12 and folate levels are normal, unclear etiology, was monitored and remained stable throughout admission.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO 2X/WEEK (MO,TH) for 2 months.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check phosphate level at [**Hospital1 13241**] on [**2156-6-4**] and fax result to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]: fax ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8387**].
During this your blood pressure became very low and you had to go to the ICU where they kept your blood pressure high with IV medicine and helped you breathe with intubation.
You passed a swallow test and started eating.
You need to keep eating at regular intervals to keep your blood sugars up.
Please call or return to the hospital for any chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening diarrhea, or any other concerns.
