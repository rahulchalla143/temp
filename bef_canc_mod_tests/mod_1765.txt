LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; septal apex - hypo;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
His troponin was 0.4 and he was started on a heparin and integrillin.
He underwent cardiac cath on [**6-11**] which revealed: 30-40%LMCA stenosis, 40% proximal in-stent restenosis of LAD with a mid 70-80% stenoses and a subtotally occluded mid-distal LAD lesion, 70-80% LCX, and a patent stent in the RCA with a 50% distal RCA.
An echo revealed a 40-45% LVEF and cardiac surgery was consulted.
The cross clamp time was 82 mins., total bypass time 93 mins.
His chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#1 and his epicardial pacing wires were d/c'd on POD#3.
