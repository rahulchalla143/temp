On [**3-15**], a duplex to assess the hepatic artery demonstrated more normal intrahepatic left and right arterial flow.
Hematocrit drifted down to 23.6 on postop day 3.
Repeat duplex on [**3-18**] noted persistent elevated velocity in the extrahepatic main hepatic artery.
Prograf levels were therapeutic.
Heparin was held postop as she was coagulopathic with INR as high as 3.8.
INR was therapeutic.
Hct trended down again to 24 and another 2 units of PRBC were transfused with hct increase to 30.
Vital signs were stable.
On [**3-20**], an abdominal CT noted patent hepatic artery, hepatic and portal veins.
L-S spine films showed generalized demineralization, but no evidence of compression fracture.
A pelvic CT was done revealing no intrapelvic collection, right lower quadrant renal transplant with surrounding inflammatory stranding and air within the collecting system, extensive body wall edema, predominantly along the right lower quadrant, superficial to the right lower quadrant renal transplant, and no suspicious osseous abnormalities.
