An ultrasound in [**2162-12-26**] right ventricular significant right carotid plaque with 80-99% stenosis and a left moderate carotid plaque with 60-69% stenosis.
Then, an MRI in [**2163-3-26**] revealed greater than 80% stenosis of the right internal carotid and approximately 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid.
An MRA of the head was within normal limits.
The patient underwent elective carotid catheterization today which revealed a 90% critical stenosis after the bifurcation of the right ICA at the bulb.
During the catheterization, he had blood pressures up to 214/93 but then a vagal episode where his heart rate and blood pressure dropped with the systolic blood pressures down to the 80s to 90s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 63-92, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 129-142/60s, respirations 16-20, 02 saturation 98-100% on room air.
Respirations clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit 34.9, platelets 352,000, INR 1.3.
A Chem-10 was unremarkable except for a magnesium of 1.6.
CK 56, CK MB not done.
A stress test in [**2162-4-26**] revealed 108% maximum heart rate was achieved on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.
An EF was found to be 55% with no wall motion abnormalities.
His blood pressure was maintained with a goal systolic between 140-160.
Neo-Synephrine was titrated up for blood pressures less than 140 and nitroglycerin was used for blood pressures greater than 160.
By [**2163-4-3**], his blood pressures were at goal and he was ready for discharge.
