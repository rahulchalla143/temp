His girlfriend noted that he started to shake and fell to the ground at South Station.
In the Emergency Department his vital signs were temperature 99.4, heart rate 128, blood pressure 155/86, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 92% on room air.
Head CT was conducted, which was within normal limits with no acute changes or intracranial hemorrhages, however, subsequently  patient had bright red hematemesis of approximately 700 cc and nasogastric tube was attempted, but not tolerated.
Hepatitis C. 4.
Lumbar compression fracture of L1 and L3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient on presentation had a temperature of 99.4, heart rate 120, blood pressure 135/86.
Respiratory rate 20.
HEENT examination pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Neck examination supple, no left anterior descending coronary artery.
Cardiovascular examination tachycardic, normal S1 and S2.
Lung examination clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Back examination no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Abdominal examination soft, slightly distended, slightly tympanic to percussion, nontender and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Neurological examination positive asterixics.
LABORATORY:  His initial CBC showed a white blood cell count of 5.5, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 41, INR 1.6, PT 15.7, and PTT 37.5.
His chem 7 was within normal limits except for a potassium, which was 3.1.
His ALT was 31, AST 135, LD 287, and alkaline phosphatase was 126.
Amylase and lipase was within normal limits.
His albumin was 3.2, total protein was 7.3., total bilirubin was 1.2.
His head CT showed no hemorrhage and small soft tissue attenuation, but most likely status post trauma, but no acute changes.
His CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed diffuse low attenuation with fatty uptake.
His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute and normal axis and intraventricular rhythm conduction delay and no ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary this is a 42 year-old male with a history of alcohol and intravenous drug abuse and no known history of liver disease who presents with coagulopathy and hematemesis with abdominal CT revealing fatty liver and question of hepatomas.
Hematemesis/coagulopathy:  Initial evaluation suggested the cause to be liver failure causing a decrease in vitamin K and coagulation factors.
He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed varices, however, he started having alcohol withdraw at the time so the esophagogastroduodenoscopy was halted and the patient was intubated and treated for alcohol withdraw.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed grade three esophageal varices, which was successfully banded.
He was on SBP prophylaxis, which was then discontinued secondary to no evidence of ascites.
Hepatology Service followed throughout and made sure that the hematocrit remained stable and banding was successful.
Acute blood loss:  Decrease in hematocrit and acute blood loss was thought to be secondary to esophageal varices, which on esophagogastroduodenoscopy was grade three.
Banding of the varices, however, stabilized his hematocrit and his transfusion requirement.
His hematocrit remained stable throughout his hospital course status post banding.
Ethanol and drug abuse:  His serum tox and urine tox indicated the patient had been recently on alcohol and he was started on a CIWA scale with Ativan p.r.n.
FEN:  The patient had hypokalemia on admission and given his chronic ethanol abuse the patient's calcium, magnesium and phosphate and other electrolytes were repleted prn.
The MRI revealed two focal hepatic lesions with imaging characteristics most consistent with hemangiomas concerning the presence of cirrhosis were quite evident in the MRI and dilatations and sequences;  follow imaging in approximately four months is to be considered.
