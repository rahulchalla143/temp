Abdominal xray showed ileus and he was made NPO.
On [**3-1**] he had a repeat KUB which continued to show dilated small bowel and was transferred to the general surgery service for management of his ileus.
CXR appeared wet and he was given Lasix per the medicine team request.
His NGT output was replaced on a 1:1 basis.
Repeat head CT was stable from prior episode, without hydrocephalus.
CT abdomen showed dilated small bowel with decompression in terminal ileum.
On [**3-5**] he was found to be obtunded and was taken to radiology for a CT scan and was escorted by anesthesia.
CT showed significant increase in ventricular size.
His EVD was open at 5cm h20 Shortly afterwards, he was extubated in the SICU and was following commands.
His post-op CT showed significant decrease in ventricular size and his drain was raised to 10cm H2O.
An MRI w/o contrast was ordered to rule out stroke and stroke neurology was consulted.
EEG showed complex partial seizures and epilepsy team was consulted for appropriate management.
His neuro checks were changed to Q2H.
On [**3-8**], patient's exam remained stable, he was placed on Dilantin for his complex partial seizures and his level was 11.1.
On [**3-9**], his EVD output was lower than the desired goal, his drain was dropped to 0 to drain 20cc then raised back to 5.
A repeat head CT showed improvement of hydrocephalus and CSF was sent for vancomycin trough.
On [**3-10**], patient's exam much improved, alert and oriented to self and place with prompting, full strength, slight L drift.
CSF cultures remain negative to date.
ID consult recommended a repeat CSF culture to completely ensure that he has no evidence of meningitis.
CSF was sent from EVD.
On [**3-16**], CT head showed slightly larger ventricles and small amount of IVH in L lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
LENS and cultures were sent to workup fever.
Although, 1 hours later he was much better given his neurological change in exam a head CT was obtained which demonstrated resolved IVH and small ventricles.
Post-op CT showed placement of VPS.
Subsequently, R EVD was removed in routine fashion on [**3-19**] and post pull CT showed stable ICH and decrease in ventricle size.
On [**3-20**], his exam was more lethargic in AM, EO to voice and commands with BUE and wiggles toes.
Calorie counts were continued and his calcium was repleted.
