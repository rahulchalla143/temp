Initially presented to OSH where he was transfused 2 units pRBCs and had SVC filter placement, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of GIB, with course notable for LUL necrotizing pneumonia.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
His admission exam was less concerning for an acute respiratory process.
However, in setting of increased rhonchi on lung exam, CT chest obtained and demonstrated a LUL necrotizing pneumonia and developing abscess.
Rigid bronchoscopy done [**2170-1-30**], with two biopsy samples, bronchial brush, and BAL collected.
# Pulmonary embolism: Pt diagnosed with bilateral PEs [**2169-12-22**] at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.
Heparin was started without bolus and titrated to goal of PTT 60-80.
INR only 1.2 at time of [**Date Range **].
Patient will continue on heparin gtt until INR has been therapeutic >48 hours.
Goal INR [**1-19**], and patient will need at least 6 months of anticoagulation.
# Right upper extremity DVT: Noted at OSH, and patient had SVC filter placed prior to transfer as his anticoagulation was being held in the setting of GIB.
Ultrasound of RUE on HD4 revealed no arterial obstruction or stenosis, but did show non-occlusive venous embolism in the axillary and brachial veins and nearly complete obstruction of the basilic vein.
Electrolytes were WNL.
He was switched from carvedilol to metoprolol, though dose could not be uptitrated due to blood pressure (SBP in high 90s-low 100s).
His admission WBC count was 1.9; he remained in the 1.8-2.7 range on HD2-4.
On HD5 his WBC rose to 3.0 and on HD6 to 6.9.
Concern remained through HD6-9 that WBC may be rising in setting of developing PNA.
WBC count briefly spiked to 12.1 post-bronch while patient in MICU, but returned to <10 on HD10 and remained in the 7-9 range afterwards despite the restart of meropenem on HD9.
Patient was on furosemide and spironolactone at time of admission, though these were held in setting of lower BPs, with SBP in 90s-110s throughout much of hospital course.
Patient did not have evidence of pulmonary edema on exam or imaging, and he did not appear volume overloaded on exam.
TF were d/c'd late on HD8 in preparation for his bronchoscopy on HD9, and were restarted post-procedure.
-Patient should continue on heparin gtt until INR therapeutic for >48 hours.
Goal INR [**1-19**].
-Patient should have periodic monitoring of Hct, given recent GIB and ongoing anticoagulation.
-Hct on [**2-9**] was 25.7.
