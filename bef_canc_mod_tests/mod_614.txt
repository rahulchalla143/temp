His weight at that time was 84.3 kg.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained due to the patient's high blood sugars at home and they recommended increasing Glyburide to 10 mg po q am, 7.5 mg po q pm.

Acute blood loss anemia:  Patient's hematocrit dropped significantly secondary to severe hematuria, and he required 4 units of packed red blood cells transfusion.
His hematocrit continued to be monitored and remained stable postoperatively.
Renal:  Patient's renal function improved while he was on nisseratide to 1.5, however, the creatinine bumped 2.0 off the nisseratide.
