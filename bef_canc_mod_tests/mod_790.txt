[**5-17**] and [**5-18**] with blood cultures 4/4 + coag negative staphylococcus.
[**5-19**] and [**5-20**] bld cultures no growth to date.
Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and dynamic systolic function (LVEF>80%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-12-4**], the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy has increased and trace aortic regurgitation is now identified.
Dynamic LV systolic function and the resting intracavitary gradient are similar.
Recommend analysis of the SVC, central subclavians and internal jugular veins with dedicated magnetic resonance venography, which can be performed without intravenous contrast for a global assessment of the venous patency.
She was started on vancomycin and her blood cultures cleared after 2 days in the hospital.
The patient felt strongly about keeping her HD line, which was felt to be reasonable because her infection was coag negative staph.
Ecchocardiogram did not show any valvular vegitations.
Blood pressure is in the 130s-150s systolic.
