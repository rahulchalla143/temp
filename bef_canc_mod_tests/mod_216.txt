The patient has had an increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.1, and hyperkalemia to 5.8, noted on his laboratories over the last two weeks.
An arterial blood gas showed 7.22, 67, 90 on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Repeat arterial blood gas revealed 7.12, 86, 102, and the patient was intubated electively.
Chest x-ray revealed dense opacities of the lower two-thirds of the left lung.
Chest CT revealed large areas of collapse on the left, with peribronchial opacity noted.
Abdominal cuts showed extremely large sigmoid colon, rectum which was dilated and filled with stool, and the maximum diameter was about 24 cm.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, with an ejection fraction of 45 to 50% on an echocardiogram done in [**4-1**] 2.
Urosepsis, [**4-1**] 6.
History of atrial fibrillation status post DCCV 11.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.5 13.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6, pulse 46, blood pressure 132/59, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 100% on 80% FIO2.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, mucous membranes moist.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.9, hematocrit 39.6, platelets 163.
INR 3.4.
Sodium 144, potassium 5.4, chloride 111, BUN 78, creatinine 2.2, bicarbonate 26, glucose 87.
Arterial blood gas post-intubation:  7.38, 37, 151 on 80% face mask.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, no change from baseline, no ST or T wave changes.
Chest x-ray revealed a large left-sided opacity.
CT of the chest:  Left upper lung consolidation, left pleural effusion.
Sputum cultures were taken that revealed only oropharyngeal flora.
The patient had a bronchoscopy which was done, which revealed mucous plugging.
Bronchoalveolar lavage was done as well as that time, but did not reveal results which could guide antibiotic therapy.
The patient had a rectal tube placed, and was given numerous enemas and stool softeners, which resulted in five to six large bowel movements.
The patient's heart rate had been noticed to be decreased during his admission, with heart rates between the 80s to the low 60s.
A chest x-ray was done, which revealed elevated left hemidiaphragm with very large dilated colon pressing up against the left lung.
Stool was still left in the colon.
The patient was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a short stay, during which time he was reassessed by Gastroenterology.
He was taken off his ACE, which had been put on in the Medical Intensive Care Unit since there was a concern that his hyperkalemia and his acute renal failure would return.
The patient returned to the floor, did quite well, was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] from Pulmonary, who recommended an outpatient sleep study since he thought that the patient had a flail chest status post his sternotomy and his wound dehiscence at that area.
The patient's heart rate remained under good control, between 80s and 90s off the amiodarone, and he did not have any events of tachycardia or arrhythmias.
The patient was to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**] within one week, to have his creatinine and potassium levels checked.
The patient was to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in Pulmonary, to have his pulmonary function tests checked since there is a question that amiodarone may have possibly caused his decrease in pulmonary function status.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] was to orchestrate a sleep study within one to two weeks.
