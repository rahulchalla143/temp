PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Physical examination at the time of admission to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed the following:  Temperature 100.7; blood pressure 189/83; heart rate of 112; 83% on room air; 93% on six liters.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Anicteric sclera.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 21.2; 90% neutrophils, 2% bands, 3% lymphocytes.
Hematocrit of 40.6.
Platelets of 270.
Chemistry 7 revealed a sodium of 150; potassium of 4; chloride of 110; C02 of 28; BUN 33; creatinine 1.1; glucose 149.
Urinalysis was yellow, clear, specific gravity of 1.025.
Small blood, 30 protein, trace ketones, small bilirubin, 0 to 2 white blood cells, rare bacteria.
Chest x-ray reveals no effusion, no congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 113, normal axis and intervals and no ST or T wave abnormalities.
Based on his initial chest x-ray, it appeared that his fevers were secondary to a pneumonia, questionable aspiration pneumonia.
Blood and sputum cultures were obtained, of which the sputum culture grew out moderate growth of coagulase positive staph aureus which was Oxacillin sensitive.
A bedside swallowing evaluation was obtained on hospital day number two which revealed severe oral motor weakness and difficulty initiating swallows, probable aspiration of apple sauce and water and was, therefore, placed n.p.o.
The neurology service was consulted for further evaluation of the etiology of his oropharyngeal dysphagia.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation with this tensilon was performed with similar results to his initial evaluation -- namely considerable aspiration with inability to propel pureed foods as well as inability to protect his airway.
Repeat chest x-ray on hospital day number 14 revealed improving bibasilar densities, consistent with improving pneumonias.
A biopsy was taken one day prior to discharge with pathology results pending at this time.
Multiple laboratory studies were sent including liver function tests, B-12, folate and TSH and RPR all of which were normal and was started on Trilafon 8 mg by gastrojejunostomy tube twice a day.
An arterial blood gases was drawn during this event which revealed a pH of 7.17, Pc02 of 87 and P02 of 104, indicative of a respiratory acidosis.
After approximately 24 hours of mask ventilation, the patient clinically improved with good oxygen saturations and was significantly less labored in terms of his respiratory status.
The patient was noted to be hypernatremic upon admission with a sodium level of 150.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, Psychiatric Unit, where he will have further evaluation of his mental status and indication for Trilafon.
