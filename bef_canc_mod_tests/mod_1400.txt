Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-5-2**] the ventricular premature beats and artifact are new.
[**2199-5-20**] CXR IMPRESSION: Layering right pleural effusion.
[**2199-5-20**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
CT with contrast may be performed to evaluate for active extravasation.
Pancreatic calcifications, raising the possibility of chronic pancreatitis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-2**], left ventricular function appears similar.
He underwent angiography that showed no active bleeding.
His abdominal discomfort and hematoma size were improved at time of discharge.
Atrial fibrillation Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on admission for rate control; it was titrated to 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with HR in the 50 - 60's.
A lower INR goal of 2.0 - 2.5 was chosen given his history of bleeding, and he was discharged on warfarin 2 mg QHS.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed a preserved ejection fraction with moderate TR and MR as seen in prior studies.
Coronary artery disease with demand ischemia His troponin was mildly elevated to peak of 0.14, likely demand ischemia due to anemia and poor rate control early in admission.
INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO REHAB FACILITY FOR FOLLOW-UP: (1) Mr. [**Known lastname 78764**] should have his INR measured for a goal of 2.0 - 2.5 (lower goal range given patient's history of bleeding).
Please check INR every two days until stable.
(2) Please weigh patient daily and adjust lasix as appropriate to keep weight stable.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-9**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day).
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Please adjust as needed for INR 2.0 - 2.5.
Aspirin 81 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: PLEASE DO NOT START UNTIL INR IS STABLE AND NO EVIDENCE OF ONGOING BLEEDING IN RECTUS SHEATH.
This was likely due to the blood thinners (lovenox) you were taking.
