CXR revealed bilateral fluffy infiltrates c/w pulmonary edema or a diffuse infectious process/ARDS.
Initial labs were notable for mildly increased BUN/Cr (Cr 1.1 up minimally from baseline if 0.9-1.0), a normal CKMB of 3, a Tn of 0.01, WBC of 10.1, stable HCT/plts, and a lactate of 1.3.

[**2183-8-27**] CHEST X-RAY IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-26**], 2:52 a.m.
Following extubation, lung volumes are slightly lower, exaggerating volume of the already moderate-to-large left pleural effusion.
[**2183-8-28**] CHEST X-RAY IMPRESSION:  Extensive pulmonary edema.
[**2183-8-29**] CHEST X-RAY In comparison with the study of [**8-28**], there is continued substantial pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis in a patient with previous CABG and dual-channel pacemaker device in place.
[**2183-8-26**] TRANSTHORACIC ECHO The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-10-18**], apical hypokinesis/akinesis appears to be new.
Comparison with prior study is limited by suboptimal views.
Was felt to most likely be secondary to a cardiogenic source, given patent was hypertensive on arrival, with SBP in the 200s, as well as a history of HF with an EF <45% with CXR consistnent with pulmonary edema.
ECHO showed a new decrease in EF to 30% with FWM abnormalities.
He was called out to the floor off of a nitrogen gtt, with a plan to increase his blood pressure regimen to prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
Antihypertensive medications were uptitrated and upon [**Year (4 digits) **], he was normotensive with SBP 120-130, appeared euvolemic, with no oxygen requirement.
- Lisinopril 10mg - Increased carvedilol to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] - Diuresed over 8L with IV lasix, transitioned to PO torsemide 40 mg daily.
# Hypertension:  SBP 200s on admission likely contributed to flash pulmonary edema.
- Negative infectious workup to date, afebrile, no leukocytosis, negative legionella, sputum, urine cx, CXR shows stable pleural effusion, LLL lung collapse  # Acute kidney injury - developed [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr 1.4 (from baseline 1.0-1.1) in the setting of aggressive diuresis, remained stable and was 1.4 on [**Last Name (un) **].
A chest x-ray should be checked in approximately 4 weeks (around [**9-28**]) to confirm resolution of collapse.

You were found to have fluid in your lungs which is likely because your blood pressure was elevated and your heart could not move fluid effectively.
