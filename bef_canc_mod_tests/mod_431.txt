Admission Date: [**2128-4-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2128-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-3-6**]        Sex:  F  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia and cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35 percent and diastolic dysfunction with negative catheterization, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who was in her usual state of health until 2-3 weeks prior to admission she had episodes of nausea and vomiting.
She was noted to have an INR of 19.5 on admission.
Echocardiogram revealed depression in her ejection fraction to 20 percent.
The Renal Service was consulted and felt her creatinine increase and proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabetic nephropathy with severe right-sided heart failure.
She was initially started on Lasix for her uncompensated congestive heart failure, but her creatinine rose, so she was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to initiate nesiritide treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 66-78, blood pressure 125-130/82-91, respirations 20, she is saturating 100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 14.2, hematocrit 41.7, platelets 417, 93 percent neutrophils, 5 percent lymphocytes, 2 percent monocytes.
Sodium 140, potassium 5.1, glucose 140, chloride 105, bicarbonate 20, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, and magnesium 2.
INR is 5.4 and PTT 34.3.
ALT is 915, AST 1,311.
Troponin T is 0.15, MB index is 3, MB is 12, and CK is 397.
Alkaline phosphatase 114 and total bilirubin 3.1.
Chest x-ray on [**4-7**], shows congestive heart failure versus bibasilar atelectasis.
Renal ultrasound shows unremarkable left kidney, limited evaluation of the left.
Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of 20 percent, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global right ventricular and free wall hypokinesis, 3 plus TR, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Abdominal ultrasound shows normal liver echo texture, hepatopetal portal venous flow.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with non-ischemic congestive heart failure associated with [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia with a recent worsening of her ejection fraction to 20 percent.
These enzymes trended down and were not consistent with myocardial infarction.
After several days of Natrecor diuresis, she was transitioned to Lasix, although her creatinine rose to 2.1 and therefore her Lasix was held for 1 day and her Lasix dose was decreased.
The patient did convert to sinus rhythm on dofetilide, although her creatinine was unstable and rose to 2.1.
The patient's creatinine during her hospitalization rose to 2.1 and her Lasix dose was subsequently decreased.
Because of her unstable creatinine dofetilide was felt to be a poor antiarrhythmic for her.
Her hepatitis A virus IgG was positive, although all other hepatitis serologies were negative.
She is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] on [**2128-5-27**] at 3:30 p.m.  [**Hospital1 882**] labs is to draw her INR level on Friday [**4-23**], and the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic will call her to change her dose.
