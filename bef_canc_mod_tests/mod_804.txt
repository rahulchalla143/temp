TTE ([**9-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-1-15**], the findings are similar.

Urinalysis c/w UTI.
His urine culture grew 2 morphologies of Klebsiella resistant to Cipro and Cefuroxime but sensitive to Bactrim.
His EKG showed ST elevation.
Troponin peaked at 0.39.
However, he was then seen by cardiology who felt the changes were due to hypotension in the setting in sepsis, the did not want to proceed to catheterization and suggested stopping heparin gtt in setting of h/o SDH along with guiac + stools.
Repeat TTE was similar to prior studies and showed no wall motion abnormalities.
# Acute renal failure with uremia: Came in with BUN 97 and Creatinine of 0.8.
He had good urine output throughout this hospitalization.
Hematocrit dropped from 39 to 30 and then stayed stable between 30 and 33 throughout the rest of his stay.
Iron studies in [**5-20**] with low iron, normal ferritin, low binding capactiy but ratio approx 10% so likely a component of iron deficiency.
His systolic blood pressure remained >130 and he was started on home lisinopril the following day.
His clonidine was never restarted and he did not have any hypertension during his hospitalization.
with baseline left hemiparesis, limited vocalization, continued the patient on aspirin 325mg and monitored neuro exam closely.
