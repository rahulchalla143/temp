Partially imaged is an enhancing lesion of the right second rib, which may represent a fracture, but if there is concern for metastases, this could be better evaluated by either plain films or CT scan.

Many of these were present on the CT from [**4-13**].
Recommend repeat evaluation in 4 months.
[**9-29**] ECHO  The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-8-28**], the findings are similar.
She was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and diuresed but cont.
Cardiac enzymes were persistently negative, and she had no significant EKG changes.
Her echo was similar to one month prior.
Plain films demonstrated new fractures and MRI confirmed these findings (see report above).
