This work-up included abdominal CT which showed thickened duodenal valve, 2 cm adrenal mass, question of colon lesion consistent with intermittent intestinal obstruction.
Her CEA at the outside hospital was 41.
In the hospital the patient had work-up which included CT angiogram due to abnormal EKG initially which revealed pulmonary embolism and patient had been started on Heparin.
Her initial EKG revealed T wave inversion at V2 and V6 plus ST depression so she was also admitted for rule out MI.
CT also revealed dilated common bile duct up to 18 mm.
Her hematocrit on admission was 29.0 and drifted to 22.5 on [**1-1**].
She had two episodes of coffee ground emesis on [**1-1**], became hypotensive and bradycardic and acute EGD was performed which revealed grade 3 esophagitis in the lower third, ulcer in the stomach, body and antrum, blood in the stomach and anterior vault.
On [**1-2**] the patient was transferred back to the medicine floor and on [**1-3**] she had a second EGD done due to hematocrit of 33.6 which drifted to 32.2.
For this reason the patient underwent angiography revealing the source of bleeding and underwent duodenal gastric artery embolization.
Her hematocrit after transfusion went to 38.5 on [**1-4**].
Other studies during the hospital course included chest x-ray which revealed widened mediastinum secondary to tortuous and dilated thoracic aorta and bibasilar atelectasis.
CTA revealed moderate intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, left pulmonary artery embolism and left adrenal mass.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed no DVT, KUB revealed no obstruction and chest x-ray on [**1-5**] revealed bilateral small pleural effusion with consolidation of the lower lobe presenting either atelectasis or infection.

HEENT:  Revealed no icterus, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, oropharynx clear, mucus membranes are dry.
After transfer to medicine service she remained stable and her hematocrit remained stable as well.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit on admission 24.4, 32.9 on [**1-2**].4 on [**1-3**].5 on [**1-4**].2 on [**1-5**].
