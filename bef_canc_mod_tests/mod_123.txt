CT head negative for any acute intracranial process.
Neurological exam not suggestive of focal deficit.
CXR similarly negative for acute process.
Rest of metabolic work-up not suggestive of source of altered mental status.
However, his UA had large leukocyte but urine cx was negative so ABX were stopped because of sterile pyuria and lack of fever and elevated WBC count.
His Cr improved with fluid repletion and returned to baseline of 1.5 on day of discharge.
# Hypernatremia: Pt with an initial sodium of 155 on admission.
His sodium remained stable in the low 140's and was down to 139 on day of discharge.
# Sterile pyuria: Urinalysis showed pyuria, and in the setting of altered mental status was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Urine culture showed no growth, and given his normal WBC count and lack of fever it's reasonable to assume this is sterile pyuria.
# Studies pending at time of discharge: blood cultures (NGTD) # Foley discontinued at 2pm on [**2179-11-29**].
