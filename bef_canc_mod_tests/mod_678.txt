Signed Electronically by [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 251**] on TUE [**2149-5-20**] 3:10 PM  Name:  [**Known lastname 41311**], [**Known firstname **]           Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 41312**]  Service:                          Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2081-1-9**]        Sex:  F  Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**MD Number(1) 41313**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Ischemic left leg.
URINE OUTPUT:  Zero as the patient was on peritoneal dialysis.
A total of 128 cc of Visipaque were used and total fluoro time was 22 minutes.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was placed in the abdominal aorta and a short 4-French sheath was placed.
An Omni Flush was placed at the level of L1 and diagnostic abdominal aortogram was obtained.
A 4-French angled glide catheter was placed into the left external iliac artery after this was accessed using the floppy angled Glidewire and then serial images were obtained of the left lower extremity down to and including the foot.
The SFA and profunda were isolated with vessel loops as well as an Aldara clamp placed on the distal external iliac artery.
An endarterectomy was then performed of the common femoral going into the SFA and a plaque was pulled out of the origin of the profunda.
Arteriography was then performed of the left lower extremity and there was still noted to be a large amount of clot at the tibioperoneal trunk and despite multiple attempts with the export catheter over a [**Name (NI) 41314**] PT wire which had been placed into the posterior tibial artery and despite multiple passes with the excisor vacuum assisted battery-operated thrombectomy device, there was still a tremendous amount of clot in the anterior tibial and the posterior tibial so these were pulled out and the sheath was left in place.
A cutdown was performed of the below-knee popliteal artery and the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle were taken off their attachments to the tibia.
Flow was restored and then a completion arteriogram was shot through the same sheath in the left groin patch.
A Perclose device was deployed through the right groin after [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was placed back to the abdominal aorta.
Manual pressure was held and there was excellent hemostasis from this.
The patient, at the completion of the case had a dopplerable distal AT, peroneal, PT, but there was no signals in the foot.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  Initial images of the abdominal aorta revealed patent abdominal aorta and iliac arteries bilaterally.
PT/OT evaluation recommended home vs. rehab.
CXR for pleuritic pain WNL.
2 units of PRBC given for hct 24.3 which increased to 29.3 post-transfusion.
[**2149-5-24**] Underwent CTA or torso.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Goal PTT [**12-22**].
Temperature greater than 100.5F for 24 hours ??????
Bleeding, new or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions   Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11082**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2149-9-23**] 10:50  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 251**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1490**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**] Date/Time:[**2149-6-4**] 9:00   Completed by:[**2149-5-27**
