SBP dropped to 80s which responded to 2L.
Head CT, Abdomen/Pelvis CT, and FAST negative for bleeding.
Hct dropped to 23.8.
Past Medical History: -Bladder cancer --HGT1 w/ CIS, s/p BCG Therapy with subsequent BCG-osis - was found to have suspicious etiology in [**8-2**] and subsequently has had three atypical cytologies -Heart Block s/p PPM -Atrial Flutter -Seborrheic keratosis -Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Skin -CKD 4 -Senile Cataract -Hypertension - COPD - CHF (Diastolic) - AAA (s/p endovascular repair) - with bleeding in small intestine during capsule endoscopy - could not identify source.

Studies: [**2112-4-1**] CXR REASON FOR EXAM: Heart failure, received fluids.
Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day in the morning.
[**2112-3-31**] Abd/pelvis CT IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2112-3-31**] Transthoracic Echo The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) with mid to distal septal and distal inferior hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-8-19**], regional LV systolic dysfunction is now present and the severity of TR has increased.
[**2112-3-29**] CT Head IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral sinus disease with air-fluid levels may indicate acute sinusitis.
[**2112-3-29**] CT spine IMPRESSION: 1.
If there is clinical concern for cord injury and there is no contraindication, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
After 2L of NS in ED his blood pressure increased to the 110s.
Patient had ECHO with worsening EF (45-50%) and LV systolic dysfunction new since [**7-/2111**] so it was felt that his hypotension was likely due to hypovolemia and poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
Acute MI was ruled out with CE flat x3 (though troponin 0.14 0.12 in setting of ARF)  He was not given any further fluid but transfused 3 units of PRBCs.
# Macrocytic Anemia: HCT 28 on arrival and dropped to 23 after ICF resuscitation.
After two units of PRBCs the patient's HCT improved to 28 and after a 3rd unit his HCT was >30.
His retic was checked and was 5.8%.
# Heart Block s/p PPM, Atrial Fibrillation: Coumadin on med list, but INR 1.
He was in atrial fibrillation with a paced rate of 60.
His heart rate did not increase in the setting of hypotension, remaining at 60bpm.
The pacer's responsiveness feature was activated and the basal rate was raised to 70bpm to hopefully reduce future hypotensive episodes.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr 3 from baseline 2.3-2.5.
After 2L IVF and 2 units PRBCs his creatinine 2.1 so likely pre-renal azotemia.
Creatinine was back at baseline 2.3. .
However, serum glucose in the AM was 62 and he was taking poor POs so his NPH was cut in half and he was continued on SSI.

Your blood pressure was low, and you received several liters of fluid.
Some changes were made to your medications: - Your blood pressure medications (are being held to prevent further hypotension or low blood pressure) - your coumadin (blood thinner) is also being held - you are being given a course of antibiotics to end on [**2112-4-8**]  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
