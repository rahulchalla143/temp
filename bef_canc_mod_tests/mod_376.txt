Review of recent micro: [**2202-7-21**] stool + Cdiff [**2202-4-30**] blood + enterococcus, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to linezolid and daptomycin .
STUDIES: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:10 PM There is a posterior segment left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:50 PM Advanced global parenchymal atrophy related to patient's stated age.
Differential diagnostic considerations are broad.
Nonetheless, finding is consistent with remote head MRI dated [**2196-11-12**].
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS  W/O CONTRAST; Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:50 PM As best can be determined due to limitations in technique, no significant interval change with the exception of likely improved wall edema suggesting healing colitis.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-8-22**] 1:17 PM 1.
CT Abdomen/PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-8-30**] 12:43 PM 1.
ECHO Study Date of [**2202-8-30**] Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-8-12**], the pericardial effusion is much larger and the heart rate is higher.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2202-8-31**] 1.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2202-9-6**] 6:01 PM Interval increase in size of left pleural effusion and decrease in the right pleural effusion.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2202-9-7**] 9:29 AM No acute intracranial abnormalities, although the evaluation is limited due to the lack of gadolinium.
ECHO Study Date of [**2202-9-9**] Small echodense pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-9-1**], the effusion is smaller, with less free pericardial fluid.
CXR [**2202-9-21**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process with near complete resolution of previously identified effusions.
Cardiac transthroacic echo [**2202-9-22**]: Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CT head showed advanced global parenchymal atrophy related to patient's stated age, findings were consistent with remote head MRI dated [**11-13**], [**2196**].
Repeat MRI on [**2202-9-7**] confirmed global atrophy inconsistent with age, but no other identifiable abnormality.
Psychiatry then proposed possible use of ECT, but on [**2202-9-10**] the family refused this option so further EEG analysis was not pursued.
She was given IV metoprolol and her heart rate improved greatly.
An echo performed after the episode was normal and did not show any structural heart disease.
Aspirin was discontinued after she had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation for one month, and the reason for her atrial fibrillation appeared clear, due to the effusion, which had resolved upon repeat echo on [**2202-9-24**].
TTE [**2202-8-30**] showed echo evidence of tamponade; a large, circumferential effusionwith stranding was appreciated.
She was followed with serial echos, which showed continued resolution of effusion.
A chest xray performed on admission, showed a left lower lobe pneumonia.
Blood cultures were persistently negative prompting discontinuation of repeat cultures.
There were no localizing findings on physical exam and the patient did not complain of any specific symptoms.
She was transferred to the MICU and her urine cultures grew citrobacter freundii complex at that time.
Cultures off of her dialysis catheter were negative, and her PICC line was pulled.
At time of discharge, after returning from HD pt had a transient temperature to 100.4 which resolved without intervention.
Since these fevers had occured throughout the admission an did not seem to have a clear cause she was discharged with VNA services to check vital signs.
TSH was mildly elevated at admit at 5.3, but given recent change in medication, she was continued on her outpatient dose and TSH was monitored.
Mixing studies, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin were sent, and will need to be followed up in the outpatient clinic.
During her hospital stay ([**2202-9-10**]), her TIBC, iron and ferritin were evaluated and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Her hematocrit was chronically depressed, yet never to the point requiring transfusion.
# Mobility and conditioning: Physical therapy worked with patient to increase her mobility and maintain and increase her endurance.
Ascites 9.
Pericardiocentesis 3.
Lumbar Puncture 4.
A number of tests were completed, including imaging, lumbar puncture, blood, and urine tests.
