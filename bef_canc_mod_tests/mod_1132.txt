Admission blood cultures grew strep anginosus and wound swab was polymicrobial including MSSA and e Coli.
CT angiogram was concerning for infection at the site of bypass graft anastamosis with the femoral artery.
[**4-24**] - Exploration of right groin, control of the external iliac artery via a retroperitoneal exposure, excision of distal portion of the axillary-femoral bypass, and vein patch repair of the femoral artery with saphenous vein patch.
Patient remained intubated on return from OR  Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken back to the OR on [**4-25**] for exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision which was left open.
[**4-25**] - Exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision which was left open.
On [**5-4**] patient had decreased urine output in setting of increased bladder pressure (27 mmHg) and abdominal distension, which improved with albumin administration, 1 u pRBCs, and muscle paralysis.
Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs; RUQ ultrasound showed no abnormalities and LFTs trended downward.
Systolic blood pressure rose to 200s with agitation, which responded to Fentanyl and hydralazine.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pt also has Mechanical Valve was on IV heparin with transition tocoumadin on DC  Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID transitioned to IV Zosyn - to be on a total of 6 weeks, then PO supression therapy for life.
[**2-26**] blood cultures drawn [**4-17**] grew S. anginosus as well as MSSA on [**4-17**] and [**4-19**].
A CT Torso on [**4-19**] showed "a widely patent right axillary to femoral bypass graft, with minimal soft tissue density and small locules of air surrounding the distal portion of the bypass graft at its femoral artery anastomotic site."
A TEE was performed showed "a well-seated [**Hospital1 **]-leaflet mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with normal leaflet motion and gradients.
