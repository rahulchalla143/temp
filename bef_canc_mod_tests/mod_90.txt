His alcohol withdrawl was treated with a midazolam infusion while he was intubated; this was later switched to propofol.
He initially had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator due to intermittent episodes of tachypnea with low tidal volumes, particularly when his pressure support was weaned; this was thought to be due in part to anxiety/withdrawl, and so he was put back on a low dose of standing diazepam and his propofol was weaned.
His leukocytosis improved to 11.
