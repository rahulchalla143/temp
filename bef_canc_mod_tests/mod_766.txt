CXR [**2190-5-20**]: Bilateral parenchymal opacities, for which CT of the chest is recommended for further evaluation and to exclude malignancy.
CT Head [**2190-5-21**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
RUQ Ultrasound [**5-21**]: 1.
Renal US [**5-24**]: 1.
CXR [**5-25**]: 1.
LE Angiogram [**5-27**]: 1.
AN omniflush catheter was advanced to the level of L2/L3 and a dstal abdominal aortogram was prefromed.
The RCIA, IIA and EIA were patent.
The LCIA, EIA and IIA were patent as was the L CFA.
The ominiflush catheter was then advanced over the [**Doctor Last Name 534**] over an angled gluide wire and selective angiography of the LLE was preformed.
Final angiography revealed a 20% residual stenosis and no dissection.
Successful stenting of the LSFA with a 6.0 x 60 mm protege stent which was post dilate dto 6.0 with a admiral balloon.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and normal flow.
An ABG showed significant hypercarbia to 120 and a code blue was called.
A CT of his head did not show any acute event.
His cultures were significant for Citrobacter freundi in his urine.
His blood cultures were negative.
Upon review of his prior chest films and CT chest, he has a long history of nodules and pulmonary opacities due to silicosis.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction.
His creatinine improved to 1.4 prior to his cath and was 1.5 on the day of discharge.
Although he initially appeared dehydrated on admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 39714**] developed lower extremity edema and crackles on his exam in the setting of receiving IV fluids for ARF and prior to his catheterization.
**His blood will be drawn [**6-2**] and a BUN/Cr should be sent to his primary care doctor so that his dose of lasix can be adjusted as appropriate.
**  # Gangrenous left big toe/Peripheral vascular disease: After the patient's renal function returned to baseline, he was brought to the cath lab and underwent LE angiography with balloon angioplasty and a stent to his LSFA.
The trigger for his elevated BPs was not clear, though his systolic blood pressure was noted to be elevated 150s-170s even before he became acutely hypertensive to 200 and was transferred to the CCU.
At the time of discharge, his blood pressures were greatly improved on this regimen with systolic pressures in the 130s to 150s.
He had a RUQ ultrasound that showed gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis.
# Anemia: Patient's Hct was stable at 28-31.
His INR will be drawn on Wednesday to allow his coumadin to be adjusted as needed since he is being sent home on ciprofloxacin, which interacts with coumadin.
His valproate, which he takes at home for behavioral control, was continued.
