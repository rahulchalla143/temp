Blood cultures were also sent to assess possible sepsis.
One of the samples sent was positive for Enterococcus, thus the patient was placed on Flagyl/Zosyn.
The patient also received an CXR to evaluate the mediastinum for free air and it too was negative.
What's more, he received a CT scan which demonstrated early cholecystitis.
Although his labs were improved, his abdomen was clearly problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
Intraoperative cholangiograms which were done revealed free flow into the duodenum.
Patient also has a CVP of 12.
POD2:  Patient CXR demonstrated congested lungs.
Patient's blood pressure was also elevated and was thus, placed on Lopressor and Hydralazine.
POD3:  Patient's blood pressure was better controlled, his respiratory status improved and he appeared less agitated than in previous days, though his agitation was not entirely gone.
His abdomen was less distended and his CVP ranged from [**10-6**].
His WBC dropped to 11.7 from a high of ~15 a couple of days prior due to the administration of steroids, which will continue to be tapered off.
He could void independently without difficulty, tolerate appropriate po diet, demonstrated markedly reduced dyspnea on exertion  with no pain and a healing wound   Medications on Admission: Prednisone 5'(temporal arteritis), Atenolol 25', Coumadin 2.5', Simvastatin 10', Tamsulosin 0.4 SR', Clonazepam 1 hs, Protonix 40', Albuterol, Atrovent, Salmeterol 100'   Discharge Medications: 1.
