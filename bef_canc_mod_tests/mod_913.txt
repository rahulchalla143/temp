Her EKG revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads and reciprocal depressions in the lateral leads.
In the cath lab, she underwent angiography which showed no obstructive disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCX.
Her pain, ST elevations, and hypotension all resolved promptly after this intervention.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided pressures (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg, mean PCWP 20mmHg).
The cardiac index was normal at 2.02 L/min/m2.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-7-2**] acute injury pattern in the inferior-posterior region is new.
ECHO [**2106-4-19**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-4-10**], mild inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis is seen on the current study.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2106-4-17**]: 1.
Cardiac catheterization in this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LCX, and LAD were without significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal blood pressure of 121/72 mmHg.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and a 5% residual stenosis in the mid RCA.
Heart rate was kept near 60 and BP<140/90, by adding metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID as pressures allow and uptitrated to 25mg PO TID.
TTE showed normal systolic global function (EF 55%) but with inferior hypokinesis c/w IMI.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Calcium  Oral 15.
