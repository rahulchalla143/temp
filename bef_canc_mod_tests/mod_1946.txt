Pt was sitting in comode, and upon standing oxygen saturation dropped into the 80's.
A V/Q scan to eval for PE was indeterminate; LENIS were negative.
TTE showed dilated right ventricle which was could be correlated with PE.
MRA of chest showed saddle pulmonary embolus.
(Note: CT contraindicated secondary to an iodine allergy).
She was also bridged to coumadin anticoagulation upon transfer with goal INR of 2.5.
Plans are to repeat ECHO as outpatient in [**3-13**] months to assess long term cardiac damage s/p PE.
Upon discharge from MICU platelets were stable and within normal limits.
Upon discharge from the hospital, pt with platelets stable = 313.
# Bacteremia - Gram positive cocci (Coagulase negative staphylococcus) grew from arterial line tip [**8-28**] in 1 of 4 sets of BC (other BC were from other sites).
Recultured urine as [**8-27**] urine culture grew Coagulase negative staphylococcus.
-Monitor vancomycin levels daily.
Surgery reviewed CT advised that stricture in sigmoid possibly secondary to diverticulitis.
Head CT showed no metastatic disease.
HR was 130s initially now is 100-110 on discharge.

Stable, INR 2.3 on coumadin, PICC line in place for daily vancomycin infusion.
While you were being treated with "heparin", a type of blood thinner, you had a reaction to heparin which caused you to have low platelets in your blood.
You also had a bacterial infection of your blood for which you are now taking an antibiotic called "vancomycin."
