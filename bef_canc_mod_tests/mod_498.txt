The patient presented to the hospital with a week's history of diffuse abdominal pain, found in the ED to be febrile to 101.3 with SBP in low 100s for which he was given IVF, Vanc, Levo, Flagyl, and Decadron with transient drop in pressure to the 90's.
A chest film at the time was revealing for multilobar pneumonia.
As the patient's white count was noted to be dropping, Vanc and Zosyn (both may have this effect) was changed to Meropenem and Azthromycin without caspofungin, the regimen which the patient is currently on upon transfer to the floor.
Induced sputum was sent for a variety of studies including legionella, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], fungal infection all of which were negative.
Bacterial cultures were unfortunately limiting as all were contaminated with OP flora.

Imaging: [**2141-3-10**]: Portable Chest - The heart size is normal.
3-04-06L Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelvis - The liver is normal in echotexture and architecture, without focal lesions.
The main, right, and left portal veins are patent, with normal hepatopetal flow.
These are slightly increased since the last examination, but may be due to position, as waveforms are within normal limits.
[**2141-3-11**]: CT Chest - No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes are demonstrated.
Lung window images demonstrate patchy areas of ground glass opacity within both upper lobes, and both lower lobes, with more consolidative appearance noted towards the bases.
[**2141-3-11**]: CT Abd/Pelvis - There are dependent atelectatic changes of both lung bases, with a consolidation at the left lung base.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The bladder is collapsed, with a Foley and nondependent air, probably from Foley introduction.
[**2141-3-11**]: CT Head - IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2141-3-15**]: Portable Chest - Compared to the prior radiograph of [**2141-3-11**], there is incomplete resolution of the pulmonary edema.

As detailed in H+P, all sputum and blood cultures were unrevealing including extensive workup for atypical pathogens including crypto, CMV,EBV,legionella,AFB, and chlamydia Pneumoniae.
Leukopenia - The patient developed a leukopenia with nadir ANC as low as 800.
Neupogen was discontinued and the patient's white count was monitored.
The patient's BP was well controlled during hospital course with stable renal function after resolution of initial failure in setting of sepsis.
Patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable with O2 sats > 90% on room air.
