======= STUDIES ======= UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2115-2-12**] RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The exam is technically limited, because pain limited the patient's ability to tolerate compression of the superficial femoral vein at its mid and distal portions.
If clinical concern persists, followup exam can be performed following appropriate pain control.
AP PORTABLE CHEST [**2115-2-12**] The study is limited secondary to AP portable technique and body habitus.
ECG Study Date of [**2115-2-12**] Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-10-14**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.
Rate 85, PR 0, QRS 88, QT/QTc 392/435, P 0, QRS 15, T 89 .
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2115-2-14**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2109-10-22**], cardiac rhythm now atrial fibrillation; no pericardial effusion seen; otherwise findings similar.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-2-18**] The right supraclavicular catheter remains in place with tip in the right atrium.
Bibasilar atelectasis are again seen, slightly worsened on today's examination with a lower lung volume than before.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST, [**2115-2-20**] 1.
The lung parenchyma is not well evaluated given that the amount of respiratory motion present.
[**2114-2-26**] EKG Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 80-85.
Delayed precordial R wave progression - cannot exclude anterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-2-13**] anteroseptal T wave inversions are new.
Rate 83 PR 0, QRS 76, QT/QTc 386/426, P 0, QRS 18, T  109 .
[**2115-2-18**] Blood Culture (4 BOTTLES):    NO GROWTH FINAL.
VIRAL CULTURE (Final [**2115-2-27**]): HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE 1.
CT chest was negative for pulmonary embolism.
However, wheezing persisted and low O2 saturations (~91% room air) persisted after significant volume removal.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate showed patient had an RSV infection.
Of note, viral cultures of the nasopharyngeal aspirate grew HSV 1, which was felt to be a normal colonizer of the patient's respiratory tract.
By the time the HSV culture returned ([**2-27**]), the patient's respiratory status was at baseline; no antiviral for HSV was felt to be indicated.
Upon discharge, the patient had clear lungs to auscultation bilaterally and had an normal O2 saturation on room air.
Sleep study was recommended as an outpatient to evaluate the need for home BiPAP.
Venogram was performed in anticipation of outpatient fistula placement.
His acidemia improved with dialysis and adjustment of diasylate bath.
