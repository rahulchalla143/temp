PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation revealed temperature recorded at 102.6, blood pressure 111/64, heartrate 140, respiratory rate 20, 98% on room air.
Head and neck examination revealed head normocephalic and atraumatic.
Ear, nose and throat examination failed radiation changes in the anterior and lateral neck, no fluctuance and scar was present.
Gastrointestinal, soft, nontender, nondistended and bowel sounds were present.
Genitourinary examination revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness, no suprapubic tenderness.
Musculoskeletal extremity examination revealed no spinal or paraspinal tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory data revealed white blood cell count of 11.5, hematocrit 30.4, platelets 316, sodium 141, potassium 4.8, chloride 98, carbon dioxide 30, BUN 39 and creatinine of 1.0 with a glucose of 177.
Chest x-ray taken in the Emergency Room revealed no evidence of pneumonia.
The lumbar puncture was performed in the Emergency Room and during this lumbar puncture he became dyspneic complaining of neck swelling, throat closure and was taken to the Operating Room for emergency intubation which was unsuccessful secondary to questionable airway edema and emergently had his old closed tracheostomy sites accessed by endotracheal tube and was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit.
The patient continued to be treated on Vancomycin, Clindamycin, Levofloxacin for presumed postoperative otorhinolaryngology infection, however, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures from admission remained negative and computerized tomography scans of the neck and chest did not reveal any abscesses.
However, the computerized tomography scan of the neck did show some marked edema posterior and of the hypopharynx with a questionable right density versus aneurysm of the right jugular vein versus jugular ectasia but normal flow by ultrasound and no further concern for septic thrombophlebitis.
On [**5-3**] he was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a hematocrit of 23 and bloody airway secretions and on [**5-7**] was transferred to the floor where he remains hemodynamically stable and successfully weaned to a tracheostomy mask on [**5-6**].
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with a home physical therapy consult and home safety evaluation and will follow up with Otorhinolaryngology.
