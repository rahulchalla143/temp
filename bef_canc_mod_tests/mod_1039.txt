In the ED, she was febrile to 102, SBP was in the 80's initially, and lactate was 3.8.
She was given 2L NS but blood pressure remained in the 70 - 80's systolic; a right IJ was placed and she was placed on a code sepsis, with initiation of levophed.
She was taken off the flagyl and cipro once stool studies were returned with C. diff, and she completed a two week course of PO vanco for the C. diff (ended on [**2141-5-30**]).

Poorly aerated retrocardiac region, limiting evaluation of left lower lobe.
[**2141-6-9**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
No pneumoperitoneum or marked dilatation of the transverse colon to establish toxic megacolon, but clinical correlation is important.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-5-15**], the findings are similar.
[**2141-6-23**] CT CHEST: Persistent, extensive, and severe emphysema is observed.
Two right lower lobe non-calcified pulmonary nodules are seen, which are 6 mm in size (series 2, image 40).

-Try to maintain ostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day.
-If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
HTN/AFIB Management: -Patients taking 40mg of PO Linisopril prior to surgical admission.
-Titrate Lisinopril back up to pre-admission dose as blood pressure tolerates.
