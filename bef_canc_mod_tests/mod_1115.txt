no drift, motor full, sensory intact  Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2129-5-11**]: 1.
CT Torso [**2129-5-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Cspine [**2129-5-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**2129-5-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI BRAIN +/- [**2129-5-12**]: 1.
Contusion/hemorrhage- subacute hematoma is less likely given the lack of negative susceptibility foci and decreased attenuation and lack of hemorrhage on the prior CT head study.
CTA [**2129-5-13**]: 1.
TTE [**5-17**]: EF greater than 55% IMPRESSION: No PFO, ASD or cardiac source of embolism seen.
His repeat Head CT on [**5-12**] was stable and off profolol the patient was moving all extremities and following commands.
He also underwent a Brain MRI to r/o an underlying brain mass.
The MRI  showed area of increased signal intensity, in the right parietal lobe measuring approximately 5.4 x 3.6 cm.
He underwent LP [**5-13**] showing normal glucose, protein and cell count.
Neurology was consulted for stroke workup which was negative.
Thransthoracic echocardiogram showed a Normal EF and was negative for ASD, PFO or clot.
Carotid dopplers showed less than 40 percent stenosis bilaterally.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] in 4 weeks with an MRI Brain with and without contrast.
