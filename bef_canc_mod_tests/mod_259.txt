Following pt's catheterization on [**7-24**], pt was intubated and transferred to CCU.
Pt was re-intubated on [**7-25**] when became hypoxic (o2 40%).
Pt again failed PS trial on day prior to discharge as pt became tachy with high rr (40s) on PS of 18.

2) STEMI: On [**7-23**] pt had elevated TPN level and EKG with STE V1-V4 with TWI.
On [**7-24**] pt had acute chest pain and received cardiac catheterization which revealed only mild disease except known disease to RCA with good collaterals and apical ballooning.
No current apneic episodes Given LE weakness and ?LUE weakness, neuro suggested L&T spine CT and repeat head CT which were done on [**8-5**] and were negative.
An EMG performed on [**7-26**] was c/w general axonal sensorimotorpolyneruopathy, ?superimposed proximal myopathy; not c/w NMJ disorder (LEMS or MG), though the study was limited.
