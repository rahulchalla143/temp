An EKG done at the office showed new LBBB, so the patient was sent to [**Hospital **] hospital for a work up, where three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative, no events on tele, and a TTE showeda 1.1cm squared aortic valve area.
The patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] for left and right heart catheterization to evaluate coronaries and aortic valve.
Aortic valve area was 1.8cm squared with a mean gradient of 17. .
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: LABS/STUDIES EKG: NSR, LBBB, diffuse STD's and TWI .
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: From OSH on [**7-3**] valve area 1.0 cm square, EF 55% .
CARDIAC CATH: [**2144-7-3**] LMCA: normal LAD: nonsignificant plaque LCX: 90% proximal RCA: 90% crux Severely depressed EF 20% AV gradient 17, valve area 1.8 .
LABORATORY DATA: OSH: Total cholesterol 189, LDL 122, HDL 52, TG 75 .
[**2144-7-10**] ECHO Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The inferior, infero-septal and infero-lateral walls are hypokinetic.The remaining left ventricular segments contract normally.
LV systolic fxn is mildly reduced, with HK of the inferior, infero-septal and lateral walls, and AK of the apex.

He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe two vessel disease and mild aortic stenosis.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2).
Mr. [**Known lastname 79623**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no associated significant ICA or CCA stenosis.
He was later transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
