Pertinent Results: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler examination of the right and left common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins were performed and demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentability and respiratory variation and flow.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: eval r heart border for mass  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with CP p/w b/l cellulitis and tachycardia and hypotension REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval r heart border for mass HISTORY: Tachycardia and hypotension with suspicious poor definition of the right heart border.
If clinically necessary to exclude pathology, CT would be required.
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2135-4-4**].
Repeated PA and lateral radiographs after improvement of patient's volume status are highly recommended.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.

Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension/tachycardia/Volume Overload - Initially, in the ED he had stable vital signs but then developed hypotension with SBP in 90's and HR 135 unresponsive to fluids.
On admission to the ICU, given the lack of fever, normal lactate and no SIRS criteria, it was [**Last Name (un) **] that his assymtomatic low blood pressure was not sepsis.
An EKG showed aflutter with 2:1 block suggesting that his BP may be due to low CO due to arrythmia.
He was again found to be in A-flutter (at a rate of 132).
An echo was ordered with the results as above.
Visiting nurse will check INR at home (next on [**2135-11-4**]) and call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] - PCP with results.
Wound cultures grew MRSA and he was eventually changed to po doxycycline.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need a repeat Chest CT to evaluate for mass (question of this was raised on portal film).
A repeat UA advised in clinic.
You are being given a medication (Metoprolol XL) to slow down your heart rate and prevent the atrial flutter from causing your symptoms.
Due to your high risk for a blood clot, you are also being given medications to thin your blood (coumadin/warfarin).
INR checks will be done at home by th evisiting nurse, starting tomorrow ([**2135-11-4**]).
This may interfere with INR levels.
You should get a urine test to look for blood when you visit Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**].
Also thyroid tests should be checked in the next 4-6 weeks with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] as they were mildly abnormal available.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2392**].
INR will be checked at home by visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2974**] [**2135-11-4**].
