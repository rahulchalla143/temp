His gap closed by the morning of [**2131-12-12**] and he was transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] Lantus along with a sliding scale [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.
His glucose remained under fair control.
His hematocrit dropped as low as 20 during admission.
He had an EGD [**2131-12-13**] that showed severe grade 4 erosive esophagitis as the likely source of his bleeding.
CKMB was normal, troponin trended down with improvement in his hematocrit and he denied chest pain.
His post-void residuals were followed, and this resolved.
Stool studies were negative for c-diff and campylobacter.
Remainder of stool studies remain pending at the time of discharge.
