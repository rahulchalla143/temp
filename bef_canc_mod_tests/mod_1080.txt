In [**11-15**] he was noted to have a baseline weight of 184 pounds.
As per most recent note, it was unclear of the accuracy of pulse ox readings and patient noted to have oxygen sats of 85% 4 liters ([**Last Name (un) 69130**] finger probe) vs 89%4 liters oxygen (ear probe), consistent with ABG drawn simultaneously on 4 liters on [**2114-2-15**].
[**2113-11-20**] overnight oximetry demonstrated average oxygen sats of 93-96% on 50% venti face mask, and 2 minutes 50 seconds with SpO2<89%.
He is undergoing evaluation for the utility of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to COPD and ?component of OSA.
CXR was done and showed no edema or infiltrate.
His vitals upon transfer to the floor were HR 101, BP 108/58, RR 18, O2 sat 97% on 4L NC.
Diastolic CHF, EF 70% in [**2113-7-8**].

CXR [**2114-2-21**]: The lungs are hyperexpanded with biapical lucencies and bibasilar fibrosis, consistent with COPD.
TTE [**2114-2-23**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-3**], no definite change seen.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  .
Repeat TTE with bubble study did not show any significant shunt ([**1-9**] PFO) physiology contributing to his hypoxia.
Given lack of improvement in his symptoms, a CT chest was ordered and showed no signs of infection.
#  Sinus Tachycardia: Likely [**1-9**] pulmonary etiology, could alternatively be [**1-9**] albuterol and volume depletion, as he was consistently negative in terms of his fluid balance.
# History of embolic stroke/Factor V Leiden Heterozygosity: Patient was anticoagulated on coumadin with therapeutic INR on admission.
He was bridged with lovenox until his INR was therapeutic ([**1-10**]) for 24 hours.
