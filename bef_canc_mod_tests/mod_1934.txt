He was found to be hypoxic to the 60s at his rehab facility so EMS was called and he was placed on a NRB with sats at 92% on 10L in the field.
On exam he had poor air movement, mild exp wheezes right base, sounded "tight".
CXR shows little change from prior xrays, no evidence of infiltrates.
CHF with diastolic dysfxn 5.
DM type 2, diet controlled 8.

CXR showed no significant interval change from prior films, and there was no radiographic or clinical evidence of worsening pulmonary edema (note BNP was 1184 which is improved prior levels) or pneumonia.
ABG showed 7.3/76/76/47 which is consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation.
He was given albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments for possible bronchospasm (he may have underlying obstructive component, possibly asthma, although recent pulmonary function tests would be needed to confirm this), 80mg IV lasix, and was placed on his home Bipap settings overnight.
Upon [**Month/Day/Year **], his goal oxygen saturation is greater than 80% on oxygen supplementation.
Please consider re-hospitalization if oxygen saturations fall below 80%.
Of note, he had mild acute renal injury with elevated creatinine 1.3 upon admission, which was attributed to pre-renal azotemia (supported by FeUrea 32%).
BiPap - Overnight BiPap settings of 20/18 with 10 liters of supplemental oxygen 10. oxygen - 2-4 liters of continuous oxygen via nasal cannula.
Titrate for O2 saturations greater than 90%.
You received a chest x-ray and laboratory tests which were reassuring.
We made the following changes to your medications: - Please start albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing  It was a pleasure caring for you.
