Liver was consulted and agreed to do endoscopy non-urgently; however, given patient was hemodynamically unstable due to withdraw (tachycardia, agitated, tachypnic)- this was deferred to an outpatient process.
His BP was consistently normal to high.
His heart rate came down appropriately.
# Fever and infiltrate:  CXR and CT indicated LLL pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
Urine culture was negative.
We were not able to perform the endoscopy due to your vital signs being unstable secondary to your alcohol withdraw.
