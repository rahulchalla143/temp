Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2195-2-6**]):       Less than 60 columnar epithelial cells; Specimen inadequate for       detecting respiratory viral infection by DFA testing.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2195-2-19**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
BLOOD CULTURE/URINE CULTURE AND STOOL FOR CDIFF AT MULTIPLE TIMES WERE NEGATIVE  =========== IMAGING: ===========  CXRAY ON [**2-4**]: Chest single frontal view.
There is increased opacity at the lateral right lung base which could relate to underlying scarring and is likely similar in appearance to CT from [**2192-7-8**] scout view.
CHEST CT ON [**2-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST CT ON [**2-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST CT ON [**2-11**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Gas tracking along the sites of previous right and left chest tubes, raising the possibility of ongoing extrathoracic air leak.
CT TORSO W CONTRAST ON [**2195-2-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
The lesion's MR features are suggestive of a benign serous neoplasm.
=============== PROCEDURES: =============== BRONCH ON [**2-12**]: Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with percutaneous dilational tracheostomy and serial airway balloon occlusion.
Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with successful percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, and serial airway balloon occlusion was performed with identification of an air leak from all three RUL segments.
#Hypoxemic Resp Failure- The patient had a pmh significant for very severe COPD on home O2 and he was admitted for respiratory distress leading to hypercarbichypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be related to his COPD.
On arrival the the ED he was initially placed on BIPAP which he continue to be hypoxic and hypotensive, there was a concern for pneumothorax given his hx of blebs on CT scan.
Upon entry of the needle into the thorax, a large rush of air return was noted, however the patient continued to be hypotensive and a needle compression was also subsequently performed on the left.
Both chest tubes were subsequently seen in the lung on CT imaging.
Possible right lower lobe infiltrate seen on imaging and he was covered with vancomycin and Cefepime.
Right chest tube was readjusted by thoracics on day #2 and they felt it was placed in the pleural space, even though CT chest revealed possible position in lung.
The viral cultures and sputum cultures were also negative.
There were many attempts to place pt on pressure support for trials of SBT which he failed due to labile BP and agitation.
Once sedation was lighten, the patient would become more agitated, SBP would then range from 150s-160s by BP cuff [**Location (un) 1131**] and up to the 200s in the A-line [**Location (un) 1131**].
This seem to have helped with the agitation, but his BP remained labile.
He also had a repeat bronch that showed some bronchial bleeding.
He had pan culture and repeat chest CT that showed interval increase in the size of bilateral pulmonary consolidations which were most compatible with aspiration pneumonia.
He had bronch lavage and pan cultures sent which were all negative; however pt persisted with ?
pneumonia on image and he was initially treated for 8 day course of antibiotics which was prolonged to 14 days since his clinical picture was still concerning for infection and he had increase in his WBC and recent procedure with placement of bronchial valves.
His LFT's also had a marked increase to ALT 4830, AST 7800,  AP 114.
His Tbili: 1.9, Dbili: 1.3, LDH: 6550, IRN 1.8 were also elevated with decrease in his HCT 29 which was initially concerning for DIC or hemolytic anemia.
developement of new pneumonia and CT abd showed distended gall bladder with hyperemia and pericholecystic fluid consistent with acute cholecystitis.
All his cultures remained negative.
We checked cortisol levels and attempted an ECHO which was unable to give us US image given amount of subcutaneous air in his chest.
Patient with CT abdomen/pelvis showed dialated gallbladder, concerning for cholecystitis, less likely cholangitis particularly in light of fevers and leukocytosis.
His LDH was up, as well as his Tbil which was concerning for DIC/ hemolytic anemia.
His fibrinogen was normal and his smear did not show [**Last Name (LF) 21802**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] less likely to be DIC.
His Hct and plalets remained stable.
His INR peaked at 1.8 in the setting of ?
