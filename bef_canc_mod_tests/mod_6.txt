In the Emergency Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic with an INR of 9.8.
Repeat hematocrit several hours later dropped to a value of 13.
The nasogastric tube was placed on the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred to the General Medicine Floor on [**2177-11-28**].
Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with temperature of 96.8, blood pressure 90/55, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 96% on 3 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data upon admission revealed complete blood count demonstrated a white blood cell count 19.2, hematocrit 19.0, platelets 381.
Coagulation profile showed PT 38.5, PTT 38.0, INR 9.8.
Serum chemistries showed sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 30, BUN 52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 196.
Liver function tests showed ALT 18, AST 26, amylase 23, lipase 24, albumin 3.4, alkaline phosphatase 100.
Cardiac enzymes showed creatinine kinase 82, troponin I 0.04.
Chest x-ray was negative for any acute pulmonary process.
Abdominal x-ray demonstrated opacification of the right lung base.
Later computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess, bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer, appendicitis or diverticulitis.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis, prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new.
This was compared with the prior electrocardiogram from [**2177-10-9**].
His hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.
His gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
After stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.
While on the floor, his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.
On [**2177-12-3**], the patient underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.
He had a normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his hospital course and were consistent with changes status post large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing hemolysis.
Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2177-11-28**] the patient began to complain of right upper extremity pain and swelling.
Doppler ultrasound demonstrated an axillary deep vein thrombosis.
The computerized tomography scan was performed to better examine the right upper extremity soft tissues.
Computerized tomographic venogram was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis, however.
Examination was consistent with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging of the right lower extremity.
His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a goal INR of 2 to 3.
At the time of discharge he was maintaining saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.
fingersticks, fingerstick blood glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding scale.
Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000 mcg p.o.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed a diabetic heart-healthy diet.
Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula, ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 243**] intake without nausea or vomiting.
Combivent 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.
He will decide on the timing and the necessity of any further testing or studies that will be required including any further gastrointestinal workup for bleeding.
He will follow up on the biopsy results from the patient's last esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
The patient should have his INR level checked daily while at the rehabilitation facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted appropriately with goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
