DIAGNOSTICS: DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**2180-9-9**] DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER: The liver demonstrates heterogeneous echogenicity, findings consistent with patient's known history of cirrhosis.
Evaluation of the tail is limited by overlying bowel gas.
There is a mild amount of perihepatic and left upper quadrant ascites, which is new compared to prior ultrasound though similar compared to recent CT examination.
LIVER DOPPLER: Color and pulse wave Doppler examination of the hepatic vasculature demonstrates a patent main portal vein with a peak systolic velocity of 44 cm/sec compared to 59 cm/sec on recent prior.
The peak systolic velocity in the distal TIPS measures 134 cm/sec compared to 121 cm/sec on the prior.
The main hepatic artery demonstrates normal arterial Doppler waveform with a peak systolic velocity of 85 cm/sec.
Small amount of perihepatic and left upper quadrant ascites, which is new compared to prior ultrasound though similar compared to recent CT examination.
PERTINENT LABS ON DISCHARGE:   Brief Hospital Course: 31 y.o.
Hct drop from 24 to 21.
PRBC transfusion was given.
The pt's Hct dropped to 16.9 and she was taken to IR to embolize the bleeding duodenal varix and subsequently transferred to the CCU.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed.
Drain fluid was sent for cell count and culture on [**9-22**].
Culture of fluid isolated 2 species of Acinetobacter Baumanii pan-sensitive except Bactrim.
Fluid was re-sent on [**9-25**] demonstrating 94 WBC and 21 polys.
Culture was negative.
Creatinine started to rise.
Liver US/Duplex demonstrated patent arteries with resistive index in the right hepatic artery  0.7 to 0.78,  main hepatic artery was 0.78 to 0.79, and left hepatic artery was 0.68.
The middle, right, and left hepatic veins were patent with normal waveforms.
Repeat liver duplex was unchanged.
Creatinine continued to rise to 3.2 then decrease.
On [**10-9**], a liver biopsy was performed for rising alk phos.
An ERCP was then done on [**10-11**] noting CBD stricture; duct was stented.
Head CT was normal.
Creatinine normalized.
Serum specific IgE to peanuts and other common food allergens were sent, and she was given an EpiPen script on discharge.
Results of blood tests were to be reviewed at that time.
