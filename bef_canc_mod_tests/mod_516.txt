The patient has been febrile with his temperature maximum of 104.0 F., on the afternoon of [**2166-9-15**].
The patient also received one half ampule of D50 and liter of D5 normal saline with a blood sugar of 51.
His blood sugar returned to [**Location 213**] following this intervention.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially saturating in the mid-90s on room air; however, over the course of the next several hours, the patient's oxygen requirement increased to 6 liters nasal cannula to maintain his oxygen saturation in the mid 90s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature maximum 101.9 F.; temperature currently 99.1 F.; blood pressure 104/62; heart rate 104; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation 97% on five liters.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 7.1, hemoglobin 14.7, hematocrit 42.4, platelets 156, 63 neutrophils, 28 bands, 5 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes, zero eosinophils, zero basophils, one atypical, one meta and one myelocyte.
Chemistries with sodium 132, potassium 3.9, chloride 95, bicarbonate 25, BUN 35, creatinine 3.1, glucose 51, ALT 29, AST 54, CK 854, alkaline phosphatase 70, amylase 18, lipase 15, total bilirubin 0.5.
CK MB 4, troponin 0.11.
Blood cultures were drawn.
Chest x-ray on admission with cardiomegaly.
CARDIAC:  Three sets of cardiac enzymes were obtained on admission.
These CK MB were normal but the troponin were mildly elevated with a maximum of 0.14.
An echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate his cardiac function.
The left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Therefore, he had a cardiac MRI on [**2166-9-24**].
On [**2166-9-20**], a chest CT scan was obtained to further evaluate his pulmonary process.
However, the patient's creatinine remained elevated in the mid to high 2s following rehydration.
A urinalysis revealed moderate blood, negative nitrites, 500 protein, 100 glucose, negative ketone, negative bilirubin, negative urobilinogen.
Given the patient's pulmonary and renal processes, Wegener's granulomatosis was considered to be a possibility, with patient having negative ANCA.
A renal biopsy is planned for [**2166-9-29**].
However, his blood sugars have now returned to [**Location 213**] to high range.
