Postoperatively the patient experienced motor and sensory changes status post AngioJet thrombolysis and returned to the OR for Removal of [**Last Name (un) 73395**]-[**Doctor Last Name 6632**] catheter, serial arteriogram of right lower extremity, balloon angioplasty of right posterior tibial artery, and perclose closure of left common femoral arteriotomy (Reader referred to operative notes for details).
Cardiac enzymes were elevated postoperatively given his extensive cardiac history patient was sent for cardiac catheterization on [**2173-10-11**] which revealed existing known blockages but patency of graft sites.
His oxygen saturations regained when his airway was controlled.
Elevated CK was likely due to ischemic right foot and Troponins and CK trended down during his stay.
A TTE was performed of limited quality due to body habitus which showed mild hypokinesis of the apical and basalateral ventrical but with preserved EF of greater than 55%.
Vital signs were routinely monitored through hist stay.
He was comfortable on room air and vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; the patient received 1 unit of PRBCs on [**2173-10-10**], [**2173-10-12**], and [**2173-10-16**] for HCT less than 30 in light of evidence of heart strain via elevated cardiac enzymes.
Thereafter, HCT remained stable and CE were downtrending.
His hematocrit upon discharge was 30.0  The patient was otherwise asymptomatic, and hemodynamically stable.
