She reportedly presented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital yesterday with similar complaints and was found to have a WBC of 21.
She was given Ceftriaxone 1g and Vancomycin (at 3:25pm), and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, the patient's initial VS were T 101.2, P 76, BP 126/60, R 18, O2 99% on 4L.
She was unable to have a LP because her INR was 2.7, and there was concern that her picture was more consistent with an epidural abscess.
Neurology was consulted, who recommended LP after INR reversal.
Neurosurgery was then C/S, who recommended CT spine with contrast, as a MRI cannot be performed because of her pacemaker.
At the time of transfer, her VS were 76, 147/59, 17, 96% on 2L.

Pertinent Reports CT Spine with contrast ([**2155-3-4**]): No evidence of abscess on noncontrast CT.
Note that this study has low sensitivity for infection.
If the patient cannot undergo MR imaging, a contrast CT may be the next best alternative, although far less useful for detecting intraspinal infection.

CT neck did not show epidural abscess while CT head at outside hospital was negative for acute intracranial process.
LP obtained 20 hours out from presentation showed few WBC ([**5-17**]), RBC (diluting from tube 1 to 4) with normal protein and glucose.
She was clinically doing well with no fever, improved mental status and mild headache and neck pain so she was transferred to the floor for further workup and evaluation.
Flexion/Extension X-ray of the neck showed no evidence of subluxation.
Creatinine of 1.4 on admission with baseline of 1.0.
She then developed a new oxygen requirement and CXR showed some concern for vascular congestion and fluid overload.
She was diuresed aggressively and her creatinine rose to 1.6.
Clinical exam and urine lytes showed a pre-renal picture and the patient's lasix was temporarily held and she was given IV fluids.
INR was elevated as she had been on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and splenic vein thrombosis.
INR dropped below 2 and a heparin drip was started pending decision for any invasive procedures.
INR trended up above 2 and her LMWH was discontinued.
On [**3-18**], an abd CT was done to evaluate for repeat bleeding.
LFTs increased and liver duplex was done concerning for impaired hepatic artery flow.
CTA was done noting concerns for hepatic artery stenosis.
On [**3-25**], IR performed an angiogram via the right common femoral artery placing a 6 mm x 18 mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18979**] [**Last Name (un) 2435**] in the main hepatic artery.
A head CT was negative for mass or bleed.
