Admission Date:  [**2138-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-10-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: coronary catherterization  History of Present Illness: 81 y old male with hx of dyslipidemia, HTN, CAD s/p NQWMI in '[**32**] s/p bare metal stenting of proximal and mid LAD as well as OM1 presented to ED by ambulance with acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, was found to have STE >5mm in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 along with 3-4mm ST depression in I and aVL.
Code STEMI was called, pt was given ASA 325mg, plavix 600mg (although takes plavix at home), Heparin 5000 units x 1, Integrillin 17mg IVx1 and then transferred to cath lab.
Pt quickly realized the urgency of the situation as the sx's very similar to his prior MI and therefore asked his friend to [**Name2 (NI) **] 911.
His last colonoscopy was 7-8 years ago and was normal.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.4, BP 98/69, HR 62, RR 19, SaO2 100% on 2L Gen: male appearing younger than stated age in NAD.

Echo ([**9-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2130-12-21**], the regional left ventricular wall motion abnormality is new and the ascending aorta and arch are now identified as dilated.
On the second day the pace was briefly needed but then heart rate remained in to 60-s and 70s, therefore the pacer was removed after 48hrs, lopressor was again started after 72 hrs without a drop in the heart rate (bradycardia improved as expected since RCA reperfused) Enzymes were negative in the emergency room, but second set came back VERY elevated at CK 2713, Trop T 11.23, CK-MB 363 and MB index of 13.4.
An echo was done to r/o wall motion abnormalities determine EF demonstrating mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction, and LVEF = 45-50 % c/w CAD.
