Findings which suggesting a large air pocket in the lower mediastinum, which may reflect a dilated viscus or extraluminal air-fluid collection, as well as persistent and potentially increased intraperitoneal air; correlation to CT performed on the same day is recommended.
Differential considerations include aspiration and pneumonia are not excluded, however.
[**2197-4-22**] G-J tube study : Brisk leakage of contrast from the known distal esophageal leak site filling the paraesophageal collection and layering along the right hemidiaphragm without evidence of reflux superiorly in the mediastinum.

Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules for which follow-up chest CT in one year can be performed.
[**2197-5-12**] G/J tube study : 30 mL of Gastrografin was injected into the J-tube.
[**2197-5-13**] CXR :  Again seen is left-sided PICC line with tip over proximal SVC, bilateral L>R effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, and upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.

He was given broad spectrum antibiotics and emergently taken to the Operating Room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and repair of a Colles staple line perforation.
His intra op peritoneal fluid cultures grew mixed bacterial types and he completed a 14 day course of Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole.
His WBC was 11K.
He developed a temp of 102, lethargy and tachycardia on [**2197-4-22**] and a G-J tube study revealed a leak at the Colles suture line.
He was pan cultured and his WBC rose to 12K.
A EGD was done on [**2197-4-25**] and an esophageal stent was placed to obliterate the leak.
Over the next few days his diet was advanced to clears, all cultures were negative and his abdominal wound was healing.
His JP drainage was decreasing as well.
Unfortunately he had another fever on [**2197-5-4**] and a subsequent EGD revealed no visible leak but the mucosa was very edematous and friable.
His WBC rose to 15.9 but quickly decreased after treatment.
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow service a few days ago for a full evaluation due to his prolonged period of not eating.
His room air saturations are 97% but he still gets nebulizer treatments to help him cough up secretions.
Allopurinol, 300mg PO daily 7.
