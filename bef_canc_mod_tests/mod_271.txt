He states that 30 hours after he had a bone scan to evaluate for metastases he began to develop fevers and chills.
His highest temperature was 101.1 on the morning of presentation.
In the ED, his Tmax was 100.6, with HR 90's to 100's and BP 114-130's/60's.
This is what led to the bone scan to ensure there were no mets.

Family History: positive for breast cancer, DM  Physical Exam: vitals T 99.2, BP 110/58, HR 95, RR 20, O2 sat 98% RA General: pleasant male in NAD.
HEENT: NCAT, anicteric sclera, non-injected conjunctiva, PERRLA, EOMI, OP mildly erythematous without exudate.
Pulses 2+ radial and DP and symmetric Neuro: CNII- XII in tact.
Reflexes 2+ bicep on right (IV on left), brachioradialis bilaterally, patellar on right.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities bilaterally in proximal and distal muscle groups.
[**2108-1-31**] MRI L spine:  IMPRESSION:  Limited, but unchanged lumbar MRI with no definite epidural abscess, discitis, or osteomyelitis identified.
[**2108-2-1**] CT chest: 1.
[**2108-2-1**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial nocardiosis or other acute process.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2108-2-9**] 2:53 AM There has been no significant change compared to one day prior.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2108-2-17**] 6:00 PM PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST: Again seen are large loculated right upper and lower lung effusions.
CXR with continued slight improvement.
Serologies sent for mycoplasma infection are pending.
No evidence of nocardia, fungus, or AFB on BAL gram stain and cultures.
Infectious etiologies include pneumonia vs. parapneumonic effusion vs, endocarditis (new murmur on exam no heard during PCP visit last month or documented on ECHO- although systolic murmur heard at the base not apex more suggestive of flow murmur secondary to fever), UTI (U/A mostly clean).
CT head was done to look for disseminated nocardosis as he recently finished a course of minocycline for nocardia infection.
The pleural fluid initially suggested an exudate with pH 6.6, glucose 0, protein 3.2 and 900+ WBC with 98% polys.
This suggested malignancy, parapneumonic effusion, empyema; however, the gram stains and cultures were negative implying malignancy as the cause.
# NSSLC: Recent CT and bone scan show no suggestion of metastases.
CT chest was done and suggested there was a new mass and worsening effusion.
