Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes and right lower lobe, which may be due to infectious or inflammatory etiology.
A followup CT scan is recommended in 3 months.
[**8-4**]: Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[**8-4**]: CT chest: New moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral basilar atelectasis.
[**8-4**]: CT neck: No evidence of lymphadenopathy noted on this neck CT. Sinus disease.
[**8-6**]: CT sinuses: The left sphenoid cell is almost completely opacified.
[**8-4**]: CT pelvis: There has been interval left total hip replacement, which is noted to cause a large amount of streak artifact in the pelvis, slightly limiting evaluation for signs of infection.
If there is strong clinical suspicion, a MRI or white blood cell scan would be helpful.
[**8-12**]: Head MRI: FINDINGS:  Again, note is made of pontine abscess with ring enhancement, which has increased in size compared to the prior study and now spreading across the midline to the right side of the pons, with increased amount of surrounding edema.
[**8-30**]: MRI head: Compared to examinations performed at the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**], and even to the study of [**2111-8-21**], there is less edema in the dorsal pontine body, than on previous studies.
Diffusion signal hyperintensity persists, and may represent residual liquified material within the abscess.
The left upper quadrant accumulation of activity was not positively confirmed as free pertechnetate; however, were this to represent bleeding, the rate of bleeding was not brisk.
[**9-9**]: MRI Head: No significant interval change seen involving the examination of the brain since [**2111-8-30**].
An area of residual enhancement is still present along the posterior aspect of the pons and upper medulla with some diffusion abnormality still present suggestive of a partially resolving posterior pontine abscess.
The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable.
EEG [**2111-9-30**] : Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.

Upon further review of the entire MRI study by the radiology service, it was felt that this lesion more likely represented an abscess given that it was ring-enhancing on T1 with gadolinium.
A lumbar puncture revealed pleocytosis and elevated protein; gram stain was negative; serologic and laboratory studies on CSF remained negative.
An HIV antibody was sent and returned negative.
A CT scan of the left hip was performed which showed no evidence of infection of the replacement hip.
CT of the sinuses were performed and showed evidence of mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus.
Further workup should take place once the patient is in better condition, i.e.
A biopsy would have been the only means to make the ultimated diagnosos, but this procedure was considered to be too dangerous (per Neurosurgery).
On hospital day ten, a repeat MR of the head was performed to assess for response of the lesion to a course of antibiotics.
Unfortunately, the MR revealed extension in the size of the lesion.
The pt showed evidence of worsening clinically on hospital day twelve with a small (1mm) but reactive right pupil and sluggishly reactive (although normal-sized) left pupil as well as evidence of a left cranial nerve twelve palsy.
Yet another MR of the head was performed which showed stable size of the lesion from the study of two days prior.
The antibiotic regimen at this point was changed to meropenem (to cover gram positive and negative organisms as well as Nocardia) and ambisome to cover fungal pathogens.
A repeat MRI of the head was performed to reassess the lesion on hospital day 18.
Further MRI studies ([**8-30**] and [**9-9**]) showed continued improvement.
To evaluate an episode of altered mental status, an EEG was obtained that showed no epileptiform waves but did show patterns consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.
Follow up MRI was done on day if discharge.
Atrial fibrillation:  On admission, the pt was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 130s.
The patient than developed a GI bleed, while her INR was supratherapeutic and her platelets were dropping.
She is currently rate controlled on digoxin (last level 1.1 on [**10-8**]) and metoprolol 25 mg QID with hr ranging from 90-120.
Cultures were only notable for MRSA in her sputum.
Her blood pressure has been lowish with SBP in the loww 100's.
Their workup remained negative (see below).
Heparin Abs were negative and lab results did not suggest intravascular hemolysis.
Currently, hct stable around  28 and plt 150's and have remained stable in the week prior to discharge.
an EGD [**9-3**] showed no active bleed but an AVM that might have bled.
Further workup should be considered only once she has recovered.
Endocrine: The patient's glucose levels were adjusted per RISS and FSBS were followed.
PPX: pneumoboots, PPI, "ski-boots" for contractures, [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings or ace wraps for edema, OOB to chair.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.5 mg Injection every eight (8) hours as needed for agitation/anxiety.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response 4. gasterointestinal hemorrhage 5. thrombocytopenia 6. anemia 7. hypotension 8. steroid myopathy 9. sepsis   Discharge Condition: Fair   Discharge Instructions: Please continue medications as instructed.
Re-start lasix at recommend dose of 10 IV BID when BP stable (SBP>105)   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your Primary Care Physician after discharge from rehab.
