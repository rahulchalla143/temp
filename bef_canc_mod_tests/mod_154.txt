A chest X-ray showed a new opacity at the right lung base, so the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
The patient also had his systolic blood pressure drop to the high 80s, for which he was given 500cc bolus of NS.
On transfer, his vitals were manual BP 100/70 HR 76 reg temp down to 98.9po after Tylenol and 02 sat 95% 2.5L NP  On the floor, the patient was dyspneic after getting up to use the bathroom.

[**2-1**] echo IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with preserved regional and excellent global systolic function.
Given nodal agents that dropped his blood pressure, so given IVF's to maintain pressure but then had some element of flash edema with hypoxia, so sent to MICU where Diltiazem was initiated and converted him to NSR.
Pt still noted to have paroxysms of AFib on the floor, symptomatic if very rapid to >140, but tolerable if lower; lower rates were tolerated, and overall AFib was controlled.
CHF: CHF listed on patient's problem list, but no evidence based on TTE or Mibi.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -patient's atenolol was changed to diltiazem -patient's prednisone was tapered per his outpatinet GI's recs -patient was started on asa 325 for stroke prevention  Medications on Admission: 1. atenolol 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): hold for systolic blood pressure <110, hr <60.
Disp:*1 inhaler* Refills:*0* 14. codeine-guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for cough for 5 days.
This was complicated by low blood pressure and hypoxia and you were briefly in the ICU.
START Ipratropium 2 puffs four times a day for 10 days to control you cough 7.
