His PCP was concerned that he may have CHF, pneumonia, or aspiration and ordered a CXR which showed possible CHF and left base PNA.
EKG showed no ST changes, old RBB and LAFB and PAC's.
CXR from PCP's office before the fall showed likely CHF and L lower lobe PNA, patient refused repeat CXR.

Followup examination is recommended.
[**8-10**] CT Head w/o Contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
[**8-10**] CT spine w/o Contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
[**8-11**] ECHO IMPRESSION: At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
[**8-11**] CXR AP There is increased opacity in the left lower lobe, consistent with increasing pleural effusion and atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
ACTIVE ISSUES  #) Hypoxemia: CXR showed new left lower and middle lobe opacity.
On arrival to the MICU, amp/sulbactam and azithromycin were started to cover atypicals and anaerobes as pt has significant aspiration risk with Zenker's diverticulum.
He had been off of his lasix for 4weeks and he appeared slightly volume up on exam and chest x-ray showed vascular congestion.
Dry weight was unclear, but highest weight in past 2 years was during hospitalization at 115 lbs, normally ranges 100-113 in OMR.
Echo on [**8-11**] did not show evidence of CHF.
Hct trended and dropped to 20.7 on [**8-12**].
DIC unlikely based on INR not changed from baseline, baseline LDH, and normal billirubin.
Haptoglobin was low at 10, but Coombs was negative and reticulocyte count was low.
He was transfused 1u of RBCs on [**8-12**] for hct of 20.7 and was also started on home dose Lasix to prevent fluid overload.
Pt's initial hct of 29 on admission was most likely related to hemoconcentration as pt was not taking in good PO at home and was dehydrated.
Head /c-spine CT showed no fracture.
XRay hand revealed fracture, which was splinted by plastics.
Aspiration was a concern and pt was seen by speech and swallow while in MICU; video study deferred as pt's bedside swallowing trials were acceptable.
Pt's intermittent nausea and cough (may also be related to pneumonia) may suggest possible worsening of zencker diverticulum and thus outpatient barium swallow is recommended to evaluate chronic aspiration and diverticulum.
#Pneumonia: - continue PO augmentin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 7 days (started [**8-10**], end on [**2119-8-16**])  #Anemia: - f/u w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3638**] on [**9-27**] - monitor CBC - continue Vitamin B12 100 mcg PO daily - continue folic acid 1 mg PO daily  #Left hand fracture: - Keep hand elevated - Patient will FU in ortho hand clinic in one week following discharge or re-evaluated in one week  #Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid 100 mcg PO daily - check TSH and titrate synthroid accordingly  #Zencker Diverticulum - We recommend pt have an outpatient barium swallow to further investigate chronic aspiration  #Depression: - Pt requests outpatient psychiatry appointment for depression  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Your red blood cell count was low and we gave you a blood transfusion after getting approval from your PCP and hematologist.
We recommend you have a barium swallow study to evaluate how well you swallow food.
