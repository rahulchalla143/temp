On addition to the Emergency [**Doctor First Name **], the patient was lethargic with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing, dry mucous membranes, bradycardic on admission with a heart rate of 30 to 40, potassium of 6.2.
The patient was treated with one amp of D50, 5 units insulin, one amp of calcium gluconate, given Lasix for congestive heart failure verified by chest x-ray with poor response.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient's neurologic examination was significant for being able to open eyes spontaneously and reacting to painful stimuli.
The respiratory examination showed coarse breath sounds with rales in both bases.
He remains on room air and O2 saturation was 97%.
The heart rate was stable in the mid 70s, occasional bradycardic episodes with rates down to the 30s, occasional premature ventricular contractions rhythm, consistent also with atrial fibrillation.
The patient's vital signs on admission were a temperature of 99 F, a pulse of 65 to 90, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, and a blood pressure of 161/58.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of acute renal failure with creatinine going from 0.5 to 3.6 with minimal urine output.
His hospital course was significant for an increase in creatinine to a maximum of 7.3.
The differential diagnoses were thought to be acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis, possibly with minimal [**Last Name (un) **] disease.
The patient had significant proteinuria of 1.8 gm in 24 hours.
On return to the Medical floor the patient was noted to have a decrease of his systolic blood pressure to 75, which improved with 500 cc normal saline and gave a systolic blood pressure of 100.
Later in the evening, the patient had another episode of systolic blood pressure dropping below 70.
The hematocrit showed 20.2, down from 26.2 earlier in the day.
A CT scan of the abdomen obtained to assess for hematoma showed a right thigh hematoma, apparently from the venous source.
The patient was emergently transfused with one unit packed red blood cells and given additional 250 cc of normal saline bolus.
There was a systolic blood pressure reaching 100.
In summary of his diagnostic procedures done during the course of his hospital stay, the patient's initial electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 65.
In addition, the patient underwent several radiological examinations, the significant one being the CT scan on [**6-25**], which showed a large right groin hematoma, tracking along the right medial muscle, compartment to approximately the upper third of the femur.
The ultrasound of the patient's scrotum on [**6-25**] showed bilateral hydroceles.
Chest x-ray done on [**6-26**] showed right sided hemodialysis catheter tip in the distal SVC as a Quinton catheter was placed in the anterior thorax and there was no pneumothorax after the procedure.
There was also decreased pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure compared with the admission x-ray and there was persistent left lower lobe collapse / consolidation.
A Doppler study of the right thigh to discover the extent of venous flow within the right leg, although grossly limited study as described in its longer report, there was no definite evidence of a deep vein thrombosis.
The microbiological studies for the patient in summary: the stool studies never showed any Clostridium difficile and the urine culture was positive for yeast.
Blood cultures have been consistently negative with the exception of a presumed contaminant of Staphylococcus epidermitis.
