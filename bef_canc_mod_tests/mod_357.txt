Echocardiogram in [**2172-2-7**] with an ejection fraction of 50% and decreased right ventricular function.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs were temperature 101.7 f.; heart rate 92; blood pressure 101/53; respiratory rate of 35; oxygen saturation 87% on two liters.
Neurological examination showed the patient to be alert and oriented times three with normal and symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremities.
LABORATORY:  An EKG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 93 beats per minute with normal intervals.
Her labs on admission were a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.2, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 8.0, creatinine of 1.9, glucose of 145.
Blood gas with a pH of 7.32, a pCO2 of 54 and a pAO2 of 74.
White blood cell count of 18.6, with 67% neutrophils, 5% bands, a hematocrit of 44.2, and platelets of 278.
The patient's blood gas was taken on two liters of oxygen.
Past spirometry has shown an FEV1 of 0.59 which is 33% of predicted, vital capacity of 1.24 which is 49% predicted, and an FEV1/FEC of 67% predicted.
Chest x-ray on admission showed hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms bilaterally.
The patient presented with a temperature of 101.2 F, small opacity in the right lower lobe on chest x-ray and some yellow sputum that she states is at her baseline.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  In the Emergency Room, the patient required Bi-PAP mask in order to properly oxygenate and increase her oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
She was placed on a Bi-PAP nasal mask with pressure support of 8 and a PEEP of 5 and it was titrated to patient comfort to keep her respiratory rate less than 30.
After aggressive suctioning, the patient improved her saturation markedly with an oxygen saturation of 98% on three liters nasal cannula.
PNEUMONIA:  The patient was admitted with a fever of 101.7 F., and increased white blood cell count of 18 with 5% bands and a right lower lobe opacity was noted on the chest x-ray.
RENAL FUNCTION:  The patient was initially admitted with a high creatinine of 1.7, up from her baseline of 1.2.
It was assumed that the patient had prerenal insufficiency due to hypovolemia with a sodium of 138.
She complained of chest pain 10 out of 10 radiating to her left arm which improved with sublingual Nitroglycerin and morphine times two.
The cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained negative.
The patient's chest pain resolved and was assumed to be secondary to her pneumonia.
In addition, the patient was found to be hypertensive on the second day of admission, with a blood pressure of 170/80.
RENAL:  The patient was initially admitted with a creatinine of 1.7 which was up from her baseline of 1.2 to 1.3.
