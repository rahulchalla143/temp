The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: Left elbow radiograph dated [**2180-6-29**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the left elbow were obtained without administration of intravenous contrast.
Possibilities for further assessment include follow-up radiographs 7-10 days following the initial x-ray, MRI, or bone scan.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Note is made of MR of the pelvis dated [**2180-6-9**], and knee radiographs dated [**2180-6-30**].
The differential is extensive, but given the multifocal nature of the abnormality, it may represent changes of renal osteodystrophy Discharge Labs: [**7-5**] WBC 7.7, Hct 34.3, Plt 157 [**7-4**]: 134/4.5/94/27/45/5.9<103 Ca 6.7, Mg 2.4, Phos 6.0 [**7-5**] CK 22   Brief Hospital Course: 32 y/o female with complicated past medical history with SLE with decubitus ulcers admitted for fever and pain control.
Her basline blood pressure typically is SBP ~ 90's.
Stage IV decubitus sacral ulcer:  After exploration of her wound, there was fibrinous tissue and sacral bone.
Wound cultures grew out E. coli and Enterococcus.
However, sensitivities from her wound cultures eventually demonstrated that the enterococcus was tigicycline resistent.
She will also need weekly CK levels for daptomycin treatment.
L Knee: MRI demonstarted a joint effusion with synovitis.
Her fluid aspirate was sent to for culture, gram stain, and cell count.
Her culture results will need to be followed.
L CT Elbow CT scan: Concern for non-displaced fracture at radial head.
Recently, her Vitamin D has been increased.
Pain Control: She was evaluated by the Acute Pain Service team.
Nutrition: Her calorie count was low (~300 calories).
Recently her Calcitrol dose was changed from 0.25 to 0.5 mg, due to a PTH level of [**2176**] and CT findings consistent with osteopenia.
