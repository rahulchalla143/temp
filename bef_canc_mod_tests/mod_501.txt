MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2202-1-10**] 9:15 PM  MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: assess for perirectal abscess.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla magnet, including dynamic high-resolution 3D imaging, obtained prior to, during and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA.
2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were performed on an independent workstation.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 30339**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]: In the [**2-25**] o'clock position (when viewed lithotomy position, left-to-left/posterior) of the intersphincteric space situated approximately 2 cm proximal to the anus, an area of crescentic high signal intensity is identified on the T2-weighted imaging (series 6, image 26) that measures 1.5 cm AP x 7 mm TV x 1.5 cm SI, with a peripherally enhancing rim, consistent with a tiny abscess too small to drain.
Hospital course by problem below: Thrombocytopenia - platelet count of 69 on [**11-25**].
Platelet count on [**12-10**] was 14.
DIC labs were negative for chronic DIC.
Bone marrow biopsy showed ITP.
He was also transfused platelets on two occasions, when his platelets decreased below 10.  he experienced only minimal improvement in platelet counts after transfusion, from [**6-3**].
An abd CT was done on [**12-26**] to evaluate for splenic vein thrombosis.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed.
A repeat JP amylase on [**1-27**] was 2769.
Blood cultures grew pan sensitive e.coli.
A MRI was done noting small intersphincteric abscess from the 3 to 6 o'clock location (from lithotomoy position) on the left at the level of the levator ani.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
An abd CT was done revealing partially walled-off fluid in the left upper abdomen with air locules, interval progression of nonocclusive thrombus in the portal system, to a greater degree in the splenic vein and left portal vein, moderate left pleural effusion, and left nephroureteral stent in stable position, with moderate dilatation of the left renal pelvis, which has progressed from the prior study.
Coumadin was then started with goal inr achieved and discontinuation of heparin.
He was sent home on a coumadin dose of 0.5mg qd with inr to be drawn on [**2-10**].
Blood and urine cultures were again sent with the urine negative and blood cultures negative to date.
A CXR demonstrated L lung base atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion.
A CT guided exchange of the drain was done for failure of the JP to drain.
His tacrolimus levels were monitored and dose adjusted based on levels.
Labs were to be drawn on [**2-10**] with results fax'd to the [**Month/Year (2) 1326**] office.
Blood cultures from [**2-5**] finalization were pending (negative to date).
