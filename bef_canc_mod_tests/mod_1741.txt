Echocardiogram showed a normal EF and BNP was equivocal making cardiogenic pulmonary edema less likely as a cause for her resp failure.
CT revealed a large abdominal/pelvic mass thought to be a large hematoma and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgt.
Of note, her INR was supratherapeutic on arrival to [**Location (un) **] and was corrected with FFP.
She had been restarted on Heparin after her INR on [**2-17**] was 1.2.
Blood cultures from [**2-26**] were [**2-3**] positive for VRE from an arterial line.
This culture also grew 2 different isolates of coag negative staph.
The patient's mental status waxed and waned in the ICU prompting a head CT that was negative for bleed on [**2-26**].
ABG was 7.37/64/144 on 50% facemask.
Her urine output was reported to be 500cc to the last dose of furosemide on [**3-2**].

Reports:  CXR [**2-23**] 1) Cuff of endotracheal tube is overdistended and tip of vascular catheter abuts the apparent lateral wall of the superior vena cava.
2) Lingular and left lower lobe consolidation suggestive of pneumonia  CXR [**3-3**] SEMI-UPRIGHT AP CHEST: The patient is post median sternotomy.
CXR [**3-6**] Comparison is made with the prior film from [**2128-3-3**].
The atelectasis in the left lower lobe present in the prior chest x-ray has resolved.
CXR [**3-11**]  CT Head [**2-26**]  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, infarction or other acute intracranial pathology.
Chest CT [**3-5**] Impression:  1.
Chest CTA [**3-8**] 1) Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
[**3-11**] XRAY Flex/Ex C-spine These films are not labeled as to flexion or extension.
Although flexion and extension views were requested, these are not labeled as such.
EMG [**3-4**]   Complex, abnormal study.
The electrophysiologic findings are most suggestive of a severe, ongoing myopathy, superimposed on a generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy which is axonal in nature.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-3-13**] Stable CT appearance of the brain, allowing for limitations due to head motion.
IVC GRAM/FILTER [**3-14**] Successful placement of retrievable recovery IVC filter inferior to the level of the renal veins via right common femoral access  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C [**3-14**] ) A large, extraperitoneal heterogeneous mass representing a hematoma is seen arising from the left rectus abdominis muscle posteriorly.
Echo [**3-15**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2128-3-3**], tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
[**2128-3-13**] Lower Ext U/S No evidence for DVT  [**2128-3-13**] CXR 1) Increased left lower lobe opacity, which can represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Hematoma: Surgery was consulted and felt that the mass was likely a hematoma, which would require close monitoring due to concerns over infection.
Her hematocrit was stable throughout.
Throughout her hospital course, hematoma continued to resolve and HCT remained stable.
CT head in MICU r/o bleed/stroke.
During her first night out of MICU, HD#7 patient had systolic pressure of 170.
Portable Chest xray on [**2128-3-2**] showed a resolving PNA in LLL.
On [**2128-3-3**], patient displayed respiratory distress with ABG CO2 of 64.
Proph: Pneumoboots  Access: Central line  Code Status: Full  Dispo: Will follow  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**2128-3-3**]- [**2128-3-5**]  Resp: On [**3-3**] patient was transfered from floor to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] secondary to ABG CO2 of 64 with HCO3 of 36.
Floor Course: [**2128-3-5**]-  Resp: Patient's breathing improved with better respiratory effort, patient's sats were 95% on 2lNC.
An ABG done on [**2128-3-6**] revealed O2 of 82 and CO2 of 36, which indicated patient's resp status was improving.
Throughout the weekend [**Date range (1) 7601**] the patients heart rate ranged from 60s to 120s.
Given the patient's tachycardia and dyspnea, a r/o PE CTA was ordered which was positive for PE.
The CTA also revealed evidence of bilateral upper lobe infiltrates.
ID was consulted as to whether ABX should be restarted, and felt that the CT findings were not concerning.
On [**3-11**] the patient had an ABG which showed improvement with O2=72 and Co2=32.
A CXR on [**3-11**] revealed no change from prior studies, only a slight exacerbation of the LLL atelectasis present in prior films.
It was suggested that the patient avoid opiates and benzodiazepines and obtain an MRI to rule out stroke.
The MRI revealed no evidence of infarctions.
On physical exam neurology also reported the patient as being areflexic/ quadriplegic with a positive babinski sign on the right side.
Given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and report of difficult intubation, and an inconclusive spine MRI, a CT myleogram was ordered which revealed possible C4-C5 compression .
The patient had an EMG/NCS which revealed polyneuropathy.
A C-Spine CT and C-SPine xray revealed no fractures, stenosis, or compression of the cervical spine.
Her free cortisol was obtained which revealed a normal level.
CVS: Patient's echo on [**2128-3-3**] reveals LVH w/ good ef of 55%.
Chest CT on [**2128-3-5**] revealed some degree of CHF with bilateral ground glass opacities, pulmonary edema, a small left pleural effusion and L base consolidation which could be edema.
Serial EKGs revealed no evidence of MI, ischemia, or arrythmia.
It was thought that fever could be secondary to empyema, but CT ruled out.
Endocarditis was also considered as a cause but ruled out by echo on [**2128-3-3**].
Cultures of cryptococcous, histoplasmosis, c-diff, and blood cx were all found to be negative.
She was pan cultured with blood, urine, and sputum cultures continuing to be negative.
On [**3-7**] she had a positive UA and as a result the foley catheter was changed and UA repeated, which was negative.
However, blood cultures were collected and the patient was started on Flagyl and levofloxacin.
Her current problems include, likely resolving ICU neuropathy with  mental status change, fevers, compromised respiratory status from resolved LLL PNA and bilateral PEs for which she was on heparin between [**Date range (1) 50572**], and labile HTN.
She has a resolving abdominal hematoma, which again enlarged during her course of heparin between [**Date range (1) 50572**].
CT head in MICU on [**3-13**] and  r/o bleed/stroke.
MRI does not indicate brain lesion.
Patient has blood, fungal, and c-diff cultures which are all negative.
UCX on [**3-21**] was positive for Klebsiella Pneumo sensitive to Meropenem.
CVS: CT Chest shows CHF with mild Pulmonary edema.
CTA [**3-8**] shows PE.
CXR on [**3-18**] showed LLL PNA vs atelectasis.
Heme: During MICU course ([**Date range (1) 109553**]), patient had abdominal CT revealing increasing abdominal hematoma, with HCT drop of 10.
While no DVTs or Pelvic thrombosis were noted on abd/pel CT or lenis, IVC filter placed and patient now off heparin and coumadin.
CXR on [**3-18**] revealed LLL PNA vs atelectasis slightly increased from prior studies.
[**3-18**] bilateral lower ext u/s revealed no evidence of DVT .
