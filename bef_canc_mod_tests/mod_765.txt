Presents with with HCT of 22 and hypotension with documented melenic guaiac positive stools and elevated BUN concerning for upper GI source of bleeding.
Given suboptimal study with copious food/fluid in the whole esophagus and proximal stomach, the patient was placed on a clear liquid diet with plan for repeat enteroscopy attempt  and capsule placement.
He received 3 units of PRBCs and about 4L of fluid during the first 24hours of his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course with HCT increase from 22 to 27.
His hematocrit thereafter remained stable.
Capsule endoscopy was initiated on [**7-22**], and he remained clinically stable.
PPI was switched to po, and Hct remained stable around 28-30.
The patient provided his information at work, including his telephone number and availability on Monday [**7-25**], which was passed along to the GI team.
Tel: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39222**].
BP improved with blood transfusion in addition to isotonic IVF.
# Acute blood loss anemia Patient with HCT 40 baseline in [**12/2111**] prior to onset of GIB.
Baseline since then ranges in 26-30, presumably all secondary to blood loss.
As noted above, he was transfused a total of 3U PRBCs in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and Hct stabilized around 27.
# Leukocytosis Patient with WBC or 24.5 on admission.
His CXR and u/a are within normal limits.
Post-MI LVEF 30% with apical akinesis, but recent TTE in [**2112-3-8**] with LVEF 55-60% and apical hypokinesis.
His SBP was 98-120 on the day of discharge without evidence or symptoms of orthostasis or chest discomfort.
