He had a dopplerable DP/PT pulse post op and throughout his hospital stay.
CV: The patient was anticoagulated postoperatively with a heparin ggt, with a goal PTT of 60-80 until POD 5.
Pulmonary: The patient was thought to have undergone an aspiration event in the OR and vanc/zosyn were started immediately postoperatively.
