Admission Date:  [**2178-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**] Chief Complaint: worsening SOB and chest pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 78 M with PMH HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Parkinson's Disease, CRF (baseline Cr 1.2-1.5), presents with worsening SOB, chest pressure, N/V, sweating.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be tachypneic, tachycardic, BP 199/113.
Pt's chest pressure improved on NTG, and he had good urine output.
EKG showed rate 116, 0.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in V2-V3 (J point elevation), troponin 2.09.
Neuro: [**3-10**] motor LUE, [**4-9**] motor RUE, [**2-7**] motor LEs, 3+ lower extremity edema   Pertinent Results: CXR [**7-16**]: 1.
Echo [**7-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed however views are technically suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2177-1-16**], left ventricular systolic function is now significant impaired and mitral regurgitation is now more prominent.
Moderate global hypokinesis with LV EF of 38%.
Cardiac catheterization [**7-10**]: 1.
Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization demonstrated mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP=13mmHg, mean PCWP=17mmHg).
The calculated cardiac output by the Fick method was 6.4 L/min with a cardiac index of 2.8.
Moderate hypoxemia was noted with an arterial oxygen saturation of 88% on 2L O2 by nasal cannula.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 78 M with PMH of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Parkinson's ds, CRF (with baseline Cr 1.2-1.5), discharged 1 wk ago for MRSA aspiration pna (requiring pressors, intubation), d/ced on Vanco/Levo/Flagyl, presented on [**2178-7-16**] with worsening SOB, chest pressure, N/V, sweating, found to have NSTEMI.
NSTEMI: Though it was a NSTEMI, his echo shows a large area of hypokinesis which is new.
He was pain free after admission and his CK trended downward.
His cath was initially deferred secondary to worsened CRI.
As his creatinine improved he was taken to cath where he was seen to have 3VD.
SOB: On admission he was volume-overloaded by exam and CXR and was unable to lie flat for any period of time.
Because of his previous admission for PNA, vancomycin/flagyl/ceftazidime were continued for a 10d course.
His CXR gradually improved and he began autodiuresing.
Anemia: On admission, the pt had a baseline HCT of 27-33 and iron studies c/w an anemia of chronic disease.
Secondary to his ischemia, he was transfused x3 units over three days to maintain his HCT over 30.
He was initially also maintained isordil and hydralazine but these were switched to lisinopril as his creatinine normalized.
His lisinopril was titrated up to 40qd on the day of discharge as his SBP was still in the 160s.
He will need continued outpatient management of his blood pressure meds and will need to have his BP checked at his rehab facility.
