Dobutamine stress test done [**2142-2-1**], showed progressive anginal symptoms at low workload without significant electrocardiographic changes.
However, echocardiogram showed evidence of prior myocardial infarction with inducible ischemia at achieved workload and persistent apical hypokinesis.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization [**2142-5-8**], which showed three vessel disease, mild mitral regurgitation, left main 30%, left anterior descending 90%, right coronary artery 80%, left circumflex totally occluded with ejection fraction of 50%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed heart rate 68, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 150/78.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Pulses 2+ femoral bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis and radial bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 6.3, hemoglobin 12.7, hematocrit 37.9, platelet count 249,000.
Prothrombin time 13.0, partial thromboplastin time 29.5, INR 1.1.
Chem7 revealed sodium 140, potassium 5.4, chloride 107, CO2 20, blood urea nitrogen 41, creatinine 1.8, glucose 194.
AST 14, LDH 183.
Chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process, no pleural effusions, elevated left hemidiaphragm with associated gastric distention, tortuous aorta, normal heart size.
Cardiac catheterization results as noted above.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 on postoperative day number one for continued cardiopulmonary recovery, however, on postoperative day number two, the patient went into sinus tachycardia with heart rate to the 160s.
Blood pressure was 140 systolic.
Heart rate was in the 100s, blood pressure 140/70, oxygen saturation 96% on two liters.
His blood sugar was found to be 80.
Blood sugar increased to 134.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram done which showed normal left ventricular function, ejection fraction of 55%.
The patient remained stable hemodynamically with his rate controlled on Lopressor and in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
The patient also scheduled for outpatient electroencephalogram on [**2142-7-28**], to evaluate for possible seizure activity.
