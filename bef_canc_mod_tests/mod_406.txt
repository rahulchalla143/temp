Imaging: Echo [**1-14**]: IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
CXR [**1-13**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared minimal right-sided pleural effusion.
CT chest without contrast [**1-16**]: The heart is normal in size, with aortic valvular and mitral annular calcifications noted.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old woman s/p R total knee replacement in [**1-17**] with R knee liner exchange and wash out on [**2164-12-3**], with intra-operative cultures growing Streptococcus virdians on ceftriaxone who presented to the MICU with fever and hypotension.
Blood cultures were pending at the time of transfer to the floor.
Urine cultures were negative.
All of her Cxs returned negative (Blood, Urine, Sputum, catheter tip of PICC).
As per ID c/s, a CT chest was done which was concerning for progression of [**Doctor First Name **], however pt's pulmonologist reviewed the films and felt that this was not the case.
As we were happy to see the right knee did not seem to have an active infx, we presumptively treated the pt for an HCAP for a 7 day course as that was thought to be the most likely source, especially given the poor pulmonary substrate.
Her tachypnea did come and go on the medicine floor with unknown etiology except for possible anxiety.
Repeat CT as above was originally concerning for progressive [**Doctor First Name **], however Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her pulmonologist did not feel this was the case.
We did sent AFB Cxs (which were negative preliminarily) and also sent mycolytic blood cxs, which were negative/pending at time of discharge.
As above, orthopedics did not feel it was infected, and our exam is definitely underwhelming for a septic picture.
Iron labs were again sent during this hospitalization and were c/w Fe-deficiency anemia.
Your CT scan was reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and it was felt that your [**Doctor First Name **] infection was stable.
However, you met with the ID doctors, and your fevers were felt to be related to a pneumonia.
Your blood pressures have been fine without your prinivil (lisinopril), so do not take this until your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] to start it.
