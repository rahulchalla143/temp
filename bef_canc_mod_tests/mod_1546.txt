She saw her cardiologist on [**2164-5-21**] and CXR confirmed left sided pleural effusion.
Of note, she was told to hold her coumadin on [**2164-6-6**] and take lovenox.
In the ED, the patient had the following vital signs: 97.3 103/36  111  24  97%RA.
The patient was found to have a stable left sided pleural effusion but they could not tap because of an INR of 9.
She also had a WBC count of 21.
She was evaluated by CT surgery who recommended IR guided tap once INR <2.
She was seen by cardiology who did a bedside echo that was unremarkable.
During her ED stay, she developed a fib with RVR in 170s, she was being given lopressor 5 when she dropped her SBPs to the 70s, then fortunately spontaneously converted to sinus tach in 110s.
She converted to NSR at a rate of 88 with BP of 113/77.

Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2163-6-12**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-6-8**], left ventricular systolic function is minimally improved and the large/complex left pleural effusion is no longer visualized.
Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2164-6-13**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2164-6-14**]: 1.
Abdomen (supine only) [**2164-6-24**]: 1) Gastrostomy PEG-type tube.
CXR (portable AP) [**2164-6-25**]: In comparison with study of [**6-24**], the tracheostomy tube is unchanged, as is the central catheter and pacemaker leads.
She saw her cardiologist on [**2164-5-21**] and CXR confirmed left sided pleural effusion.
She did develop a small PTX during the above procedure, which was monitored with serial CXR, and subsequently self improved.
However, she was intubated on hospital day 3, in the setting of tachyarrhythmia (SVT) to HR 180s, dropped her pressures to SBP 70s.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: intermittently had episodes of SVT into HR 140s.
TSH was wnl.
-her INR was 1.2 on the day of discharge and she will need Lovenox 60 mg SC Q12H until INR is therapeutic (goal [**3-15**]).
She will need daily INR checks until on a stable regimen of Coumadin.
QTc was 435 on [**2164-6-19**].
Remainder of culture data was negative, with exception of catheter tip growing [**Female First Name (un) 564**] (see below).
It was noted that her upper extremity BP were 40 points lower than her arterial line pressures.
As such, blood pressures should be measured in her thighs for accuracy.
G-tube study was done that showed all contrast in the stomach so this was felt likely to be expected amount of air with PEG placement and not pathologic.
Repeat CXR on the day of discharge showed improvement in free air.
Her last HCT <25 occurred on [**2164-6-23**] and she received 1 unit PRBCs.
Her HCT on the day of discharge is 26.5 and should be rechecked every 3-7 days and transfused for HCT <24 given her cardiac history.
Patient has small amount of free air seen on her ABD XRAY which is presumably due to PEG placement as patient has no abdominal pain, has good stool output.
-repeat Abd Xray to ensure improvement in free air -consider increasing fiber content of tube feeds if needed for constipation .
