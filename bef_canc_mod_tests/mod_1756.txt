Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2192-12-11**]  12:52:32 PM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-12-10**] the ischemic-appearing anterolateral and apical ST-T wave changes have improved, although there is persistent lateral ST-T wave change.

The middle ear cavities, mastoid air cells and the views of the paranasal sinuses are clear.
MRI of the brain [**12-10**]: FINDINGS: MRI BRAIN: There is a rim-enhancing heterogenous lesion in the right parietotemporal lobe which demonstrates heterogenous internal foci of enhancement and irregular rim enhancement posteroinferiorly.
MRA HEAD AND NECK: There is a bovine arch.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Repeat Head CT on [**12-10**] showed no recurrent hemorrhage.
He will return for a non contrast head CT on [**Last Name (STitle) 766**] [**2191-12-18**], and then go to his Cardiologist for an elective cardiac catheterization/angioplasty on Wednesday [**2191-12-20**].
Your brain imaging showed a large hemorrhage (collection of blood) in the right side of your brain.
The appearance of this region of the brain on your MRI suggests that there could be an underlying tumor, and this needs to be investigated -- you will see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from Neurosurgery in [**2-16**] weeks to arrange a biopsy and possibly resection of this mass.
Retrun to the hospital on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**12-18**], for a repeat head CT in the radiology department (see below).
Head CT on [**Telephone/Fax (1) 766**]: (do not eat for three hours prior to the CT, please) CAT SCAN Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] Date/Time:[**2192-12-17**] 1:00  2.
