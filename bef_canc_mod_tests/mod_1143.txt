Pt underwent a lap chole in [**3-14**] for her 2 months of abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting.
One week PTA, the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48587**] for a GI consult, and underwent an outpatient ERCP on [**2140-8-2**] which showed an 8mm dilated CBD and CBD stone.
A sphincterotomy was performed and the stone was removed.
Amylase returned at 3,818 and lipase at 12,148.
(hemoconcentration Hct 41-> 48%, intravascular depletion with Cr up to 1.4, borderline urine output at 30 cc/h, somewhat tachycardic, low grade-temps to 100).
CT abdomen confirmed 3rd spacing, but showed pancreas still perfused.
On night prior to txf back to MICU, pt triggered with acute SOB and HR up to 140s, 92% on 2L.
During her stay on the floor, her fluids were decreased from 200 cc/hr to 75 cc/hr due to increasing concern for third spacing and worsening pleural effusions.
Bld gas showed 7.4/33/55 on 2L with a lactate of 2.5.
Temp spiked to 101.7 and bld cx were drawn.
A CXR showed a large gastric bubble, low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions (but unchaged from prior CXR).

[**2140-8-3**] OSH CT Abdomen - prominent head of the pancreas with free fluid in the right anterior perirenal space and free fluid within the pelvis consistent with pancreatitis .
[**2140-8-5**] OSH CT Abdomen - Dramatic interval increase in the amout of free fluid within the abdomen.
[**2140-8-10**] CT Abd/pelvis - Complex collection in the anterior mediastinum measuring 4.7 x 4.0 cm which most likely represents a moderate-sized hematoma.
Bibasilar consolidation with air bronchograms which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
[**2140-8-11**] TTE - The LA is normal in size.
LV systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Right ventricular systolic function  is normal.
[**2140-8-14**] CT abd/pelvis - Stable appearing complex collection within the anterior mediastinum which could represent a hematoma.
An alternate consideration is lymphadenopathy (query history of lymphoma), or thymoma.
[**2140-8-24**] CTA - No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Re-imaging of CT sinuses and Abd/Chest/Pelvis showed no progression of Pancreatitis or acute processes, and no evidence of abscess or pseudocyst with necrosis.
On [**8-20**], blood cultures (from [**8-18**]) grew [**2-10**] coag (-) Staph; she was started on vancomycin until speciation.
Blooc cx from [**8-20**] also grew [**2-10**] coag (-) Staph and she was continued on a 14 day course.
A TEE was performed on [**8-24**] that was negative for any endocarditis or vegetations.
A CT guided biopsy of her mediastinal mass/hematoma was negative for any growth.
A pelvic w/u for GC/chlamydia was negative as well.
She remained afebrile and recent blood/urine cultures show no growth to date.
These eventually decreased, and pt would develop intermittant bouts of pancreatitis with flares of her enzymes to the hundreds.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis did not show any development of any pancreatic pseudocysts or necrosis of the pancreas.
On day of discharge, pancreatic enzymes and LFTs were normal.
An extensive w/u was undertaken to r/o PE, pericardial effusion, and CVPs remained in the euvolemic range.
* # Pneumothorax Pt had a CT-guided mediastinal bx that entered into the pleural cavity and created a pneumothorax on [**8-24**].
# Code: full     Medications on Admission: TPN via PICC dilaudid pca   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute post-ERCP pancreatitis E.coli bacteremia and septic shock Enterococcal UTI Respiratory failure due to CHF/ARDS Coag (-) Staph bacteremia Mediastinal hematoma s/p biopsy c/b Pneumothorax R thigh cellulitis   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, abdominal pain improved   Discharge Instructions: Please contact a physician if you feel abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stools that are dark or bloody, or any other concerning symptoms that do not improve.
Followup Instructions: Please repeat CT abdomen 4-6 weeks after discharge to evaluate for pancreatic pseudocyst.
