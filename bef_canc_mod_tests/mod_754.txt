CHF:  This admission was felt to be consistent with the patient's prior admissions for pulmonary edema, with a CXR on admission c/w frank congestive heart failure.
She was wheezing on exam, CXR c/w pulm edema, and was given an ipratropium neb and Lasix 40 IV.
Her CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity, and she was begun on Levaquin for a 7 day course (renally dosed at 250 mg daily).
Renal:  Her creatinine was elevated to 1.8 on admission, and had come down to 1.1 by discharge (baseline mid 1's.)
Her hematocrit was 37 on admission and dropped 9 points that day, which is what has happened for her last 3 admissions.
It is unclear why, as her hematocrit should go up with diuresis.
She received 2 units of PRBCs throughout her stay, and her hematocrit was stable at 31 by discharge.
Carvedilol 3.125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for SBP <100, pulse <60.
You are still on carvedilol, and we have added another medication for your blood pressure called Imdur, which you should take at night.
