Blood cultures were negative, and the patient had no further signs of localizing infection.
Hypotension: SBP was noted to be 80-90s in ED.
Blood cultures were negative.
FAST exam in ED showed no pericardial effusion.
SBP ranged from 90s-120s during the rest of the hospitalization.
Lasix gtt was started with improvement in blood pressure and renal function.
Metoprolol was restarted after blood pressure improved.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine of 2.4 on admission most likely secondary to heart failure and intravascular depletion.
Creatinine remained between 1.0-1.2, despite aggressive diuresis.
