ECG [**5-24**]: NSR (87), nl axis and intervals, TWI V5-V6, no change from [**5-20**].
MRA [**5-24**]: 1.
Bibasilar atelectasis  US upper extremity [**5-26**]: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins were performed.
MRV Chest [**5-30**]: 1.
Limited study which demonstrates a chronically occluded and completely atrophic left brachiocephalic vein.
Venogram [**5-31**]: 1.
Repeat MRV suggested chronic occlusion of the L brachiocephalic vein.
Venogram performed on [**5-31**] showed extensive collateralization of the L brachiocephalic vein with patent flow through these collaterals.
For this reason, the patient was placed on Heparin IV as a bridge to coumadin anticoagulation with goal INR [**2-12**].
The patient has had extensive negative testing for hypercoagulable states, including during this work-up with negative anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, Beta-2 glycoprotein and AT3 antibodies.
Protein C and S levels were unremarkable.
Her INR will be followed first by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**], her nephrologist, and then by the coumadin clinic of [**Company 191**].
This was communicated tothe patient and she understands and plans to be compliant with frequent blood draws for INR testing and varying her coumadin dose as directed.
It remains unclear why her blood pressure is so chronically labile.
The hope is that once she starts dialysis this will help to stabilize her blood pressure, however in the interim various adjustments were made to her regimen.
She is discharged with home VNA for blood pressure checks and assistance with meds.
She has purchased a portable BP cuff and will keep a BP diary to bring to subsequent appointments as well.
Her goal SBP is 140-160 at this time.
She will have her blood drawn for INR in two days and faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**], subsequently this will be faxed to the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic and her dose will be adjusted for INR [**2-12**].
The above plan and appoitnments were reviewed with the pt and her mother extensively.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO qwednesday (): for 10 weeks.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have blood drawn on Friday, [**6-9**] for PT/INR.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have blood drawn on Monday [**2141-6-12**] for PT/INR and twice per week thereafter until told by coumadin clinic that you can decrease lab draws.
There were many changes and it is very important that you stick to the medication list as you have large, life-threatening swings in the blood pressure when not taking consistently.
We also treated you for high potassium levels and anemia, and low vitamin D and calcium levels, which are related to your kidney failure.
Please check your blood pressure three times per day and keep a blood pressure diary to bring with you to all medical appointments.
