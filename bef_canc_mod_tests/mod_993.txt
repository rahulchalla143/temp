Patient's hypotension improved to systolic 90's in the MICU, which is thought to be her baseline.
ECG [**2108-1-9**]: Sinus rhythm Ventricular premature complex Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2108-1-2**], ventricular ectopy present and ST-T wave changes appear slightly less prominent   Stress: TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  55  INTERPRETATION: 74 yo woman (severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF ~ 20%) was referred for a CAD evaluation.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75yo fem c/ PMH of HTN, CRI presenting with hyperkalemia and hypotension likely secondary to exacerbation of renal failure due to Lisinopril.
A on CRF:  Recent baseline creatinine around 1.2, currently at 3-4.
-Support BP with gentle NS boluses if SBP < 85 and symptomatic -QD potassium and creatinine -QD lytes in setting of metabolic acidosis -strict I/O's -Renal u/s --> renal consult -Avoid nephrotoxins (ie, contrast/NSAIDS)  .
Pump: CHF not an active issue, but EF = 20-25% ([**12-2**]) limits [**Female First Name (un) **] of fluid resuscitation for kidneys.

#Renal Failure: On admission, the patient was found to have creatinine = 3.8 up from baseline .8.
The patient's creatinine quickly corrected and returned to near baseline with fluids and discontinuation of Lisinopril, such that creatinine was trending down to 1.8 on discharge.
#Hyperkalemia: On admission, the patient was found to have K = 6.
Calcium Gluconate, Dextrose, Insulin, Kayexealae 30gm were given.
EKG showed no peaked T waves.
Potassium quickly improved to WNL without any arrhythmias as monitored on telemetry.
#Hypotension: In the ED, the patient was fond to have BP = 70's/52.
Lipid studies are pending and will need to be followed-up as outpatient.
Please return to the ED or call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2130**]) for shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, "fainting", or any other concerning symptom.
Please ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31**] to discuss 1. the management of your blood pressure, and 2. the addition of Atorvastatin to your medication regimen, and 3. the addition of a beta blocker as your blood pressure and HR permit.
