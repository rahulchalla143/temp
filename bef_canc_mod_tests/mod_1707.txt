Subsequent to this she developed C. difficile colitis, for which she has been on PO vancomycin since; she continued to complain of abdominal pain, with fevers post op and had a CT in [**2195-12-28**], that revealed slight increased fat stranding in the region of the sigmoid colon at sites of diverticula, representing a mild case of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

CTA head and neck ([**2196-1-26**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evlauation with MRA Neck with Gado can be considered for temporal info regarding the direction of flow, if there is no contra-indication to [**Month/Day/Year 4338**].
Moderate microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease  CXR [**1-26**] - IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
ECHO [**1-27**] - The left atrium is dilated.
[**Month/Day (4) 4338**] Head ([**2196-1-28**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Subcortical areas with high signal intensity are identified on T2 and FLAIR sequences, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
CT Head ([**2196-2-4**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo ([**2196-2-8**]) - The left and right atria are moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-6**], the [**Date Range **] across the aortic valve has increased and the right ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis.
The estimated PA systolic pressure and severity of mitral regurgitation are similar.
colon cancer, s/p colectomy c/b C.Diff coilitis who now presented from NH with two episodes of GTC seizures.
At [**Hospital1 18**] upon evaluation in the ED, she was found to be "obtunded" s/p Keppra load and given multiple hospitalizations, WBC and seizure, she was felt to be at risk for meningitis, thus was treated with Vancomycin IV, Bactrim IV and Acyclovir IV for possible meningitis.
LP couldn not be performed due to requirement of remaining on coumadin and INR of 2.6.
There was also concern for top of the basilar syndrome, thus she underwent a CTA of the neck, showing severe atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal right vertebral artery and moderate-to-severe narrowing of both cavernous internal carotid arteries along w/ a small calcification in the basilar artery.
The detailed neuro exam after she came back to Neuro floor showed subtle weakness on the left side and absent reflexes.
The Non contrast [**Date Range 4338**] showed a lesion in right parietal area, possibly infarct with hemorrhagic conversion, although mass or AVM could not be ruled out due to lack of contrast administration.
Initially there was concern for endocarditis, TTE was performed and showed no vegetations.
TTE revealed EF of > 60%, LVH, mild LVOT and  aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed as well as "significant aortic stenosis."
We held lasix after transfer to floor as there was concerns about lowering her blood pressure in setting of possible ischemic stroke.
She has not had any more loose stools while in the SICU and last C.diff was [**1-13**] at NH and was neg.
CXR also showed RLL lung collapse.
She was febrile to 100.3 and given her worsened lung exam and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4338**] it was thought that she had additional experienced silent aspiration.
On ICU day 3 she spiked to 102 and was pancultured with urine analysis showing pyuria and positive leuk esterase.
She was kept on broad spectrum coverage with culture data pending.
Her INR was supratherapeutic on CCU admission, is now 1.4 with neurology recommending restarting low dose coumadin.
Her EEG remained active with generalized sharp waves at a rate of approximately 2 Hz, and on [**2-7**] was found to be back in subclinical status.
Her keppra was increased to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and her dilantin was adjusted for goal levels 15-20.
Her EEG remained active on [**2-8**] AM.
Her EEG has slowly become less active, currently consistent with encephalopathy and occasional GPEDs with less sharp activity.
Trough levels are requested for dilantin and free dilantin levels on [**2-15**].
A bedside TTE showed an aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2.
She is on coumadin for goal INR [**12-30**].
Per neurology recommendations, the patient underwent [**Date Range 4338**] of his head, which did not reveal any acute changes from prior MRIs.
The patient was continued on EEG monitoring, which did not reveal any active seizure activity.
