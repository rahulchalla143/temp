The patient also suffers from cardiomyopathy with last ejection fraction measured in [**2124**] at 20%.
Per report, the patient's low systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s lead to holding off her ACE inhibitors as well as Lasix and gradual increase in her weight.
The patient's last pulmonary function tests are from [**2130-9-18**] and revealed FVC of 0.6, FEV1 to FVC of 68 and severely depressed total lung capacity indicating severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease.
Tuberculosis in [**2121**] 3.
Serzone 25 [**Hospital1 **] 14.
Haldol 1 mg q 4 prn  ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5?????
?, heart rate 114, blood pressure 94/49, weight 152 pounds up from a dry weight of 112 to 114, respiratory rate 35, O2 saturation 100% on 50% O2 with pressure support of 15.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her jugular veins were distended to the angle of jaw.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 130, phosphate 3.7, chloride 85, bicarbonate 40, BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose 96, calcium 7.8, magnesium 1.8.
Her white count was 8.8, hematocrit 27.6, platelet count 429.
The differential on the white count was 83 polys, 8 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, 2 eosinophils.
IMAGING:  Her chest x-ray showed left sided whiteout, small right pleural effusion.
With aggressive Lasix diuresis, the patient was able to return to her dry weight of approximately 114 pounds.
The patient's blood pressure as well as renal function tolerated diuresis well.
An echocardiogram was obtained to confirm her cardiac function and revealed LV function of approximately 30%.
With these medications, the patient was able to maintain systolic pressure of around 80 without any signs of hypoperfusion.
At night, the patient preferred to be rested on pressure control ventilation set at FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 and a driving pressure of 20.
The urine cultures from that day grew probable Enterococcus.
Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 75 10.
Captopril 6.25 mg pg tube tid, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 70 13.
