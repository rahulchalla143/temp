A recent [**Doctor First Name **] appointment on [**10-19**] was notable for serum glucose of 639 w/o urine ketones, which was treated with increased insulin.
During the admission a renal biopsy revealed pathology consistent with diabetic nephropathy but the biopsy was complicated by cardiac arrest and spontaneous return to sinus rhythm after 2 minutes of CPR.
Labs were notable for serum glucose of 590, AG of 27, HCO3 of 19.
Agressive IV hydration (3L NS) and insulin gtt at 5U/hr were initiated with decrease of serum glucose to 185.
On arrival to the floor, vital signs were T- 99.5, BP- 129/74, HR- 112, RR- 16, SaO2- 99% on RA.
Last eye exam [**5-1**] - "quiescent" PROLIFERATIVE diabetic retinopathy.

**FINAL REPORT [**2139-11-7**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-11-7**]):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH FECAL       CONTAMINATION.
Active Issues:  # DKA: Pt initially presented with sugars in the 600s, improved following IVFs, insulin drip and potassium, with resolution of DKA as sugar was <200, bicarb > 18 and anion gap < 12 on transfer from the MICU.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was placed for assistance with insulin dosing.
This was affective at controlling the pts blood glucose levels once she was on the medicine floor.
Renal biopsy on [**2139-9-15**] showed scarring consistent with stage IV diabetic nephropathy.
On discharge her creatinine was 1.0  # Peripheral neuropathy: Decreased sensation in lower extremities.
