History of Present Illness: 69 year old male with a history of high grade invasive transitional call carcinoma of the bladder s/p laproscopic cystectomy and neobladder formation [**2-24**] and multiple complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia presenting to the ED for evaluation of fast heart rate.
He takes his blood pressure twice daily and normally SBP is in the 90s.
Shortly after arrival, he had a temperature of 100.8 and a BP of 97/55.
Evaluation for source of abdominal discomfort included a CT abdomen with contrast.
A repeat CT with rectal contrast was then performed which demonstrated possible sigmoid diverticulitis and fluid, gas and stranding in the pelvis.
Klebsiella bacteremia (last [**5-24**]) with Klebsiella UTI 7.

Recommend repeat PA and lateral radiograph when patient is able.
[**6-30**] CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend repeat CT examination with rectal contrast to evaluate for wall thickening and perforation.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, stable since dedicated chest CT examination from [**2126**].
The acute findings involving the stranding and free air were posted in a wet read and discussed with the urology resident at time of study, and were rediscussed with recommendations for repeat CT with rectal contrast at 10:00 p.m. on [**2127-6-30**].
[**7-1**] CT PELVIS (WET READ) fluid, stranding, and small bubbles of gas in pelvis redemonstrated.
subsequent imaging shows no extravasation of contrast from the rectosigmoid colon.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the Urology service for abdominal pain and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate in the 140s.
CT A/P was performed which showed a small pocket of free air in the abdomen near his neobladder.
The foley catheter was changed, and repeat urine culture two days later was negative.
