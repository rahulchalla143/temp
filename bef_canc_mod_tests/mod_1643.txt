As patient had worsening hypoxia and increase in interstitial process seen on interval Chest CTs despite antibacterial and antiviral therapy a bronchoscopy was preformed which did not show evidence of bacterial infection.
The patient was started again on IV steroids and a lung biopsy by VATS preformed for evaluation of her lung process.
She was transitioned to PO steroids and had marked improvement in her oxygenation and rash.
IgG was positive and IgM for viracella was positive as well, patient recieved a 7 day course of acyclovir while her pulmonary process was evaluated out of convern for a zoster pneumonitis.
A skin biopsy was preformed which showed acute generalized errythematous pustulosis, a rare neutrophil mediated drug reaction.
Upon presentation to the OSH as CXR showed multifocal pneumonia for which she recieved vanc/zosyn, on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] this was changed to Vanc/meropenem out of concern for drug rash.
As her skin improved her respiratory status worsened despite antibiotics, Chest CT was preformed which showed diffuse ground glass opacities concerning for pneumoina.
Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate and a pulmonary consult preformed a bronchoscopy which was not reveiling.
As her interval chest imgaging continued to show worsening of her inflammatory process with steroids a VATS procedure for biopsy was preformed.
The decision was made to continue steroids as infectious processes for her lung pathology were excluded by multiple cultures and serologies.
She had PFTs which showed a restrictive pattern and the patient was discharged on 60 mg prednisone daily, bactrim ppx, vitamin D and Calcium for a steroid course to be determined by outpatient pulmonology.
Abdominal Ultrasound did not show acute liver process.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  patient had rise in her creatinine to 1.8 over the course of her stay, renal ultrasound was normal and patient responded to albumin challenge.
She had urine eosinophils suggesting that the actue drug reaction may have caused a transient nephritis at the time of discharge her creatinine was 0.8. .
# Leukocytosis:  Patient was noted to have a leukocytosis of 30-40 over the course of her hospitalization.
# Hypercarbic failure:  Post VATS procedure and extubation the patient was noted to be hypercarbic with a pH of 7.19.

You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of your rash, which was felt to be an allergic reaction to antibiotics.
A CT scan of your chest showed a large amount of inflammation in your lungs that despite steroids and antibiotics got worse on a repeat scan two days later.
You were brought to the ICU for a procedure called a bronchoscopy and cultures were sent from this material which were negative.
As it was not clear to any of the doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 40087**] for [**Name5 (PTitle) **] whether you had an infection or an allergic reaction in your lungs a lung biopsy was preformed.
Your liver enzymes were also noticed to be elevated which was felt to be from an acute stress on your liver from your acute illness.
The following changes were made to your medications: -START Fluconazole 200 mg daily for 6 more days -START Prednisone 60 mg daily -START Vitamin D/Calcium supplement daily -START Bactrim SS 1 tablet daily -START Lasix 80 mg daily -START Spironolactone 25 mg daily -START Albuterol 2 puffs every 6 hours as needed for wheezing -START Moisturizing lotion daily  -CONTINUE Lactulose 30 ml twice daily -CONTINUE Rifaximin 550 mg twice daily -CONTINUE Pantoprazole 50 mg daily  -CONTINUE  Followup Instructions: Name: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Address: 99 [**Location (un) **] STRAITS, [**Hospital1 **],[**Numeric Identifier 19665**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72602**] *It is recommended that you see your primary care doctor within one week.
