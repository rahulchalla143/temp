Pylori Antibody negative - HCV viral load negative - CMV viral load negative  [**10-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the examination.
For better assessment of the facet joints, followup examination is recommended.
Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic  function appears severely depressed, particularly in the mid-ventricular and apical segments.
There is a distinct 0.9 x 1.0 cm spherical mass consistent with  vegetation which appears ttached to the Eustachian valve (clips 37, 46, 53,  61).
[**10-21**] CT L-Spine: FINDINGS: The paravertebral soft tissue abscesses which were apparent on the [**Month/Year (2) 4338**] are difficult to discern on CT.
[**10-21**] Pathology Liver Biopsy: DIAGNOSIS:  Hepatic biopsy: Carcinoma with hepatocellular and cholangiolar differentiation; adjacent hepatic parenchyma with intracytoplasm hyaline and lobular neutrophils (recommend evaluation for toxic-metabolic injury)--see note.
Note: The tumor is positive for AE1/AE3, keratin cocktail (AE1/AE3; CAM 5.2), CK7, CK20.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-10-20**], the vegetation/mass seen in the area of the Eustachian valve is not seen on the current study.
[**10-22**] Paravertebral Cytology: Neutrophils only  [**10-23**] U/S LUE: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT  [**10-24**] CT Chest w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], especially for the evaluation of vasculature and embolism.
[**10-28**] CXR: AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: The appearance of the chest is not significantly changed.
EGD [**2111-10-29**]: Impression: - Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction - Erythema in the stomach body and fundus compatible with gastritis - Ulcer in the antrum - Ulcers in the first part of the duodenum and distal bulb - Ulcer in the duodenal bulb - Erythema in the duodenal bulb and distal bulb compatible with duodenitis  [**2111-11-10**] ECHO: EF 40%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-11-1**], left ventricular systolic function appears improved.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 46 year old male with very complex medical problems transferring from an outside hospital whose medical problems include Eustachian valve endocarditis with possible embolization to the lung; heart failure that appears to be multifactorial (sepsis, dilated cardiomyopathy - ischemia vs EtOH), newly diagnosed Hepatocholangiolar carcinoma, L3-L4 paraverterbral abscess, and cellulitis of left arm and right thigh, hospital course complicated by an UGIB secondary to duodenal and gastric ulcers.
U/S guided biopsy was done here at [**Hospital1 18**].
Pathology showed carcinoma with hepatocellular and cholangiolar differentiation.
All blood cultures are negative here.
EF of 20% on echo from OSH.
TTE at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2111-10-22**] with comparable results to outside TTE (EF 20-25% The left ventricular cavity is dilated.
However, last ECHO performed on day prior to discharge was more consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy.
EF on final ECHO improved to 40%.
HCT continued to fall so Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken for endoscopy which showed gastric and hepatic ulcers.
Interventional neuroradiology biopsy on [**2111-10-22**] submitted samples for histopath and cultures, which were negative for malignancy.
Renal U/S from [**2111-10-22**] was not indicative of obstruction or hydronephrosis.
FeNa = 0.6%, which is suggestive of pre-renal azotemia.
Urine sediment showed granular casts which is consistent with ATN.
Surveillance labs will also be done weekly to monitor his serum Potassium and BUN/Cr levels.
Glucose on transfer was 408.
Pulmonology states nodule cannot be biopsied via CT or bronchoscopy given location.
A biopsy was performed and was positive for liver cancer.
Please check your blood sugars twice daily, before breakfast and before nightime insulin dose.
