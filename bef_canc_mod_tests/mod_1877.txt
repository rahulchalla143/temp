Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system showed native three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Saphenous vein grafts were known to be occluded from a prior catheterization dated [**6-17**] and were therefore not visualized.
Graft angiography showed a widely patent LIMA to LAD, supplying the distal [**1-18**] of the LAD and large collaterals to the RCA and r-PDA.
Left subclavian angiography showed a widely patent left subclavian stent.
Resting hemodynamics showed normal left-sided filling pressure.
Left ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with more pronounced hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Limited left ilio-femoral peripheral angiography showed a mild 30% stenosis of the common femoral artery.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Conclusions 1.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Comparison study dated [**2149-12-21**].
The ETT and the NG line remain well positioned.
After stabilization of her pulmonary issues, given her history and an echo which could not fully assess LVEF and could not rule out RWMA, she went for cardiac catherterization and found to have no new lesions, patent LIMA to LAD.
but no recent echo on admission.
Echo here showed: 1.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
On admission, the patient was felt to be euvolemic to slightly volume overloaded and gently diuresed but her SOB was primarily due to astham/copd exacerbation.
Diuresed adequately for discharge--felt to be dry for discharge by exam and labs.
Given that she was acutely decompensated from pulmonary perspective and volume overloaded when echo was done, it was not felt to be fully accurate of baseline status.
Should titrate ACE/beta to HF goals based on repeat echo (lisinopril 20/toprol 150).
heart failure, systolic-held and went up on beta-blocker for control.
Scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy and then to re-start coumadin then.
WAs on subcu heparin, lft's obtained which showed mild transaminase elevation and t bili elevation.
Subcu heparin stopped, RUQ U/S obtained showed fatty liver/h/o cholecystectomy.
Lft's, t. bili and PTT trended down on discharge.
Patient will need follow -up of these studies as an outpatient.
