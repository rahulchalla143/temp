A subsequent workup was negative; including an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a colonoscopy, an enteroscopy, small-bowel follow-through, and red blood cell scan.
During his prior gastrointestinal bleed, he ultimately necessitated an 11-unit red blood cell transfusion, and ultimately a source was unknown.
He was noted to have a poor prep; however, there was no bleeding and no masses.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  When examined in the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature maximum and temperature current were 96.7, his pulse was 89, his blood pressure was  124/76, his respiratory rate was 14, and his oxygen saturation was  100 percent on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination showed him to be normocephalic and atraumatic.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with the absence of any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Rectal examination showed normal tone.
LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's white blood cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 24.3, and his platelets were 249.
Sodium was 137, potassium was 3.6, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 39, creatine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 127.
Prothrombin time was 12.9, his partial thromboplastin time was 25.1, and his INR was 1.1.
Gastroesophageal recommended placement of two large-bore intravenous lines, serial hematocrit checks, and crystalloid resuscitation as necessary, intravenous Protonix 40 mg twice per day, nothing by mouth, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy while in the intensive care unit and avoidance of  any nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs; all of which were implemented.
He continued to have significant hematocrit drops necessitating 4 additional units of packed red blood cells in response to a hematocrit of 19.
On the morning of [**2138-4-22**] the patient again had a 3 to 5 point hematocrit drop and bright red blood per rectum.
Post doppler flow arteriogram demonstrated stagnant flow through the vessel with no further bleeding.
Apparently, this selective and superselective SMA arteriogram demonstrated active extravasation from proximal jejunal branch with successful Gelfoam embolization of the bleeding jejunal branch.
Subsequently, the patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit where his hematocrit stabilized over the next 24 hours.
By [**2138-4-23**] the patient had again significant drops in his hematocrit and blood per rectum.
Initial evaluation of the intestines revealed no outward or obvious deformities.
The Gastroenterology Service was brought to the Operating Room and proceeded to do an upper endoscopy and was able to reach the patient's duodenum where no obvious source of bleeding was noted up to that point.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**4-25**] showed some areas of nasogastric erosion; however, no areas of new or acute bleeding were noted.
Over the subsequent four hospital days, the patient's vital signs remained stable and his hematocrit indeed likewise stabilized.
Although the patient's vital signs remained stable, it was felt that additional intervention was warranted.
This was used to allow for examination for possible additional sources of bleeding.
Final Nutrition evaluation revealed the patient was meeting adequate nutritional needs through by mouth intake.
