[**2146-9-17**]: Exploratory laparotomy, sigmoid resection, and end-colostomy.
CT angiogram showed a heavily calcified infrarenal aorta with 3 areas of distinct blowout, almost looking like contained ruptures.

Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Blood,sputum, and urine cultures were sent and he was started on empiric Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.
On exam, his abdomen was mildly tender to palpation and distended.
All cultures were negative on POD4 but he continued to have fevers.
Transplant surgery was consulted for a potential abdominal pathology, and a CT scan was obtained demonstrating pneumatosis of the sigmoid colon.
He underwent exploratory laparotomy that demonstrated necrotic sigmoid colon, which was resected with creation of an end-colostomy.
He was extubated on POD3 from the ex-lap, and maintained oxygen saturation on nasal cannula.
Chest xray demonstrated a large pleural effusion.
Cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage were growing serratia, and he was started on cefepime.
While on the Lasix drip, pt experienced an increase in his creatinine to 2.0, once off the Lasix drip pt, creatinine has normalized.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
