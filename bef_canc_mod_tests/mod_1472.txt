Her Blood pressure emained elevated around 150s/80s.
Her initial exam was reportedly notable only for crackles in the lungs, but a repeat exam revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Thus, the patient underwent CT abdomen and pelvis, which did not reveal acute pathology.
Her CXR did not show a clear source of infection.
Bedside echo was reportedly without signs of cardiogenic shock.
She also had a gap of 18.
Her hematocrit and platelets were normal.
She did have a slight elevation in her ALT and AST, her INR was elevated to 1.4.
Her troponin was elevated to 0.04 with normal CK/MB.
A RIJ was placed and was oozing.

Estimated RA pressure at least 15 mmHg.
LV systoli function severely depressed (LVEF 20%) with akinesis of the apex and distal LV segments and moderate hypokinesis remaining seg.
[**2136-10-3**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis w/ contrast: 1.
[**2136-10-3**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: Minimal cavernous carotid atheromatous disease, otherwise normal  [**2136-10-5**] CARDIAC STRESS IMPRESSION: No significant ST segment changes or anginal symptoms.
Decreased left ventricular function with calculated EF of 24% and diffuse hypokinesia.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo woman with ESRD on dialysis, HTN, admitted for 6 weeks of worsening cough, posttussive emesis, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, found to have elevated lactate as high as 8 and new echo with dramatically reduced EF, 3+ TR/MR, mild RV failure, pulmonary hypertension, and LV thrombus.
# CHF:  Pt was found to have new biventricular heart failure (EF 20%) on echo with LV thrombus.
[**10/2134**] TTE which showed systolic dysfunction with EF of 45-50%.
DDx includes recent silent MI  (unlikely given lack of qwaves) or balanced ischemia from 3 vessel disease since stress MIBI was negative (patient is not a good candidate for CABG per discussion with family, nephrologist), chronic deterioration of hypertensive cardiomyopathy, or amyloid cardiomyopathy.
P-MIBI [**2136-10-5**] showed no reversible or fixed myocardial perfusion defects, diffuse hypokinesia, EF 24%.
Based on this interpretation, we cannot rule out balanced ischemia, but since patient not candidate for CABG, it was agreed upon that cardiac catheterization was not necessary.
- CT of head was negative for any intracranial process, so patient was given heparin bolus and heparin gtt was started for LV thrombus, until therapeutic on warfarin.
As outpatient, could get SPEP/UPEP, serum light chains, and immunofixation, but deferred as inpaitnet.
No leukocytosis, CXR showed no consolidation, UA negative, blood cultures no growth.
Continued azithromycin for 4 days for possible atypical pneumonia vs pertussis given history of 6 weeks of severe cough with post-tussive emesis - HIV pending at time of discharge - Hep serologies pending at time of discharge - CT abd/pelvis negative for bowel ischemia, transplant surgery saw and felt no surgical issues - LV dysfunction without hypotension unlikely to cause this kind of lactate elevation.
Sertraline toxicity has been seen in a case study in rats to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and a lactic acidosis so this is a possibility.
Sent serum studies for pertussis to state since swab will be negative 6 weeks out.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH 5.0 and free T4 0.99.
# Anemia: HCT remained stable around 34.
