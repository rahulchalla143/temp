Past Medical History: kidney stone with pyelonephritis in [**2170**] osteopenia GERD Asthma Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Migraines- last one over a year ago Seen by Neurology here in [**2170**] for an episode of sudden onset shooting pain L eye, followed by burning with looking up and to the left, diagnosed with trochleitis B12 deficiency   Social History: + tobacco 1 PPD, [**1-25**] glasses of wine/week, financial consultant at AG [**Doctor Last Name **], no children   Family History: Mother -> died of Lung CA at 65 Father -> died of PE at 55 Brother -> HTN   Physical Exam: T- 95 BP- 153/73 HR- 93 RR- 20 O2Sat- 96% on RA Gen: Lying in bed, NAD, eyes closed HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  NIH SS: 5 1a.

Dysarthria: 1 11.
Impaired upgaze on R > L. Sensation decreased to light touch V2- V3 on L.  Bilateral ptosis, R > L (cannot open R eye at all, just opens L eye 5 mm).
Mild NLF flattening on L.  Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: dysmetria with finger-nose-finger and heel to shin on left  Gait: Not assessed   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: 141  104  19 -------------< 139 3.7  24  0.9  WBC 9.4 Hgb 14.9 Plt 394 Hct 42.2 MCV 87  N:59.4 L:33.5 M:4.9 E:1.7 Bas:0.6  PT: 11.0  PTT: 22.3  INR: 0.9  Imaging CTA Head and Neck with perfusion: On the unenhanced scan, there is no evidence for acute ischemia or hemorrhage.
Preliminary evaluation of the CTA images demonstrate what appears to be occlusion of the distal basilar artery extending to the proximal right PCA artery.
This area also appears to be hyperdense on unenhanced CT.  No definite acute infarction in the brainstem or cerebellum is seen, although MRI evaluation would be recommended for further evaluation.
Repeat Head CT at 5:47: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
TTE [**2185-9-20**] Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The  estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness,  cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV  diastolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-1**], no change.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-9-21**] 8:23 PM MRI BRAIN: Areas of slow diffusion are seen in the pons right greater than left, left superior cerebellum, and right cerebellum.
The internal carotid arteries, Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and major branches also appear patent.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY NECK: The right vertebral artery has loss of signal at its origin, which may be due to the recently placed stent.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are unchanged.
Air-fluid levels are seen within the sphenoid air cells bilaterally.
CTA HEAD AND NECK:  A stent is seen at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
A dedicated chest CT as previously recommended is again recommended.
A chest CT to further evaluate multiple small nodular densities is again recommended.
On initial exam she had evidence of a 3rd and 6th nerve palsy on the R, and 3rd nerve palsy on the left, bilateral ptosis, dysarthric speech, left nasolabial flattening, and L UMN pattern weakness in the arm.
On CTA she had evidence of a large basilar artery thrombus.
She was acutely intubated and sedated, and Head CT was repeated, which showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
Angiogram showed a severe narrowing of the proximal vertebral artery on the left (atherosclerosis versus dissection).
A total dose of 11mg of tPA was infused in the basilar artery and both PCAs.
She was  The cause of her infarct is unknown at present, given her vascular risk factors (long time smoker, HTN, hyperlipidemia) could consider atherosclerotic plaque in the basilar with thrombosis.
Could also consider a cardioembolic source (though no known A fib)  Echocardiogram did not reveal PFO, ASD, or sources for cardioemboli.
Her discharge examination was notable for right eye ptosis and slight bilateral deficit of eye abduction.
Chest CT is recommended at follow up for evaluation of multiple small nodular densities seen incidentally on CTA of the neck.
You underwent extensive intervention to break up the clot and prevent further neurologic deficits.
Call your doctor or 911 if you experience any difficulty with speech, walking, new weakness, numbness, tingling, weakness, double vision, blurred vision or any other concerning symptoms.
Followup Instructions: [**11-16**] at 1:30pm with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
