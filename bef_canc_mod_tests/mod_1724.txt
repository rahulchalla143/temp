Her pulmonologist near [**Location (un) 5583**] performed bronchoscopy early in [**2157**] and diagnosed this condition.
In [**2157-3-2**], she underwent stent placement given TBM; between [**Month (only) 956**] and [**Month (only) 547**], she tolerated the stent with initial improvement in her breathing, however, over the last several weeks, she has started to make increasing secretions with daily cough.
However, given respiratory rate of 30, saturations near 92% on ambulation, she was sent to the ED for respiratory distress; she was started on nebulizers amd required BiPap initially.
A chest x-ray was obtained which reveals surgical scarring on the left secondary to her wedge resection, but no other acute process.

Bronchoscopy [**2157-6-13**]: The flexible bronchoscope was introduced for airway inspection.
A lesion was identified on the left vocal cord.
Dynamic airway maneuvers were then performed, with the following findings: proximal trachea - moderate collapse; mid-trachea - severe collapse; distal trachea - mild collapse; RMS - moderate collapse; [**Hospital1 **] - mild to moderate collapse; LMS - mild collapse.
Rigid bronchoscopy [**2157-6-15**]: Rigid bronchoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy with deployment of Dumon Y stent for tracheobronchomalacia.
Stent size was a 16x13x13 with a 5cm proxima limb, 1.5cm to RMS and 3cm to LMS.
CXR was unremarkable.
CT trachea showed no evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.
She underwent bronchoscopy that showed severe upper tracheomalacia.
We held this the entirety of her admission, and did not get volume overloaded.
