CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   [**2136-11-6**] 3:36 PM IMPRESSION: Increased densities in distribution similar to prior examinations could represent worsening of previously diagnosed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or possible superimposed edema.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-11-7**] 4:48 PM IMPRESSION: Bilateral upper lobe/left lower lobe reticulation, stable since [**2136-8-16**] is in an unusual distribution for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
In the imaged right lung apex, there are extensive alveolar opacities, better evaluated on the chest CT, from the same date.
Pulmonary opacities, better evaluated on the recent CT.  Brief Hospital Course: Hypotension: On transfer to the MICU, Levophed was discontinued, and systolic blood pressures stabilized in the 110s with dexamethasone, 1L IVF, and one dose of vancomycin and cefepime.
Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits, ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, and he denied chest discomfort.
Blood pressures remained stable in the 110s to 120s.
Pulmonary emboli was also considered as an etiology for his hypoxia, as his D-dimer was slightly elevated at 630, however LENIs were negative for DVT, he was not tachycardic, noncontrast chest CT showed no change from prior, and CTA could not be performed due to renal failure.
UOP remained good and Cr trended down from 3.9 on admission to 2.3 on transfer to the floor.
He was diuresed with 80 mg IV lasix daily (given thought of poor forward flow contributing to his renal failure) and Cr continued to improve throughout hospitalization to 1.5 on discharge.
Finger stick blood glucoses ranged from the high 100s to mid-300s, thought partly exacerbated by the high dose steroids.
His gabapentin was increased from 100 to 300 TID as his blood pressures and creatinine improved.
His oxycontin was increased from 30 to 40 to 50 mg Q8H with lower doses (10-15 mg Q6H of oxycodone) for breakthrough due to concerns over the effect large doses of short-acting opioids would have on his blood pressure.
Shoulder XRays were obtained which showed no acute fracture or dislocation.
He placed on a CIWA scale and did not require any benzodiazepenes as he exhibited no autonomic instability or other symptoms of EtOH withdrawal.
Medications on Admission: Citalopram 40 mg qd Lisinopril 5 mg qd Metoprolol 1.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] Calcium 500mg [**Hospital1 **] ).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for low blood pressure and low oxygen levels.
Your blood pressure was thought to be low because your steroids were tapered too rapidly.
Given your heart failure, you should weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
