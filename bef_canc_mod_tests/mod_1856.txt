One day prior to admission, he had undergone an outpatient colonscopy and removal of four colonic polyps.

----- CT head without contrast [**2139-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is hyperdensity along the left aspect of the tentorium cerebelli suggestive of a subdural hematoma versus tentorial calcification.
----- CT Cspine [**2139-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of fracture or subluxation.
Disc protrusions at C5-6 and C6-7 with associated spurring results in narrowing of th central cervical spinal canal at these levels.
----- CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2139-5-20**]: CT ABDOMEN: There is bibasilar atelectasis.
CT PELVIS: There is extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Neurologic exam remarkable for poor mental status exam with depressed level of alertness and inattention.
Tone and reflexes are increased on the left compared with the right, likely reflecting his right intracerebral hemorrhage and subsequent left hemiparesis.
His trough level was 10.8 ([**5-20**]) and 12.2 ([**5-21**]) but dropped to 7 on [**5-25**] therefore his dose wia increased to 400mg qd.
He will need trough levels checked again in [**4-10**] days.
An EEG was performed to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus; the EEG showed evidence of encephalopathy but no signs of status.
MRI of the head was done and showed hyperdensity along the left tentorium, bifrontal hemorrhages and calcifications in the bilateral basal ganglia.
The patient had an MRI of the neck as well to evaluate for cervical spine fractures.
The patient received Ativan in the emergency department and also during his imaging studies on the day of admission and his diminished mental status could be secondary to this medication combined with his series of seizures.
The patient also had an ECG which showed a first degree AV block and left anterior fascicular block, both of which were seen on prior ECGs.
On admission, the patient chest x-ray showed a possible left lower lobe nodule.
However, upon chest CT to evaluate said nodule, no nodular abnormalities were notes.
CT abdomen and pelvis were done upon arrival to the ED, because the patient had had a colonoscopy on the day prior to admission and the CT was done to evaluate for perforation.
CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of perforation.
Speech and swallow evaluation was performed on [**5-22**] and the patient was deemed to be too lethargic for full diet.
Thin cuts of the skull via CT were ordered which confirmed longitudinal fracture in the R temporal bone.
Diffusion-weighted imaging shows no evidence of acute infarction.
Abnormal signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted imaging is seen within the periventricular white matter consistent with a chronic microvascular infarction.
IMPRESSION: Intraventricular, subdural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage as described above without associated significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.

Potassium & Sodium Phosphates [**Telephone/Fax (3) 4228**] mg Packet Sig: One (1) Packet PO QID (4 times a day).
Bifrontal hemorrhages 3.
