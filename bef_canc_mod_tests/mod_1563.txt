She was found to have a BP of 60/palp and difficulty ambulating.
She was brought by ambulance to the [**Hospital1 18**]-ED where her BP was noted to be 73/56, and she was noted to be in possible atrial flutter on EKG.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 72, BP 123/90, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97% on 2 liters.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema bilateral lower extremities, warm, 2+ DP pulse left, 1+ DP pulse right.
Reflexes 1+ throughout.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 17.9, hematocrit 42.7, platelets 255, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 94, bicarb 24, BUN 49, creatinine 2.1, glucose 138, calcium 10.2, mag 2.2, phos 4.3, albumin 2.9, ALT 192, AST 291, alk phos 197, T-bili 1.7, lactate 5.2.
Blood cultures and urine cultures have been no growth to date.
An EKG showed AFIB versus AFLUTTER versus MAT at 150 beats per minute which converted to normal sinus at 75 after diltiazem, with a normal axis, no Q waves, and no acute ST-T wave changes.
A chest x-ray initially showed mild CHF with left lung base patchy atelectasis, no pneumothorax, no effusions, no consolidations.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed coarse liver echo texture, no masses, no intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no free fluid in the abdomen.
A follow-up chest x-ray was read as left lower lobe consolidation, could be consistent with pneumonia, though the patient did not have other signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
The patient presented with what sounded like a viral syndrome, initially a chest x-ray without signs of pneumonia.
2) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's baseline creatinine noted to be 1.0.
As she responded well to fluids, her creatinine is actually 0.5 today.
Her urine output was adequate.
A TSH was checked which was normal.
We do not believe the patient requires further evaluation at this time.
Her LFT elevations were likely multifactorial due to hypotension, her Hep B, and possible alcohol ingestion.
The right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no signs of cholecystitis, and there were no clinical signs of cholangitis.
Also of note, the patient's INR appears at baseline to be slightly elevated likely due to decreased hepatic function combined with perhaps poor nutritional intake.
8) HEME:  The patient was admitted with a hematocrit of 43 which decreased to 33 with aggressive hydration, and then came up to 35.
Her hematocrit settled out around 33-36.
