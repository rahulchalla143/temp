Vital signs were stable.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.3, hematocrit 28.1, platelets 255, sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 105, bicarb 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.3, glucose 104.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm.
Chest x-ray was within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and had a Fleets prep kit and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] prep done prior to surgery.
Electrocardiogram done at this time showed ST depression in 1, AVL, V4 through V6.
Her enzymes were cycled.
Her CPK was found to be 441, troponin greater then 50, hematocrit was 25.3.
BUN 48, creatinine 2.2 from a creatinine of 1.3 on admission.
The recs were followed as far as giving her aspirin, putting her on intravenous heparin and giving her a beta blocker, getting TTE and a PA catheter was placed and she was found to have a CVP of 10.
It was decided at that time to not bring the patient to the catheterization laboratory.
The TTE showed an ejection fraction of 30% with anterior hypokinesis.
Her CPK continued to trend down.
On postoperative day six her hematocrit was 34.3, PTT 73.2, creatinine 1.5 and TPN was discontinued.
Hematocrit was stable on a regular diet and the patient was transferred to a regular floor.
Postoperative day eight was uneventful except for the fact that her BUN and creatinine began to rise.
Her BUN was 56 and creatinine was 1.5.
On postoperative day nine the BUN was 62 and creatinine 1.6.
On postoperative eleven she had an episode of hematemesis and melena and was transferred to the unit where an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, which showed a friable stress ulcer in the distal stomach, which was injected with epinephrine.
Her hematocrit at this point was 24.1.
On postop day twelve her hematocrit was 32.1.
Her enzymes were cycled and were negative.
The patient was also started on Levofloxacin for a urinary tract infection and her hematocrit was stable at 1.4.
held for systolic blood pressure of less then 110 and a heart rate less then 50.
We have decided at this time to not give the patient any Lasix as each dose seems to increase her BUN and creatinine significantly.
