[**2111-5-27**]- CT head without contrast-CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is again seen an area of linear density adjacent to the inner table at the location of the right-sided craniotomy, which is unchanged in appearance since [**2111-5-19**], likely post- surgical in origin.
If clinical concern for seizures persists, a repeat study after the patient's mental status improves, may be of benefit to better discriminate focal abnormality that can be obscured by an encephalopathic pattern.
Please note that this finding was not seen on the previous examination, but the difference may be due to the present study obtained at 3T, as opposed to the 1.5T study earlier.
[**2111-6-10**] MRI gadolidium-1.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2111-5-28**], pt was noted to be tachycardic, then had decreased in BP from 120's from 150-180's.
~ 10 point Hct drop from 32 on [**5-27**] am to 23 on [**5-28**].
MICU course: Patient had an episode on bloody emesis ~300 cc but Hct remained stable.
EGD repeated on [**2111-5-29**] and showed small ulcer w/ signs of recent bleeding at gastrostomy site.
Repeat MRI with gadolidium showed no acute stroke.
He had an EGD which showed this and the ulceration was cauterized.
His initial delirium was likely due to this, and has now resolved to baseline.
Needs speech and swallow evaluation for safety of po intake in setting of baseline delerium.
C. diff- Pt with c. diff positive on prior hospitalizations with persistant diarrhea.
Electrolytes were checked and repleted prn.
Speech and Swallow evaluation needed for safety of po intake.
Celecoxib 100 [**Hospital1 **] 3.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO twice a day.
His Hct is stable and his mental status has returned to baseline per family.
