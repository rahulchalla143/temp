Attempts at weaning were continued and her tidal volumes on the ventilator were decreased to increase her pCO2 thereby facilitating further weaning.
Cardiovascular:  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient demonstrated hemodynamic instability with systolic blood pressures in the 70s.
An arterial line was placed for invasive blood pressure monitoring on arrival to the MICU.
Her blood pressure was noted to be extremely labile throughout with systolic blood pressures ranging between 70-200.
An echocardiogram performed on [**2-24**] have concern for the patient's wide pulse pressure demonstrated a hyperdynamic heart with an ejection fraction of 80%, mild aortic insufficiency, trivial, mitral regurgitation, and mildly thickened aortic and mitral leaflets.
She was noted from her culture data to have Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae in her sputum culture from [**2-17**].
In addition, she was growing Bactrim-resistant Klebsiella from her urine culture from [**2-17**].
Further recommendations were to begin new antibiotic coverage for tracheobronchitis/pneumonia only if the patient demonstrated a clinical decompensation.
On [**2-23**], she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for volume in the setting of hypotension and for a hematocrit of 23.0.
She elevated her hematocrit appropriately to 29.0.
She had a hemolysis and disseminated intervascular coagulation laboratory sent which were negative.
The patient also had repeat CA-125 performed which continued to be elevated at 66.
Given that the patient demonstrated poor movement of her upper extremities, an EMG was performed on [**2-23**] which was consistent with polyneuropathy of critical illness.
Further workup for other etiologies of the neuropathy were negative.
On [**2-25**], a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed for possible right upper quadrant pain showing sludge, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
She was noted to have an incidental right thyroid nodule on CT scan.
