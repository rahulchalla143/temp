Intubation on [**2166-2-16**]  2.
EGDs on [**2166-2-16**] and [**2166-2-17**]   History of Present Illness: HPI: 59 y/o man with PMH significant for melanoma and esophageal cancern s/p resetion admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2166-2-16**] with hypotension, renal failure, and a GI bleed.
At the OSH, he was found to have a creatinine of 11.1, BUN 119, and Hct of 32.5.
Head CT was reported as negative.
Of note, he has been maintained on a CIWA scale throughout admission but has not required any ativan per this.
AT that time, his oxygen saturation is noted as 100% but it is unclear how much oxygen he was on (?
They preformed an upper endoscopy which showed evidence of the previous esophago-gastric anastomosis 15 cm from the incisors in the upper third of the esophagus.
He was kept intubated initially so a repeat EGD could be done.
A clot suggested recent bleeding on the 2 ulcers near the pylorus.
On had a clot adherent and the other was oozing.
Pt's Hct has been stable since this time.
He had had no further bleeding and Hct was stable.
Creatinine was trending down as below.
The sentinal lymph node was negative for metastatic disease.
2+ DP pulse on right and 1+ DP pulse on left.

Renal US ([**2-16**]): PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10 cm in length, and the left kidney measures 10.6 cm in length.
CT scan ([**2-20**]): CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions, as well as bibasilar atelectasis.
A gastric pull-up is seen in the right chest.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is stranding in the left inguinal soft tissue, which could be post-op as there was prior lymph node dissection in this region.
The air fluid levels are consistent with the history of hematochezia.
KUB ([**2-20**]): Distribution of bowel gas is unremarkable with gas present throughout the colon and in the rectum and no evidence for intestinal obstruction.
His Hct was slightly below baseline and the pt recieved 2 units of PRBC.
Serial Hcts were followed throughout admission.
Abdominal pain- Pt developed abdominal pain and nausea on the morning of [**2-19**].
The following day, the pt recieved a CT of his abdomen following IV fluids and mucomyst given his acute renal failure.
Renal failure- Pt presented to the hospital with acute renal failure with an initial creatinine of 9.4.
The pt improved dramatically early in the admission with IV fluids and his creatinine has continued to trend down since that time.
