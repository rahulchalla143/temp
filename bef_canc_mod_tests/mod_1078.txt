Patient recently hospitalized from [**8-12**] - [**8-19**] for evaluation and mgmt of anemia.
During that hospitalization patient presented with HCT 17 from a baseline high 20s.
An EGD showed a brisk bleeding due to erosive esophagitis and two areas consistent with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears at the gastroesophageal junction.
HCT remained stable at 24-25 post procedure after transfusion of total of 4units pRBC.
Post endoscopy pt was complaining of significant abdominal pain.
Stat CXR/KUB obtained to rule out perforation and Stat CT angio to look for active bleeding.
Decision made to transfer to the MICU with plan to start PPI infusion for better hemostasis, monitor serial HCTs, and transfuse for goal hct > 26, INR < 1.6 .

CTA (prelim): - bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right, small on the left with adjacent compressive atelectasis - massive simple ascites, new compared to prior study - Focus of arterial hyperdensity noted in distal esophagus (4a:231, 4b:231, 600b:38) expanding on delayed phase imaging concerning for active extravasation in pt with prior [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.
Arterial enhancement which expands on progressive images at the distal esophagus approximately 7 cm above the GE junction consistent with a site of active extravasation.
However, when the patient is able, a dedicated hepatic MRI or multiphasic liver CT would be suggested for further characterization  .

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
CTA obtained which revealed active bleed at distal esophagus.
HCT at time if discharge 28.5.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Continue PO PPI [**Hospital1 **] -- Plan to have HCT checked on [**9-20**] -- Follow-up with outpatient GI .
On admission exam notable for full flanks and distended abdomen.
CT with massive ascites.
Hep panel negative in [**2154**].
CT without evidence of cirrhotic liver.
Ascitic fluid negative for infection.
Due to homogenous character and lack of peritoneal signs which would be expected if blood were present in the peritoneum acting as a causatic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] this collection is thought to represent new ascitic fluid rather than blood.
Serial HCTs monitored with transfusion threshold >26.
Likely secondary to malnutrition in the setting of chronic disease with an albumin of 2.7.
INR at time of discharge 1.4 .
Your hematocrit has trended down but seems to be stable currently around 27-28.
You should have your blood level rechecked on [**Known lastname 766**] to ensure that it continues to be stable.
Lastly, your bilirubin has been increasing.
