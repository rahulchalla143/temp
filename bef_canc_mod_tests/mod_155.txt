At the outside hospital, he received IV diltiazem, and his rate decreased to 110s with blood pressure to the high 80s systolic.
Admission labs were notable for lactate of 2.4 (down to 0.8 with 4L IV fluids), Ca of 7.1, Hct of 29.9, and TnT <0.01.
Vital signs at transfer were as follows: 98.1, 115, 105/50, 18, 98% RA.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes(-), Dyslipidemia(-), Hypertension(-) 2.

<< Active Issues  # Atrial fibrillation: On admission, patient was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation, largely to 110s and transiently to 140s-160s with activity, but remained hemodynamically stable on short-acting diltiazem 60mg qid in place of home diltiazem ER 240mg daily, with blood pressures in the 100s-110s systolic.
On the morning of hospital day 2, he became transiently hypotensive (SBP mid-80s) and hypoxic (mid-80s% on room air), with improvement in blood pressure to the high-90s systolic and oxygen saturation to the low 90s% on room air on recheck.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: Although admission CTA chest demonstrated bibasilar and lingular opacities possibly reflective of aspiration or infection, antibiotics were held initially in the absence of clinical signs clearly attributable to pneumonia, including lack of fever, leukocytosis, or productive cough.
When patient developed low-grade fever to 100.3, increased Wbc (6.8-6.9 to 10.5), and nonproductive cough in association with possible right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone/azithromycin was initiated.
# Normocytic anemia: Hct remained 29-32 throughout admission, consistent with recent baseline.
BCx x4 ([**Date range (1) 16066**]) were pending at the time of discharge.
# History of non-small cell lung cancer: CTA chest on admission revealed findings concerning for possible recurrence of malignancy, which were shared with the patient and family members.

The results of the monitoring will be sent to his cardiologist during the next appointment.
