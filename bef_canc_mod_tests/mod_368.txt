CT abdomen [**12-24**] demonstrated new 31 x 23mm soft tissue density peripherally enhancing mass extending superiorally off the pancreatic tail; Mild surrounding soft tissue stranding c/w recurrent or residual pancreatitis; cholelithiasis; fatty liver.
On day after admission, had an episode of hematemesis (bright red blood and clots), remained hemodynamically stable throughout, but was transferred to MICU for emergent EGD, which demonstrated [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear with stigmata of recent bleed (clot).
Hematocrit remained stable at 35-40 throughout.
Per GI, will follow-up with repeat abdominal CT on [**1-1**] for re-evaluation of suspected pancreatic pseudocyst.

EGD demonstrated evidence of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, which was injected with epinephrine and did not rebleed per stable hematocrit, lack of pain.
Abdominal pain: Pancreatitis as etiology given symptoms, similar presentation to past episodes and abdominal CT findings; patient was placed on bowel rest, PPI, and rapidly advanced on day 2 to clear liquids, but given hematemesis and EGD, diet was intermittently held throughout course; on discharge, patient was hungry without abdominal pain.
Abdominal CT disclosed pancreatic pseudocyst, which will be followed by GI with repeat CT scan on [**1-5**].
Beta-blockers were held for hypertension throughout given positive urine toxicology screen for cocaine, and risk of hypertensive emergency.
However, blood pressure on return from MICU remained at 130-140 throughout off anti-hypertensives.
Cardiovascular: Depressed EF on prior ECHO was felt to be progressive ischemic disease (cocaine-related accelerated atherosclerosis) or dilated (secondary to alcohol, cocaine, HCV).
Radiology Please perform and abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess the pancreas 31x23 mm pancreatic tail mass (suspected hemorrhagic pseudocyst at [**Hospital1 18**]).
