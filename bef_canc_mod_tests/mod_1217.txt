preop eval  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval prox humerus fracture.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous thin section axial images were obtained from the volumetric (64 detector GE) CT scanner and reconstructed in both bone and standard algorithms.
CT UPPER EXTREMITY WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The preliminary wet read report by the resident issued in the PACS requisition is as follow: "Impacted comminuted fracture of the neck of the right humerus with bone fragments as seen on prior plain film and CT study, with large surrounding hematoma."
Of note, fracture lines are seen extending into the articular surface of the humeral head, both at its superior margin (series 104B, image 45 and series 3, image 31) and in the mid portion of the articular surface (series 104B, image 38).

The small amount of blood within bilateral posterior parietal sulci appears slightly more conspicuous compared to prior CT head obtained on [**2113-11-28**].
Direct comparison with prior study obtained on [**2113-11-28**] is difficult given patient's different positioning, however, t right frontal lobe hemorrhage/contusion, and small bilateral parietal subarachnoid blood is unchanged in distribution and likely unchanged in size.

Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 106 120 88 346/408 48 37 39        Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma service.
His intraparenchymal hemorrhage was non operative; serial head CT scans were followed and were stable.
His systolic blood pressure was intermittently high during his hospital stay; he required IV Hydralazine prn; he was started on beta blockade and an ACEI; both of these medications were increased periodically; he will likely require further adjustment of these medications for better blood pressure control.
