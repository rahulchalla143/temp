His peak troponin value at the outside hospital was 0.4.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**12-26**] for a cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was afebrile, his heart rate was 82 (in atrial fibrillation), and his respiratory rate was approximately 20.
On general examination the patient was an obese white gentleman in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the patient's oral mucosa was pink and moist.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with a [**3-8**] murmur heard best at the apex.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neck examination revealed 2+ carotid pulses.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was obese and softly distended.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent laboratories revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 4.4, his hematocrit was 36.5, and his platelets were 140.
The patient's potassium was 4.2.
The patient's blood urea nitrogen was 20.
The patient's creatinine was 1.3.
His INR was 1.7.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram was done at that time which showed the patient was in atrial fibrillation at 93 beats per minute with a left bundle-branch block.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and sent for cardiac catheterization.
The cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction of approximately 29%.
This surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of approximately 112 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 88 minutes.
The patient was AV paced at this time with a mean arterial pressure of 79.
By postoperative day one, the patient was weaned of his dobutamine but remained on Levophed which was titrated to correct a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
This was done without any difficulty, and the patient was placed on nasal cannula at 4 liters and was able to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 98%.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with his rate controlled between 85 and 90 beats per minute.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation with heart rates approximately in the 90s.
The patient had a abdominal x-ray done which demonstrated several air/fluid filled loops of bowel suggesting early postoperative ileus.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**2182-12-31**].
The patient was advised to undergo a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy following his discharge.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with heart rates dropping down to 40 to 50 beats per minute.
As a result, the patient was sent for a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram.
Cardiac enzymes were sent which revealed a transient increase of his creatine kinase value to 45 and his troponin to 0.39.
A repeat complete blood count, Chemistry-10, liver function tests (including albumin and ammonia), and thyroid-stimulating hormone were sent.
Carotid Doppler studies were also done to examine whether or not a poor blood flow was the culprit.
All of the studies proved to be negative.
Carotid Doppler studies indicated patent carotids bilaterally.
The patient underwent a head computed tomography to rule out a hemorrhage or infarction.
This results of this study indicated a few scattered low attenuations within the centrum semiovale suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Due to this questionable negative study, a magnetic resonance imaging was completed as well.
The magnetic resonance imaging indicated no evidence of acute ischemia, but did reveal an increased signal of the cortex of the left frontal lobe which was consistent with a small prior infarction.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation, but his blood pressure was holding steady with peak systolic blood pressures of approximately 110 to 120.
The patient continued to have a pulse of approximately 80 to 90, but in atrial fibrillation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's discharge examination revealed his vital signs to be stable.
His temperature was 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
His heart rate was 88 (in atrial fibrillation).
Systolic blood pressures between 80 and 112.
His respiratory rate was 20.
His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and irregular rhythm.
His lung examination revealed that his breathing was even and nonlabored.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient's lower extremities revealed 1+ edema with no erythema or rashes.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's white blood cell count was 8.9, his hematocrit was 27, and his platelet count was 112.
The patient's prothrombin time was 15.2, his partial thromboplastin time was 54, and his INR was 1.5.
Chemistry-7 revealed the patient's sodium was 137, potassium was 4.7, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 20, and his creatinine was 1.1.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING ON DISCHARGE:  A chest x-ray showed a very small left pleural effusion with no signs of infiltrate.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] was also contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to the patient's discharge, and he stated that he would be able to follow the patient's INR and Coumadin dosing.
Coumadin 2.5-mg tablets two to three tablets by mouth at hour of sleep (please dose to maintain an INR of 1.8 to 2.2).
