LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Chest xray [**2173-6-7**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-6**]: Lung volumes have improved, but bibasilar atelectasis persists, as does a small left pleural effusion.
His hematocrits were followed closely as they had drifted postoperatively.
The decision was made to give 1 unit packed red cells when his hematocrit dropped to 22.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for HR <60; SBP <110.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Inform the office that you will need and end expiratory AP chest xray for this appointment.
