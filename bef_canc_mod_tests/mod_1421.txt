On [**2149-11-5**] she underwent Flexible bronchoscopy which showed tracheobronchomalacia, severe in the trachea, severe in bilateral main stem bronchi, severe in the bronchus intermedius.
A Chest CT was done (see above report).
On [**2149-11-6**] she was taken to the operating room for Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy but were unable to perform rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement due to significant narrowing of the airway just distal to the vocal cords.
Thoracic surgery was consulted who felt since she did not improve markedly with a Y-stent trial previously, and her malacia appears to be more extensive (specifically, more distal) than might be ameliorated with a stent or surgery tracheobronchoplasty.
The patient was treated with bactrim for UTI x 5 days and repeat UA came back negative.
They decided they want to send her back to vent rehab in CT [**2149-11-10**].
