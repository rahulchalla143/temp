Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-10-19**], a possible secundum type atrial septal defect is now suggested.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study with saline contrast and/or a TEE would be better able to characterize the possible atrial septal defect.
[**12-18**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
[**12-20**] MRV IMPRESSION: No appreciable change since the MRV chest exam dated [**2141-5-30**].
Right external jugular vein is provides the major venous drainage from the neck.
Her BP remained elevated so she was switched to nicardipine 1mg/kg/min.
In the ICU she was continued on the Nicardapine drip and her pressures decreased to 175/120.
The renal team removed her tunneled dialysis catheter that had a cuff out, and replaced it with a temporary femoral line.
The patient was transferred to the floor with stable blood pressures, BP 124/72 on [**12-21**].
The morning of [**12-22**], the patient was noted to have a BP up to 247/120 at 0800.
Hypertension persisted throughout the morning with BPs 210s-240s systolic.
Her blood pressure decreased to 130s-140s/60s without further intervention.
The patient underwent MRV that showed no progression of her clot.
She was admitted with a subtherpeutic INR of 1.2  She was started on a heparin drip.
Her Echo did not suggest worsening pericarditis.
