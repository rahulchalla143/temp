[**Company 191**] VS -> 148/70, 54, 22 99% 4LNC.
ECG without acute changes.
Pt referred to ED for further eval.
On immunosuppression - DM/CRI - HTN - HYPERCHOL - Chronic Lung Dz: Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Note [**2112-2-22**]: " normal FEV1 and FVC at 113% of predicted.
Her last diffusing capacity was measured two years ago at 42% of predicted.
Recent chest CT scan showed stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy,  a moderate pericardial effusion, and apical emphysema.
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the chest with multiplanar reformats was reviewed.
Previous bypass surgery and right RCA and LAD stents are present.
MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.5 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.3 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.31 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 60% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 2.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: 2.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.4 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.0 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.43 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 178 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *44 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg) Pulmonic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.0 m/sec (nl <= 1.0 m/s) Pericardium - Effusion Size: 2.5 cm  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  This study was compared to the prior study of [**2112-3-24**].
TVI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Overt echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures/pulmonary  hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-3-24**], the effusion appears similar in size.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2112-5-13**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2112-5-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2112-5-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
Pt did note LE swelling, which has resolved overnight, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions noted on chest CT, which prompted an echo to be performed, which showed signs of early tamponade.
Her SOB improved significantly after window placement.
She also had repeat PFTs performed prior to her pericardial window.
A pericardial biopsy was performed, and initial pathology showed reactive changes.
She had fluid cultures performed as well, which showed no growth to date.
Her echo showed no new RWMA and a preserved EF.
Her Prograf levels were stable, and she was continued on her Bactrim per home dose.
