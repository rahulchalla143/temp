Per OSH records, a CT abdomen revealed a hemorrhagic cyst of the liver vs. a right renal hemorrhagic cyst but no management of this fluid collection was initiated at the time.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] following transfusion of 3 units of pRBCs, dialysis, and treatment with Epogen.
He was transported back to [**Hospital3 **] where his hematocrit was found to be 24 and a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed that showed marked interval enlargement of what was read as an exophytic right renal cyst with concern for active hemorrhage.
He was noted to be in Afib with RVR in the 120s despite a diltiazem drip started at OSH when he arrived with a SBP in the 110s on a low dose of neosynephrine drip.
On physical exam he was noted to have a large, tender mass on the right side of his abdomen.
General surgery, urology, and IR were all consulted.
His OSH scans were reviewed and on preliminary read it looked as though he had a chronic free standing fluid collection with subacute blood in it, but no active extravasation.
IR decided to take the patient for an aortogram to see if there was any active bleeding that could be embolized.
The diltiazem drip was also stopped and his HR remained in the 120s.
He also got 2 units of pRBCs for a hematocrit of 26.6 with an unknown baseline.
A left IJ triple lumen was also placed for access in the ED and blood cultures were sent.
Arteriograms of the aorta, celiac, and SMA systems revealed no active extravasation or bleeding.
He mentions that he was being treated for a PNA found on CXR at his rehab since [**10-22**].

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2177-10-28**] 6:05 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
This lesion appears separate from the right kidney and liver, and while closely associated with the pancreatic head, appears to remain separate as well from the pancreas.
Angiography of the celiac artery, SMA, GDA, and abdominal aorta [**2177-10-28**] 7:10 PM FINDINGS: 1.
The abdominal aortogram demonstrated no evidence of extravasation.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2177-10-30**] 2:40 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-28**], the catheters remain in position.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2177-11-17**] 11:28 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-30**], the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, though there is no evidence of vascular congestion or the diffuse opacification previously seen on the right.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-10-31**] at 2:30:00 PM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TTE (Focused views) Done [**2177-11-3**] at 3:08:22 PM Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-10-31**], the findings are similar.
However, the fluid collection was felt to be separate from both the kidney and pancreas.
Repeat CT abdomen without contrast on [**10-28**] demonstrated the large hematoma which was causing IVC compression and was felt possibly secondary to trauma.
Pt underwent angiograms of the aorta, celiac, and SMA on [**10-28**] which did not showed any evidence of extravasation or pseudoaneurysm.
BP improved after drainage and pt was able to weaned off pressor support in the following days.
Peritoneal fluid results showed WBC: [**Numeric Identifier 87675**] 99% Polys, HCT: 26, Amylase 0.
Both cultures and cytology returned negative.
Pt had a repeat CTA abd and pelvis on [**11-10**] which showed an interval decrease in size but still a large residual hematoma with no blush to suggest active bleeding.
His Hb/HCt remained stable and abdominal pain improved significantly.
The drain output will need to be monitored regularly at the LTAC with a plan for follow up with IR once the output decreases to <10cc/day.
CXR at [**Hospital1 **] showed RLL infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions secobdary to his volume status.
Latterly his BP permitted significant fluid removal of 3-4L without the aid of albumin and his anasacra greatly improved as a result of this.
# Pericardial effusion: On [**11-3**] there was evidence of a moderate pericardial effusion on echo and was not causing tamponade.
He went on to a repeat echo [**11-3**] which showed normal LV/RV (LVEF>55%)and a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent (1.3cm) around the apex of the right and left ventricle and relatively little inferolateral (<0.5cm) to the left ventricle with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
His pathology was reviewed at [**Hospital1 2025**] and a second opinion is awaited.
He was therefore treated with TPN for approx 2 wks and as his fluid collection decreased in size, his intake improved.
Pt was transitioned back to regular diet when his intake improved and his blood sugars remained well controlled without any short acting insulin coverage.
# Anisocoria: Noted to have left pupil larger than right which was persistent with GCS 15/15.
CT-abd [**10-28**] showed right middle lobe ground-glass nodules measuring up to 8 mm, possibly infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check TSH and fT4 in 6 weeks and forward results to rehab doctor/PCP.
The outside hospital had taken a chest X-ray which showed pneumonia and you were treated with intravenous antibiotics for this completing a 10-day course.
You were transferred to the ICU for monitoring and had an angiogram to look at the blood vessels and there was no evidence of active bleeding or any swellings of the blood vessels.
Following initial drainage of this, your blood pressure was much easier to control as this was felt to have been compressing one of the major veins in the abdomen.
We had many discussions with interventioanl radiology and once your drain is drainig <10mL in 24 hours you will have your abdomen re-scanned and as necessary your drain removed or re-positioned.
You required no transfusions while at the [**Hospital1 18**] although you did have some prior to your arrival here and your blood count remained stable.
Due to the blood collection, we held your aspirin and pain was controlled with appropriate pain-killers and improved during your admission.
They were able latterly to take off 3-4 liters of fluid but there were problems regarding your blood pressure which tended to drop during dialysis.
For this you received the medication midodrine and occasionally required fluids to support your blood pressure with albumin.
You were incidentally found to have right sided lung nodules on your CT scan which was in teh context of being treated for pneumonia.
As a precautionary measure, these should be followed up with a repeat scan in 3 months.
