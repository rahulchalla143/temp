MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture ([**2141-9-11**]): Mixed flora .
STUDIES: Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2141-9-11**]  6:55:16 AM Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-9-5**] the rate has increased.
TTE ([**2140-8-26**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

Hypertensive urgency: During the patient's [**Hospital1 **] stay, her SBPs ranged from 140s-160s during the day, which is her baseline systolic blood pressure.
At night, she became more hypertensive, with SBP to the 170s-180s, which was controlled with both IV hydralazine and PO nifedipine.
SBP at discharge was 140.
Of note, lumbar spine MRI and R hip XR on most recent admission were both negative.
Her urine culture showed mixed flora consistent with skin contamination.
The patient's creatinine remained stable at 7.9-8.4 throughout her hospitalization, which was similar to her baseline renal function.
Her calcium was low during admission, and supplemental calcium was given in addition to starting Calcitriol.
Her laboratories will be checked as an outpatient in renal clinic.
Prior SVC thrombus: The patient has a reported history of prior thrombus related to catheter placement in [**2139**], and was maintained on warfarin with INR goal 2.5 to 3.0. .
Baseline BPs 180's - 120's.
