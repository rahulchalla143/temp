On [**2138-12-9**], I then decided to place a new tunneled right femoral 7French double lumen Hickman catheter with tip at the level of L1 and the exit site over the lateral thigh.
She brought a venogram from [**2139-8-26**], which demonstrated that the tip of the catheter had pulled back into the distal inferior vena cava.
Her blood pressure was 96/54, with a pulse rate of 123, temperature 100, and oxygen saturation 99%.
The heart rate was regular and considering the rate, murmurs could not be elicited.
To assess her semi-obtunded status, blood was drawn which revealed a severe hypomagnesemia with a level of 0.7 and a hematocrit of 26.6.
Because of an antibody to the blood, blood was ordered but couldn't be transfused before the start of the procedure.
In the meantime, she had been transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit had reached 30.0.
Her levels on the one gram per day regimen was what she came from the outside revealed a Vancomycin random level of 40.
We had obtained cultures from the tip of the previously indwelling tunneled catheter and blood cultures were obtained.
An ultrasound on [**2139-9-13**], demonstrated that the internal jugular vein and superior vena cava were patent compatible with a successful recanalization.
On [**2139-9-23**], the swelling had been much reduced so that now there also was a satisfying clinic result, and on [**9-24**] facies and arms were normal.
Of note, her hematocrit drifted again down to 23.0% on [**2139-9-22**].
This included a blood loss of about 250 cc for all the surgical interventions.
Hydration with D5 one half normal saline with 1 L of this containing 5000 U Heparin, the remaining hydration fluid to be without heparin.
