Briefly, this is a 40M with h/o HTN, aortic dissection in [**2156**] s/p [**Hospital3 9642**] valve on coumadin, who presented to OSH approx 1 week ago with fatigue and R flank pain, found to have right RP perinephric bleed.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], stabilized with FFP and IR embolization, with stable HCTs.
Subsequently developed ATN with Cr 6.0 and progressive volume overload requiring intubation and CVVH.
For hypertension the patient had been treated with labetalol, with SPB 120-160s).

His creatinine rose to 6 and potassium remained elevated.
# Coagulopathy: On arrival to the medicine service, the patient was on a heparin drip only, yet his INR was elevated to 2.7.
The patient was discharged with an INR of 2.5; he has an appointment on Monday (day post-[**Month/Day/Year **]) for repeat INR check and coumadin dose adjustment.
His creatinine and BUN were trended, nephrotoxins were avoided when possible, and the renal service was consulted for recommendations on treatment and restarting anti-hypertensives.
His creatinine improved significantly, and prior to dischage returned to his baseline of 1.5.
In the setting of improved blood pressure control, he was given a one-time dose of Epogen to which he responded with a hematocrit of 24.
This was short-lasting, and several days later he returned to hct 22.
At that point (again, with improved blood presures) he was transfused with 1U PRBC and hct jumped to 27.
His iron studies were normal (except for ferritin which was elevated in the setting of acute illness).
His hematocrit was monitored and remained stable for the remaineder of his admission.
# Hypertension: On transfer to the medicine service, the patient's blood pressure ran 160-200/40-60s.
Lisinopril was added on last but caused an acute jump in his creatinine from 1.9 to 3.0.
On removal his creatinine returned to baseline.
His blood pressure was well controlled and prior to [**Month/Day/Year **] lisinopril was restarted at low dose (5mg daily).
His blood pressure should be maintained in goal range of 120-130s in the setting of dissection.
# Respiratory failure/pleural effusion: The right pleural effusion was noted on CXR during his ICU stay.
Initially afebrile, the patient had several fever spikes (max 102.3) which prompted a thoracentesis and addition of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired and vent-acquired pneumonia.
His thoracentesis was consistant with an exudative effusion, however it was not felt this was an empyema.
He should have a repeat chest xray done within several weeks after [**Month/Year (2) **] to ensure resolution of pleural effusion.
Further work-up needs to be pursued upon [**Month/Year (2) **].
A renal MRI w&w/o contrast was performed.
Medications on Admission: Coumadin 3mg daily, Coreg 120mg daily, Trimaterene-HCTZ 50-25mg daily, Lotrel 10-20mg [**Hospital1 **], Colchicine 0.6mg daily, Doxazosin 8mg daily, Tricor 145mg daily  [**Hospital1 **] Medications: 1.
You will require close follow-up for your blood pressure and to make sure you are further evaluated by the urology service for your kidney mass.
You need to have your coumadin checked first thing Monday morning ([**1-20**]) to ensure your INR is therapeutic.
For blood pressure control, your medications were changed to: amlodipine, carvedilol, and lisinopril.
You will need to have your creatinine levels checked regularly as both of these medications may need to be adjusted based on kidney function.
When you see your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], make sure you have a repeat chest xray done to ensure resolution of the pleural effusion.
