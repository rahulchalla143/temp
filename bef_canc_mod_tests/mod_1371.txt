Given these findings the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2166-6-20**] which determined that the left ventricular ejection fraction was 45% with right dominant coronary artery.
Mucomyst 3 cc b.i.d., first dose was administered [**2166-6-19**] for cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 97.4, pulse 80 and sinus, blood pressure 121/79, respiratory rate 20, 90% room air saturation.
Chest: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The chest was otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, obese but nontender to palpation with positive bowel sounds and no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly and no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
LABORATORY DATA:  As of [**2166-7-29**] the white blood cell count was 7.3, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 440.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25, BUN 32, creatinine 1.1, glucose 105, calcium 8.9, magnesium 2.1.
After obtaining a successful preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to diagonal) on [**2166-6-26**].
The patient also maintained good oxygen saturation post extubation and maintained adequate blood pressures after Lasix administration and beta blocker initiation.
That evening the patient developed an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation to 130-140 beats per minute which was treated initially with 10 mg of Lopressor and 500 cc of normal saline bolus to maintain the systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg.
By postoperative day number four the patient's chest tubes were removed and the patient was anticipated for discharge.
Further evaluation was required and the patient was maintained in the hospital.
The patient also underwent a bronchoscopy for the presence of productive cough.
Given chest x-ray findings which showed bibasilar atelectasis and rather unimpressive bronchoscopy findings, the patient was initiated on aggressive chest physiotherapy regimen.
The patient exhibited good strength along with a chest x-ray which did not show a focal infiltrate.
The patient's effusions were also small and moderate on the CT suggesting that his persistent ventilatory dependence was not completely mechanical in nature.
By postoperative day number 13, the patient's pressure and oxygen saturation maintained adequate levels and physical therapy reevaluation was sought.
By [**2166-7-28**] the patient's white blood cell count rose moderately and urinalysis indicated the patient had developed a urinary tract infection following prolonged catheterization.
