Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
A PSA was sent for routine post-prostatectomy screening and was found to be undetectable.
CAD:  EKG showed ischemic changes new from previous tracing 06/[**2188**].
Troponins were mildly positive at .05.
Records from [**Hospital 882**] hospital were obtained, showing that EKG at the current admission was unchanged from an ED visit there [**2188-9-19**] when the patient was noted to be hypotensive.
Troponins were flat.
Due to his agitation, he received an extra dose of 2.5mg Zydis Zyprexa (he takes 2.5mg at bedtime nightly).
CPR was stopped, and evaluation revealed normal laboratories from the morning, FSBS 171, and ECG with new QTc prolongation compared to admission.
Labs were drawn and he was settled in, after which he complained of vague mild abdominal "soreness" that had resolved.
He was monitored on telemetry for the remainder of his stay without further events.
Hypertension: The patient was initially hypertensive to the 180's with HR 50-70.
Head CT from prior admission was notable for evidence of microvascular ischemia, prominent ventricles, and a single focus of likely chronic blood product in the L frontal [**Hospital1 3630**].
Electrolytes and B12 were WNL.
The psychiatry consult service saw the patient and advised that a further dementia workup including formal neuropsychiatric testing, laboratory testing, and consideration of head MRI be pursued after his mental status had returned to baseline several months after his hospital stay.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency (iron 40 mg, TIBC 348).
