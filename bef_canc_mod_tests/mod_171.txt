A TTE was done which was notable for EF30-35% w/ mildly dilated LA, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum and apex of the LV.
She also had 3+ MR. With the addition of lasix + Lisinopril, her Creatinine increased to 2.0, so both were stopped on discharge.
She was tachycardic with HR 120s and with O2 sats 100% on NRB, and diffuse wheezes on exam.
ABG 7.21/54/73.
Her proBNP was 3300.
In the ED here, her CXR was c/w CHF.
-COPD - FEV1 - 90%; FVC - 82%; FEV1/FVC - 90% - c/w mild obstructive ventilatory pattern, DLCO mildly reduced -CVA - 4 [**Last Name (un) **] - Sx were blurry vision -LBBB .
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.3 BP 155/60 HR 80 RR 18 O2 sat 100% AC 0.5/500->521/5/2 GENERAL: Intubated, sedated.
[**2121-3-17**] - CTA (at [**Location (un) 620**]) - per ED report - negative for PE, otherwise stable from [**2-13**] .
[**2121-2-13**] - Chest CT scan - postoperative appearance of the lung with loculated apical and basilar pleural fluid collections at the left side.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
Parvus tardus of the right main renal and interlobar arteries suggests possible renal artery stenosis and further evaluation with MRA is suggested.
CHF - The patient has an EF of 40% with 2-3 + MR, and pulmonary HTN, thus biventricular failure.
CAD - The patient's ECHO revealed focal akinesis/hypokinesis which suggests the presence of CAD.
Her enzymes remained stable and she had no telemetry events.
She had a negative stress test and MIBI, and therefore was continued on medical management such as a statin, beta-blocker, ace and aspirin and she was advised to follow up with a cardiologist as well as to have a repeat ECHO in 3 months.
Her urine lytes were consistent with intrinsic reanl causes.
Carotid bruits - The patient had a carotid US, which revealed 70-79% stenosis, and she was advised to have this checked again in 6 months.
Her iron studies were not revealing and her hematocrit remained stable during her course.
Stage 1A Lung Cancer - The patient is not on any current therapy at this point in time , and will need a follow-up CT in 3 months to monitor RLL nodule.
Possible Renal artery stenosis: The patient's renal us revealed  parvus tardus of the right main renal and interlobar arteries, which suggests possible renal artery stenosis.
Based on this the patient should have this followed as an outpatient and may need an MRA in the future.

If you have any further episodes of heart failure, you may need further intervention including a cardiac catheterization.
At the appointment on Tuesday, you can have your blood pressure checked.
CT scan for a 7 mm intermediate nodule in RLL that will need 3 month follow up from [**3-/2120**] .
Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6162**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] M. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6163**] for an appointment.
