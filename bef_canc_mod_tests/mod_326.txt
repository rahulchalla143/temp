CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2200-11-30**] 3:35 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Transmitral Doppler E>A and TDI E/e' <8 suggesting normal diastolic function, and normal LV filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
However, his CT is improved from before.
He had MRSA on urine although negative blood cultures at his previous admission.
Repeat blood cultures x2 were done and pending at time of discharge.
He was started on Linezolid IV 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Meropenem 500mg q6h and Caspo 70 mg loading, 50 mg IV daily for presumed line infection.
An Echo was done and was a normal study.
Continue to monitor INR and Coumadin dosing.
INR at time of discharge was 4.2.
INR 4.2.
Monitor INR and adjust Coumadin dose accordingly.
