CXR [**11-27**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Exam positioning is somewhat limited due to lordotic technique.
Given these limitations, the exam still appears normal without evidence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, edema, or pleural effusions.
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE [**11-26**]: The degree of lumbar lordosis is somewhat accentuated but there is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Visualized contents of the intrathecal sac is somewhat limited on CT examination and displays expected mass effect of the adjacent thecal sac related to disc osteophyte complexes most pronounced at the C5-C6 interspace where the entire ventral thecal sac appears effaced.
CT Brain [**11-28**]:  Mild interval increase hyperdense material along the left frontal extra-axial space consistent with likely increased subdural bleeding; small epidural bleeding.
CT Brain [**11-30**]: Mild interval improvement in the amount of pneumocephalus with persistent bilateral low-density extradural collections.
MRI [**2141-1-16**]: FINDINGS: This single sequence is compared with the multiplanar post-contrast MR examination obtained the preceding day, which was extremely motion-limited, as well as the more diagnostic study of [**2141-1-6**].
CT scan [**2141-1-16**]: FINDINGS: There is a right parietal craniotomy defect with right frontal pneumocephalus and air in the right lateral ventricle frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is within the spectrum of post-surgical change.
Post operatively he was extubated, follow up CT scan showed decrease size of subdural and pneumocephlus.
He was noticed not to be moving his right side as well as left, a second CT was unchanged he would withdraw his right arm to nailbed pressure only.
On POD#2 his exam continued to be obtunded with eye opening only to pain and continued weakness on left side though his legs seem to be moving more than the previous day and nursing reported more sponteous movement on right side.
On [**12-3**] Sputum cultures resulted positive as the pt continued to produce copious amounts of thick yellow secretions.
Neuro exam showed following commands inconsistenetly with R UE.
Head CTs followed during hospital stay showed interval improvement.
His dobhoff was replaced for poor calorie counts.
They recommended an MRI, which showed new brain lesions on [**1-7**].
A steriotactic biopsy was planned.
The steriotactic biopsy was done on [**2141-1-16**] and it indicated that the mass was an MS lesion but the final pathology report is pending at time of discharge.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
