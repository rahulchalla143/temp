In triage, BP was in systolic 90s, which was attributed to the recent BBKer increase.
He then dropped his BP to systolic 60s, no symptoms except darkening in his vision, unclear etiology, and was given 1 liter IVF.
He responded appropriately with repeat BP 90/46 and HR in 70s.
ECG was V-paced and without changes.
CXR in ER showed mild interval increase in bibasilar effusions with persistent findings of mild congestive heart failure.
The patient was about to be admitted to the general medicine floor, when his BP dropped again to systolic 80s.
While in the unit, he received more fluid and his bp remained stable (85-150)/(51-81).
