Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-10-7**] no significant change.
SUPINE AP CHEST ([**2-10**]):  A tracheostomy is in place at the thoracic inlet.
# Urosepsis: Patient had fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate c/w sepsis, with potential sources on admission being urine, sacral decubitus ulcer, and lung, with his trach and copious secretions.
GNR rapidly grew from sputum and blood cultures, speciated as proteus and pseudomonas sensitive to cepholasporins.
Identical species of proteus grew from urine culture, and therefore uriary source was most likely.
A vancomycin trough should be checked on [**2120-2-18**] with goal 15-20. .
Patient has been evaluated by plastics on prior admissions, and felt not to be surgical candidate.
He was C Diff neg x3.
