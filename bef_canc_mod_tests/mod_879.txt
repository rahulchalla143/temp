They called EMS and she was found to have HR 20-30's and they were unable to palpate a pulse.
The tracing showed high degree AV block 2:1.
The patient was also found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3 and hyperkalemic to 5.6.
She reportly underwent non-contrast CT abdomen that was negative, but no report or images.
Her WBC count was 12.4, lactate 3.3 and given 1 dose of Zosyn & Imipenem.
The patients labs were significant for Cr 2.8, BUN 107, WBC: 11.3, lactate 2.2, INR: 3.9.
Cardiac enzymes were trop 0.08, CK 41.
UA was negative and CXR did not show infiltrate or extensive edema.

NECK: Supple with JVP unable to assess given cordis on RIJ.

IMAGING: RENAL U/S: IMPRESSION: At least no diastolic flow with suggestion of reversal of diastolic flow within an arterial branch within the renal hilum.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-12-7**], the severity of aortic stenosis has slightly progressed.
# High Degree AV block/syncope: Pt with syncopal episode and found to have HR 20-30's at OSH.
However, when the pacer was stopped briefly to check her underlying rhythm her blood pressure dropped to the 70s.
She did not have any evidence of acute MI on ECG or by cardiac enzymes or myocarditis.
Baseline creatinine function following transplant was 0.8-1.2.
Her diuretics and ACEi were initially held but restarted once creatinine improved to 1.0.
Renal ultrasound of the transplant was within normal limits.
Leukocytosis/Fever: Pt with WBC count of 11.3 that rose as high as 15.3 during her hospital stay.
The patient had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis given her abdominal pain and nausea.
She did not have any cause of infection visualized on CT scan.
Her urine culture from the OSH grew ESBL klebsiella, blood cultures negative.
CE trop 0.08, CK 41.
She was monitored with serial EKGs and continued on an aspirin and a statin.
# History of splenic vein thrombosis: Her INR was initally elevated at 3.9  Her coumdadin was held prior to pacemaker placement, and INR trended down to 1.4. .
# HTN: Pt BP was SBP 140-130's on admission with a paced rhythm.
Her betablocker and ACEi were held.
