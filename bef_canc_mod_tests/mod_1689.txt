His PA pressures were 44/26.
After cardiac catheterization he was transferred to the CCU.
His pressure fell to 70 over palp and he got shocked at 200 jewels and at 300 jewels without returning to normal sinus rhythm.
He had an anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**2188**] and his cardiac enzymes were positive in [**2197-4-15**].
His ejection fraction after his last episode was 55%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, heart rate 128.
Arteriole blood pressure 130/77 on dopamine.
Pulmonary artery pressure is 55/20.
Respiratory rate 32.
Cardiac S1 S2.
White count 13.6, hematocrit 42.8, platelets 297.
CK initially was 145, PT 13.1, PTT 24.5, INR 1.1.
The patient was started gingerly on a beta blocker Lopressor, which was increased to 25 b.i.d., which he tolerated well.
Dopamine was started to keep the blood pressure up and also to stimulate the sinus, which we felt kept him in sinus rhythm.
However, on hospital day six the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a maximal rate of 130.
He was extubated and was tachypneic for the next 24 hours likely because of secretions, which we aggressively suctioned and also a high pulmonary diastolic pressure for which we diuresed him aggressively.
Blood cultures were drawn.
Sputum was also positive for strep pneumonia and we obtained a head CT to evaluate his sinuses, which showed no evidence of sinusitis.
The patient has a history of a splenectomy, which was done 36 years ago.
Surgery consult was obtained as well as a CAT scan of his abdomen.
NG lavage showed bright red blood, which cleared and then coffee grounds.
We followed his hematocrit, which remained stable without any necessity for transfusing.
