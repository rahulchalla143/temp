HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was seen immediately on consultation by the renal service for evaluation of her hyponatremia.

Urine studies were recommended.
The patient was admitted for evaluation and treatment of her congestive heart failure as well as monitoring of her cellulitis of her foot.
Also consultation by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16471**], the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] associated psychiatrist, who managed her Tegretol therapy.
