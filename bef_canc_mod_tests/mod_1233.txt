CXR showed bilateral effusions.
Liver u/s showed intrahepatic fluid collection and subdiaphragmatic fluid collection, new in the interval since [**2170-3-4**].
Abd CT also showed large bilateral pleural effusions,persistent stone in distal pancreatic duct with massive pancreatic ductal dilatation and two fluid collections, one at the dome(72x34mm) and one periportally (58x77mm).
ABG showed worsening PaO2.
Respiratory rate increased to 36 with accessory muscle use and O2 desat to 82%.
Blood cultures were  negative.
On [**4-9**] rectal swab was VRE positive.
Cardiac cath was recommended, but given the ARF and pulmonary condition, this was deferred.
Levophed was used for BP of 88/56.
Creatinine trend up and CCVHD was started on [**4-11**] for metabolic acidosis/ARF/hyperkalemia/oliguria.
Creatinine increased to as high as 2.9 with K+ of 6.
Urine demonstrated granular casts indicative of ATN.
BP improved and pressors were weaned off.
On [**4-10**] a left thoracentesis was done with 1.5 liters removed.
Cultures were negative.
On [**4-12**] he had an episode of afib that converted to SR. Levophed requirements decreased with preservation of cardiac output and cardiac index.
Creatinine trended down to 1.6.
Attempt at aspiration of the right-sided subdiaphragmatic collection revealed old hematoma, therefore a catheter was not placed.
This grew enterococcus (vanco sensitive), pan [**Last Name (un) 36**] pseudomonas, staph aureus coag + (pcn & emycin resistent), strep veridans and pan sensitive pseudomonas.
Cultures from thoracentesis from R & L  were negative.
On [**4-12**] LFTs increased with ast 2439 from 109, alt 2045 from 12, alk phos 80 from 82 and t.bili 0.6 from 0.4.
INR increased to 1.8.
On [**4-24**] a Abd CT was showed bilateral pleural effusions left more than right and right subdiaphragmatic collection.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
On [**4-17**] bilateral upper extremity u/s was done for right arm swelling.
LV systolic function appeared depressed with septal and apical akinesis/hypokinesis and basal inferior akinesis).
Goal inr was [**2-3**].
Inr was 3.0 on [**4-27**] on coumadin 3mg qd.
He received FFP and 1 unit of PRBC for hct drop to 25.9.
Stools were negative for c.diff x 5.
CXR and CT scan demonstrated moderate pleural effusion on the left and large effusion on the right.
Gram stain and culture were negative.
As a part of the work-up, he underwent a repeat TTE which showed a stable EF 25-30% without visualizing the LV thrombus seen on prior TTEs.
His SBP was persistantly elevated on Carvedilol and hydralazine and a PA catheter was placed to assist with management.
His PA numbers were initially elevated along with his SVR, and his cardiac output/index was normal.
Nitro gtt was started but did not improve SBP and was therefore d/cd.
His blood sugars were elevated requiring a transient insulin gtt while on TPN.
CXR showed marked worsening of left retrocardiac opacity.
EKG was without acute change.
Urine was sent for temp on [**5-8**].
Blood cultures were sent for temp of 101.3 on [**5-10**].
He experienced ARF from supra therapeutic tobra levels and IV contrast for a chest CT.  Tobra was switched to Aztreonam for 18 days.
Creatinine trended down to 2.4 from 3.1.
A repeat u/a and cx of urine were sent on [**6-1**].
On [**5-16**] a transjugular liver biopsy revealed Central venular hemorrhage, congestion and hepatocellular drop out, focal bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils.
An ERCP was done to rule out biliary obstruction/ischemia.
Post procedure CXR was improved.
Thoracentesis of the right lung was considered by Int.
An u/s of his scrotum was done for complaints of bilateral swelling with discomfort greater on the right side.
This showed right scrotal fluid collection with multiple septations and low level echoes, which possibley represented a chronic hydrocele with proteinaceous debris, although a pyocele could not be completely excluded.
Immunosuppression for discharge consisted of prograf 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
Re-institution was to be considered on follow up visit [**6-4**].
