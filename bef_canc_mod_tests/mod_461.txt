Her initial CAT scan in [**2158**] revealed her aneurysm to be approximately 4 cm in diameter with subsequent CT scanning this year revealing a significant enlargement to 5.6 cm.
She had a full course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and her last colonoscopy revealed no recurrent cancerous lesions.
Her hepatic workup was negative for any liver involvement.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation of her preoperative coronary artery disease.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  CAT scan with a 5.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm starting just below the renal arteries and ending at the iliac bifurcation.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 58% ejection fraction, normal left main coronary artery, mild narrowing of approximately 50% stenosis at the ostium of the left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex artery with a 60% stenosis before the origin of the first major marginal.
Chest x-ray revealed slight ventricular enlargement without evidence of heart failure.
Electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific lateral ST segment changes, but otherwise normal sinus rhythm.
Her white blood cell count was 10.1 with a hemoglobin of 13.2, hematocrit 42.1, platelet count 341.
Potassium blood sugar was 85.
BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, potassium 4.6.
Other electrolytes were within normal limits.
She did well until postoperative day number three when it was noted that she had an elevated white blood cell count to be approximately 20.2.
Her hemoglobin and hematocrit had also dropped from 33 to 29.6 and a rectal examination was performed due to her history of colon CA, which was guaiac negative.
A stool was sent for C-difficile.
