He was then transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further care and cardiac catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination upon presentation to the Cardiac Care Unit was temperature of 97??????
with a pulse of 76, blood pressure 108/64, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 94% on 8 liters face mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat revealed normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
His carotids revealed no bruits.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values upon presentation revealed the patient with a white count of 18, hematocrit 37, platelets 357.
Basic metabolic panel revealed a sodium of 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 21, BUN 27, creatinine 4.8 with a glucose of 216.
His liver function tests were unremarkable.
His albumin was 3.6 with a calcium of 10.2, magnesium 1.7 and a phosphorus of 3.7.
His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with ST inversions in 1, 2 and V4 through V6 with left ventricular hypertrophy or stream pattern.
Chest x-ray revealed mildly flattened diaphragms with a question of a right middle lobe density.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed diffuse left anterior descending disease with 50% stenosis of the circumflex and a total occlusion of the right coronary artery with multiple collaterals.
The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction was normal.
The patient initially had a small leak from his Hickman Port-A-Cath so he had to undergo a serial hemodialysis to correct his hyperkalemia.
Infectious disease - It was noted that the patient had a question of pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary edema on his chest x-ray.
He subsequently underwent a chest computerized tomography scan which revealed bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than the left and subsequently underwent thoracentesis which revealed fluid of a transudative nature without any organisms and a negative gram stain.
The patient has remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization and has had multiple blood cultures drawn which all were negative for growth.
It is recommended the patient receive serial blood cultures during hemodialysis to rule out the possible occult bacteremia.
The patient was noted to have an increased leukocytosis throughout his hospitalization with an average white blood cell count of 10 to 15 going as high as 30.
It is possible the patient has an occult infection that has not been detected with serial blood cultures as well as chest computerized tomography scan.
His hematocrit was checked and remained stable throughout his hospitalization.
The patient has remained afebrile with negative blood cultures throughout his hospitalization.
The chest x-ray was questionable for a possible pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis with a negative thoracentesis.
He will need Coumadin anticoagulation for a total of 30 days status post his episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Endocrine - It was noted that the patient had a blood glucose as high as 600 at an outside hospital and has remained in the upper 150s to low 250s throughout his hospitalization here.
He had a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1 which established the diagnosis of a new onset diabetes.
Nephrocaps 1 capsule p.o.
The patient is also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44750**] at the Veteran's Administration Hospital, phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34340**].
He is to receive dialysis on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and it is recommended that surveillance blood cultures be drawn during this time.
