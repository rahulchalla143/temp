Their imaging appearance is nonspecific, however, given the patient's history of multiple intestinal AVMs, this appearance could be compatible with multiple hepatic AVMs.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo F with DM2, HTN, chronic anemia and chronic GI bleeding presenting with recurrent GI bleeding resulting in acute blood loss anemia, s/p transfusion, EGD and colonoscopy with thermal therapy treatment of stomach and cecal angioectasias.
Her Hct remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
Due to severe abdominal pain complaints she had an abdominal/pelvis CT without any signs of an acute pathology.
She underwent EGD and colonoscopy with findings of numerous angioectasias in the stomach and cecum all of which were treated with thermal therapy during the procedure.
She had no further problems, including stable Hct and resolution of abdominal pain complaints (which were probably related to constipation).
The patient will follow-up with her PCP and GI as [**Year/Month/Day 1988**] for further follow-up on this issue.
