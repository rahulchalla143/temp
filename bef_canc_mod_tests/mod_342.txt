After approximately 12 hours of discomfort, the patient went to the [**Hospital 47**] Campus where an EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes.
CPK at that time was 1510, with a 7.6 index and troponin greater than 50.
The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization at that time which showed significant two vessel disease and an ejection fraction of approximately 30%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient presented with a blood pressure of 133/84.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal and grossly intact.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service on [**2117-6-21**], following cardiac catheterization and placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.
The postoperative EKG showed 1:1 AV conduction with a PR interval of approximately 0.22.
The patient was afterwards paced but a strip of several seconds was obtained which showed complete absence of P waves, absent QRS, and absent pacer spiking.
Electrophysiology consult was obtained at this time and the patient was increased on the V lead sensitivity to improve the pacing of the patient's heart rate and anticoagulation was done for the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation.
On [**2117-6-28**], the patient's demand pacing was decreased to a rate of 40.
The pacer was then increased back to a rate of 60-80 and the patient improved symptomatically.
The patient had a urinalysis which showed 11 white blood cells in the urine and subsequently the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin for possible urinary tract infection.
Urine culture done from this sample grew no bacteria.
