2) Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely patent.
3) Resting hemodynamics revealed elvated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 24 and LVEDP of 35mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.26 l/min/m2.
There was normal systemic arterial pressure with a BP of 136/73, mean 97mmHg.
4) There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak [**Company **] of 56mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.56cm2.

Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-20mmHg).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-8-21**], the aortic valve leaflets are slightly more mobile and there has been a small, expected increase in calculated aortic valve area.
Initial CXR and phyiscal were consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
She was found to have a Hct of 22 on admission and an INR of 2.6 despite stopping coumadin on [**10-31**].
Oncer her INR was <2.0 she underwent successful AV vavluloplasty w/ an incraese of her valvular area from 0.5-->0.8cm2, decrease in peak velocity from 4.8-->4.1m/sec and peak [**Month/Day (4) **] from 90mmHg-->66mmHg.
# RHYTHM: Patient has a h/o Afib and on presentation she was found to be in Afib with HR up to 120s.
Once her INR was <2.0 she underwent AV valvuloplasty as above.
EKG w/o signs of ischemia.
Cardiac cath showed right dominant system demonstrated two vessel disease.
# Anemia: Patient presented w/ Hct 22.5, baseline 27-32 (only 2 measurements in OMR).
Her iron levels were found to be low indicating severe iron deficiency anemia.
Her Hct remained stable at 27 post-transfusions.
