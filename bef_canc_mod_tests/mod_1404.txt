was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] after ECHO for workup of shortness of breath revealed moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Repeat ECHO 24h later showed stable-to-improved effusion and was discharged with plans for f/u ECHO in 14d.
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of a distended belly in setting of previous volvulus.
She was guaiac negative with VSS and received Abdominal CT shich showed large pericardial effusion and presacral, perihepatic fluid, but no acute abdominal process.
was admitted for planned f/u ECHO in the AM.
Physical Exam: VS - T 99.8 137/65 HR 101, 95%RA, no pulsus Gen: middle-aged woman, NAD, repititious and perseverative, follows commands.
Conjunctiva were pale, no with sublingual pallor, MMM Neck: unable to assess JVP as pt.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
denies belly pain but seems to grimace on palpation of RUQ>RLQ.
+ hirsutism Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact, moving all 4 ext.
Pertinent Results: Echocardiogram [**2144-6-23**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There is substantial right atrial collapse and brief diastolic invagination of the right ventricular outflow tract (cine loops #15 and #28), consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
CT chest, abdomen & pelvis W/CONTRAST [**2144-6-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Surface immunoglobulin expression is extremely dim-to-absent, precluding evaluation of clonality.
T cells comprise approximately 80% of lymphoid gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 5.0.
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.

Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo F with mental retardation & h/o volvulus s/p colonic resection admitted with hypoxia & abdominal distention, also repeat echocardiogram given newly diagnosed pericardial effusion.
W/u already started at [**Hospital6 **] and so far studies negative except for elevated ESR, CRP & CA 125.
No evidence of reaccumulation of fluid seen on repeat echocardiogram or vital signs including nml pulsus.
# CT findings: Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the axillary, supraclavicular and mediastinal regions with pulmonary nodules in the left lung apex which were concering for neoplastic process.
However, pathology was not diagnostic.
Guaiac negative stools during admission.
Pt will need outpt evaluation for excisional lymph node biopsy vs mediastinoscopy for tissue diagnosis, if desired by the family.
No evidence of volvulus, cholecystitis or obstruction; imaging showed significant amounts of air with colonic distention, likely colonic ileus.
Also given possibility of malignancy, it's recommended that pt under colonoscopy as part of further workup.
# Microcytic anemia: c/w anemia of chronic disease; low retic count, however hematocrit stable.
Guaiac negative stool x 1 in the ED.
# Peripheral edema: Unclear if new, no evidence of chronic venous stasis and no significant ascites seen on CT despite abdominal distention.
DNR/DNI  Medications on Admission: - Multivitamin 1 tab - CaCo3 1250mg qdaily - Celebrex 100 mg twice a day - artifical tears PRN - Eucerin cream topical every day, - Vitamin E and Vitamin D ointments - Chlorhexidine topical - FeSo4 325 mg [**Hospital1 **] - started on levaquin 500mg at NH today given transient hypoxia .
You had a biopsy of one of these nodes that was not diagnostic.
You should speak with your doctor about having an excisional biopsy of one of your lymph nodes.
You should discuss whether you should have a mediastinoscopy or excisional biopsy of one of your lymph nodes.
