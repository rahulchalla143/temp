The examination is otherwise without change since the recent study a few hours earlier  [**4-30**] CXR dobhoff: Successful post-pyloric nasal intestinal feeding tube placement.
MICROBIOLOGY:  [**4-19**] blood culture: Serratia (levofloxacin sensitive) [**4-21**] sputum: MRSA [**4-28**] urine: negative [**4-29**] c. diff: negative [**5-4**] urine: negative [**5-4**] blood culture: pending  CARDIOLOGY:  [**4-22**] Echo: .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2151-2-18**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
He required some neosynephrine for blood pressure control in the immediate post-oeprative period.
He developed fevers on post-op day 3 and blood cultures were sent which revealed Serratia; he was started on Levofloxacin on [**4-19**] for this.
Chest x-ray revealed significant bilateral effusions and bilateral chest tubes were placed.
At this time, cultures from his sputum revealed MRSA and he was started on vancomycin on [**4-26**].
He again required neosynephrine for blood pressure support, however this was eventually weened off with low systolic blood pressures in the 90s-100s tolerated (a cortisol stimulation test was normal).
He failed a swallow evaluation and a dobhoff tube was placed for tube-feeding; he failed a repeat swallow evaluation on [**5-6**].
He had some significant diarrhea and leukocytosis on [**4-29**] and flagyl was started on [**5-1**] empirically for c.diff though cultures were negative; nonetheless his leukocytosis resolved after commencement of his flagyl and it was continued through [**5-7**].
Anticoagulation with coumadin was started on [**5-6**] with goal INR in the sub-therapeutic range (1.5-2.0) given his history of GI bleeding.
Rehab screening was commenced and the patient was discharged to a rehab facility.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for temperature >38.0.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): dose daily for goal INR 1-1.5.
