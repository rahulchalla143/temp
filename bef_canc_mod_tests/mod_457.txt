The tests were specifically cholestatic with elevated alkaline phosphatase.
A liver biopsy was performed on [**4-8**] which was consistent with recurrent viral hepatitis C with grade 0-1 inflammation and stage 0 cirrhosis.
His most recent HCV viral load was 26,900,000 (stable from last count from [**1-26**], elevated from [**9-27**]).
Liver biopsy in [**9-/2144**] showed stage 4  cirrhosis and small well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Found to have grade 1 esophageal varices on EGD in 4/[**2143**].

Pt had abdominal imaging including doppler U/S to ensure graft patency which was normal as well as KUB to visualize correct placement of prior biliary stent via ERCP, and the stent was confirmed to be in the correct position in the RUQ.
Pt's prograf levels were carefully monitored and as his levels were supratherapeutic at 11.9, prograf was decreased from 1mg [**Hospital1 **] to 0.5mg on [**5-17**] and then held starting on [**5-18**] as his levels trended downward.
In order to rule out rejection or potential fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, pt underwent bedside liver biopsy on [**5-19**].
However, on the evening of [**5-19**], pt c/o severe mid-epigastric pain and had a few episodes of vomiting, so stat CT abd was ordered to rule out hemorrhage.
As pt reached CT scanner, he complained of anxiety and ringing in his ears, then had a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure lasting <1 minute.
Sirolimus 2mg PO daily was initiated on [**5-21**] per liver recommendations, as pt was no longer on tacrolimus (since [**5-18**]) Lactulose and rifaximin were continued.
Final pathology demonstrated findings consistent with early recurrent hepatitis C.  Upon the patient's return to the floor, his bilirubins began to slowly trend downward, but the patient's alkphos continued to rise, raising concern for an ongoing acute process, such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH).
Given this concern, a repeat liver biopsy was performed.
Final pathology results were consistent with the previous biopsy with mildly decreased inflammation, in favor of recurrent hepatitis C and decreasing the likelihood of FCH.
Tacrolimus level was 8.9 on the day of the seizure.
CT on [**5-19**] showed no acute intracranial process, and MRI on [**5-20**] revealed increased putamenal signal bilaterally, consistent with tacrolimus toxicity or acute hepatic encephalopathy.
ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY : Pt's creatinine had been increasing since [**5-16**] (prior to ICU) with Cr 1.2 (at admission) to 2.1.
Creatinine improved with gentle hydration and was 1.4 on the day of discharge.
14 day course of antibiotics was completed on [**5-28**], and repeat C. diff toxin was negative.
Patient reported an improvement in his symptoms but still reported diarrhea with each meal.
Fecal cultures were negative, a repeat C. diff toxin was negative.
[**Name2 (NI) **] acute tx for lower quadrant abdominal pain that had no guarding/rebound, with CT abd/pelvis on [**5-20**] negative for abdominal hemorrhage.
You underwent liver biopsy on [**5-19**] and unfortunately suffered two seizures later on that day and went to the Intensive Care Unit.
We STOPPED your cholesevalam 7.
We ADDED Benadryl which you can use as needed for itching  Followup Instructions: PLEASE FOLLOW-UP AS BELOW:  [**Month/Day (4) **] [**Hospital 1389**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2146-6-8**] 2:20  You will need to have labs drawn on Friday [**6-3**] and Monday [**6-6**] including CBC, CHEM7 and RAPAMYCIN levels.
You will also get TTG testing and testing for bacterial overgrowth with the hydrogen breath test.
