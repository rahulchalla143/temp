They immediately determined that they would transfer him to [**Hospital1 **] after a CAT scan revealed that he had massive free air.
This was initially controlled with argon beam and packing, as the colectomy was completed.
A retropancreatic space was mobilized a bit more to clean this out.
He had a Marlex mesh, which was there attached.
The peritoneal edges were identified and freshened, and the skin was mobilized back to allow fascial closure, which was relatively easily accomplished.
He had 3 units of blood, 500 cc of Hespan, 2 units of albumin that is 500 cc at 5% albumin, and his urine output at the end of the case was 1000 cc.
Sponge, needle and instrument counts were correct times 2.
Operative Note- [**2108-4-12**] PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Fascial dehiscence.
PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy with repair of fascial dehiscence, insertion of a Surgisis Gold mesh.
Subsequent CT revealed that he had a fascial dehiscence.
At this point, the inferior sutures were removed, and a large tailed running suture was left in place as this dehiscence only occurred over approximately 10 cm, and the remainder of the wound field appeared both on CT and within our examination to be adequately intact.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed because the subcutaneous space was potentially infected, and the skin was closed with staples and Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing was applied.
Sponge, needle and instrument count were correct x2, and the patient was then transported back to the intensive care unit for bronchoscopy because of a left lower lobe atelectasis noted on CT.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, had 100 cc of urine output, and had 1000 cc of crystalloid during the course of the case.
At POD 1 Hct was stable at 24.2.
Urine output was WNL.
At POD 5 a bronchoscopy was performed for RUL and LLL collapse which was negative for evidence obstruction or infectious source.
Abdominal drain culture was (+) enterococcus/pseudomonas.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis showed  two small fluid pockets two small for drainage without evidence of leak or obstruction.
At POD 12 he was transfused for a HCT of 21.4  He was extubated without event.
Repeat video swallow was completed with approval for thickened liquids.
Abdominal drain culture was (+) for pseudomonas/Citrobacter.
Sputum cultures were (+) MRSA/Klebsiella.
At POD 18 he had fascial dehiscence which was noted on exam and (+) per CT scan.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Repeat swallow evaluation allowed for regular diet.
At POD 30/12 WBC was elevated at 33.2.
Repeat CT scan was performed to assess interval change in fascial repair site which was negative for compromised fascial integrity.
WBC remained elevated at ~30 but he was afebrile and was clinically doing well.
Digoxin/Toprol were not restarted.
