Lower extremity Dopplers were also done, and no deep venous thromboses were found.
Blood cultures on the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottle from her PICC line grew out gram-positive cocci on [**7-27**].
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  On admission the patient was begun on TPN for nutritional support.
Cardiology/Pulmonology:  The patient was tachycardiac throughout this admission which was attributed to her fluid losses secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome; however, given the patient's immobility throughout the course of this admission, a CT angiogram was performed to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism, and none were found.
Neurology's recommendations were to obtain a repeat CT scan which was unchanged from previous showing a right frontal lobe extra-axial hypodensity which was stable.
They also recommended repeat MR imaging which was again unremarkable except for a stable extra-axial lesion noted on CT scan.
A follow-up MR scan would be recommended with gadolinium to evaluate for the presence of residual tumor.
