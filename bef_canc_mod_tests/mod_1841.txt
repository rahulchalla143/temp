She has in general been kept on a pressure support ventilation with pressure supports of [**11-27**] and a PEEP of 5 with an FIO2 of 35%.
Due to supratherapeutic levels, her vancomycin has been held and on the morning of the 25th, her vancomycin level was still 20.
She will be given vancomycin for trough levels less than 15.
Acute renal failure:  The patient's creatinine remained slightly above her baseline and on the morning of the 25th, her creatinine was 1.5.
It is felt that the creatinine elevation from her baseline may be secondary to prerenal physiology as the patient has been diuresed with Lasix, and overall remains total body water overloaded.
Anemia:  The patient is a Johovas Witness as mentioned before and does not allow blood transfusions, therefore, she has been maintained on 20,000 units twice a week of Procrit, as well as iron replacement, and her hematocrit has remained stable.
