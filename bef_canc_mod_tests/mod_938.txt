CXR: prelim negative CT ABD: prelim: Relative transition with dilated fecal loaded sigmoid colon proximal to the point of the sigmoid-rectal reanastomosis most compatible with a component of anastomatic narrowing.
No definite vegetations seen Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-9-28**], the findings are similar.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
[**2110-8-16**] Doppler Liver IMPRESSION: 1.
He had an admission CT that revealed fecal loading with an associated dilated proximal colon.
U/A and CXR were negative.
Pt underwent colonoscopy with dilation of anastamotic stricture on [**2110-8-11**] which he tolerated well, however, afterwards became apneic requiring transfer to ICU.
A metal stent was placed on [**8-13**] which he tolerated and f/u KUB showed decreased bowel distension.
He had an abdominal [**Month/Year (2) 950**] performed to assess his liver vasculature, which showed patent vessels.
On POD 2 he was advanced to a regular diet and his foley was discontinued.
- GPC bacteremia: Admission blood cultures grew GPC in pairs and chains.
TTE was neg for vegetations and f/u cultures were neg.
- Apnea: After the colonoscopy with dilation of anastatamotic stricture, pt became apneic on the floor and a code was called.
His O2 saturation was 100% at this time, and he was hemodynamically stable with BP ~140/80 and HR 71.
After receving narcan, patient became responsive and respiratory rate normalized.
- Hypertension: BP was stable on his home meds.
- Cirrhosis: There was no evidence of an acute decompensation, although varices and splenomegaly were noted on CT abdomen.
You underwent a colonoscopy which showed a stricture at the anastomosis.
