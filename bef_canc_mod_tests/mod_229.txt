#) Bacteremia: The patient was transferred from rehab with positive BCx growing coag negative staph sensitive to vancomycin on [**7-12**], and grew VRE sensitive to Linezolid in BCx on [**7-24**].
CXR and CT of the chest was not suggestive of PNA.
CT of the abdomen/ pelvis was without evidence of abscess or any other infectious source.
It will be continued for an unspecified course, to be determined during outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4020**].
Surveillance cultures remained negative for the remainder of the patient?????
BP was unresponsive to IVF boluses and she was transferred to the MICU for closer management, where she briefly required pressors in addition to multiple fluid boluses.
As above, subsequent cultures have been negative to date.
CT, however, demonstrated small abscess in the anterior subcutaneous tissues near the fixation but no deep abscess.
CT scan of abdomen/pelvis was unremarkable except for an incidental finding of a L obturator hematoma (spontaneous in nature - no history of manipulation or trauma).
A repeat CT of the abd/ pelvis showed slight interval expansion of the hematoma, and there was a concern for a pseudoaneurysm.
