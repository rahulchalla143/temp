A ultrasound guided [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] access of the left common     femoral artery.
Angiography of the right lower extremity.
Received right superficial femoral stent placement and on the way to PACU became unresponsive with HR 40s , pulseless, and apneic.
Neither a O2 saturation nor a blood pressure tracing from the A-line was unable to be registered.
Head CT was negative for intracranial bleeding, and she was initiated on therapeutic hypothermia, sedated with versed/fentayl, paralyzed with cisatracurium, and maintained CMV ventilation.
TTE on [**8-27**] showed a LVEF 50-55%, PCWP >18, less vigorous global ventricular function, and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Vital signs normalized and she was extubated with altered mental status, volume overload, and urine output of dark brown color.
CAD: s/p MI [**2183**], cath with 3VD s/p CABGx3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA and ramus); Cath [**2183-6-11**] Severe left main and a three vessel coronary artery disease (LMCA 60%, LAD proximal 90% lesion and 90% apical stenoses, LCx 80%, Ramus 80% ostial lesion).
Diastolic CHF: TTE on [**8-27**] showed a LVEF 50-55%, PCWP >18, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, mildly decreased global ventricular function, mild-moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation 3.

Head CT ([**2188-8-27**]): No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or acute [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territorial infarction.
EEG ([**2188-8-27**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous slowing of the background activity with 5-7 Hz theta and occasional [**2-12**] Hz delta activity.
ECHO ([**2188-8-27**]): TTE, Indication: Cardiac Arrest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) secondary to mild global hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study dated [**2188-1-21**] (images reviewed), global left ventricular systolic function appears less vigorous.
ABI ([**2188-9-15**]): On the right side, monophasic Doppler waveforms were seen at the right femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.
On the left side, monophasic Doppler waveforms were seen at the left femoral, popliteal and dorsalis pedis arteries.
The right ABI was 0.963 and the left ABI was 0.28.
CXR ([**8-27**]): Mild pulmonary edema and more focal opacification in the right upper lung where pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.
CXR ([**9-24**]): 1.

underwent angiogram with distal superficial femoral artery angioplasty and stenting with subsequent PEA arrest (HR 40s, pulseless, and apneic) in the PACU likely [**3-13**] apnea from sedation (versed and propofol) where she was down for approximately 5-10 min.
Her post-arrest course has been complicated by altered mental status likely [**3-13**] toxic metabolic encephalopathy, hemodynamic lability with episodes of hypotension with BPs as low as 60s/30s.
PNA was suspected on [**2188-9-17**] and treated empirically for 7 days of Vancomycin and Cefipime, but remained afebrile with normal white count and negative blood and urine cultures taken before Abx admin.
Had a cognitive-linguistic evaluation on [**9-24**] that showed some deficits with complex manipulation of information, including short-term recall, executive functioning, and attention.
Pain was covered with oxycodone and acetaminophen.
Waveform study [**9-15**] showed failure of stent.
Transfused on unit during HD, but crit and INR stable.
Echo performed shortly after arrest showed preserved EF of 50-55%.
Triggered for lethargy and respiratory distress [**9-25**] but maintained 99% saturation on room air, likely mucus plugging from asthma.
