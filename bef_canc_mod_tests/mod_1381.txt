Rigid bronchoscopy with yellow and black [**Last Name (un) **]     tracheoscope.
A repeat bronch revealed a swollen pharynx and larynx, a concentric web-like stenosis measuring about 5 mm in length, [**7-30**] mm in diameter, 5 cm from the cricoid cartilage and 6 cm from the carina, moderate to large amount of granulation obstructing about 50% of the lumen of the right branch of the y-stent.

ECHO [**2149-3-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Bronchoscopy showed evidence of mid-tracheal stenosis about [**7-30**] mm in diameter.
