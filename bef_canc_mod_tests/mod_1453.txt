Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Bronchoscopy [**2168-7-20**] Blood transfusions, 4 units PICC insertion [**2168-7-30**]   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with a history of Tangier disease, paraplegia secondary to thoracic cord compression, and poorly controlled hypertension who presented with right tongue numbness and arm tingling.
Head CT showed a 4x3cm L frontal hemorrhage.
MRI and MRA were done at that time, and it was thought to be due to a pial malformation.
More recently she was hospitalized from [**6-26**] to [**6-30**] for poorly controlled hypertension (201 systolic) for which she was started on Diovan 160mg, Norvasc 10mg and HCTZ 12.5mg.
Past Medical History: - hypertension - paraplegia with indwelling Foley s/p spinal surgery [**9-22**] for thoracic epidural mass (T11/T12) - demyelinating neuropathy with bilateral Bell's palsy - occipital hemorrhage [**1-24**] - thrombocytopenia - tangier disease - AVN of bilateral humeral heads (likely secondary to long-term steroid use) - GERD - depression   Social History: Has lived in [**Hospital2 34116**] [**Hospital3 **] since [**4-23**].
EKG [**7-17**]: Sinus rhythm 80bpm.
Prominent Q waves in leads III and aVF are new as compared with previous tracing of [**2168-1-21**].
Head CT [**7-17**]: FINDINGS: In the left posterior frontal lobe along the high convexity, there is a 4.5 x 3.5 cm parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
Given the absence of prior studies for comparison and abnormal appearance of the glenohumeral joint, evaluation for interval change is somewhat limited.
CXR [**7-18**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**1-23**], there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the distal stomach.
The examination is unchanged except for increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm.
CXR [**7-19**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-18**], there is little change.
This has developed since the most recent study and is worrisome for developing pneumonia in the region.
CXR [**7-20**]: FINDINGS: Posterior thoracolumbar spinal fusion hardware is intact and unchanged.
EEG [**7-21**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of rare right frontal and left temporal sharp waves which may represent epileptogenic regions in the cerebral cortex.
Head CT [**7-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG [**7-22**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of left frontal and frontotemporal slowing suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in these regions and correlates with her history of intracerebral hemorrhage.
EEG [**7-23**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of left frontal and frontotemporal slowing due to subcortical dysfunction in these regions and correlates with her history of intracerebral hemorrhage.
Head CT [**7-28**]: IMPRESSION: Stable size of the large left frontal lobe hemorrhage.
[**7-20**] BAL: GRAM STAIN 2+ POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
[**7-27**] stool cultures negative for salmonella, shigella, enteric gram negative rods, campylobacter, ova and parasite.

[**2168-7-18**] 02:09AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.0 eAG-97   Brief Hospital Course: 59yo F with Tangier disease and baseline paraplegia, who presented with large new left frontal intracranial hemorrhage.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: Per neuro recommendations, her blood pressure was controlled for target SBP < 160.
She received serial head CTs to ensure no progression of the bleed.
Her [**7-21**] head CT did show minimal interval increase in left sulcal effacement and rightward subfalcine herniation measuring 6 mm, rather than the prior 3 mm.
Her [**7-19**] urine culture showed grew vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus and Pseudomonas, with repeat urine culture on [**7-28**] growing VSE at [**2158**]/ml, and a [**7-29**] urine culture with no growth.
#MRSA Pneumonia - In the ICU, she developed a retrocardiac infiltrate with BAL growing out MRSA.
#Acute renal failure - On [**7-26**] her creatinine rose from a baseline of 0.3 to 1.5 and then climbed to a max of 2.2 on [**7-29**] before trending downwards back to 1.5.
Renal was consulted and thought her ARF was due to acute tubular necrosis, likely from hypotension related to a Lasix drip she received.
#Multifactorial anemia - Ms. [**Known lastname **] came with an Hct of 34.
Several times during her hospital course, her hematocrit drifted down (minimum of 19.6 on [**7-21**]), and she ended up requiring a total of 4 units of PRBC during her stay, with the last transfusion on [**7-29**].
At the time of discharge, her Hct was stable at 28.6.
Her retic index >2 (2.17) suggested adequate marrow response.
Iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease.
Routine screening colonoscopy would be recommended.
Shoulder films showed severe glenohumeral joint destruction and fragmentation bilaterally (also present in past, consistent with AVN/Charcot joint).
