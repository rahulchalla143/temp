Because of these findings, it was determined that standard barium esophagram to evaluate for fistula would not be possible.
He underwent a series of therapeutic and diagnostic bronchoscopies ([**Date range (1) 22229**]).
TTE on [**5-6**] showing EF 55% and normal RV function.
CXR showed worsening right sided infiltrates.
Bronchoscopy performed for lavage and cultures, which returned Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas.
CXR did show an impressive R pleural effusion.
Interventional pulmonary performed a diagnostic thoracentesis, removing 500ml of exudative fluid.
With failure to wean from ventilator, excessive airway secretions and CXR findings, several bronchoscopies performed to remove secretions, the patient required tracheostomy.
A swallow study performed prior to discharge, which he failed.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
BAL cultures returned with a multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas.
Hematology: The patient was transfused with blood on [**2168-5-6**] for hypotension, hct of 27% and to prevent ischemia around his anastamosis.
Wound: JP drains were removed on POD15 after amylase levels were checked and confirmed no evidence of any anastomotic leaks.
