At OSH, he was noted to have a Na of 124.
He does have a history of hyponatremia; he had a Na of 117 in [**2-27**] but had been in the mid 130s since then.
Given that he has had AMS in the setting of infection and is known to have chronic UTIs [**12-24**] indwelling suprapubic catheter and neurogenic bladder, blood and urine cultures were obtained as well as a CXR.
He had a urine culture from [**11-28**] that grew pseudomonas and his CXR showed a possible infiltrate and he was treated with vancomycin and cefepime.
A head CT was negative.

He had a negative head CT but was found to have a Na level of 126.
At that time, his urine osm was 423 and serum osm was 263.
He also had a CXR and there was prelim concern for pneumonia which can cause an ADH like effect (the final read was neagtive).
Neurology was consulted for his AMS and seizure and they felt that his hyponatremia was likely related to recent initiation of carbamezapine for sensory illusions.
Following discontinuation of carbamezapine along with fluid restriction, his Na increased.
By time of discharge, his serum Na was 140. .
He has also had several pneumonias in the past, most likely [**12-24**] frequent aspirations and his first CXR was concerning for lung infiltrate.
Ultimately, repeat CXR and a CTA were both negative for pneumonia.
A urine culture drawn prior to abx inititian also grew pseudomonas.
His catheter was changed and all other cultures remained negative.
This labile blood pressure was most likely secondary to the patient's autonomic dysfunction secondary to his SPMS.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
He was monitored in the ICU for 24 hours with stable swings in BP which were asymptomatic and consistent with autonomic dysfunction.
Changed clonidine dosing from 0.2mg [**Hospital1 **] to 0.1mg TID.
More blood and urine cultures were sent and all were negative.
He had a CTA which was negative for PE.
During the work up for a source of infection and source of AMS, he had a CTA which revealed a liver lesion.
He had an ultrasound and a multiphase liver CT to further describe the lesion because he cannot have an MRI [**12-24**] an implanted baclofen pump.
During this work up he also had KUB that was concerning for ileus but he continued to have BMs so he was kept on a regular diet.

You had a CT scan and the results are pending final interpretation.
It may be necessary to reimage the liver or take a biopsy of the lesion seen on CT scan.
