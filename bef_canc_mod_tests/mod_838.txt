Of note, during his last hospitalization he was found to be bacteremic, with various blood cultures growing out E.coli, Klebsiella (sensitive only to the penems), and Enterococcus (Vanc sensitive).
A tap of his peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**].
He received 1 paracentesis for fluid culture and at the time had 6 L of peritoneal fluid removed which reaccumulated rapidly.
He had persistent pleural effusions during his admission, noted on CT on [**8-9**], moderate on the right and small on the left.
Per conversation with primary team from last admission, a pleural tap was considered but deferred due to its stable nature.
In the ED, he had a temperature of 100 degrees per rectum.
His heart rate was 92, BP 124/54, RR 14, and his O2 Sat was 100% on room air.
A chest x-ray and EKG were ordered and he had a RUQ ultra-sound.
Full labs and blood cultures were drawn.
His hypoxia improved without any intervention.
ABG showed 7.32/32/102 with lactate of 2.1.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma- s/p Whipple [**9-28**] and chemo/XRT 2.
Sigmoid diverticulosis ([**2146**]) 10.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm ([**2146**]) 11.
Pancreatitis 12.
E. coli bacteremia [**7-/2149**] 15: RUE DVT [**7-/2149**] 16.
RUQ U/S on [**8-12**] showed multiple liver nodules concerning for  abcesses vs. metastases.
He also received a paracentesis and peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] and fluid analysis showed elevated WBCs c/w SBP.
Caspofungin started [**8-19**] for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] coverage.
Planning for antibiotics will need to be continued for 6 weeks with serial imaging to monitor for resolution of absecesses.
Of Argentinian decent, travelled to [**Country 32814**] earlier this year, where his liver abcess was diagnosed.
Hct remained stable after bleed post transfusions.
Would have needed long term antibiotics with serial imaging to assess responsiveness.
The utility of repeating head imaging to reevaluate his possible septic emboli was believed to be low without further intervention options.
A family meeting was held which included the patient, and it was decided to make Mr. [**Known lastname 52006**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] measures only.
