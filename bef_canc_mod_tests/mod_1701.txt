Imaging: CXR ([**2147-1-5**]):  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
An emergent CT head was obtained that demonstrated a significant right sided MCA stroke.
In the initial period of her ATN, Electrophysiology was asked to interrogate her pacemaker and increase her rate from 60.
It was felt that increasing her HR may improve cardiac output and increase perfusion to her kidneys.
A bedside echo was obtained that demonstrated respiratory variation in her aortic flow, suggestive of a hypovolemic state.
A renal consultation was also obtained, and again felt to be in pre-renal ATN.
Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline Cr of 0.8-1, but more recently elevated to 1.8) 9.
