HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 to 3), type 2 diabetes, bilateral staghorn calculi, and presumed diastolic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation now being transferred from Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine Service following treatment for acute-on-chronic renal failure with anion gap metabolic acidosis.
On Emergency Department evaluation on [**1-3**], the patient was found with a blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 156 and 5.1 and had a fractional excretion of sodium that looked to be prerenal in etiology.
The patient received Levaquin, Lasix, and normal saline in the Emergency Room and had a bicarbonate which was decreased from 16 to 6 with a pH on arterial blood gas of 7.16.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a Renal consultation and was started on aggressive fluids and bicarbonate drip.
She continued to receive aggressive hydration, and her creatinine improved to 4.6, while a repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.28, and her chemistries showed a bicarbonate which had increased to 20.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 to 3).
Congestive heart failure; presumed diastolic (with an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% in [**2184-3-20**]).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   At the time of admission her vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 132/80, her heart rate was 60, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination significant for upper palate with dentures.
Cardiovascular examination revealed first heart sound and second heart sound with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Pulmonary examination revealed bibasilar crackles (right greater than left) about one quarter to two thirds of the way from base.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood cell count was 8.2, her hematocrit was 28.7 (down from 32.5), and her platelets were 221.
Chemistries revealed her sodium was 139, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 149, and her creatinine was 4.6 (down from 4.8 and 5.1).
Her calcium was 6.3, magnesium was 2.7, and her phosphate was 12.2 (down from 13.8).
Her INR was 2.6.
Her albumin was 3.1, aspartate aminotransferase was 23, alanine-aminotransferase was 44, her lactate dehydrogenase was 167, her alkaline phosphatase was 213, and her total bilirubin was 0.2.
Most recent arterial blood gas was 7.28/41/87.
She had a lactate of 0.8.
Her thyroid-stimulating hormone was 1.6.
She had an echocardiogram on [**1-5**] which showed an ejection fraction of 60%, tricuspid gradient of 42 to 47, with moderate pulmonary hypertension, dilated left and right atrium, mid symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, mildly dilated aortic root, 1+ to 2+ mitral regurgitation, and moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
By the time of her transfer to the Medicine Service, her creatinine had shown slow signs of improvement and her acidosis seemed to be much improved from admission, as her bicarbonate had increased from 6 to 20.
Further review of her initial renal ultrasound, however, did not indicate significant left-sided hydronephrosis.
Given that the patient was ineligible for magnetic resonance imaging given a pacemaker, it was decided that she may qualify for a follow-up ultrasound as an outpatient for further evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis and re-evaluation of hydronephrosis.
Her urine output increased markedly, and she was given fluids to help keep up with her losses.
Her creatinine also showed marked improvement, decreasing to 2.9 by the day of discharge.
For this reason, her hydrochlorothiazide was held throughout her hospital course, and her blood pressure was controlled with beta blockers, nitrates, and hydralazine.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Pump function:  The patient was found to have a normal ejection fraction on an echocardiogram during this admission.
She was scheduled to be evaluated as an outpatient one to two days status post discharge for additional blood pressure measurements and electrolyte checks to determine whether it would be safe to resume her hydrochlorothiazide at this point.
The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two days for a blood pressure check and check of her INR and electrolytes to determine whether it was okay for her to resume diuretic.
