The EKG in the ED showed ST depressions in V4-V5 and TnT 0.03, although the patient denied chest pain and showed no further symptoms, increased troponin level, or EKG changes.
A CXR showed a new infiltrate, however, the patient had no fever or cough.
Legionella testing came back negative.
CTA was not able to be pursued due to ARF.
At the time of discharge, O2 sat was 91% on RA and the patient was able to ambulate without difficulty.
Workup for multiple myeloma is thus far negative.
