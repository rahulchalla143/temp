He noticed that he had a temperature of 99 this morning with a MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE of 102.1 prior to the hospital visit.
Labs were notable for WBC 15, Creat 1.3 (elevated from 1.0).
Triggered for episode of hypotension to SBP 70s.
Received 3L IVF and BP improved to SBP 90, but dropped again.
SBP then 110s.
For infectious w/u, CXR was unremarkable.
RUQ U/S showed normal gallbladder, no ascites.
His pressures remained in the 90s-110s.
Pt had a CT abdomen suggestive of transverse colitis, perhaps infectious in etiology.
Blood, urine, and stool samples were sent for analysis, and Pt was transferred to the liver-transplant floor.

Pt's BP has been stable on the floor.
CXR wnl.
CT abdomen and pelvis showing possible R-sided colitis.
This was narrowed to ciprofloxacin / metronidazole on [**11-4**] to cover for colitis after CT result showing possible R-sided colitis.
Urine cultures and blood cultures negative.
CMV blood viral load was not detectable.
Stool cultures were negative for viruses and common infectious etiologies including C diff.
Colonoscopy w/ biopsy to look for CMV colitis on [**11-7**] showed only colonic congestion but no other obvious lesions.
Pt's Cr improved from 1.4 to 1.0 with fluids (baseline 0.7-0.8).
Pt's peg-IFN, which he receives every Friday, was held to avoid confounding his fever curve.
Pt was transfused 1 x PRBCs on [**11-4**] for Hct 21 from baseline ~30, likely dilutional plus ribavirin effect, with appropriate bump to 24.
Pt may need erythropoietin injections to maintain his hematocrit while he remains on anti-HCV therapy.
If Pt develops fevers, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea, would consider further abdominal imaging / repeat colonoscopy given continuing suspicion for CMV.
You were initially treated with antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection, but none of your stool cultures revealed any pathogenic bacteria, so this treatment was stopped.
Because of your prior CMV negative status and your receipt of a CMV positive liver, you were placed on antiviral medications to prevent CMV infection, which you stopped approximately one month ago.
You were started on antiviral therapy and had a colonoscopy with biopsy, which showed that you did not have any evidence of active CMV colitis.
You may need to start additional medications to increase your red blood cells and should discuss this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
