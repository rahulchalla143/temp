The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes x 3.
Initially the patient's digoxin was discontinued although his blood levels were not supra therapeutic on admission.
A previous echocardiogram showed a LVEF of 20-30%.
On admission, CXR and physical exam were consistent with significant volume overload, but diuresis was limited by persistent hypotension.
After the patient's SBP stabilized on [**3-6**], gentle lasix diuresis was initiated to effect a net diuresis of 700cc.
Repeat echocardiogram performed on [**3-6**] revealed an EF of 20-30% with moderate LA and RA enlargement, severe global LV hypokinesis, mild AS, Mod MR/TR and moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Given an inability to control the patient's rhythm medically, the patient [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] AVN ablation (see below) with improvement in blood pressure and rate control.
Brief right heart cath performed during the AV nodal ablation was consistent with left heart failure with a PCWP of 36.
With improved rate control and pressure the patient was more effectively able to be diuresed with net diuresis of approximately 5-6 liters since admission with IV antibiotics, usually requiring lasix 40mg - 120mg IV qd to achieve goals of 500-1000cc/day.
Of note, the patient previously had a biventricular ICD placed for depressed EF and ventricular dys synchrony.
The patient is currently V/V/I paced with heart rate around 80.
The patient is currently with a therapeutic INR of 2.3 with discharge medical regimen of Coumadin 2mg po qhs.
Antibody testing was negative including anti-peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin, making Grave's disease less likely.
# ARF - Patient is reported to have baseline creatinine of 1.2 - 1.4 on previous admission.
This admission the patient suffered acute on CRF with admission creatinine of 2.7 thought likely to be secondary to hypoperfusion given patient's hypotension on admission.
With improved cardiac function the patient's creatinine began to decrease, even in the setting of fairly aggressive diuresis.
On discharge the patient has a creatinine of 2.1 which will need continued monitoring as the patient continues therapy with lasix.
Renal ultrasound of the remaining right kidney revealed no obstruction.
CHF - ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-30% [**2149-3-6**]) #.
CKD - baseline appears to be 1.2-1.4   Discharge Condition: Good.
Patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable with SBP > 100 with O2 sat > 90% at rest.
You will need to have your INR checked at this time as your coumadin dose has been adjusted during your hospital course.
As you have been instructed, this medication is very effective but requires careful monitoring as it very rarely can have serious side effects such as decreasing your WBC count dramatically.
