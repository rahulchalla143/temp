[**2179-3-27**] CT HEAD: 1.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or definite CT evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Limited view of right globe with suggestion of internal high density material, to be correlated clinically.
If of concern, dedicated orbital imaging could be obtained.
Given a dirty UA and h/o recurrent UTIs he was initially treated broadly (vanc/cefepime), but was narrowed back to cipro when urine culture was negative.
CT head was negative for acute process.
His sodium remained within normal limits on the floor, and as above his mental status improved.
Unclear etiology: volume overload appeared improved on CXR w/o obvious infiltrates.
He had recently started a course of cipro 500 [**Hospital1 **] for planned 14 days for pan sensitive pseudomonas.
Urine culture ultimately was negative so he was put back on his home cipro to finish initial course of 14 days (will complete on [**4-3**]).
Renal ultrasound was done which showed multiple bilateral up to 11-cm cysts, collapsed thick-walled urinary bladder with internal debris, but no hydronephrosis.
Creatinine returned to baseline of 1.7 prior to discharge.
Etiology was unclear, but blood pressures trended up w/o further intervention.
INR was also elevated so fibrinogen was sent and returned wnl.
Heparin was stopped and HIT antibody was sent; this returned as equivocal.
Serotonin assay sent prior to discharge, and will need to be followed-up.
Platelet count stable at time of discharge.
# Diastolic CHF: Has h/o severe RVD [**3-11**] cor pulmonale w/ intact EF of 50-55% on recent echo on [**3-18**].
Appeared extremely dry on clinical exam so home torsemide held.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient was FULL CODE this admission, though per his wife they will likely continue discussion in outpatient setting about possible transition to hospice care -Patient should have repeat chem7 checked [**2179-4-3**] to ensure renal function remains stable at baseline and to assess electrolytes in setting of restarting torsemide -Patient will need ongoing monitoring of weight and daily fluid balance, and may need increase in torsemide dose to 40 mg daily if weight increasing.
-Blood cultures [**2179-3-27**] still pending at time of discharge -Given some suspicion for HIT, serotonin assay was sent prior to discharge.
We checked your urine, and we found no evidence of further infection.
We made the following changes to your medications: -DECREASED torsemide to 20 mg daily  In addition: -- Please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
