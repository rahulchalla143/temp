Congestive heart failure, last echocardiogram [**2176-6-18**] with limited views showing grossly preserved left ventricular function and right ventricular function.

He remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay and his white blood cell count decreased daily.
White blood cell count returned to [**Location 213**] range, and cultures were negative except for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.
To manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily weights.
Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.
Three sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of myocardial infarction.
Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding scale.
The plan was that he would follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic the following week and that he would have an INR drawn on [**8-6**] calling the results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
