<br> Echo [**2133-4-2**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-29**], left ventricular cavity size is larger.
On the left lateral decubitus view, multiple air-fluid levels are present, but there is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
The possibility of intermittent cecal volvulus should be considered, and a CT of the abdomen has already been obtained for a more complete evaluation at the time of this dictation.

A KUB was done that demonstrated markedly distended cecum, without evidence of distal colonic decompression and raised the possibility of intermittent cecal volvulus.
On physical exam at this time, her abdomen was soft but moderately distended and diffusely moderately tender, right abdomen greater than left but there was no rebound.
Given the equivocal etiology of her abdominal symptoms, a non-contrast CT scan was recommended for further evaluation (no IV contrast given that her Cr was 3.0).
The scan demonstrated no evidence to suggest cecal volvulus but there were fluid-filled loops of small bowel suggestive of enteritis along with mild nonspecific thickening of the wall of the left colon which could be secondary to infectious causes or ischemic colitis.
At this juncture, it was felt that this was possibly a pseudoobstructive picture of the colon and GI was consulted for colonoscopy for further evaluation of the colonic mucosa along with potential endoscopic decompression.
However, she had some intermittent episodes of hypotension to SBP 90's along with tachycardia and was transferred to the MICU (no available SICU beds) with surgery following closely.
Her exam post-procedure demonstrated a softer, less distended abdomen and mildly less tender.
A C. diff PCR was sent (eventually, this returned as negative).
Her stool started to appear more blood-tinged and her coagulation panel returned with markedly elevated INR 4.5 and PTT 150, which was not compatible with a picture of possible supratherapeutic pradaxa levels.
A concern for a comsumptive coagulopathy was raised and a DIC panel was sent (which eventually returned normal).
The patient became increasingly unstable and was transferred to the operating room emergently where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, resection of ischemic transverse and left colon and spleen.
ACLS protocol was initiated and eventually a perfusing cardiac rhythm was recovered.
The patient was briefly stabilized for transfer to the SICU but shortly after arrival, she went into VTach with loss of BP, ACLS protocol was initiated again and a blood pressure was recovered.
