Tortuous RPDA, RPL1 and AM vessels were noted as well as a modest caliber RPL2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated biventricular filling pressures with a mean PCWP 35mm Hg and mean RVEDP 17mmHg at rest.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with systolic, diastolic, and mean PA pressures of 70/28/44mm Hg.
Prominent V waves consistent with significant mitral regurgitation was also noted.
Low cardiac output cardiac index was reduced at 1.50 L/min/m2.
Entry PVR of 328 dyne-sec/cm5 and SVR of 3138 dyne-sec/cm5 was noted.
LV systolic function appeaqrs to be moderately globally depress (LVEF-35-40%) Post Bypass: The patient is on epinephrine 0.05 uck/kg/min LV function now appears normal in the setting of inotropes (LVEF~ 55%) There are ring prosthese in the mitral and tricuspid position.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the head without intravenous contrast.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: CT head [**2153-3-21**].
TECHNIQUE: MRI and MRA of the head was obtained without contrast and MRA of the neck was obtained before and after administration of contrast per department protocol.
There is no signal abnormality on the gradient echo images to suggest hemorrhage.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2153-3-24**] Echo Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
No mass/thrombus seen in the left or right atrium, but this study is not adequate to fully exclude atrial/atrial appendage thrombus ((ie atrial appendages not well visualized).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-1-31**], the left ventricular function is markedly depressed.
If suspicion for atrial thrombus is high, consideration can be given to other imaging studies (eg cardiac MRI, CT), as the patient is unable to undergo TEE.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac cath on [**3-16**] and was admitted following cath.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Head CT revealed left ACA infarct.
Infarct was followed on CT to evaluate for hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of anti-coagulation for atrial fibrillation.
Current clinical picture is consistent with Left ACA infarct likely due to embolic etiology and exam shows profound abulia with a right hemiparesis.
