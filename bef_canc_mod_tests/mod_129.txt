He was recently d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission [**Date range (1) 12479**] for generalized weakness attributed to CHF exacerbation.
Today, on routine lab check his Hct was 22 from baseline of low 30s, and Cr 3.7 from baseline 2.1.
Pt was alert and oriented to self and place, however VS were notable for a HR of 130s and sat of 84% on RA.
His SBP was in the 70s and his sats were 80's on room air.
Exam revealed guaiac positive stool with melena.
Hct was 21 with INR 4.0 He then vomitted and was intubated for airway protection.
He had a torso CT that was unremarkable.
Head CT initially raised some concern for SAH but upon reviewing, neurosurg considered the findings old infarct without hemorrhage.
ECG showed slow afib with no ischemic changes.
Cr 3.9 from baseline 2.1.
He received one dose of vanc and zosyn, 2L of fluid with improvement in BP and therefore got a femoral line placed with initiation of norepinephrine.
After blood and FFP transfusions, Hct improved to 30 and INR decreased to 2.2.
GI saw the patient in the ED, recommended EGD in a.m. with serial Hcts and suppportive care.

CT Head [**5-4**]: 1.
CT Torso [**5-4**]: 1.
Right hip XR [**5-13**]: Two frontal radiographs of the right hip are obtained in relatively similar positioning.
CT Head [**5-14**]: FINDINGS: Exam is somewhat limited due to motion artifact.
Right lower extremity U/S [**5-19**]: Normal right lower extremity ultrasound examination.
Video Swallow [**5-20**]: A swallowing videofluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with the Speech Pathology service.
CXR [**5-19**]: Left PICC has been partially withdrawn, now positioned with tip in the left subclavian vein just posterior to the head of the left clavicle.
CXR [**5-23**]: Dictated report.
His HCT stabilized on [**5-6**] and remained stable for the remainder of his hospitalization.
Patient's neurological exam was remarkable for impaired sensorium, inattention, inability to follow simple commands, dysarthria, impaired strength in LUE, LLE w/ slight L NLF flattening and upgoign L toe (all of the motor findings were felt to be old).
His serial Neurological exams were w/o focal features upon transfer to the floor.
An MRI was suggested for ?
Stage III (baseline [**1-14**]), Cr peaked at 4.1 during admission and was 2.5 at time of discharge.
[**2110-4-2**] ECHO w/ global LV and RV hypokinesis, EF 25%.
Patient's fluid balance was tenuous and he required lasix dose titration as well as holding lasix for several days in the setting of orthostasis.
DDx also includes intramuscular bleed, but no echymoses on exam and HCT is stable.
