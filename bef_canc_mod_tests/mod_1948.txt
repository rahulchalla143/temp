When she was at dialysis in the morning, she noticed some chest pressure/tightness, which was substernal, without radiation or frank pain.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a mean gradient of 3 mmHg at a cardiac output of 4.3 L/min.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2198-12-14**] 8:30 PM   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 177**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5204**] FA6A [**2198-12-14**] 8:30 PM MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 101280**] Reason: infarct/rule out bleed    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    64 year old woman with hx bihemispheric small infarcts likely due to MV    vegetation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of [**2198-11-13**].
In comparison to the prior study it demonstrates evolution of some of the previously seen infarcts which are now seen as T2 shine through.
MRA NECK:  The neck MRA obtained with 2D time-of-flight study demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
COMPARISON: CT and ultrasound dated [**2198-10-7**].
If there is a persistent clinical suspicion, a HIDA scan should be performed for further evaluation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7722**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7723**] Approved: MON [**2198-12-10**] 9:36 PM    Imaging Lab  ECHO [**2198-12-17**] No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
IMPRESSION: Well-seated, normally functioning bileaflet mechanical mitral valve prosthesis.
She was found to have a ventricular escape rhythm with a rate of 40bpm.
EP felt that her rhythm would recover and a pacer would not be necessary.
There was no growth on valve tissue sent from OR.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
INR became supra-therapeutic quickly in the setting of poor appetite and nutritional depletion.
MRA of the brain revealed multiple embolic infarcts- acute/ and sub acute.
On [**2198-12-16**] a TEE was done and cardiac thrombus was ruled out emboli.
The patient's mental status cleared, and her blood pressure was allowed to remain above 120mmHg systolic, as she remained oriented under this condition.
