Admission Date:  [**2131-6-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-6-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-9-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed by chest CT and diabetes mellitus who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a left scapular and left arm pain since 1 a.m. on the day of admission.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 958**] denied chest pain, chest tightness, no cough, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting upon presentation.
Catheterization laboratory showed a normal left main with a twin left anterior descending system with 50-60% ostial proximal stenosis, 100% mid stenosis after D1, D1 diffuse 80% proximal with distally graftable lumen, left circumflex 40-50% mid lesion before the large OM1 and mild luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery with a 100% distal mid after posterolateral branch with TIMI II flow.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her Emergency Room vitals: Temperature 97.9.
Pulse is 97.
Respiratory rate 18.
Blood pressure 196/110, saturating 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  She had bilateral submandibular gland enlargement.
Pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam:  Nontender, positive active bowel sounds, obese, but not distended abdomen.
Her pre catheterization pain free electrocardiogram showed a regular rate and rhythm, ST elevation in V1 to V6 without reciprocal changes in I and aVL.
Her post catheterization electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block, anterior myocardial infarction based on Q waves development, acute and recent.
A heparin drip was initiated to prophylax for potential left ventricular thrombus in the setting of an anterolateral left ventricular wall infarct, however, the patient was taken off heparin when it was determined that her risks were low given the results of her echocardiogram, status post catheterization, which showed reasonably good ejection fraction and no apical akinesis or dyskinesis, just hypokinesis, which could not significantly increase the risk for left ventricular thrombus formation.
Pump:  Echocardiogram was checked while the patient was hospitalized after her catheterization.
Overall, left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed with septal, distal, anterior and apical hypokinesis.
Electrocardiogram showed no rhythm abnormalities and no evidence of arrhythmia throughout her hospitalization.
Her BUN and creatinine remained stable despite a heavy dye load in the catheterization.
