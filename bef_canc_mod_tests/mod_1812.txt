Her visiting nurse, who sees her twice a week to check her weight, temperature, and blood pressure, noticed today that her temperature was 100.5 and that she seemed "not herself".
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 101 HR 99 BP 113/40 RR 18 O2 sat 98 on room air.
Her physical exam was notable for a mild abdominal fluid wave, and she was noted to be "slow speaking".
An LP was not obatined to rule out meningitis given her high INR (4.0).
A head CT and chest X-ray were read as normal, and an abdominal US showed no baseline change from recent imaging.

Mini mental status exam was 28/30, with only deficits poor attention (was able to say months of the year backwards with great difficulty and several mistakes).

-UCx ([**2137-10-10**]): <10,000 organisms/ml -BCx ([**2137-10-10**]): Pending x 2   Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE SERVICE COURSE:  56 year-old woman with a history of HCV and autoimmune hepatatis with a baseline MELD score of 32, on liver and kidney [**Month/Day/Year **] list and previous admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, who was admitted on [**9-27**] for fever and altered mental status.
Her VNA found her to be confused on the day of admission, with a T of 100.5. .
Her MELD scores were generally above 40 though had improved to 35 on the day of transfer, in the setting of an acute improvement in her creatinine.
Her bilirubin had climbed to 24.0 on day of transfer.
Her INR was consistently elevated, and she required occasional doses of FFP to reverse her INR when she developed low-grade bleeding from the corner of her mouth and lips.
OB/Gyn saw the patient for a potential endometrial biopsy as part of the pre-[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] evaluation, though the risks of the procedure were thought to outweigh the pre-test probability of finding any malignancy, especially given the patient's chronic femara (believed to be protective against endometrial malignancy).
Diagnostic paracentesis was not performed given high INR and risk of bleeding.
She had an ABG performed, and subsequently developed a hematoma.
They did not believe she had compartment syndrome, and her U/S was negative for DVT or pseudoaneurysm.
# UTI: The patient's urine culture on [**10-5**] grew coag negative staph and enterococcus.
Subsequent urine cultures were negative.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level was 2.6 on admission.
Her creatinine improved to 1.5 on day of transfer to the MICU, but her midodrine regimen was occasionally interrupted secondary to hypertension.
Her albumin infusions were stopped when the patient became hypertensive and volume overloaded.
Her urine output was low, but unreliably measured, and frequently mixed in with loose stools.
# Hypernatremia: Her sodium levels trended up to 150 on day of transfer to the MICU, which may have contributed to her mental status.
She has a history of lymphedema in her left arm, and blood draws were avoided in the left arm.
At the time of transfer to the MICU, there was a plan in place for the patient to receive vitamin K via the IV, and have her coagulation studies checked overnight, with FFP/cryoprecipitate given as needed to reduce her INR to <2.0.
She was transferred to the MICU and NGT is placed which aspirates blood.
She became hypotense to SBP 67.
CVP was noted to be elevated to 30s and heart was enlarged on CXR so stat echo was ordered and showed no effusion but PASP 40-48 with a normal LVEF.
She was aggressively transfused with FFP/cryp/PRBC/plt with goals Hct > 25, fib > 100, plt > 50, INR < 2.
A Cordis and A-line were placed.
Her CT Abdomen showed moderate to large amount of ascites.
Her bladder pressures were monitored with plan to para for > 30.
Her abd was more distended, with bladder pressure overnight 21.
Her lactate was trending upwards into 8s; unclear etiology at this point, but probably bowel related vs. secondary to liver disease and inability to clear lactate.
Her blood pressure slowly declined and she passed away in no apparent distress at 6 AM on [**10-22**].
