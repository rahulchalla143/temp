Found to have a drop in Hct to 25, WBC of 20.9, was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
A RUQ U/S obtained on [**8-12**] showed multiple liver nodules concerning for abscesses vs malignant nodules, with MRI not more helpful in delineating the two.
In regards to his hct drop on admission, he was transfused 3u pRBC and GI was consulted who felt it was related to chronic anemia as well as in the setting of sepsis and marrow suppression with recommendations only to tx to hct >28, and obtain OSH records regarding previous colonoscopies.
He was given IVF x1L NS and had an NG lavage performed that was negative.
His VS were: T96.7, HR 90, BP 122/58, RR20, 98%RA.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma- s/p Whipple [**9-28**] and chemo/XRT 2.
Liver abscess ([**3-3**]) in [**Country 32814**]; treated with ?
Recurred in [**5-31**]- Abscess composed of E. coli, Morganella morganii, and enterococcus-Rx w/ IR drainage, and 5 weeks of cefipime, vancomycin, Fungizone - treatment halted due to ARF 3.
Sigmoid diverticulosis ([**2146**]) 10.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm 3cm ([**2146**]) 11.
Pancreatitis 12.
Of Argentinian decent, travelled to [**Country 32814**] earlier this year, where his liver abcess was diagnosed.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T97.2 HR92 BP139/73 RR20 o2: 98%RA GEN: Elderly male in NAD, comfortably talking at rest HEENT: Anicteric sclera.
Pertinent Results: MICRO: - Urine Cx from OSH grew klebsiella pneumoniae, sensitive to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
- Bcx [**8-9**]: [**4-29**] bottle from [**8-9**] grew E. coli (different strains isolated).
- Bcx [**8-10**] E. coli - Ucx [**8-9**] and [**8-11**]: negative - Bcx [**8-11**]: E. coli - Bcx [**8-12**]: 2/4 bottles E.coli, Klebsiella - Bcx [**8-13**] negative - Bcx [**8-15**]: E. coli, Klebsiella - Bcx [**8-17**]: E.coli, enterococcus - Abscess [**8-15**]: E. coli, strep viridans, [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 17939**], GPR - Abscess [**8-19**]: E. coli, enterococcus, bacteroides - peritoneal fluid ([**8-27**]): [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**]  IMAGING: -([**8-9**])Port AP CXR: Opacity at the right base which likely represents a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid, view.
There are 2 poorly defined areas of opacity in the left midlung region without change from prior a portable chest radiograph of [**8-9**], [**2149**].
- ([**8-12**]) Abdominal U/S: 1.
- ([**8-13**]) Abdominal MRI: 1.
Thus this study is nondiagnostic for histologic differentiation between these two entities and tissue diagnosis is recommended.
There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function (LVEF 60-70%).
The post-gadolinium images are limited by motion.
Repeat study would help for further assessment if clinically indicated.
No  spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
RUQ U/S on [**8-12**] showed multiple liver nodules concerning for abcesses vs. metastases.
He also received a paracentesis and peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] and fluid analysis showed elevated WBCs c/w SBP.
Caspofungin started [**8-19**] for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] coverage.
Secondary to this ,antibiotics will need to be continued for 6 weeks with serial imaging to monitor for resolution of absecesses.
Pt maintained hematocrit until [**8-14**] at 7pm when he had a large volume bloody BM on the floor.
NG lavage performed at that time was negative, and he refused colonoscopy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 52006**] had low urine output during his ICU stay, and was bolused with IVFs to keep urine output>30cc/hr.
As a result, he had been positive ~10L and developed anasarca, likely secondary to poor nutritional status with an initial albumin of 2.2 which decreased to 1.2 by the time he was transferred back to the floor.
He received 1 paracentesis for fluid culture and at the time had 6 L of peritoneal fluid removed which reaccumulated rapidly.
Head MRI showed possible septic emboli on [**8-23**], however, a TEE on [**8-28**] was negative for vegetations.
A lumbar puncture was considered but refused by the patient.
At discharge patient's mental status had improved, he was tolerating tube feeds well, urine output was stable, he had been afebrile for 2 weeks, hematocrit had been stable, and he denied colonoscopy as an inpatient.
He received a PICC placement by IR, was given 2 units of blood to increase his hematocrit prophylactically, and he was discharged to an acute rehab facility for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks with close monitoring by infectious disease.
