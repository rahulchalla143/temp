Per report, the patient was in his usual state of health and had routine labs drawn on [**2185-3-1**].
A CT head performed, though limited by patient motion, demonstrates no clear intracranial process.

COMPARISON: Recent CT head.
The CSF signal in the basal cisterns on the FLAIR sequence is not well visualized, likely related to pulsation artifacts, however, seen well on the axial T2-weighted images.
However, dedicated MR angiogram is not performed.
This can be better assessed with MR angiogram of the head.
2D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK: Study is limited due to technical reasons.
COMPARISON: Prior head CT and MRI of the brain dated [**2185-3-1**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial and sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained, axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic susceptibility, and axial diffusion-weighted sequences, 2D time-of-flight arteriography of the neck vessels was also obtained, and multiple rotational images and axial source images were provided.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior examination, no significant changes are identified, again the ventricles and sulci are prominent for the patient's age, on FLAIR and T2, multiple scattered areas of high signal intensity are demonstrated in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific and may reflect chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
A focal area of low signal intensity is noted in the ventral aspect of the left basal ganglia, below the head of the caudate nucleus (image 14, series #12), with heterogeneous signal on the corresponding FLAIR sequence, possibly consistent with residual blood products from an old ischemic or hemorrhagic event, this area is identified on the prior head CT dated [**2185-3-1**] (image 13, series #2).
Bilateral patchy hyperintensities are demonstrated in both mastoid air cells, unchanged.
These findings were communicated via telephone to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 66255**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90652**] at 11:30 hours on [**2185-3-3**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Examination by Neurology was notable for "Confusion (A&Ox1, to self), left facial droop, and a rightward eye deviation (no nystagmus) and left-sided visual neglect with otherwise intact CN testing.
Also, left arm and leg weakness but normal tone (hard to assess strength with lack of cooperation with exam [**1-26**] confusion/L-neglect), hypertonicity of the Right-UE (flexed and tremulous) and hypertonicity of the Right-LE (extended and still).
His work-up include blood culture, urine culture, lumbar pucture, CMV viral load, cryptococcal antigen which are either negative or no growth to date.
An MRI/MRA of patient's head on [**3-1**] had the following impressions: 1.
Cavum velum interpositum, 3.1cm, with indentation on and thinning of the pineal gland- attention on follow up.
A repeated MRI/MRA of patient's head on [**2185-3-2**] showed similar findings.
An EEG was also performed and was interpretted by Neurology as "negative for seizure, positive for encephalopathy", which likely indicated PRES as an etiology.
There was concern for a potential seizure but no evidence of seizure activity on EEG and he was started on Keppra.
His cultures have been negative to date.
# Chronic anemia: His labs suggest anemia of chronic disease.
