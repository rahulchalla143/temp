There, vitals were recorded as T 101.7, BP 214/117, HR 121, RR 19.
A non-contrast CT of the head was done, and showed hemorrhage in the left frontaoparietal regions.
He was given fospheytoin 1.5 grams and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.

CT C-spine: No fracture.
Small posterior osteophytes are noted at C4-5 and cause mild canal narrowing  CTA ([**3-5**]): Left frontal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema; CT angiography demonstrates no evidence of abnormal vascular structures, early draining veins to indicate arteriovenous malformation or enhancing lesion in the region of hemorrhage; A tiny 1.5-mm infundibulum versus aneurysm at the right posterior communicating artery is likely incidental, unrelated to the hemorrhage.
TTE ([**3-6**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
EEG ([**3-9**]): continuous EEG on [**3-9**] showed a low voltage slow encephalopathic background throughout.
Stable shallow subdural collection overlying the right cerebral convexity  CXR ([**2173-3-20**]):   The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.
His goal BP was <160.
EEG was performed and did not show any epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
MRI performed to further evaluate etiology of bleed; MRI showed presence of hemorrhage without acute infarct, shift or hydrocephalus.
His neurologic exam at disharge is: He opens eyes to voice.
Cardiovascular:  Given the IPH, goal SBP was less than 160.
He also received Hydral prn for SBP >160.
Troponins were cycled and trended down.
His CT showed 3cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm; no acute intervention was determined to be necessary.
Urine cx during this time grew out Proteus, which was sensitive to both Cefempime and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was covered on his antibiotic regimen.
Repeat urine cx negative.
Blood cx have remained sterile.
WBC count has since trended down and he is currently afebrile.
