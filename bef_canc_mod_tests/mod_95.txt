LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, his laboratory studies show a white blood cell count of 7.4.
Hematocrit is 43.2 and platelets are 81.
PT is 13.1; PTT is 22.2 and INR is 1.1.
Sodium is 139; potassium of 4.5.
BUN is 14 and his creatinine is 0.8.
CK of 101.
Troponin of .40.
CK MB of 6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient's vital signs were 173/83; pulse of 85; SPOT is 99 percent.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed no blood in his nares.
ASSESSMENT:  77 year old male with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and blood throughout, including intra ventricular blood in fourth ventricle; cluster of blood around the left carotid artery.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12184**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3903**], nurse practitioner, examined the patient and spoke at length with family of subarachnoid hemorrhage and possibility of an aneurysm.
Nipride to titrate blood pressure less than 130.
Cervical spine films to rule out fractures.
Further work-up when stabilized.
His neurologic examination continued to decline.
CTA showed a complicated fusiform aneurysm and left internal carotid artery.
His examination was unchanged.
Plan at that time was to keep his blood pressure under 130; keep his ventricular drain at 15 and was given Ancef for prophylaxis.
Cardiology notes his troponin is up and he had electrocardiogram changes.
Electrocardiogram was unlikely to be myocardial ischemia, elevated troponin may represent demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness.
He had blood cultures done and cerebrospinal fluid cultures done.
On [**6-7**], his blood culture was preliminarily negative as well as his cerebrospinal fluid culture being negative; however, this was only a preliminary diagnosis.
