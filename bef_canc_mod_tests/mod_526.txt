There were no signs of mesenteric ischemia on CT scan, though diverticulosis was noted.
His crit bumped from 21.1 to 28 after 3 units.
His crits were followed [**Hospital1 **], and remained stable.
He was seen by GI, who did not think further endoscopy would be useful for hemorrhoid/diverticular bleed, and deferred evaluation to General Surgery for possible surgical intervention, e.g.
[**First Name (STitle) **] this Friday for repeat crit check, and will be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in Colorectal Surgery in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**].
This likely represents sequelae of anemia and demand ischemia given Hct of 21.1.
Repeat EKG the next a.m. showed resolution of TWI, just flattened T waves in the lateral V leads.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x3.
WBC ct was 2.8 on admission.
WBC ct stabilized at 4.5 on day of discharge.
