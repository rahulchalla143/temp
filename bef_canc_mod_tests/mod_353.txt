Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-11-19**], no major change is evident.
Proximal limb of colon (H-K): 1.
[**2-9**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
[**2-13**] Chest CT: 1.
[**2-15**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
Otherwise stable examination since [**2193-2-9**].
[**2-16**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
[**2-21**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Continued but slightly improved distal colitis.
[**2-28**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
Peripherally enhancing cystic structures in the seminal vesicles are new since the study of [**11-15**], and raise the possibility of seminal vesiculitis and/or prostatitis with abscesses.
Slight improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions since the study of [**2193-2-21**].
The presumed small infected collection demonstrated on prior CT (and diminishing in size on followup CT) has completely resolved.
His hct was maintained above 25 and plts above 10 with transfusions, though he remained neutropenic, requiring products approximately every 3-4 days.
Surveillance cultures showed no growth and patient remained afebrile throughout the rest of his BMT stay.
Her potassium levels normalized after addition of florinef and remained stable throughout the rest of her admission.
Repeat cultures were negative.
*Oral lesions:  Patient had lesions on his upper lip that appeared to be HSV and his HSV 1 serology was positive.
Cyclosporine levels were monitored and increased accordingly.
POD7 CT scan showed dilated R colon and he was febrile to 102.5.
BP responded to 2U of PRBCs.
Urine Cx from [**2-9**] came back pos for pseudomonas.
occassionally had high BP to 180s controlled by PRN hydralazine.
On [**2-13**] he had a CT of his head for suspected change in MS that was negative.
CT on [**2-15**] showed increased inflammatory changes in R colon, and pt.
[**2-16**] CT also showed similar results.
Serial CT scans showed gradual improvement of distal colitis.
At that time a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a possible seminal vesiculitis vs. prostatitis.
Ultrasound revealed no abnormality, so the aspiration procedure was cancelled.
The patient remained afebrile thereafter except for one elevated [**Location (un) 1131**] which revealed nothing on culture or exam.
However, he was encouraged to increase intake and florinef was added to aid in retention of intravascular volume, and Cr was stable at ~1.1.
CT head was negative.
G-CSF 300 mcg/mL Q24H 2.
