MRI from [**2182-7-5**]: Status post right temporal lobe brain tumor resection, with cystic CSF space at the surgical site.
MRI from [**2182-8-9**]:IMPRESSION: Nodules of enhancement along the posterior margin of the surgical cavity in the right posterior lobe, slowly increasing in size most notably since the exam of [**2182-1-19**].
