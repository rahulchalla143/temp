MICROBIOLOGY [**2192-2-3**] 11:23 pm MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.
RADIOLOGY CXR [**2192-2-3**] FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
ECHO [**2192-2-3**] The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-7-12**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
# AoCRF: Pt presented with Cr 3.9, with a recent baseline of 2.2-2.6.
Her potassium has been stable for 48 hours prior to discharge less than 5.
# CHF exacerbation: Pt presented with 25 lbs above dry weight with significantly elevated BNP, and CXR consistent with severe fluid overload.
ECHO on [**2-3**] showed unchanged EF with diastolic dysfunction.
Her urine output increased dramatically afterwards likely in the setting of recovery from ATN.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout this hospitalization.
Her average heart rate has consistently been >50, with episodes of recorded bradycardia from arhythmia.
Her metoprolol was switched to carvedilol per above (initially held in presence of bradycardia), and she was discharged on a warfarin dose of 6 mg qday as INR remained subtherepeutic at time of discharge.
Systolic BP's returned to 140's mmHg with this regimen.
Her blood glucose was largely well controlled.
# Anemia: Her HCT has been stable.
We continued her iron supplement .
