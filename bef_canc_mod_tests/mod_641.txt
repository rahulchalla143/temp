Admission Date:  [**2179-4-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-5-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-10-19**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male who was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2179-4-15**] for evaluation of a basilar artery aneurysm.
As part of his presurgical evaluation, the patient underwent a head computed tomography which was worrisome for fusiform basilar artery aneurysm which was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography to be 1.3 cm X 2.1 cm in diameter aneurysm.
General examination revealed an elderly male in no apparent distress.
Head and neck examination demonstrated normocephalic and atraumatic.
Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rate with a systolic murmur.
The lung examination demonstrated good air movement with bibasilar crackles.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, and nondistended with a functional colostomy noted in the left lower quadrant.
Extremity examination demonstrated 2 to 3+ edema; right greater than left.
An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained given reports of a positive catheter tip culture at [**Hospital6 2561**] which reportedly demonstrated Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli, as well as a reported recent history of Clostridium difficile colitis.
A cardiac catheterization conducted on [**2179-4-22**] demonstrated elevated left-sided and right-sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac output.
In addition, moderate pulmonary hypertension with large V waves and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing was noted.
40% to 50% serial stenoses in the proximal and medial portions of the left anterior descending artery were noted.
His central venous pressure was 12.
His PAD was 28, and his [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 36.
The patient was noted to be a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.
A follow-up chest x-ray demonstrated evidence of volume overload with questionable acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Further evaluation of the patient's chest film demonstrated the presence of bilateral pleural effusions with increasing evidence of underlying newly diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis.
A screening transesophageal echocardiogram obtained on [**5-5**] demonstrated no evidence of endocarditis as a potential source of the patient's elevated temperature.
Following extubation, an oropharyngeal speech and swallowing study was obtained which cleared the patient for oral intake on [**5-6**].
The patient continued to demonstrate an improving clinical examination and diminishing signs of respiratory distress through postoperative day 13 ([**5-10**]), at which point he was transferred to the floor and admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
A follow-up chest computed tomography demonstrated no evidence of a pulmonary infectious process; however, it did demonstrate evidence of progressive pulmonary fibrosis; right greater than left.
An electrocardiogram and chest x-ray at this time demonstrated no evidence of acute myocardial event or flash pulmonary edema.
