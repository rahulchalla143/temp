Other etiologies (or contributing diagnoses) include: CHF (elevated BNP, negative cardiac biomarkers, CXR showing pulmonary congestion and Kerley B lines ??????
Patient's goal O2 saturation is 88-92%.
His lab chemistries showed elevated bicarbonate to 42, suggestive of metabolic compensation for worsening respiratory acidosis, but he clinically appeared to be improving.
His exam and laboratory findings suggested hypervolemic hyponatremia, likely combination of his cirrhosis, heart failure and ?SIADH given his pulmonary process.
Na was 137 at discharge.
His hyponatremia was corrected as above.
# Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient had downtrending WBC and plt counts on day [**3-9**] of hospitalization without clear trigger.
WBC was 3.9 and platelets stable at 120 on discharge.
His hct was monitored and remained stable.
