His course was complicated by a CSF leak which was repaired, but then followed by development of MRSA meningitis, cerebritis, sinusitis, and mastoiditis, PE/DVT, NSTEMI, acute interstitial nephritis and hypersensitivity desquamative dermatitis believed secondary to vancomycin or rifampin, respiratory failure from pneumonia, ICU neuropathy/myopathy, candidemia, and mental status changes.
He had an ABG of 7.14/74/83 on unknown O2 settings and was found to be satting 91% on NRB mask and have systolic pressures from 40-60, so he was intubated and transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
His pressures stauyed in the 40-60's and he was started on levophed and fluids.
With his hypotension, lactate of 3.8 and WBC 28 with 17% bands, a code sepsis was called.
Urine and blood cultures were drawn.
BPH 8.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-18**], there is no significant change.
He was continued on voriconazole for history of [**Female First Name (un) **] blood infection.
He got >10 liters of fluid and SVo2 was >90% despite fluids, so an echo was done which showed no shunt.
ID was consulted and recommended continuing linezolid and cefepime, and obtaining MRI of the neck area which showed no drainable fluid collection.
The next day, cultures revealed pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime.
3) EKG changes/demand ischemia - The patient was noted to have new inferior flipped T waves on admission, and slightly elevated troponins in the setting of systolic blood pressures to the 40's.
HE should follow up with his cardiologist and stress test or cath should be considered when his rehabilitation is completed.
He was continued on aspirin, and beta blocker and captopril were restarted when blood pressure tolerated.
4) Vancomycin allergy with eosinophilia - The patient had a history of severe desquamative reaction/AIN/hypotension and fevers in recent hospitalization to vanco/rifampin.
Urine eos were negative.
His creatinine improved with hydration to baseline.
6) history of PE/DVT, on anticoagulation - He was reversed on admission with 1 mg IV vitamin K in anticipation of possible LP, but then started on heparin when INR was < 2.
Sodium Chloride [**12-17**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day).
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): may titrate as tolerated to keep pulse around 60.
Captopril 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): may titrate to keep systolic blood pressure between 120 and 140.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): adjust as needed, goal INR [**1-18**].
