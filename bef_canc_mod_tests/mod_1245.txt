Inital labs were notable for troponin of 0.11, ABG with pH 7.30, K 8.0, and lactate of 5.2, glucose close to 400.
Her initial HCT's came back hemolyzed, but eventually her HCT was determined to be 18 and 1 unit of blood was started.
Her systolic bloodpressure trended down to the 100's from 130's and she was urgently transferred to the MICU for further management.
Has had some chest pain radiating to left arm but is now gone, not like previous MI which was silent, and lasted 30 minutes in ED.

CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**9-17**], cardiac cath [**2140-10-7**] showed 3vd, mild diastolic dysfunction, and mild mitral regurgitation 8.

Pertinent Results: [**2142-5-6**] 11:15PM   CK-MB-44* MB INDX-5.5 cTropnT-1.13* [**2142-5-6**] 11:15PM   CK(CPK)-796* [**2142-5-6**] 03:15PM   WBC-10.3# RBC-1.79*# HGB-5.5*# HCT-18.1*# MCV-101* MCH-30.6 MCHC-30.4* RDW-16.9*  echo [**2142-5-9**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**10-24**]/2204, left ventricular function is probably similar (images not available for direct comparison).
#) GI bleed with melena and presented with HCT 17 but hemodynamically stable except tachycardia.
Serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] were stable for 24 hours prior to d/c.
During this admission patient was followed by GI; an egd, colonoscopy done- but neither really accounted for source.
Subsequently [**1-17**] bottles of blood cx from [**5-6**] showed gram + rods- likely contaminant.
urine cx neg, follow up blood cultures were negative to date at d/c.
Please follow up blood cultures from this hospitalization.
EKG not suggesting STEMI.
Subsequently, CK 796, MB 44, MBI 5.5 and TropT 1.13--> ruled in for NSTEMI.
#) history of pancreatic IPMT and surgical resection - no active issues unless tumor seen on workup .
