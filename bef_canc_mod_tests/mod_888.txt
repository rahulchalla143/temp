At the outside hospital, the patient was found to have a blood sugar of 31.
His 02 saturation was 92% on room air.
He was also found to have bilateral crackles and was given 40 mg of IV Lasix and aspirin, an amp of D50 and a half an inch of nitroglycerin paste and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
CAD, status post CABG in [**2178**] and [**2196**], last catheterization in [**2199-9-25**] showed three vessel coronary artery disease, moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction, patent LIMA to LAD, and SVG to RI/OM and PDA.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 165/65, pulse 76, respirations 20, saturating 98% on 2 liters.
Extremities:  Sacral edema, cool feet, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 3.1, hematocrit 30.4, platelets 167,000.
INR 2.1.
Chem-7 significant for a BUN of 27, creatinine 2.3.
The urinalysis was significant for 21-50 white cells.
He was sent to the ICU shortly after admission for closer glucose monitoring and was started on a D10 drip due to very difficult to control blood sugars.
The patient's hypoglycemia was felt likely due to the use of oral hypoglycemic agents in the setting of acute renal failure.
The patient will follow-up with his primary care physician for further monitoring of his blood sugars and titration of oral hypoglycemics.
HEART PUMP:  The patient was with CHF with an ejection fraction of 20-25%.
The patient diuresed well with improvement in his oxygen saturation and pulmonary examination.
The patient's diuretics were transiently held when his creatinine bumped from his admission of 2.3 to 2.4.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient is with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.
The patient's renal function was monitored and was normalized during this admission and should be followed closely as an outpatient.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was continued on a low-sodium diet.
His electrolytes were monitored and maintained.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable with good oxygen saturation and good glycemic control.
