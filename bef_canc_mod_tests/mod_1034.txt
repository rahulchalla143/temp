At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, patient's platelet counts were reported to be 3 with hematocrit of less than 20.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was transported immediately to the surgical intensive care unit where he was found to have an extremely low platelet count of less than 5, hematocrit of 20.5.
Hepatitis C. 3.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on presentation include a white count of 8.6, hematocrit of 20.5, platelets 5.
Chem-7 is sodium 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 112, CO2 23, BUN 53, creatinine 1.0, glucose 128.
AST was noted to be 26, ALT 24, alk phos 65.
Total bilirubin is 1.1.
PERTINENT EXAMINATION:  On presentation, patient's vital signs are temperature 99.9, pulse 91, blood pressure 133/47, respiratory rate of 23, saturation 100%.
Pulmonary examination shows the lungs to be clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination shows heart regular rate and rhythm with no evidence of any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Care in the intensive care unit focused on re-establishing physiologically safe levels of platelets and bringing hematocrit back up.
Likewise, heparin induced thrombocyte antibodies were sent and subsequently were returned negative.
Despite several course of IVIG, there was reportedly very little resolution or improvement in the platelet count despite multiple transfusion of platelets and other blood products.
Immunosuppression was restarted with Solu-Medrol 60 mg p.o.
Total blood loss during the procedure was minimal and the patient only required 2 units of packed red blood cells.
On hospital day 20, after final evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the hematology/oncology service, it was deemed the patient was an appropriate candidate for discharge.
