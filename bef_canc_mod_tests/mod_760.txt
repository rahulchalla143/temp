Dermatology, Neurology, and Infectious Disease were consulted during this hospitalization.
Dermatology felt that while the biopsy and clinial presentation were not pathomneumonic, the case likely represented an atypical eosinophilic presentation of Sweet's syndrome.
Most likely, the presentation was secondary to Sweet's syndrome in the setting of previous infection, most likely viral or Lyme; Lyme titers sent on previous hospitalization were negative and repeat Lyme titers were sent on this hospitalization and were pending upon discharge.
Because of the association between Sweet's syndrome and malignancy, a CT abdomen was performed, which was negative as above.
CSF was sent for cytology, which was pending at the time of discharge.
Wound culture from the original biopsy was positive for MRSA, and the patient was placed on contact precautions.
The patient's vancomycin and neutropenic precautions were subsequently discontinued.
The patient's hematocrit remained in the low 30s throughout this hospitalization from baseline low 40s in [**7-25**].
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease.
His anemia showed be followed-up as an outpatient.
Lumbar puncture was repeated on this admission, with results as above.
The CSF was sent for Lyme titers, which were pending upon discharge.
The patient's pre-existing lower extremitiy spasticity remained stable throughout hospitalization.
As above, would culture from skin biopsy [**2126-8-19**] was positive for MRSA, and the patient was placed on contact precautions.
Stable white blood cell count and improving rash.
