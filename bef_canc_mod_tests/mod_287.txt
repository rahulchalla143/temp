History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 25% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents with altered mental status x 1 day.
In ED, HR 74, BP 101/65, RR 21, SpO2 100% on NRB.
A CXR and CT head were performed.
Blood, urine, and peritoneal fluid were sent for culture, and he received a dose of vancomycin and zosyn.
He received normal saline 2 L, ASA 325 mg PR, Vancomycin 1 g, and Zosyn 4.5 g.  Following intubation, blood pressure dropped to 78/50 and levophed gtt was initiated.

Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2185-2-18**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
ECHO [**2185-2-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
CXR [**2185-2-19**]: A single portable image of the chest was obtained and compared to the prior examination dated [**2185-2-18**] demonstrating no significant interval change.
An enlarged cardiac silhouette associated with pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 20-30% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents after recent discharge with altered mental status x 1 day and continuing chronic bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
After metabolic etiologies were excluded, it appears both altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory arrest were medicaiton induced.
#) Hypotension: on adm, pt met 1 of SIRS criteria (afebrile, HR 74, WBC 7.9, RR 21) but required levophed for BP support following intubation.
Essentially unchanged ECHO and CE flat.
Septic shock was still most likely etiology pt hypotension on admission.
Podiatry re-evaluated case and requested doppler studies of lower extremities, which confirmed severe disease.
Vascular surgery was consulted and decided to perform angiogram which revealed severe occlusive disease of the right lower extremity.
Patient remained asymptomatic and serial ECG's showed return to baseline.
(b) Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of apical systolic function suggestive of non-ischemic etiology; ECHO [**2-17**] essentially unchanged with LVEF 20-30%.
#) OSA: pt with h/o OSA on CPAP, but has not been using for months now - will monitor overnight & apply supplemental oxygen prn - encourage family to bring in home machine .
