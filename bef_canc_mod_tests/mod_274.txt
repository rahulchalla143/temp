[**2160-7-6**] CT Abd/pelvis w/ contrast: No intra-abdominal malignancy or lymphadenopathy identified.
Urine cultures and blood cultures had no growth to date.
At time of discharge, serum tryptase and serum IgE, obtained to determine whether this episode was consistent with an allergic reaction, were pending.
HIV Antibody and viral load were negative, and the infectious disease service felt that, even if the patient were immunosuppressed, his clinical picture was not consistent with an opportunistic infection.
In terms of malignancy work-up, hematology/oncology was consulted for possible bone marrow biopsy (given mild pancytopenia), which will be performed when the patient follows up with them as an outpatient.
His last colonoscopy was in [**2154**] and was negative except for diverticulosis.
In order to look for lymphadenopathy that could suggest malignancy or lymphoma, he underwent an Abd CT [**7-6**], which showed no evidence of LAD/malignancy.
[**7-1**] chest CTA had showed only small non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
The patient will have a repeat IgG level/subsets and CD4 checked as an outpatient 2 weeks following discharge.
3) Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipitor, which had been held in the setting of acute illness, was restarted prior to discharge  4) Edema/mild CHF: EF 50-55%, [**12-24**]+ MR, impaired LV relaxation.
He was started on low dose furosemide, and will have his electrolytes checked within 1 week followed discharge to ensure stability.
