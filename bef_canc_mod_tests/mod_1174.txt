She presented to [**Hospital3 **] that day, and her vitals there were significant for low-grade temp (100.4), blood pressure was stable in the 120s-140s, and persistently tachycardic in the 120s.
Her ALT was 380, AST 514, T bili 1.1, Alk phos 242, amylase 2960, lipase 3990, and she was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] ICU with a presumed diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis.
While there, she initial received not enough IVF per their notes, and her creatinine increased from 1.6 on admit to 2.9 this AM.
She received 2L NS bolus and her UOP remained low (15-30 cc/hr).
Her LFTs decreased, amylase decreased, calcium was very low at 6.0.
Her creatinine increased to 2.6 this afternoon.
Her imaging studies demonstrated diffusely enlarged pancreas c/w pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, ascites.
Diverticulitis 3.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CT Abd [**2187-4-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Abd with IV contrast [**2187-4-27**]: IMPRESSION: Severe pancreatitis with marked inflammatory change about the pancreas and into the mesentery.
This follow-up CT with contrast confirms the prior impression that most of the pancreas is replaced by a necrotic fluid collection.
[**2187-5-1**] CT ABD: IMPRESSION: Interval stable appearance of severe pancreatitis with replacement of the neck and body of the pancreas with an inflammatory phlegmon.
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  After withdrawal of the endotracheal tube, the tube tip now appears 2 cm above the carina with the neck in flexed position.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2187-5-9**] 2:50 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval interval change in pancreas, r/o free air in pancreas, Field of view: 48 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old woman with necrotizing pancreatitis w/ persistant fever.

There is an unchanged lack of-enhancement of the neck and body of the pancreas, which are replaced by a phlegmon/ fluid.
Stable appearance of severe pancreatitis with inflammatory phlegmon/fluid within the neck and body of the pancreas with retained enhancement of head and tail of pancreas and no new gas collections.CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-5-9**] 3:28 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval pleural effusions/ pneumonia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old woman w/ pancreatitis, eval for pleural effusions/ pneumonia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval pleural effusions/ pneumonia AP CHEST, 3:49 A.M., [**5-9**]  HISTORY: Pancreatitis, evaluate for effusions and pneumonia.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2187-5-25**] 1:11 PM  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Please eval for pseudocyst, abscess, intrabdominal process.
TECHNIQUE: After administration of oral contrast, MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the abdomen, followed by IV contrast-enhanced images through the abdomen and pelvis.
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, and right kidney are within normal limits.
The pancreatic head, body, and tail are mostly replaced by a large hypoattenuating lesion, consisting of fluid density and some soft tissue, 42 mm in greatest AP diameter.
Celiac axis and SMA are both well identified.
No saccular outpouchings to suggest pseudoaneurysms are seen, although this is not a CTA study targeted to the abdominal vessels.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: As described above, a small amount of free fluid is seen tracking along the pericolic gutters and into the pelvis.
Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2187-6-6**] 5:53 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Compare to CT abdomen on [**5-25**] to make sure that there are no Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 yo female with necrotizing pancreatitis.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Compare to CT abdomen on [**5-25**] to make sure that there are no new processes and that she is clear to go home.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the abdomen were obtained without IV contrast followed by images of the abdomen and pelvis after 150 mL Optiray IV contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases are clear.
The stomach, duodenum, and intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable without evidence of obstruction or perforation.
Please note this is not a CT angiogram study targeted for the abdominal vessels.
The celiac trunk, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] opacify well.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, urinary bladder, uterus, adnexa, and pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable.
