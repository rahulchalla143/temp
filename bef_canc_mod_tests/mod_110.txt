A pharmacologic MIBI was done as well and showed a possible mild reversible inferior wall defect.
Cardiology was consulted, and recommended medical management at this time, given that there would not be a mortality benefit to cardiac cath with the findings on her stress MIBI and that this would be for symptom management only.
VS were unremarkable then per the pt.
Labs were notable for a Hct of 18, down from latest baseline of 22-23 since [**Month (only) 958**] (23.6 on recent discharge at 4/18).
Pt received 3L IVF NS with improvement of BP to systolic 120s, later 150s.
Upon arrival in the ICU, pt was more alert and SBP in 150s.

EGD 3/8/078: oozing angioectasia at fundus, was cauterized .
[**2184-5-4**] CTA Chest: Suboptimal study without evidence of central or interlobar pulmonary embolism.
Calculated EF 49%.
Echo [**2-/2182**]: EF 55%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-11-28**], an impaired relaxation pattern is now noted.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-12**]: 1.
This patient has undergone 22 CT scans at this institution and additional studies involving ionizing radiation should be ordered with discretion.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins was performed.
Anemia/Upper GI Bleed: Patient with Hct drop from 22 -> 18, and has history of known AVMs, has had bleeds several times in the past years.
She had an EGD and small bowel enteroscopy which showed several AVMs in the proximal small bowel, which were cauterized.
She required 1 more units pRBC [**5-15**] for Hct 24 indicating continued slow bleed, but then HCT stabilized between 26-29 until discharge.
When her hct was stable for 24 hours on [**5-14**], coumadin was restarted.
She would benefit in the future from chronic pain referral and close monitoring for pain control.
Rt arm pain: Patient had left arm pain one morning and given history of clots, an US was done which was negative for clot.
CT abdomen with IV contrast did not show any acute findings.
An endoscopy was done which showed bleeding ateriovenous fistulas in your small bowel that were treated.
