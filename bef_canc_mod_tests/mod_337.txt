EKG demonstrated V-paced, no significant change compared with prior dated 8/[**2109**].
ETT performed on [**5-/2103**] demonstrated: This 76 yo man (s/p stent amd pacemaker '[**00**]; CVA '[**02**]) was referred to the lab for CAD evaluation (viability; ischemia).
The patient was administered 5 ug (5 min stage), 10, 20, 30 and 40 ug/kg/min (3 min stages) of Dubutamine for a total infusion duration of 17 minutes.
A progressive and subtle drop in blood pressure was noted during the infusion (nonspecific finding w/ Dobutamine infusion).
The EKG was uninterpretable due to the presence of a paced rhythm.
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 69 bpm and a blood pressure of  172/96 mmHg.
Focused Doppler demonstrated  trace aortic regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared  with a prior study from [**2100-9-10**] (baseline for exercise echo), there has been a significant deterioration in left ventricular function.
At low dose dobutamine [5 mcg/kg/min; heart rate = 69 bpm, blood pressure = 178/96 mmHg), there was failure to augment systolic function of all segments.
At mid-dose dobutamine [20 mcg/kg/min; heart rate = 69 bpm, blood pressure =  178/86 mmHg), there was augmentation of the basal inferoposterolateral wall and anterior wall.
At peak dobutamine stress [40 mcg/kg/min; heart rate = 69 bpm, blood pressure  = 158/76 mmHg), there was persistent augmentation of the basal  inferoposterolateral wall and anterior wall.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2103**]: Right dominant system revealed significant obstructive two vessel disease.
The LAD revealed discrete mid 70-80% and distal 70% stenoses, with its proximal D1 branch exhibiting 70% stenosis and D2 branch with diffuse disease up to 70%.
The LCx revealed a mid-vessel 40% lesion, with its OM3 branch exhibiting a 30-40% stenosis proximal to the widely patent stent.
The RCA revealed discrete proximal 70-80% and distal 60% stenoses.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a mean RA pressure of 6 mmHg, PA pressure of 30/12 mmHg, mean PCW pressure of 11 mmHg, LVEDP of 8 mmHg and a cardiac index of 3.1 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography revealed a moderately severe anterolateral and apical hypokinesis, with posterobasal and inferior akinesis.
The ejection fraction was 27%.
CXR [**10-11**] AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.
No definite change in the cardiac or mediastinal contour from prior studies given differences in technique.
Please note for the detection of aortic pathology, CT is more sensitive.
CXR PA and lat [**10-11**]: Small left pleural effusion is confirmed, and there is also a probable very small right posterior effusion.
Persantine MIBI [**10-11**]: 1) Mild inferior wall defect likely representing attenuation.
2) Moderate global hypokinesis and biventricular dilation with ejection fraction of 35%.
His cardiac enzymes were followed, and were found to be negative.
The day after presentation, the patient received a persantine MIBI which was found to have EF of 35% and a mild inferior wall defect thought to be secondary to attenuation.
The patient has known chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure with an EF of 40%; he was euvolemic throughout his admission.
He received gentle IV fluids and urine was sent for electrolytes and eosinophils.
Creatinine improved to 1.2 on the day of discharge.
# Anemia Patient has a chronic macrocytic anemia, and his hematocrit was at his baseline (25-31).
The was not sure why an ACE inhibitor was not included among the patient's medications.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: chest pain Secondary Diagnoses: CAD, cardiomyopathy with EF 40% by echo in [**2108**], sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker in [**2100**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, spinal stenosis, chornic low back pain   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile with stable vital signs, chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain.
You were evaluated with blood tests and a stress test and found not to have had a heart attack.
You had a chest xray that showed some fluid outside your lung (a pleural effusion) on the left side.
You should have a CT scan of your chest to further evaluate this as an outpatient.
Call your primary care doctor and seek medical attention at once if you develop: ** recurrent chest discomfort, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness, or other symptoms that worry you  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 8673**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8674**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1091**] Date/Time:[**2109-12-13**] 9:40 Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
