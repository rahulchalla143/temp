Had abnl cxr so v/q not pursued either.
Passed swallow study on [**7-25**] and [**7-31**].
[**7-25**], pt had resp distress but cxr showed layering pleural effusions L>R, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 44756**].
[**7-26**], patient had another episode of tachypnea, hypoxia at HD and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mngt.
Aggressive chest PT was initiated.
EF now 25% with new akinesis.
Cardiac cath considered for concern of recurring ischemia (INR elevated [**3-15**] coumadin, so held off for some time).
Cath tentatively planned for [**8-7**], pt started on heparin today for stroke ppx since INR now.
[**2113-8-5**] Had HD session w/o incident and had acute onset of resp distress w/ sats 83% approx 30 min after arrival on floor.
VS at that time were T 96.3 BP 108/60's HR 90's RR 30's sats 83% NRB (was 98% 2L previous to this).
ABG 7.42/40/49 on NRB.
pt w/ pulse; ekg NSR 90's old TWI's in V1-V5.
MICU stay Underwent throacentesis with 1700 cc of serous fluid removed which was transudative.
He was initially on a levophed gtt for hypotension, but with fluid boluses he was weaned off the gtt.
Chest PT, nebulizer therapy, and mucolytic therapy were instituted with success.
PTT was supratherapeutic GI consulted, felt endoscopy would not be of benefit unless catheterization performed.
[**8-17**] Thallium viability performed revealed no reversible defects, as no tissue could be recovered by reperfusion, Cardiology decided catheterization would not benefit the patient and signed off.
