Angiography revealed a right dominant system with 50% distal left main lesion; 70% ostial stenosis in the left anterior descending; 90% stenosis in the circumflex involving the first obtuse marginal; and 70% lesion in the mid right coronary artery.
Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed.
A preoperative chest x-ray was notable for a new right lower lobe opacity which will require further evaluation as an outpatient.
He required diuresis and aggressive chest PT while steroid therapy was resumed.
Serial chest x-rays were notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the left hemithorax with a small left apical pneumothorax.
He remained afebrile but was empirically started on antibiotics for positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
At discharge, his apical pneumothorax remained stable while oxygen saturations remained 96% on 3L.
He will eventually need to follow up with his pulmonologist and require outpatient CT scan to further evaluate his new right lower lobe lung opacity.
