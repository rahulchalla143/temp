**FINAL REPORT [**2199-11-22**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2199-11-22**]):       Culture workup discontinued.
Further incubation showed contamination       with mixed skin/genital flora.
Imaging Studies:  Electrocardiogram ([**2199-11-20**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-9-11**] there is variation in precordial lead placement but the T wave abnormalities recorded in leads V4-V6 are not apparent.
Chest x-ray ([**2199-11-23**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Workup revealed UTI and accumulation of left pleural effusion, and patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for need for pressors.
Urine culture taken from the nephrostomy tube later grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn, so the vancomycin was stopped.
Stool and blood cultures were negative.
Pleural fluid cultures were negative.
With treatment of the urinary tract infection, his blood pressure improved and the patient was quickly weaned off of Levophed.
However, serial chest x-rays and hematocrits showed stability and no evidence of bleeding post-procedure.
