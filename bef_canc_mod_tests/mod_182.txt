Initial vitals were T 97.9, BP 138/83, P 69, RR 24, 99% on NRB (dropping to 99% on 6L by NC).
Past Medical History: -History of right sided MCA ischemic stroke (residual mild left hemiparesis) -Severe aortic stenosis:  TTE [**2-1**] showed severe AS and diastolic heart failure.

Metabolic disturbances, infection, and medications are among the most common causes.
ECHO [**8-3**] - Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CXR [**8-3**]: There is a small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is very similar.
The cardiac silhouette is borderline in size.
MRI Head/Brain/Neck [**8-3**]: 1.
Suboptimal quality of the contrast-enhanced MR angiogram of the neck, which makes assessment inaccurate.
Neurology evaluated the patient and did an EEG which showed encephalopathy likely due to metabolic causes.
An Echo showed worsening aortic insufficiency, RV hypokinesis a worsening of LVEF (50%).
The patient's blood pressure was well controlled with a systolic blood pressure goal of less tahn 130.
Severe aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis with a value area of 0.8-1.0.
#Hypertension: The patient had well controlled blood pressure with most SBP<140 during this hospitalization.
An echocardiogram showed increased aortic regurgitation, increased hypokinesis in the right ventricle and a worse left ventricular ejection fraction (50%).
She was infused with D5W and her hypernatremia returned to [**Location 213**].
