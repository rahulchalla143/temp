In ED: BP 146/71 HR 95; hypoxia to 89%, that was 98% on 4L, 100.3 and c/o CP.
Supratherapuetic on admit with INR to 7 after being anticoagulated for LIJ thrombosis [**9-28**] in setting of PICC line.
INR was reversed with vitamin K. Upon admit surgery was called to evaluate her and thought her to be a poor surgical candidate.
While in the MICU she was not hypotensive but had average BP of 140/90s and never required pressors.
Preoperative anemia, transfused x2.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2129-10-13**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO P. [**Doctor Last Name **], R.N.
Abdominal exam significant for wincing pain to palpation, concerning for toxic megacolon given C. diff infection.
CXR revealed mod pulm.
Preliminary wound swab revealed GPC in pairs, still pending on discharge.
Repeat imaging studies would be ideal to better assess the OSH images, but given the patient's family wishes of no surgical approach and the risk of IV contrast, no further imaging was pursued.
Given no surgical intervention, patient was medically managed with blood pressure control and her Hct was followed as an inpatient.
Upon discharge, all blood cultures negative, campylobacter & samonella negative.
On admit elevated INR initially thought to represent DIC vs over administration of warfarin.
DIC panel: fibrinogen 752, FDP 10-40, d-dimer 4040.
On discharge, patient was therapeutic with INR = 2.5 despite held warfarin, thought to be due to poor diet.
Rehab instructed to monitor INR and add warfarin PRN for goal INR [**1-8**].
Urine lytes evaluated and found to be UreaN:1145, Creat:67, Na:<10, Osmolal:654.
FeNa 0.12%, thus patient likely prerenal [**1-7**] nausea/vomiting.
Na 137 on discharge.

Please check INR daily until on therapeutic regimen and then per facility protocol 22.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day as needed for INR goal [**1-8**] : Likely very sensitive to coumadin; INR on transfer 2.5 without coumadin, likely secondary to recent poor nutrition.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC and chemistry panel qod to monitor for renal function, adequacy of electrolyte repletion and stable Hct.
