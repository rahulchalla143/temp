ACS ruled out:  troponins negative x2, EKG unchanged from prior, and symptom onset was insidious, and the patient says her chest pain is close to baseline.
Blood gas was obtained, which showed the patient to be in hypercapnic respirtaroy failure, and the patient was tranfered to CCU for BIPAP.
Dry weight is 84.3kg.
Creatinine rose again in the setting of aggressive diuresis and hypotension, but improved upon discharge after gentle bolus (500cc) of IVF.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: On admission, pt had supratheraputic INR to 6.2 and coumadin was held.
She was given 1mg vitamin K to reverse INR so that patient could go on to right heart catheterization, she did not end up getting procedure, INR normalized and coumadin was restarted.
Pt's carvedilol was held for hypotension in CCU and uptitrated to home dose as BP tolerated, then changed to metoprolol to minimize bronchospastic component.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Admission EKG at her baseline.
# BLOOD PRESSURE:  Normotensive with SBP in 110-120s on discharge.
Has had some urinary symptoms, and was post void bladder scan showed 400 ccs of urine, so Foley was placed.
[**2202-7-31**] urine cx showed 10,000-100,000 Enterococcus.
Bcx showed no growth and WBC downtrended.
