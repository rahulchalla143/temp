In the emergency department, diagnostic paracentesis revealed > 4000 WBCs in para fluid suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Lung volumes are low.
Given the low lung volumes, evaluation of the lung bases is limited.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2122-1-27**] 1.
Further workup with Doppler liver vascular ultrasound should be considered.
TIPS [**2122-1-28**] 1.
CXR [**2122-1-29**] The patient is severely rotated, distorting anatomical landmarks.
The examination was performed at near expiration, which crowds and dilates pulmonary vasculature and is responsible for severe left lower lobe atelectasis.
Cardiac size cannot be assessed.

# Sepsis - Abdominal pain is present on review of systems; diagnostic paracentesis reveals a WBC count of >4000 with >90% polys consistent with either SBP or secondary bacterial peritonitis (given repeated taps), but no perforation or abscess seen on CT abdomen.
Alkaline phosphatase is elevated which could be secondary to TIPS.
The fluid culture revealed GNRs.
The fluid culture grew e.coli which was resistant to zosyn, which he had been treated with, and he was transitioned to ceftriaxone, which the e.coli was sensitive to.
# Hypotension: blood pressure was in the range of SBP 80s at night; then increased during the day to the 100s.
At time of transition to CMO, the patient's blood pressure was 60/40.
An NGT was placed with relief of nausea and vomiting, and he was discharged with this tube to hospice for intermittent suctioning.
The patient has baseline anemia, likely secondary to kidney disease and liver disease; prior iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
No signs of hemorrhage on CT abd.
The patient missed HD on day of admission (Monday, [**1-27**]) so recieved an extra session on [**1-28**], in which 1L was removed.
