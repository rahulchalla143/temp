He was found to have profound anemia with HCT of 18.7 (baseline high 20s-30s), acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.5 (baseline [**1-29**]), new cerebellar lesion on CT head, and RLL pneumonia.
He developed acute shortness of breath after admission and evaluation revealed pulmonary edema (though imaging suggestive of noncardiogenic etiology), and was diuresed.
LOS fluid balance at transfer was approximately negative 800 cc.
He was transfused 3 units of blood, had negative stool guaiacs, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency, and had negative hemolysis labs (haptglobin 677).
Hematocrit at transfer 24.5, and CT torso did not reveal intra-abdominal source of blood loss.
His creatinine mildly improved after the blood transfusions and some diuresis to 4.5 at transfer.
His rapamycin level was elevated and his doses were held with plan to restart once <8.
Lastly, neurology/stroke was consulted regarding the cerebellar lesion seen on CT scan and his falls at home.
His neuro exam was nonfocal and the lesion was thought to be a chronic infarct vs. metastases as opposed to an acute lesion.

TTE [**4-27**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed because of significan mitral valve disease.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Lungs show interlobular septal thickening and bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities, which given lack of interstitial abnormality on CT from [**2113-2-27**], is most suggestive of non cardiogenic pulmonary edema given normal heart size and lack of pleural effusion.
Generalized atrophy of the muscles, especially involving bilateral iliopsoas, which may account for patient's lower extremity weakness.
EGD, small bowel follow through, and gastric empyting study were all attempted, but could not be performed given poor room air saturation (for EGD) and back pain / not tolerating procedure (when laying flat for SBFT and GE study).
# Anemia secondary to chronic renal disease Admission hct was 18.7.
His rapamycin level was also found to be elevated, secondary to med toxicity with azithromycin.
After diuresis and a low creatinine of 2.8, his creatinine trended up again to 4.0.
On arrival, head CT showed a cerebellar hypodensity.
Head MRI with gadolinium was recommended non acutely to better evaluate this and rule out the unlikely possibility of a primary lung metastasis; the MRI was witheld due to ARF, decreased GFR, and as mentioned above, the patient's inability to tolerate MRIs.
This can be performed as an outpatient or a PET scan can be done to rule out metastasis.
