Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 22336**] for DOE and melenotic stools; Hct was found to be 22 from baseline 40.
She underwent extensive GI workup including EGD, colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy that was largely unrevealing for source of bleed.
She received total of 4 units PRBCs during admission with Hct in low 30s on discharge.
CXR was unremarkable.

CT CHEST [**4-4**] 1.
Elective evaluation with dedicated adrenal protocol CT may be performed as an outpatient.
EGD [**2105-4-4**]: Impression: Food in the whole Esophagus Erythema and friability in the lower third of the esophagus compatible with esophagitis Retained fluids in stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Trial clears with close monitoring.
Can consider further motility evaluation if it becomes clear that the stomach as well as colon are involved as well and if the above is unrevealing.
Barium Swallow [**2105-4-5**] FINDINGS: The patient has mild esophageal dysmotility.
She had a CT of the chest which showed large amounts of food in the esophagus with air fluid levels.
She was intubated for her EGD given food seen on CT scan and concern for aspiration.
Her EGD showed large amounts of food in the esophagus as well as esophagitis without evidence of strictures or malignancies.
Barium swallow showed no stricture.
She initially appeared euvolemic on exam and torsemide was initially held.
Hct remained at her baseline in low 30s.
She will need a repeat colonoscopy in 6 months as outpatient  Thrombocytopenia: Has long-standing thrombocytopenia.
Platelet count remained in her baseline range.
Patient needs to be followed up on her dysphagia as outpatient, and further work up should be discussed with GI 2.
Patient needs a repeat colonoscopy in 6 months as outpatient 4.
Left adrenal nodule found incidentally on CT chest, should have adrenal protocol CT as outpatient to further assess  # Communication: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 575**] (son, [**Name (NI) 382**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22335**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22334**] # Code: Full (confirmed with HCP)   Medications on Admission: 1. digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO once a day.

You had an endoscopy to look at your esophagus and food was found within your esophagus as well as irritation of your esophagus called esophagitis.
We also performed a barium swallow study which did not show any strictures.
A study called esophageal manometry was performed and showed no evidence of achalasia.
