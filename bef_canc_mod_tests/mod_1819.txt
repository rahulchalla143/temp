Pulmonary vascularity is minimally prominent and indistinct suggesting slight congestion.
She became bradycardic to the 50's after her first dose, but then on repeat later in the afternoon on HD #2 her heart rate was persistently in the 60-80s.
Her blood pressures and heart rate were stable and it was felt she was safe to be discharged on half dose metoprolol and diltiazem and her lisinopril could be restarted in the outpatient setting.
As her digoxin toxicity was treated her K+ trended from 6.6-4.2.
Discussed with attending who would like her to get 1mg of PO vitamin K.  Her INR peaked at 6.2 and then started trending down thereafter.
On the day of discharge her INR was 3.0.
She will have her INR repeated on [**2179-8-3**] and will be restarted per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Abdominal X-ray was unrevealing.
Will add on urine lytes to confirm and trend.
Her lisinopril was held and urine lytes were unrevealing.
Her creatinine improved to 1.1 on hospital day 1.
Her metoprolol and diltiazem will be halved for now and can be increased in the outpatient setting if needed.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Need to follow up INR and restart coumadin when between [**3-12**] - Need to restart lisinopril when indicated - Consider increase nodal agents if needed back to home doses - Will need to follow up and continue evaluate abdominal pain - She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding further management of her a-fib - Follow up with wound ostomy nurse regarding further post-op care   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
