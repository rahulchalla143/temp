On [**2105-3-6**], an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan were done to determine the source of her mental status changes.
The electroencephalogram was consistent with encephalopathy, no focal activity indicating seizures.
The magnetic resonance imaging scan could not be performed as the patient could not sit still and comply with the exam.
On one of these occasions, she was given a gentle bolus, however, her blood pressure seemed to respond the same way it did when she was not given boluses.
On [**2105-3-7**], the patient's white blood cell count rose to 4.7, although she afebrile.
A urinalysis was done which ultimately grew out Klebsiella culture and she was started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for this.
Her blood pressure remained stable.
