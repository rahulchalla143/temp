However, the CXR was without clear new infiltrate.
On ED arrival, initially vs were: T 99.1, P 88, BP 112/72, RR 32, O2sat 82% on NRB.
Labs were notable for a WBC 21 up from 12 on discharge (diff...).
BNP was 1293 c/w prior admission during which he was not felt to be in CHF.
CK was 115 but trop mildly elevated at 0.09, consistent with prior admission (0.08-1).
Post-intubation CXR showed LLL infiltrates which were difficult to assess given his post-lobectomy changes.
CTA chest showed no PE and bibasilar infiltrates mostly at the periphery consistent with pneumonia, less likely aspiration pneumonitis.
Blood cultures were drawn, and patient started on vancomycin and Zosyn.
On transfer to the MICU, vs were: P 75, BP 105/66, O2sat 100% with ABG 7.60/27/130/27 on AC 500/16/5/100%.
