This was first diagnosed in [**11-18**] when pain between his shoulders prompted a chest x ray demonstrating a posterior chest wall mass.
CT demonstrated a large mass in the right posterior mediastinum and hemithorax destroying the transverse processes of T3, T4, and hte ribs at that level.
CT guided biopsy of this right posterior chest wall lesion was consistent with plasmacytoma.
Bone marrow biopsy was significatn for plasma cells involvement, 41% of the marrow cellularity.
Skeletal survey showed no additional lytic lesions.
His IgG was 8703, SPEP with abnormal band representing 58%, and a beta-2-microglobulin or 3.4.
MRI at that time demonstrated only prominent sulci.
An LP was negative, and he was also HSV negative.
Then, he was switched to Velcade, with response of IgG decreased to 789, and SPEP with only 4% of total protein.
On [**11-8**], he presented to clinic with shortness of breath, a pulsus of 15, and a chest xray significant for a large mediastinal mass.
His room air saturation was 90%.
His [**11-8**] echocardiogram demonstrated  circumferential pericardial effusion (2.6cm anterior to RV) with evidence of right ventricular and atrial diastolic collapse consistent with tamponade physiology.
Catheterization [**11-9**] demonstrated tamponade physiology with increased and equalized diastolic pressures of RA, PCWP, and pericardial pressures.
MRI of the thoracic mass with bony involvement of T3 through T5 with right posterior ribs and lesion into the spinal canal.

[**2191-11-11**] CT chest: IMPRESSION  1.
TTE: -[**11-8**]:Overall left and right ventricular systolic function is normal.
-[**11-9**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2191-11-11**], the pericardial effusion appears similar to slightly larger.
[**11-10**]: SPECIMEN RECEIVED: PERICARDIAL FLUID  DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Cytology from the pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.
A repeat TTE on the [**11-10**] demonstrated small amount of residual pericardialfluid, but no tamponade physiology.
His pulsus was monitored and was between [**7-26**] daily.
He was also monitored on telemetry with no events while on the floor.
#Anterior Mediastinal Mass: He was treated with a five day course of Solumedrol 125mg IV qD, and there was no interval change in the size of the mass by repeat CT. CT surgery and interventional pulmonary were consulted and the decision was made to biopsy the lesion by bronchoscopy.
By the second or third day on the floor, he was intermittently requiring 2L oxygen by nasal cannula to have oxygen saturation of 95-96% and his pleural effusion was larger on both cxr and CT.
By discharge, his oxygen saturation was 96-97% on room air and 94-95% with ambulating.
