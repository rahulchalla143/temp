In the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature was a temperature to 101.7, blood pressure 99/60, heart rate 116, respiratory rate 34, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air and 97% on 2 liters.
Chest x-ray showed left upper lobe pneumonia.
Laboratories showed leukocytosis and a creatinine of 6.6.
On admission to the medical floor, the patient had a temperature of 102.1, blood pressure 112/60, and oxygen saturation of 89% on room air.
Shortly thereafter, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 85/40.
The patient was bolused 1 liter of  normal saline with an increase in systolic blood pressure to the 90s.
Transthoracic echocardiograms in [**2116**] showed enlarge left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an estimated ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On presentation to the Medical Intensive Care Unit temperature was 99.5, blood pressure 98/61, pulse 113, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 92% on 4 liters.
HEENT revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Heart examination revealed the patient was tachycardic, regular rhythm.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.5, hematocrit 30.9.
Urinalysis revealed large blood, positive nitrites, greater than 30 protein, large bilirubin, moderate bacteria, muddy brown casts.
Chloride 99, bicarbonate 15, BUN 81, creatinine 6.6.
Creatine kinase #1 was 532 with a MB of 5.
Creatine kinase #2 was 422 with a MB of 3.
Liver function tests revealed ALT 41, AST 58, alkaline phosphatase 86, total bilirubin 8, albumin 2.2.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia [**Company 109175**] wave inversion in lead III, right bundle-branch block (new from [**2118**] electrocardiogram with exercised-induced on stress test in [**2122-1-26**]).
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45%, left ventricular size was normal, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Blood cultures showed no growth to date, and sputum culture had greater than 10 epithelial cells with contamination of oropharyngeal secretions.
The patient responded to fluid boluses, but his mean arterial pressure was 65.
Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, the patient was sent for an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 40% to 45%.
RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine of 6.6.
The patient's FENa on presentation was 0.3 with urinalysis showing muddy brown casts.
The patient received intravenous fluids with a decrease in creatinine to 1.2 at the time of discharge.
The patient went for abdominal ultrasound to evaluate elevated bilirubin.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a mass in the kidney.
The patient subsequently went for a CT scan of the abdomen which did not show any renal mass.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient presented with a hematocrit of 30.9 (baseline hematocrit of 33).
Hemolysis and DIC panels were sent and were negative.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells with a post transfusion hematocrit of 30.4.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with a direct hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin peaking at 10.
In addition, the patient had a slight transaminitis with ALT peaking at 107 and AST at 177.
The patient's liver function tests gradually improved during the admission with total bilirubin decreasing to 2.6 at the time of discharge.
On admission, the patient's alkaline phosphatase remained elevated at 156.
The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which showed gallstones but no cholecystitis.
CT was otherwise negative.
