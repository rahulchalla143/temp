She was discharged on Lasix 20 MG PO QD, and soon redeveloped shortness of breath, LE edema and lethargy prompting her re-presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-9-12**].
A CXR confirmed the presence of recurrent bilateral pleural effusions.
In the MICU, she was monitored and was stable other than one episode of hypoglycemia with a blood sugar of 14 on the [**2139-9-16**], that was immediately managed with IV D50 and she responded appropriately with improved alertness and appropriate mental status.
The patient was immediately placed on 4L NC and her O2Sats increased back to the 90s.
An ABG taken on 4L gave results of 7.37/62/67/37 and a following one on RA was 7.39/61/47/38.

CXR ([**2139-9-16**]): As compared to the prior examination, there is improved aeration at the lung bases with improvement in atelectasis and effusions as well as vascular congestion.
CT CHEST ([**2139-9-15**]): 1.
ABDOMINAL U/S ([**2139-9-14**]): 1.
Active issues:  # Code blue/arrest:  The patient underwent renal biopsy and received fentanyl/versed for the procedure.
CPR was performed for 2 minutes following which she had spontaneous return of circulation.
BP was in the 160s and HR in the 70s.
CTA showed no PE and labs were unrevealing.
# Dyspnea hypoxemia with hypercarbia: Thought to be from pleural effusions, which were seen on CXR.
She had no fevers, tachycardia, or signs of infection and was diuresed 3L of fluid with improvement of her O2 saturations to the mid 90s on 2L NC O2.
She was transferred to the floor and continued to improve on IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **] when she was sent for a renal biopsy per the recommendation of both the Renal and Rheumatology teams.
ABGs obtained on 4L and RA revealed a picture of hypercarbia likely from narcotic medication administration and poor inspiratory effort from pleural effusions, chest pain due to CPR and healing rib fractures, in addition to hypoxemia likely from V/Q mismatch given elevated A-a gradient and improvement on oxygen.
This was confirmed by renal biopsy which took place on [**2139-9-15**].
The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.6, which improved initially following diuresis, but then became elevated to 2.6, 48h after a CT scan, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy.
Within 3 days, her creatinine downtrended to 1.3 and she was subsequently started on torsemide 40 MD QD instead of Lasix, and the following day back on her home dose of valsartan 160 MG PO QD.
Repeat K+ after administration of Kayexylate gave a repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of 4.2 and the patient had a stable K+, with occasional need for repletion with potassium chloride following initiation of diuresis.
Her K+ continued to be elevated on discharge but the EKG did not show any acute changes.
Her electrolytes will be followed closely in [**1-25**] days by her PCP.
Her blood sugars in the hospital were somewhat variable, with a many readings above 400 and a low in the MICU of 14, that was managed with 50% Dextrose.
Her blood pressures were generally well-controlled in the hospital and no changes were made to her regimen, apart from the valsartan as described above.
# Rib pain: As a result of chest compressions, the patient noted a very sore chest, with pain managed adequately by tramadol.
Medications on Admission: 1) Amlodipine 10 mg PO/NG DAILY 2) Insulin SC 3) Citalopram 40 mg PO/NG DAILY 4) Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO/NG DAILY 5) Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] 6) Furosemide 40 mg IV ONCE 7) Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY 8) Gabapentin 600 mg PO/NG HS 9) Senna 1 TAB PO BID:PRN Constipation 10) Simvastatin 20 mg PO/NG DAILY 11) Heparin 5000 UNIT SC TID 12) Ambien 5 MG PO QHS PRN for insomnia 13) Ergocalciferol 50,000U QWeekly  Discharge Medications: 1. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Pleural effusions, Hypoxia, Hypercarbia 2.
You received a renal biopsy on [**2139-9-15**], which went well, but immediately following the procedure, you had what was presumed to be a cardiac arrest for 2 minutes.
We closely watched your oxygen levels and you appropriately came off oxygen and had appropriate levels on room air and on the day of discharge.
With regards to your kidneys, the biopsy results revealed that your disease is almost entirely related to your diabetes.
On [**2139-9-17**], your kidney function acutely declined as indicated by an increase in your creatinine level, likely due to the contrast you received a few days earlier during your CT scan.
We conservatively managed this, encouraging you to take in sufficient fluids orally and your creatinine appropriately came down on the day of discharge.
