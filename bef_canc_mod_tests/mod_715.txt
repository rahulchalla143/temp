The EKG obtained, showed a left bundle branch block and the patient was transferred for stress test with nuclear imaging on [**2102-2-21**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 50% with hypokinesis of the septal and inferior walls and reversible ischemia of the apical wall.
Of note, the patient's hematocrit prior to cardiac catheterization was 41.9.
On admission to [**Hospital1 69**], the patient's hematocrit was 36.8.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on hospital day #1, which showed an 80% to 90% LAD lesion and the patient is status post PCA to the LAD.
Blood pressure, at the time, was 80/40 with the pulse of 60.
The patient was given a 500 cc normal saline bolus with increase in the systolic blood pressure to 92.
That morning, the patient was noted to be orthostatic on examination and a.m. labs revealed the hematocrit of 25.8 (down to 36.6 on admission).
CT of the abdomen was done, which showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient subsequently had two bowel movements with bright red blood per rectum and stool mixed with blood clots.
Of note, following bloody bowel movements, the patient's blood pressure and pulse remained stable.
It was decided to follow serial hematocrits as the patient will require anticoagulation for Plavix for one month following PCA of the LAD.
Lipid panel on [**2102-4-6**] showed a total cholesterol of 169, HDL 38, and LDL of 102.
Of note, the patient's precatheterization chest x-ray on [**2102-4-6**] showed large lingular cavity containing air-fluid with CT of the chest recommended as followup.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed the following:  WBC 5.7, hematocrit 36.9, platelet count 160,000, INR 1.2, CPK 33, albumin 3.1.
Radiographic imaging:  CT of abdomen and chest revealed no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Chest x-ray:  No evidence of cavity lesion.
The EKG was abnormal leading to stress test with nuclear imaging and subsequent cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization revealed the following:  One vessel coronary artery disease with a 99% mid LAD stenosis, status post PTCA and stenting of LAD.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is status post cardiac catheterization revealing one vessel coronary artery disease status post PTCA and stenting of the LAD.
Serial hematocrits were drawn and the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells.
Post transfusion hematocrit was 32.2.
The patient's hematocrit remained relatively stable over twenty-four hours.
