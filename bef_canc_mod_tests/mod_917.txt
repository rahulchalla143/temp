The patient had a gas arterial blood gas which demonstrated a pH of 7.20, pO2 182, pCO2 25, bicarbonate 10.
Rabomycin level on [**2138-10-31**] was 18.8.
The patient did get an ultrasound while he was an inpatient demonstrating interval increased amount of hydronephrosis of the left kidney with interval increase of resistive index within this kidney, mild increase in the index in the right kidney without hydronephrosis.
The patient had a workup of his acute visual episodic visual loss which included ophthalmology who met with the patient and felt that it was possible to have retinitis pigmentosus of both eyes, had recommended getting an  ultrasound of the carotids, MRI of the head and CT of the head.
On [**2138-11-6**] carotids were performed demonstrating a right non- occlusive thrombus and IJ carotids demonstrated no stenosis otherwise within normal limits.
CT of head demonstrated no bleed, no midline shift and the MRI that was performed demonstrated it was a very limited study but there was no evidence of acute infarction.
Neurology specifically the stroke team was consulted as well and felt that they definitely would like to have an MRI of the head performed and MRA of the head and carotids, to start aspirin and check a sed rate.
Since the patient had moved on [**2138-11-6**] the patient was scheduled for repeat MRI of the head and neck on [**2138-11-7**].
