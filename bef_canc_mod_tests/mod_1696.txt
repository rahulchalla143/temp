Her cardiac catheterization showed left main disease w/70-80% occlusion, LAD 50% and Circ 99%.
Her recent echo also showed dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction, probable aortic stenosis w/ mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10 cm above sternal angle.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
The LV systolic function remains severely depressed, estimated EF=25%.
More than 5L were diuresed with weight loss of about 3 kg.
Her JVD returned to near normal, breathing much easier, and she was no longer tachypneic.
Additionally she underwent cardiac catheterization for preoperative evaluation [**11-12**] and was found to have coronary artery disease, she had no chest pain preoperatively.
Dermatology performed a biopsy with cultures growing out pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Additionally surgery was delayed due to increased creatinine which peaked at 2.1 on [**1-19**] with BUN 39, the diuretic was held over the next few days and creatinine decreased to 1.6 on [**11-20**] and she was taken to the Operating Room.
Hydralazine was started for afterload reduction as blood pressure tolerated (ACE-I was not started due to increased creatinine.)
Pleural chest tubes remained in place due to high serous drainage for several days post op.
Vancomycin and Flagyl were given for c.diff treatment.An EGD revealed that the patient likely had oozing from the antral gastritis in the setting of high PTT.
Electrophysiology was consulted for evaluation and management of heart failure and for possible BiV pacemaker, which will be reevaluated as an outpatient.
She continued on antibiotics for C-Diff and surveillance cultures were followed.
Three negative c. diff cultures were obtained after treatment was discontinued and precautions were stopped.
