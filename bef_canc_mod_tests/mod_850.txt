Laboratory studies showed a Lithium level of 4.8; creatinine of 4.6; a white count of 21,000.
Chest x-ray showed a left lower opacity.
A CT of the head was negative.
Vital signs were heart rate of 57; blood pressure 102/53; respiratory rate of 16; on assist controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 700 at a rate set of 12; FI02 of 50% with a PEEP of 5.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white count 25.0; hematocrit of 33.1; platelets of 202.
Admission chemistry 7 was sodium of 144; potassium of 6.1; chloride of 119; bicarbonate of 21; BUN 55; creatinine 3.9; glucose 101.
Ionized calcium was 1.43.
Phosphorus was 2.1.
Magnesium was 2.6.
Lithium on admission was 4.8, 0.9 when last checked.
Admission arterial blood gases was 7.33 pH, PaC02 of 38, Pa02 of 365.
PTH was 405.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe collapse, resolved on sequential chest x-rays following a bronchoscopy.
Echo showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%; mild left ventricular hypertrophy; severe left ventricular outflow obstruction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 23 to 27.
EEG showed slow voltage, no epileptic activity.
Bronchoscopy showed thick, purulent secretions in the right main stem bronchus.
Blood cultures drawn on [**2190-7-26**] are currently no growth to date.
Lithium toxicity:  The patient transferred from an outside hospital for a Lithium level of 4.8 for emergent hemodialysis.
Lithium level drawn at [**Hospital1 1444**] was 3.9.
Lithium level following hemodialysis was 1.4 with a goal of Lithium less than 1.0.
The patient was admitted with an initial creatinine of 4.6, thought to be secondary to Lithium toxicity versus a prerenal state.
Creatinine improved to 1.8 following hemodialysis.
Urine sediment was checked and was found to be bland; no suggestion of acute tubular necrosis.
The patient was admitted with a serum potassium of 6.1, thought to be secondary to his acidosis.
The patient was admitted with serum sodium of 144, thought to be secondary to dehydration versus diabetes insipidus.
The patient's sodium improved following intravenous fluids.
The patient was admitted with an initial pH of 7.33, thought to be secondary to RTA with his acute renal failure versus a hyperthymic acidosis, secondary to the five liters of normal saline he received.
Repeat pH was 7.42.
A head CT done at the outside hospital was negative.
An EEG later, following his admission, only showed slow voltage, no epileptic activity.
A toxic screen was done to rule out any other ingestions, possibly responsible for his change in mental status.
His toxic screen was found to be negative.
The patient was found to have a left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray at an outside hospital.
Repeat chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 69**] showed a right sided collapse.
Bronchoscopy was done and showed thick, purulent secretions in the right main stem bronchus.
Gram stain from these samples showed 4+ gram negative rods.
Culture grew out moderate coagulase positive staph.
Blood cultures were drawn.
Repeat chest x-ray showed interval improvement in his lungs.
Immediately following extubation, the patient had snoring respirations but initial arterial blood gases showed good oxygenation and ventilation.
Echo showed no valve abnormalities.
Patient with blood pressures up to 210/118 during his admission.
The patient will need to follow-up with a cardiologist for the severe left ventricular outflow obstruction found on echo during this admission.
