His recent admission was notable for ongoing difficulties with hypotension in the setting of significant volume overload.
Work-up demonstrated evidence of an infiltrative process in his heart, and fat pad biopsy was consistent with amyloid.
He also underwent heart catheterization, which demonstrated inappropriately low systemic vascular resistance, and he was felt to have autonomic dysfunction resulting in inappropriate vasodilation.
At rehab today, his labwork revealed renal failure with Cr of 4.1 (up from 2.6 on discharge) and K+ of 5.3.
His blood pressure was noted to be 64/42.
He was therefore sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Labs were significant for Cr of 4.2.
CXR showed large b/l effusions (ED read).

CXR ([**2120-2-22**]): In comparison with study of [**2-21**], there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC.
Urine output, furthermore, decreased and on the first hospital day he became anuric, likely from renal amyloidosis.
On the second hospital day, the palliative care service was consulted and it was decided to continue the vasopressin as long as he remained interactive and conscious, but to otherwise withdraw all unnecessary treatments, including close monitoring of urine output and blood pressure.
Blood pressure also continued to fall despite maximum dose of vasopressin.
