At this point at the third portion of the duodenum, there is pronounced bowel wall thickening which extends to the decompressed proximal jejunum which also is thick walled; contrast does pass into the more distal small bowel.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been a hysterectomy and apparent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
Pelvic loops of bowel do not contain much oral contrast and evaluation is limited; however, there is apparent wall thickening of the rectum and sigmoid.
Evaluation of the bowel is limited by decompression and lack of oral contrast; consider direct visualization.
Linear opacity overlying the mid portion of a vertebral body in the expected location the third portion of the duodenum was seen under fluoroscopic evaluation to be associated with the vertebral body rather than the overlying bowel.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 64%.
Her hematocrit was stable.

She underwent a PMIBI on [**6-2**] which revealed a partially reversible inferior wall defect with EF of 64%.
