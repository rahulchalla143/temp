What is new is her tremor (but per patient, she had this one time in the past wher her blood cell count was low).

[**2197-10-20**] - CXR (portable): In comparison with the study of [**10-18**], there is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Comparison is made with prior study from [**10-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: (This is a 65 year old female with PMH significant for multiple drug resistant PNAs, asthma/COPD s/p multiple intubations on 2.5L of home O2, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, morbid obesity, OSA (not compliant with CPAP), aortic stenosis with valve area of [**2-3**].2 cm2), atrial fibrillation off Coumadin due to GI bleed, and HTN presenting with worsening cough over the last 4-5 days, worsening shortness of breath, and new greenish sputum production consistent with PNA.)
Her O2 Sat was found to be in the upper 90s on 4 L, which was subsequently dialed down to 3L, and she was in the upper 80s-low 90s on 3L.
ABG was obtained showing severe CO2 retention (pCO2 130) that was initially thought to be venous, but confirmed by repeat ABG.
Upon transfer from MICU ([**2197-10-28**]), her O2 sats were maintained in the low 90s to promote increased ventilation, and her ABG was 7.42/69/81/46.
Her initial weight in hospitalization was 147.87 kgs on [**2197-10-19**].
Her weight on [**2197-10-29**] was 119 kg.
No echocardiogram was done during this admission; however it may be helpful to obtain another one to assess LVEF with improved fluid status.
Her fluid status should be monitored closely by daily weight or strict In's and Out's, and diuretic dosage and be adjusted accordingly.
She will need to have her electrolytes checked daily for the next several days and repleted prn.
However, her sputum culture remained negative or contaminated throughout her stay.
Tm was ~100.
Per patient she had a PFT done in the beginning of this year but not at the [**Hospital1 **].
