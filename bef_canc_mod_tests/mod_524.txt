Sensory exam on legs "LT intact," and proprioception exam spotty due to language barrier DTRs: symmetric and normal throughout, with bilaterally upgoing toes, although this was not later reproducible.

The appearance of the left cerebellar lesion described on CT of the same day is consistent with a recent infarct within the left superior cerebellar artery territory.
CT BRAIN: "IMPRESSION: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CAROTID STUDIES: Official read pending; prelim, L ICA 40-59%; L int carotid <40%; L vert thin with "pre-subclavian steal"  MRI/MRA on the day of discharge ([**11-9**]) Comparison is made to the prior MRI of [**2164-11-6**] and a CT scan of [**2164-11-7**].
MRI of the brain reveals no change in the extent of left cerebellar infarction and no new findings.
The head of his bed was kept down for the first twenty-four hours to maximize cerebral bloodflow and minimize symptoms, and his blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate.
Blood pressure will be monitored carefully.
An echo was unrevealing as a source of emboli, with no wall motion abnormalities, and in fact, hyperkinetic with an EF of 75%.
On telemetry, he was generally regular, but after a brief run of apparent SVT lasting 4-5 seconds, an EKG was performed that was completely unchanged from prior (inferior and anterior Q's and TWIs in lateral leads); lytes were normal.
For his history of a heart attack in the past, he is on a beta blocker, aspirin, and additionally, for improved blood pressure control, a low-dose ace inhibitor was added (Lisinopril 5mg).
His examination at discharge was notable for being more awake; he walked with difficulty with his daughters and gait was quite ataxic.
Truncal ataxia was still present, and finger-nose-finger tasks were still more abnormal on the left than the right.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Cerebellar Infarction Acute Cerebellar Infarction   Discharge Condition: Stable neurological exam, some mild improvement but not at baseline.
Please check LFTs within one month (at rehab or at hm) now that patient is on lipitor.
