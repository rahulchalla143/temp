His hematocrit was checked every 8 hours and were stable, an additional unit was transfused in the MICU.
Colonoscopy on [**2152-12-4**] showed blood throughout colon with diverticulosis and blood at terminal ileum with ?
Mr. [**Known lastname 94074**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] underwent CTA and tagged RBC scan w/o ability to identify the bleed.
He received an additional 2 units pRBCs and his HCT stabilized for 48 hours prior to discharge.
Should he have another episode of massive bleeding, a repeat CT angiogram, conventional angiogram could be considered for localized embolization goal.

Transitional issues: - HCT monitoring and possibly intermittent transfusions of hemorrhage is slow - BP and HR monitoring - Fluid management - Renal function follow up.
