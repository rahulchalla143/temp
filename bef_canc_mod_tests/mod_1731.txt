Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with mild diffuse, slightly sluggish flow but no angiographically apparent coronary disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated left-sided filling pressure (LVEDP 17 mmHg).
* ECHO ([**2150-7-14**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
* ECHO ([**2150-7-16**]): 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2150-7-14**], left ventricular systolic function has improved.
EKG showed diffuse ST elevations and there was concern for ST elevation MI.
ECHO done in ED showed depressed LVEF (30%).
The patient was brought for cardiac cath and found to have patent coronaries.
Her lytes were monitored q2h initially.
Her potassium and phosphate were aggressively repleated.
Her finger sticks were controlled within the range of 100-200 on the day of discharge.
She was taken for immediate cardiac catheterization which showed patent coronaries.
A cardiac echo was done initially in the ED which showed LVEF of 30%, however, no pericardial effusion.
* 3) CHF: The first ECHO done on Ms. [**Known lastname 111059**] showed an EF of 30%.
* 5) HIGH WBC: The patient's WBC count on admission was very high at 34.9.
Her WBC count trended down to 6 by the time of discharge.
Her free T4 and total T3 were both normal.
