In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, T 102, HR 112, BP 144/63, R 27, O2 sat 92% 5L.
An ABG initially revealed 7.43/37/76.
A CXR revealed persistent bilateral pleural effusions and RLL atelectasis versus infiltrate.
No h/o IVDU or blood transfusion prior to [**2104**].
Physical Exam: Per initial ICU evaluation: VITALS: T 102, BP 140/80, HR 70s regular, RR 25, Sat 95% on 3L via NC.
In ED, patient subsequently developed increased work of breathing and was intubated, although a repeat blood gas was essentially unchanged.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-12-27**], upright T waves in leads V3-V4.
CXR [**2120-1-10**]: The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
Relevant data in hospital:  [**2120-1-11**] U/S ABDOMEN: A 4-quadrant son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination of the abdomen was performed to evaluate for ascites.
[**2120-1-17**] CXR: AP single view obtained with the patient in semierect position, is analyzed in direct comparison with a previous chest examination dated [**2120-1-11**].
1) Fever: A CXR on admission was suspicious for a RLL infiltrate (atelectasis versus pneumonia), and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Flagyl and Ceftazidime pending culture data.
His urine eventually grew Klebsiella, and sputum cultures revealed GNR.
In light of these results, Vancomycin was D/C'd on [**2120-1-11**], and Cipro was added for double gram negative coverage pending final organism identification and sensitivites.
The sputum culture eventually grew Klebsiella with the same sensitivities as in the urine, and Cipro was D/C'd on [**2120-1-15**].
The patient defervesced on the above antibiotherapy, and plan is to complete a 14-day course of Imipenem monotherapy (last doses on [**2120-1-25**]).
Also of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] has sacral and heel pressure ulcers, which will need to be followed up.
As noted above, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 111045**] was intubated shortly after admission, and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
A CXR on [**2120-1-11**] was consistent with mild CHF, and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was gently diuresed while on the floor with Lasix 20 mg IV prn with goal negative 500cc/day, with good response.
Both Metoprolol and Captopril were titrated up, with improved blood pressure control, although systolic blood pressure remains elevated at discharge (130-160).
Tacrolimus levels therapeutic (5.6 on [**2120-1-17**]) and LFT WNL during hospital course.
8) FEN: While in the ICU, a bedside swallowing evaluation and video swallowing revealed aspiration with thin liquids but adequate swallowing with pureed foods/nectar-thick liquids consistency.
A caloric count was performed while in hospital, which revealed sub-optimal caloric intake.
