In [**10-17**] patient had an ETT MIBI which showed partially reversible defects in the area of the PDA and LAD, new since [**2099**].
EF was 35-45%.
Patient presented for elective cath which showed normal coronaries but the following pressures:  RA 32/RV 64/21 PA 72/32, wedge 35.
PA sat 46%.
Of note, INR was 1.8, and there was significant oozing from groin post sheath pull.
Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) s/p open prostatectomy secondary to BPH [**2097**] 3) s/p hernia repair 4) s/p hydrocele repair  Social History: Married.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
Right sided pressures were severely elevated (mean RA pressure was 33 mm Hg and RVEDP was 32 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were severely elevated (PA pressure was 70/28 mm Hg).
Left sided pressures were severely elevated (mean PCW pressure was 34 mm Hg and LVEDP was 36 mm Hg).
Central arterial  pressure was mildly elevated (aortic pressure was 144/95 mm Hg).
Cardiac index was low (at 1.6 L/min/m2).
Left ventriculography was not performed secondary to markedly elevated filling pressures and two recent determinations of ejection fraction.
CT ABDOMEN [**2104-2-5**]: FINDINGS: CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a small right sided pleural effusion which is low in density.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear otherwise unremarkable in contour on this noncontrast examination.
CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a small amount of fluid layering within the pelvis, and between multiple pelvic loops of bowel.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
1) CHF: Cardiac echo showed EF of 30-35% with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis and right ventricular hypokinesis consistent with non ischemic cardiomyopathy (cath was normal).
2) Cardiac catherization showed normal coronary arteries.
Hematocrit was stable.
