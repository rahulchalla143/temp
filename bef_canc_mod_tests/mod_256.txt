CT head w/o contrast [**8-8**]: Evolution with encephalomalacia due to a prior left ACA infarction, without evidence of hemorrhage or new infarction.
EEG [**2153-8-9**]: This is an abnormal waking EEG because of frequent intermittent left temporal slowing with moderate amplitude polymorphic delta and theta.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to ventricular interaction, with a pressure/volume overloaded right ventricle.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-7-25**], the apparent pulmonary artery systolic pressure is significantly increased.
CXR [**8-9**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Lactate was elevated at 3.1.
However, she did not meet SIRS criteria and WBC normal at 6.9 with normal differential.
Troponin negative x2.
TTE [**2153-8-9**] showed EF 45%, dilated LA, abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure compared to prior.
CT head neg for acute process.
No h/o seizures and no involuntary movements per report; EEG obtained and on prelim read showed no e/o seizure activity.
Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-25**] on amoxicillin for UTI which was changed to ceftriaxone x 5 days for planned 7 day course the following day when urine culture showed resistant proteus, but it is unclear if patient completed the full course of ceftriaxone based on rehab documentation.
Due to concern for resistance given possible inconsistency in ceftriaxone therapy, started treatment with cefepime to which the prior culture was also sensitive.
Repeat urine culture showed only mixed [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] patient switched back to ceftriaxone [**2153-8-10**] with plans for 4 additional days of abx.
Pt noted to have several episodes of HR in 30s in ED which resolved spontaneously.
#CHF: Pt is s/p mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty [**2-/2153**] with recent EF 50% with trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17417**] TR, although presence of acoustic shadowing may have significantly underestimated valvular regurgitation.
TTE [**2153-8-9**] showed EF 45%, dilated LA, abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure compared to prior.
Warfarin intially held, then restarted after CT head neg for bleed.
Transitional Issues: -may need further neurologic work-up -restart warfarin once [**Month (only) 263**] no longer supratherapeutic -consider amiodarone in future once [**Month (only) 263**] therapeutic x1 month  Medications on Admission: 1.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 2.
You had a urinary tract infection, you were dehydrated, and it was possible that you had low heart rate during this episode.
After given intravenous fluids and a single unit of red blood cells, your blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.
A head CT was done to ensure that there was no extension of stroke and an EEG was done - revealing no seizures.
