He now returns with findings of eleveated Alk Phos at rehab at 650, AST 30 and ALT 80.

Hepatic vasculature was patent with normal flow and resistive indices.
On [**1-22**] a cholangiogram was done to assess for ductal dilatation and assess the vasculature.
Blood cultures grew Klebsiella oxytoca and VRE (enterococcus facium).
He was treated for a total of 12 days of dapto ([**Date range (1) 81979**]) and meropenum ([**Date range (1) 81980**]).
Subsequent blood cultures on several days were negative.
Biopsy findings demonstrated no intrahepatic duct dilation visualized and no bile leak at the hepaticojejunal anastomosis site.
A biopsy was then performed with features representing indeterminate to mild acute cellular rejection.
Prograf levels increased to 15-16 and as high as 18.
On [**1-28**], an MRCP was performed to assess for biliary obstruction or leak.
On [**2-3**], a cholangiogram was done showing no obvious dilation of intrahepatic ducts and possible stricture at lower common bile duct close to the anastomosis site with the contrast flowing freely down to the small bowel.
This was felt to be related to the prograf, but thyroid function studies and a MRI of the head were done to assess his cerebellum.
His CSF profile [**12-8**] was normal, with no evidence of inflammation or pleiocytosis.
He had CSF PCR negative at that time for HSV/EBV/CMV/[**Male First Name (un) 2326**]/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] there was no need to repeat a spinal tap.
HCV viral load was undetectable.
A repeat MRI brain WITHOUT CONTRAST (as lesions did not enhance and given risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis/Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy)was recommended in 3 months to re-evaluate for evolution of these lesions.
With adjustment of prograf, the trough levels decreased to 10 and the tremors diminished.
Vital signs were stable and he remained afebrile.
Twice weekly labs should be drawn for cbc, chem 10, LFTs and trough prograf level with results called to [**Hospital1 18**] Transplant Office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].
