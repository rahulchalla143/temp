Healthcare Associated Pneumonia - Mr. [**Known lastname 26237**] was found to have right lower lobe consolidations on CXR upon admission.
Bacteremia- Contaminant:  patient's blood cultures from addmision grew out GPC in clusters in [**2-15**] bottles this was felt to likely be contaminent, since no other blood cultures returned positive.
A transthoracic ECHO was obtained which did not show evidence of vegetations.
Survailence cultures were sent which were negative.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 1.5, up from baseline 1.0-1.1, likely in setting volume depletion.
