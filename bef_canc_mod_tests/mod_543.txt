Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-4**], findings are similar.
Urinalysis was negative.
Surveillance cultures were negative after [**2159-2-25**].
TTE was negative for vegetations, although could not be definitively ruled out.
Some surveillance cultures were not yet finalized on the day of discharge, and the results will be followed up as an outpatient.
#  CHF: ECHO performed during this admission (to rule out vegetations) showed no changes from previous, EF > 55% but with LVH.
