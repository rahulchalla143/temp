HR 120s, SBP 120.
CXR was done which was wnl.
WBC 22.
CT head was done given h/o hydrocephalus and new onset vomiting.
CT was concerning for enlarged 3rd ventricle thus neurosurgery evaluated pt and felt unlikely to represent signficant change.
CT Abd/Pelvis done which showed bibasilar opacities c/w aspiration pneumonia.
BP remained stable however was tachycardic to 120s persistantly despite fluids.
Of note, all c.diff toxin cultures from [**Month (only) **] were negative.

Poorly defined areas of hypodensity in the left kidney are new from a prior study from [**2188**] and raise concern for infectious or ischemic process.
CT Head ([**8-18**]): Continued evolution of blood products of left MCA territory infarction.
Renal U/S ([**8-19**]): IMPRESSION: No definite son[**Name (NI) 493**] correlates identified for bilateral renal hypodensities seen on previous CT, with no solid masses identified.
The nephrographic abnormalities on recent CT are suspicious for infectious or ischemic process and their lack of visualization may relate to limitations of this study.
CXR ([**8-21**]): FINDINGS: Comparison with study of [**8-20**], there are lower lung volumes.
He had sputum cultures sent, which grew MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia.
His blood pressure and heart rate normalized with volume resuscitation, and his TLC was d/c'd once PICC access was obtained with IR assistance.
His EKG showed stable LVH and new TWI in the anteroseptal leads.
This is nonspecific, but due to the possibility of ischemia, cardiac markers were checked and were not elevated when compared to his baseline.
# N/V CT showed no acute abdominal pathology.
Neurosurgery was consulted initially for concern of worsening ICP in a patient with a VP shunt, but felt his head CT was not suggestive of this.
Urine growing Proteus, ESBL Klebsiella, both sensitive to meropenem.
No coffee grounds were noted since the ED, and his stool was guaiac negative x2.
He received 35 units glargine qhs due to initial decreased enteral intake, but this was increased to 60 units glargine qhs at discharge as he is at goal with TFs and having glucose levels upper 200s, lower 300s.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Lantus 100 unit/mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: Seventy-eight (78) units Subcutaneous at bedtime.
Insulin Glargine 100 unit/mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: Sixty (60) units Subcutaneous at bedtime: plus sliding scale, see attached.
Your blood pressure was initially low, which improved with fluids.
We also gave you 2 units of blood because your red blood cell level was low.
