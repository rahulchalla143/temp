He underwent b/l thoracentesis, which showed transudative effusion.
Vitals there at 1 pm were: T 98, BP 124/60, P 80, RR 20, SaO2 95 RA.
Prelim read on Head CT showed slight decrease in extent of SDH; however, there was e/o some acute bleed.
Once he arrived on neurology wards, he was noted to be tachypneic (RR 30s), 02 sat on 2L ~60% (per neuro resident).
ABG was 7.34/39/205.
CXR was relatively unchanged from that done in [**Name (NI) **].
Pt transferred to MICU for further eval & tx.
Labs showed increase in trop from below assay to 0.36, though ck not elevated.
Pt developed anion gap acidosis, lactate 1.8.
WBC rising 10-->17.8.

Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.9 F BP 138/56 P 89 RR 28 SaO2 100% on NRB General: thin elderly man, sl uncomfortable appearing laying in bed HEENT: left-sided healing craniotomy scar, sclerae anicteric, dry MM, with thrush seen on roof of mouth Neck: mildly limited passive ROM, but no nuchal rigidity, no bruits Lungs: occcasional wheezes with cough, decreased breath sounds at bases CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: cool dry, no significant edema with stockings in place, pedal pulses appreciated Skin: no rashes .
Neurologic Examination (per neuro note--agree w/ exam): Mental Status: Sleepy, inattentive, can occasionally respond appropriately to some basic questions, though it is very difficult to understand, given severe dysarthria, language is non-fluent and dysarthric, following some commands appropriately cooperative with exam when able, but appears to be neglecting right side of space Cranial Nerves: Optic disc margins sharp; may have homonymous hemianopsia on right side of space, though difficult to tell.
- Repeat ECG peri-resp distress: likely afib; more pronounced TWI in V3-6, and inferior leads.
CT head, non-contrast: No evidence of ischemia although MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
ECHO [**8-11**] Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-3**], RV size is now normal and RV systolic function remains normal.

Successful placement of 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 9835**] GJ tube.
Aspiration was mostly silent, however, reflexive coughing did occur consistently with penetration intermittently with aspiration.
However, CTA was negative for PE.
Has remained on RA throughout MICU stay O2 sats >95%.
# Cardiac ischemia: Troponin haD risen from below assay to 0.36, w/o bump in CK.
EKG w/ some increase in ST-depression & T-wave inversions in precordial (V3-6) & inferior leads.
These EKG findings may be due to non-ischemic changes, possibly cerebral T waves or post-pacing repolarization changes.
Repeat ECHO was done with EF unchanged, Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-3**], RV size is now normal and RV systolic function remains normal.
EEG was done and per neuro did not show seizure activity.
# Subdural Hematoma: repeat CT following respiratory event stable from admission CT. Pt has e/o of stable hematoma, pt denies HA, visual changes, interactive and following commands appropriately.
He was continued on BB & ACE-I, BP goal 120-160.
He is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] as scheduled with repeat Head CT. .
His Casodex was reportedly stopped b/c it was thought to be possible cause.
His FS were followed closely on the floor and were not elevated.
His ISS was discontinued and his FS were within normal limits while on tube feeds.
