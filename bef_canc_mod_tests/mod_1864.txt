A duplex of the carotids was obtained on [**2137-5-29**], which showed significant plaque of 80 to 99% in the left.
A stenosis of 40 to 59% was identified in the right.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 110 to 120 over 50 to 53; heart rate 45 to 50; saturation 99% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 7.9, hemoglobin 11.2, hematocrit 31.6, MCV 87, MCH 30.9, MCHC 35.5, platelets 177.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 29, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7.
All blood pressure medications were held with a target blood pressure goal of 120 to 170.
The patient required a Neo-synephrine drip to maintain her blood pressure near 120.
When this was done, her systolic blood pressures would drop to around 100.
The patient's blood pressure once weaned off the drip remained between 110 and 115.
Possible sleep apnea:  When asleep, the patient has episodes when she pauses in her breathing and her saturations drop.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2137-7-19**], for a blood pressure check.
