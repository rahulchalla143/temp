[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.2 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.1 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.5 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.5 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.1 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 2.3 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.44 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 60% to 65% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.7 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.8 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.89 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 368 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 19 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images not available) of [**2134-6-29**].
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2134-6-29**], there is no significant change.
EXAMINATION: CT of the chest with and without contrast dated [**2136-1-13**].
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen dated [**2136-1-12**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was obtained through the chest before and after the administration of IV contrast.
FINDINGS FOR CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta and great vessels.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are demonstrated which are numerous but not enlarged by CT criteria.
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen demonstrates evidence of splenectomy with small fluid collection in the left upper quadrant measuring 3 cm which contains gas consistent with post-surgical changes.
Limited evaluation of post-surgical changes in the left upper quadrant as seen on prior CT abdomen and pelvis.
Reason: S/P RECENT SURGERY NOW TACHYPNEIC EVAL FOR PE  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 7.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MAA ([**2136-1-12**]); 44.0 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol ([**2136-1-12**]); HISTORY: S/P RECENT SURGERY NOW TACHYPNEIC EVAL FOR PE  INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate marked central clumping consistent with airways disease.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show multiple large peripheral wedge-shaped defects in the right lung.
Perfusion irregularity of the left lung is much less pronounced than the right.
Chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe opacity.
He underwent a lung scan which revealed moderate to high probability of pulmonary embolus.
CTA of the chest was done following the lung scan which revealed a thrombus in the right pulmonary artery.
On HD #5 he experienced episode of increased shortness of breath and chest pressure after performing morning ADL's; EKG and CXR were all normal; his CK and troponin were flat.
He again experienced a similar episode on HD #7, EKG without change compared to previous one; chest radiograph performed and pending at time of this dictation.
His supplemental oxygen was discontinued at that time as his room air saturations were 95%.
His hematocrits were as follows:  [**2136-1-20**] 01:20AM          32.6* [**2136-1-19**] 09:00PM          34.6* [**2136-1-19**] 07:14PM          32.6* [**2136-1-19**] 09:30AM          33.5* A GI consult was obtained and recommendations for scoping were made.
Polyp in the 25 cm Polyp in the 30 cm Otherwise normal colonoscopy to anastomosis Recommendations: Pt will need a repeat colonscopy once he is off his coumadin Monitor hct   Physical therapy was consulted and have recommended rehab stay following his acute hospitalization.
His HCt has remained stable and he is discharged in stable condition to rehab to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] of gastroenterology.
He will remain on lovenox until his INR is at a therapeutic range of [**1-7**] at which point the lovenox will be stopped and he will be continued on coumadin only for anticoagulation.
