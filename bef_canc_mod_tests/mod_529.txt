The patient was admitted for further vascular evaluation and treatment.
Blood pressure rechecked was 166/58.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC with a white count of 19.2, hematocrit 40.9, differential with polys of 74, lymphs 17, no bands; electrolytes with a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.0, potassium 4.9, glucose 129.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm with inverted Ts in II, III, and AVF.

Other studies included an arteriogram which showed extensive infrarenal aortic disease, left common iliac occluded, left internal iliac reconstructed by right collaterals from the external iliac, left common femoral profunda with multifocal SFA disease proximally, distal SFA and popliteal were patent, there was disease of the tibial, proximal posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, the left AT is in major runoff vessel but diseased proximally and mid portions.
A MIBI stress test on [**3-17**] showed no wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction was calculated at 54%.
