ECHO ([**3-25**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The LV ejection fraction (approximately 40 percent) appears mildly-to-moderately depressed secondaey to inferior posterior hypokinesis (basal segments akinetic).
The left ventricular pre-ejection delay (110 msec) and the interventricular ejection delay (30-40 msec) are now normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-2-26**], the left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume are increased.
Chest X-ray ([**3-25**]): Since [**3-17**], the right axillary pacemaker has been changed or revised.
AS: Pt with valve area of 0.7 and mean gradient of 20 on echo a few days prior to admission.
recent cath showed the native 3VD.
Despite lingering swelling in your legs, your lungs are clear and your blood pressure is improved.
