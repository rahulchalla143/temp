unchanged from prior EKG dated [**2174-7-28**].
CXR ([**2174-10-9**]): Early left lower lobe bronchopneumonia.
CXR ([**2174-10-14**]): Interstitial infiltrative abnormality, most pronounced in the lower lungs accompanied by probable small right pleural effusion has worsened since [**10-11**], probably pulmonary edema.
CXR ([**2174-10-16**]): Persistent bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2174-10-17**]): 1.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-10-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
At that time, CXR showed a new left lower lobe opacity that was consistent with early bronchopneumonia.
In light of this respiratory distress, CXR finding, and fever of unknown source the patient was started on empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia.
CXR at that time showed resolution of the LLL opacity and some increased interstitial markings felt to be pulmonary edema.
CXR showed a new RLL opacity c/w pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
Per their recommendations, a CT Chest was performed to better evaluate her pulmonary status.
CT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions which was consistent with pulmonary edema and some haziness in the RLL suggestive of a pneumonia.
The patient will also need a follow-up CAT scan in approximately 6-8 weeks.
Her fingersticks were initially as low as the 20s and the patient was asymptomatic.
Her glucose levels during this time ranged from 80-160.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with Aspirin and Verapamil for blood pressure control.
In the context of this new O2 requirement, suspicion for pulmonary edema, and recent NSTEMI, the patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed good cardiac function (EF = 55%) with  prominent and more severe mitral regurgitation (from previous study on [**2174-9-7**])and inferior and anteroinferal systolic wall motion.
The patient was instead started and uptitrated on verapamil with excellent control of her blood pressures.
This was evaluated with a chest x-ray and a chest CT scan which showed that you may have a pneumonia as well as pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs).
7)You will also need a repeat CAT scan of your chest to see if the fluid has resolved.
