Echo [**10-19**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size are normal.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**10-20**] Hip Film: AP film of the pelvis plus two added views of the left hip and proximal left femur.
# Grp B strep septicemia: this was felt to be likely due to GU source given active urinalysis, though urine cx negative.
A TTE negative was negative for any vegetations adherent to the patients valves or pacer wires.
Of note, a Left hip plain film and LLE u/s to r/o fluid collection showed no significant findings.
The longer course was recommended by ID as the exact source of the bacteremia was unclear and endocarditis was not fully ruled out.
Of note, repeat Echo during this admission showed an EF of 25% with (worsening) 2+ MR.  His amlodipine and long-acting nitrate were discontinued during this admission d/t hypotension.
At this time, CT head/ABG/ECG/Fingerstick/CXR were all unrevealing.
CXR from the day earlier did not show over CHF but did show small (B) effusions.
Given the patient's immoblitiy, a CT scan was ordered which did not show a PE, but only RLL atelectasis and evidence of emphysema.
Upon discharge, the patient was started on a Flovent Inhaler along with Atrovent given the CT findings.
