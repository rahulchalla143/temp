Her hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was first discovered approximately 2.5 years prior to admission during a preoperative evaluation for her pancreatic surgery.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with a resting gradient of 90.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.6.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 96.0, blood pressure of 154/65, heart rate of 51, respiratory rate of 17, and oxygen saturation 98% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Physical exam is notable for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
The remainder of her examination was normal.
LABORATORIES:  Notable for a creatinine of 1.6.
The second septal perforator was ablated and her gradient decreased from 90 to 5-10 mm Hg.
For blood pressure control, the patient received metoprolol and captopril.
At the time of discharge, her blood pressures were ranging from 120-140.
An echocardiogram performed following the procedure showed an improvement of her left ventricular outflow tract gradient as well as improvement of the severity of her mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a brief episode of delirium following the procedure, which was resolving by the time of discharge.
Her creatinine also slightly elevated from 1.6 to 1.9 that remained stable and was felt to be within her normal range.
She is also due to be scheduled for an outpatient MRI of her kidneys looking for renal artery stenosis.
