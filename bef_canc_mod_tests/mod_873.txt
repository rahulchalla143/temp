He initially went to an OSH, where CT head was negative.
He was hypotensive at OSH to SBP 80s, started on peripheral dopamine and sent to the ED.
His exam was notable for [**3-11**] murmur, benign abdomen, rectal was guaiac neg.
EKG was not felt to be markedly changed from baseline.
There was some concern for aortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a CT torso w/o contrast, which was negative for aneurysm.
VS prior to transfer were 79 93/36 on levofed 0.12mcg, 18 99% on 3L.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF 25-30%.
Home BP medications were held, and he was started on levophed with a goal MAP of 55-60.
On admission to the MICU, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his blood pressures.
Repeat Echo showed stable EF of 25-30%, RV free wall hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
Of note, noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitor on patient secondary to severe PVD.
Carotid dopplers showed possible subclavian steal on right, so BP should be monitored on left.
# Coronaries: Upon admission serial EKG showed nonspecific ST changes in the lateral leads, that were initially concerning for ACS.
Cardiac enzymes were trended, showing elevation of troponin to 0.95 with only mild CK elevation in the setting of worsened renal failure (see below) and cardiogenic shock.
Carvedilol dose uptitrated to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] by time of discharge but other anti-hypertensives were held since BP had been so low at presentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevated levels.
Renal was consulted for help with management given his possible need for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.
Renal function was trended daily with creatinine peaking at 6.5.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal and mental status improved through hospital course.
Placed on heparin gtt to cover while INR subtherapeutic.
Warfarin was restarted 2 days prior to D/c and INR climbing but only up to 1.8 on day of D/c so pt administered one sub-cutaneous dose of 80mg enoxaparin on day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of 80mg enoxaparin the next day.
Insulin regimen was adjusted to maintain blood sugars in 100-200.
# Incidental CT findings - noted incidentally on CT A/p.
Large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of appendicitis, enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires outpatient surgical follow-up.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and worsened kidney function.
You initially were sent to the cardiac ICU where medications were used to support your blood pressure.
You had a cat-scan of your abdomen to see if there was something obstructing your kidenys.
You received contrast with this CT and medications after the CT to protect your kineys from the contrast.
Your kidney function has improved and should continue to improve and your blood pressure has come back up so we have restarted some blood pressure medications.
You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on Monday where you will have your INR and electrolytes checked.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Start carvedilol 25mg by mouth twice each day for blood pressure - Increase home furosemide to 80mg by mouth once each day for fluid - Start enoxaparin 80mg sub-cutaneously for 1 day (only take this medication on Saturday, then stop) - Your insulin coverage was changed to NPH 70/30 taking 15 units in the morning and 15 units in the evening with a sliding scale to cover your meal time insulin (see attached sheet) - Continue your home Atorvastatin, warfarin, plavix, aspirin, folic acid - Stop all your other home medications for now until further instructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: stop minoxidil, hydralazine, isosorbide mononitrate, spironolactone, cilostazol, atenolol, benicar, your former sliding scale.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Please make sure to check your blood sugars before each meal and give yourself the additional insulin as instructed by the attached insulin slidding scale.
You will have your INR and electrolytes checked at this visit.
At this appointment you should discuss the findings of your CT scan described below.
** While you were hospitalized, you received a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to make sure there was no damage to your kidneys.
