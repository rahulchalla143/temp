His wife took his temperature and it was 100 (which is high for him).
His sputum has been yellow and increasing in thickness the last few days.
Had a head CT in the ED that was negative at that time.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6, P 67, BP 67/40, R 20 and 93% on RA.
He had a CXR that showed a new R effusion and questionable increased opacity in the RLL, although difficult to tell based on his chronic lung disease.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to chest radiographs since [**2117**], most recently [**6-11**] and [**2122-8-4**]: Since [**2121**], previous small right pleural effusion has decreased and what was probably aspiration or asymmetric edema in the right lower lobe has cleared.
Bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions; improvement of right effusion leading to resolution of right lower lobe collapse; relatively unchanged left effusion.
L1 compression fracture, new from prior study but of indeterminate age.

His CXR on admission was unrevealing for large consolidation, but he does have a new right sided pleural effusion.
Sputum cultures, a urine legionella and blood culture were negative.
His INR must be checked daily at rehab until he is off of levoquin and stable.
# Fever: The patient had a temperature of 100 (baseline 96 degrees usually) on [**8-4**] which was likely secondary to the pneumonia.
Blood cultures were negative.
# Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures were mildly below baseline.
The patient reported that baseline systolic blood pressures were in the 80s at home.
He was given midodrine 5mg to improve his pressure (given at 8am, 2pm and 6pm).
An xray of his shoulder revealed a small lucency at glenoid.
A CT of the left shoulder was ordered for further evaluation of the glenoid prior to discharge and revealed a non-displaced glenoid fx that should be followed in 4 weeks.
# s/p fall: CT of his neck and head was negative for acute fracture or bleed.
Blood sugars were in the 200s throughout the day but sometimes were low during the morning.
His lantus was decreased today to 16U with breakfast because of FS of 78 this morning.

Based on our exam and chest x-ray, we determined that you likely had a pneumonia.
During your stay we also managed your blood sugar and your blood pressure.
You will need to get your INR checked daily at rehab with Coumadin dosing adjusted as needed.
