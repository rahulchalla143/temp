CT scan of the head was reportedly negative.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS - T 95 BP 131/71 P 96 R 12 O2sat 93% ra.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: CT head [**12-13**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
CXR [**2146-12-12**]: No previous images.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a valvular vegetation and to better assess the basis and severity of mitral regurgitation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT torso [**2146-12-16**]: 1.
If the patient is at high risk for lung cancer, followup CT at 6-12 months is recommended.
(If the patient is considered low risk, followup CT at 12 months is recommended).
P-mibi [**2146-12-19**]: no ischemic symptoms or ECG changes.
colonoscopy [**2146-12-15**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon Blood in the colon Ulceration and erythema in the rectum compatible with ischemic colitis Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .

However, cardiac enzymes on admission were negative.
Blood cultures were positive on [**12-13**] and [**12-14**] and he had no further positive blood cultures on surveillance from [**Date range (1) 68705**].
He had a CT torso performed which showed no clear source of infection.
Vancomycin and gentamicin peaks and troughs were monitored to ensure therapeutic dosing and avoid toxic levels.
After blood cultures cleared, patient had a PICC line placed at bedside for outpatient antibiotics.
CVL was discontinued and tip sent for culture which had no growth at the time of discharge.
# acute on chronic systolic heart failure: according to OSH reports, patient in pulmonary edema on presentation and ECHO showed EF 30%.
Here cardiac enzymes were negative and ECHO showed EF>55%.
He had coronary evaluation as below.
If possible, patient would likely benefit from initiation of low dose ace-inhibitor if blood pressures tolerate.
Cardiac enzymes here were negative and patient had no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
As above, ECHO showed preserved EF.
LDL was at goal at <50.
He underwent P-MIBI which showed a large fixed mild intensity perfusion defect in the inferior wall.
He will follow up with his CT surgeon as an outpt and was set up for a new visit in [**Hospital1 1388**] cardiology department for follow up.
Hct remained stable after transfusion.
H pylori Ab was sent which was positive so he was set up to receive triple therapy for treatment.
ABG showed no respiratory acidosis or CO2 retention.
He will need an outpatient sleep study set up by his primary care provider.
# pulmonary nodule: found on CT scan [**12-16**].
He will need a repeat CT scan in 6 months for surveillance .
Outpatient Lab Work Please have the following blood tests checked every 5 days: CBC with diff, Chem-7, LFTs, ESR, CRP, vancomycin trough, gentamicin peak/trough.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 8957**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Mitral valve endocarditis (Amp sensitive Enterococcus, CNSE) - NSTEMI - Systolic heart failure - UGIB secondary to duodenal ulcer; H.pylori positive - Rectal ischemic colitis - Blood loss anemia - Delirium - Right femoral pseudoaneurysm - 7 mm pulmonary nodule  Secondary: - CAD s/p CABG x 4. coronary artery disease - Diabetes mellitus type II - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Obstructive sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: Ambulating with walker and assist.
All surveillance blood cultures negative.
You will need to have a sigmoidoscopy repeated in [**3-13**] weeks as an outpatient.
A CT scan performed during your hospital stay showed a small nodule in your lungs.
This is most likely benign but you will need a repeat CT scan in 6 months for surveillance.
You should ask your primary doctor to refer you to a sleep study once discharged from the hospital.
You can continue to use nasal CPAP at night until your study is performed.
You will need to have blood work performed every 5 days for monitoring while on antibiotics as prescribed.
