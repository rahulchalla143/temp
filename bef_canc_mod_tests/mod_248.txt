He was subsequently transferred to the CCU for PA catheterization and further evaluation of hemodynamics/tailored CHF therapy.
Catheterization [**1-20**] reveals 100% LAD lesion with unsuccessful PTCA attempt, patent D1 and a subtotal D2.
Catheterization [**1-20**] also revealed constrictive physiology with RA approximately equal to PCWP approximately 20 mm Hg.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.8.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate 93, blood pressure 88/60, breathing 18, and satting 97% on room air.
Dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally.
DATA:  Chem-7:  Sodium 117, potassium 4.7, chloride 83, bicarb 25, BUN 60, creatinine 2.0.
Echocardiogram:  [**10-28**] EF 60%, E/A ratio 1.57, no evidence of effusion or constriction, trivial MR.  HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.
Initial Swan numbers revealed the following:  CVP 22, PA 64/33, PCWP 30, CO/CI equals 6.4/2.8, CR 475.
Dopamine was added to increase renal perfusion and enhance diuresis, however, patient became tachycardic and experienced anginal symptoms which resolved upon discontinuing dopamine.
Patient's blood pressure remained stable and given that his heart failure was secondary to diastolic dysfunction, his beta blocker was titrated back on board and increased as tolerated, as it was felt that slowing his heart rate, increasing his filling time would improve his cardiac function.
Urine electrolytes were more consistent with SIADH picture, however, patient was hypervolemic and urine electrolytes can be confounded in the setting of diuretic therapy.
Urinalysis was sent which was negative for any evidence of ATN contributing to his renal disease.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease most likely secondary to longstanding renal failure.
