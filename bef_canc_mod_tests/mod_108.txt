Admission Date:  [**2199-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-6-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right-sided thoracentesis [**5-20**]  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with a PMH of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation [**2199-4-14**], recent STEMI and medical management [**2199-4-17**], and multiple UTIs, now presents with CHF, fevers, and altered mental status.
A UA was checked and was suspicious for a UTI, so she was started on levofloxacin.
She continued to be delirious and confused, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
She was also noted to have elevated fingersticks on [**2199-5-18**], with a FS of 470 (she is NOT a diabetic).
In the ED, her VS were noted to be T 102.4, HR 100s, BP 138/82, RR 28, sats 100% on NRB, 89-91% on RA.
She was given 500cc NS in ER, then 40mg IV lasix (once her CXR returned).
CT head was performed and showed resolution of her SDH.
Given that her D-dimer was elevated, a CTA was performed and was negative for PE, but did show a large R sided pleural effusion and left atrial clot.
She was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring of her respiratory and mental status.
Past Medical History: # SDH s/p burr hole on [**2199-4-14**] - SDH dx [**2199-3-26**] after fallx2 (on coumadin for afib) - had 6mm MLS to the right - started on dilantin - dx w/ pneumonia, treated w/ Augmentin - readmitted [**4-6**] for worsening mental status changes - rpt head CT showed worsening MLS, increased edema - given ciprofloxacin for UTI - underwent burr hole evacuation on [**2199-4-14**] # STEMI s/p vfib arrest - had witnessed CP -> cardiac arrest at rehab on [**4-17**] (was vfib)  - shocked x6, lidocaine bolus, then lidocaine gtt -> NSR - then went into afib, amio bolus and then amio gtt - was intubated for airway protection - ECHO on [**2199-4-18**] showed EF 30-40%, with severe HK of inferior, posterior, and lateral walls; RV function also depressed - ?
diastolic as ECHO in '[**98**] showed EF 60% # atrial fibrillation # ventral hernia # multinodular goiter # diverticulitis - s/p fistula between bowel/bladder -> surgically corrected # h/o MRSA in abdominal wound in [**2192-2-10**], nares negative in [**5-14**]  # HTN # s/p hemangioblastoma at C5/6 level with cord compression [**2-15**] bleed - s/p neurosurgical decompression on [**2193-6-6**] - has residual L-sided weakness and neuropathy # macular degeneration # h/o CVA (?)
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Tm 102.4 in ED, Tc 97.7, BP 130/72 (102-130/55-72), HR 97 (97-109), RR 24 (19-24), O2 sats 100% on 13L flow/50% FiO2 GEN: Disoriented, but redirectable.
RESP: Dull to percussion [**1-15**] way up on R, with decreased BS.
Pulses dopplerable bilaterally at PT; palpable 2+ radial bilaterally.
IMAGING: ECHO [**2199-4-18**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed (apical half of free wall).
TTE [**2199-5-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-18**], findings are similar.
LV ejection fraction may have been underestimated in the prior study.
CXR [**2199-5-19**]: Low lung volumes.
Stable appearance of the right upper mediastinal mass, better seen on recent CT and likely represents substernal goiter.
CTA [**2199-5-19**]: 1.
Alternative explanation includes a CT reverberation artifact that can be seen with patients in atrial fibrillation.
CT head [**2199-5-19**]: Limited study due to patient motion.
# Hypoxia:  Admission CXR revealed effusions and pulmonary edema.
Repeated CXRs revealed stable b/l pleural effusions (R>L) with amount of pulmonary edema varying with diuresis vs. fluid administration; there were no infiltrates.
Additionally, now has systolic dysfxn with EF 45% post STEMI.
Repeat CT head did not reveal rebleed in the setting of anticoagulation.
ABG did reveal hypercapnea with pCO2 in the 60-70 range, however family wishes were not to intubate nor transfer to the ICU for noninvasive measures such as bipap.
# MRSA bacteremia:  Admission blood cultures showed [**2-17**] MRSA.
She was started on vancomycin and surveillance cultures have shown no MRSA growth since [**5-25**] (at which time [**1-17**] were positive).
The source of her bacteremia is not entirely clear although she has a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] that was seen on CTA chest (although not well visualized on TTE) and this may have been seeded.
Additionally, pleural effusion when tapped was transudative and cultures were negative so as not to evoke this as source of her bacteremia.
Furthermore, CT abd/pelvis/chest did not reveal other sources of possible infection.
As above, in the setting of her bacteremia, there was concern that the clot was likely seeded.
As above, subsequent surveillance cultures have been negative while on vancomycin therapy.
Given her tenuous respiratory status on shovel mask on the floor IVF were intermittently administered while on the floor without significant improvement in urine output nor renal function.
She was admitted on ACEI, but held in MICU [**2-15**] borderline blood pressures.
As above, imaging revealed bilateral pleural effusions (tapped x1 revealing transudate).
# Anemia:  Hematocrit remained lower than previous BL 32-34 (MCV elevated), but stable in the 27-30 range.
CT head negative for rebleed [**5-30**].
Repeat CT [**5-30**] while on anticoagulation showed no change from prior/no acute bleed.
She was maintained on insulin sliding which, but finger sticks and SS coverage were discontinued to maintain patient's comfort.
