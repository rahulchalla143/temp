PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on the General Medicine Service revealed temperature maximum and temperature current 99.1, pulse 86 irregular (running from the 60s to the 80s), blood pressure 123/49 (running from 103 to 120 systolic over 39 to 72 diastolic), respiratory rate at 21.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed the patient's pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular revealed his heart rate was irregularly irregular.
First heart sound and second heart sound were punctuated by a mechanical click.
Abdomen examination revealed the patient was obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds with noted scars.
Neurologic examination was grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission to the General Medicine Service included a white blood cell count of 23.8, hematocrit of 27.3, mean cell volume of 80, platelet count of 194.
The white blood cell differential was 92% polys, 0 bands, 5% lymphocytes, 1.6% monocytes, 0.5% eosinophils, 0.2% basophils.
Chemistries included a sodium of 139, potassium of 4.7, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 25, blood urea nitrogen of 33, creatinine of 1.4, glucose of 89.
Urinalysis was benign.
ALT of 40, AST of 29, albumin of 3.1, alkaline phosphatase 115, amylase 61, total bilirubin of 0.7, magnesium of 2.3.
Sputum culture was colonized with  oropharyngeal flora.
Urine culture was negative.
Blood cultures had no growth.
Arterial blood gas was notable for a pH of 7.38, a PCO2 of 39, PAO2 of 48, bicarbonate of 24, and a base excess of -1.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed bilateral bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, with evidence of small pleural effusions.
No change between the chest x-ray of [**11-6**] and [**11-5**]; consistent with congestive heart failure with dependent pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia.
The patient initially presented with an elevated white blood cell count, but by [**11-8**] the patient's white blood cell count had dropped to 11,000.
The patient's fevers improved over the course of his admission, and the patient was running low-grade fevers by the day of discharge including a temperature of 99.9 on the day prior to discharge.
Repeat chest x-rays revealed improving consolidations over the course of the patient's admission.
during his stay, and his INR remained therapeutic.
On discharge, the patient's INR was 2.5.
His last normal hematocrit was on [**2114-2-16**].
Evaluation was begun during this admission including a workup for iron deficiency anemia with total iron binding capacity, iron, and reticulocyte counts pending, as well as an evaluation of potential dietary deficiency including B12 and folate levels.
Additionally, a haptoglobin was sent and was pending at the time of discharge for some concern of hemolysis given the patient's mechanical heart valves.
These values and the further workup of the patient's anemia should be pursued in the context of his outpatient care.
It should be noted that the patient's hematocrit did fluctuate during his stay, reaching as low as 25.7 before stabilizing and rising modestly to 26.5.
On discharge, the patient's blood urea nitrogen was 15, and creatinine was 0.9.
