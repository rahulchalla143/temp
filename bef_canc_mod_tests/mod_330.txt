The patient awoke on the morning of admission with acute dyspnea and presented to [**Hospital3 **] where his electrocardiogram revealed new lateral ST depressions of 2 mm in V5 through V6 which was initially read as left ventricular hypertrophy with strain, and he had an initial creatine kinase of 40 with a negative troponin, but an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air.
The patient was given Lasix 120 mg intravenously, nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, given 100% nonrebreather, and his oxygen saturation improved to 100%.
At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient had a blood pressure of 130/54, pulse of 72, respiratory rate of 26, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 50% Venturi mask with electrocardiograms that revealed 1-mm ST depressions in V5 through V6.
The patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, and several hours later suffered acute worsening dyspnea with 5/10 chest pain, and diaphoresis, and an electrocardiogram that showed ST depressions in II and F as well as V4 through V5, with a rate of 120, and a blood pressure of 150/90.
He was taken to the catheterization laboratory where he had a pulmonary artery pressure of 62/30 and wedge of 35.
An echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis, left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction that was markedly depressed by not quantified on a recent outside hospital echocardiogram.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a bowel sounds creatinine of 2 to 2.5).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's temperature was 97.4, pulse of 94, blood pressure of 140/69, respiratory rate of 21, 100% on 100% nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light and an oropharynx was that clear and moist.
Neck examination revealed elevated jugular venous pressure to 10 cm of water.
Chest examination revealed crackles up to one-third of the lung fields bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed distant heart sounds, a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination revealed no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds, with a nontender and nondistended abdomen.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 10.5, hematocrit of 25.3, platelets of 195.
The patient's creatinine was 2.5.
The patient's creatine kinase was 39 with a troponin of 0.6.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An echocardiogram status post catheterization revealed the patient had an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, and a normal right ventricle.
The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization four days later, at which point he received stents to his right coronary artery and first obtuse marginal.
From a myocardium standpoint, the patient had a right heart catheterization on presentation which showed elevated left-sided filling pressures with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 37 mmHg.
Subsequent cultures grew only pan-sensitive enterococcus in his urine.
He had a normal white blood cell count at that time and was afebrile.
Over the course of the admission, the patient did not have significant improvement in urinary output averaging about 600 cc per day.
His hematocrit eventually stabilized.
He was transfused with blood products to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30.
He will likely need formal audiologic testing and possible hearing aide.
