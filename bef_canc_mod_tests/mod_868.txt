CT chest showed possible basilar interstitial fibrosis with evidence of pulmonary HTN, and moderate pulmonary HTN estimated on TTE.
As part of his evaluation, patient underwent a bronchoscopy and VATS on [**2152-10-23**] with lung biopsy, pathology revealing moderate-to-severe interstitial fibrosis with honeycomb change and organizing pneumonia.
Chest film showed possible volume overload, and patient was given furosemide 40 mg IV x 1, with good UOP.
ABG was 7.41/35/61 on nasal cannula and shovel mask, but had just been on non-rebreather.
Upon assessment, vitals were significant for BP 170s/100s, and HR in 100s, along with RR 30s and O2 sat 96% on non-rebreather.
Past Medical History: Hepatitis C c/b cirrhosis, HCC, s/p liver transplant [**2146-8-10**]  - most recent liver biopsy [**2151-10-7**] with stage II fibrosis and grade 2 inflammation.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 109/49  HR 90  RR 35  100% on BiPAP, FiO2 100% General: Alert, oriented, moderate respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: diffuse crackles bilaterally Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly.

He was initially treated for community-acquired pneumonia, but his lung biopsy was concerning for UIP with superimposed BOOP vs. acute UIP exacerbation.
On [**10-30**], patient desatted into the 50s on full vent support, FiO2 of 100% PEEP of 10, and had EKG findings consistent with acute ischemic changes.
