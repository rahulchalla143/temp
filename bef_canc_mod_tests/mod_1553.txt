Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the descending colon.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the sigmoid colon.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the rectum.
Impression: Ulceration, granularity, erythema, friability, congestion and exudate in the rectum, proximal sigmoid colon and descending colon compatible with Crohn's disease (biopsy, biopsy, biopsy) Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to descending colon Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results, specifically evaluating for CMV.
Pt overall presenting with crohn's flare with sig volume depletion with hypotension - initially not responsive to IVF - required brief period of levophed in ED - but off once admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
CT a/p done without evid of abscess, flex-sig done [**3-6**] showing sig crohn's dz - bxs taken to eval for CMV.
Also per surgery - needing further cardiac eval - noted brief periods of NSVT on tele - last echo [**11-13**] - getting echo for tomorrow to eval for impaired systolic dysfunction.
Mild improvements - pt will need surgery - decision of timing of this is pending.
