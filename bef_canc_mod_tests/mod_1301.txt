CXR [**8-26**]: No definite pneumothorax or pneumoperitoneum, but this study is limited in semiupright position.
Compared to prior study performed a day earlier, mild intersitial pulmonary edema has almost completely resolved.
CTA [**8-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Active extravasation of contrast in the sigmoid colon, likely related to a diverticular bleed.
An AVM is also possible in this patient with a history of duodenal AVM.

Creatinine stablalized.
He has no MRSA risk factors or past history; therefore empiric vancomycin was not given but his foot should be reassessed daily to monitor for worsening which might suggest need for MRSA coverage.
His BP meds may need further titration at rehab.
