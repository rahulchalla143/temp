Limited angiography of the left carotid artery demonstrated 99% stenosis of the left ICA with fillign of the MCA only.
Angiography of the right brachiocephalic trunk demonstrated 50% right subclavian artery stenosis, patent vertebral artery and 95% long ulcerated, dissected stenosis of the right ICA.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and good flow.
99% left ICA stenosis, 95% right ICA stenosis, and 50% right subclavian stenosis.
