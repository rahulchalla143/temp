Hematocrit was 26.2 on admission (baseline 25-30).
He was initially hypotensive with systolic SBP in the 60s in the ED.
His hematocrit subsequently remained stable at 32-34 for the remainder of his hospital stay.
A colonoscopy and EGD were performed and revealed nonbleeding diverticulosis of the ascending colon and angioectasias in the stomach body at the lesser curvature, respectively.
Stool studies were sent that were negative for an infectious etiology, including salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, vibrio, yersinia, and E.coli 0157:H7.
Given his recent GI bleed, he did not receive NSAIDs for this condition.
A lower extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of a DVT.
Follow-up: joint fluid cultures will need to be followed up as an outpatient.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed to look for sources of the bleed.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed angioectasia in your stomach, a [**Hospital1 **] vessel abnormality, which was considered the most likely source of your bleeding.
An ultrasound of your legs was performed and no clot was identified.
