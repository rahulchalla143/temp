[**2192-4-2**] BLOOD CULTURE negative [**2192-4-8**] Blood culture negative [**2192-4-9**] Blood culture negative .
[**2192-3-31**] EKG 2249: sinus brady 56bpm, low voltage limb leads, no ste, std, twi, QTc 503 (elevated) .
[**2192-3-31**] CT ABD/PELVIS (w/o contrast) - PRELIM 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2192-4-11**] CT chest: 1.
CT of abd/pelvis without pathology, and degree of described diarrhea seemed inconsistent with her degree of hypotension.
Stool cultures were negative and her diarrhea decreased in frequency and amount.
DFA, viral sputum cultures, urine culture, urine legionella, and blood cultures were all negative.
She received ~5L IVF and stabilized to 100-110s, O2 sat improved and she was put back on room air.
CT revealed small ground glass opacities in the RUL concerning for a possible pneumonia.
Urine legionella negative.
She remained in the hospital for one week after this event and her blood pressure remained stable throughout.
Vitals demonstrated systolic BP of 78 and HR 50s-60s.
CT abd/pelvis without evidence of colitis or SBO.
Stool cultures without growth to date.
The patient presented with creatinine of 1.4 (baseline 0.9-1.1) & non gap acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea, bicarbonate loss & NS resuscitation.
Creatinine trended down to baseline with IVF and hyperchloremic acidosis resolved.
Serial enzymes were were levated, with a peak troponin of 1.12 which trended downward.
With fluid resuscitation and resolution of tachycardia, the ischemic changes on her EKG resolved.
Echo was unchanged, with preserved systolic function.
Repeat EKG showed QT in 480s, sinus brady.
Repeat CE demonstrate flat CK but troponin of 0.59.
# Hyperlipidemia: She was not on a statin, however she was recruited to an ED sepsis trial involving statins and was put on the study drug.
Blood pressure cuff blood pressure cuff for home monitoring .
You have been given a prescription for a blood pressure cuff.
Please check your blood pressure every day at the same time of day.
If you note a blood pressure [**Location (un) 1131**] where the top number ("systolic") is less than 90, please re-check.
If you ever feel dizzy or lightheaded, you should also check your blood pressure.
