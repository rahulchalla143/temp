Pain was significant and required dilaudid PCA but patient transitioned to orals nicely.
Was actually counselled to stay and undergo infectious evaluation.
However he was nonfocal (no dysuria, lung symptoms), had an alternative explanation (splenic infarction) and was insistent on discharge.
# Hypothyroidism: home liothyronine and levothyroxine were continued  # Prostate nodule: Seen on CT abd/pelvis, likely hypertrophy.
