In the Emergency Department, found to have evidence of congestive heart failure and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.2 (baseline of 2) and ST depressions in V2 to V4 on electrocardiogram.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery    bypass graft in [**2157**]; status post cardiac catheterization    in [**2168-3-22**] at an outside hospital (no stents    placed).
Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy; baseline creatinine of    2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 97, heart rate was 54, blood pressure was 118/91, breathing at 15, and 90 percent on a nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed jugular venous pressure elevated to the angle of the jaw.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Notable for white count of 10.2, hematocrit was 32.5, and platelets were 161.
INR was 1.1.
Potassium elevated at 5.8, blood urea nitrogen was 95, creatinine was 3.2, glucose was 352.
Creatine kinase elevated at 1030, MB was 15, and troponin was 0.85.
Urinalysis was negative.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed evidence of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema.
An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, normal intervals, T wave inversions in V2 through V4, and ST depressions in V2 through V4.
(b)  Pump:  The patient demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30 percent with multiple wall motion abnormalities.
Upon optimization of cardiac regimen, the    patient's oxygen requirement decreased, and oxygen    saturations were stable on room air.
Initially, diabetic medications    and ACE inhibitor were held; however, creatinine began to    decrease with good diuresis, and ACE inhibitors and    diabetic medications were reinitiated.
His electrolytes    were repleted as needed.
