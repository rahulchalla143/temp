In the Emergency Department, she was found to have a blood pressure of 210/180.
She was placed on a Labetalol drip and her blood pressure decreased to 180/140.
However, when the Labetalol drip was discontinued, her blood pressure went back up to 200/160.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination she was afebrile, 96.8, blood pressure was initially 211/179 which responded to intravenous Labetalol drip, to 188/148, pulse 69, respiratory rate 99 percent on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the fundi are normal bilaterally.
Cardiac examination is regular, no murmurs.
LABORATORY DATA:  For laboratory data she had a white count of 8.3, hematocrit of 37, she had platelets of 56.
She had a chem-7 notable for a creatinine of 7.1.
She had normal liver function tests and an ALT of 34 and AST of 27, amylase of 68, and alkaline phosphatase of 118, total bilirubin was 0.7.
Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly, interstitial and alveolar edema and a small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 65.
The patient was continued on a Labetalol drip in the Intensive Care Unit, however, this was discontinued on [**2174-5-4**], and she was started on her home medications which include her Moexipril 15 b.i.d., her Labetalol 1000 b.i.d., her Clonidine 0.6 b.i.d.
The patient had adequate control of her blood pressure on this home regimen and was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit.
Once her blood pressure was stabilized, she was continued on her home regimen with the noted increase in her calcium channel blocker from 90 to 120 q. day.
She went to hemodialysis on the day of discharge where her blood pressures were adequately maintained in the 120s to 130s.
Over night, on the night prior to discharge, her blood pressures remained adequately controlled with systolic blood pressures in the 130s to 150s.
The patient also received a right upper quadrant ultrasound on the day of discharge for further evaluation of her hepatomegaly in the setting of normal liver function tests.
At that time if her blood pressure remains elevated, increasing her Labetalol should be considered.
Vitamin C 4.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient, again, will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2174-5-10**] for a blood pressure check.
At that time the results of her right upper quadrant ultrasound and her human immunodeficiency virus test should be discussed with the patient.
