On arrival to ED, he was afebrile, and vitals were stable with 97% O2 on 2 L, BP 162/74.
He also had increased SOB, decreased O2 sats to 73% and was more lethargic; abg at that time was - 7.23/101/72 (uncertain FiO2).
CE's were negative x 1, EKG demonstrated old LBBB, and hct was 26 (baseline 30-31).
Initial CXR demonstrated new bilateral nodular opacities, old R pleural effusion, and R 5th rib fracture.
Repeat CXR following onset of symptoms demonstrated complete opacification of the R.Lung field.
A 3rd CXR following tx.
Repeat ABG: 7.34 / 61 / 348.
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mangagement.
Squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right upper lobe lobectomy;  On last hospitalization ([**1-4**]) CT and MRI demonstrated a right skull-base lesion worrisome for metastatic bone dx, but f/u bone scan did not reveal evidence of metastatic dx.
Osteoarthritis 9.

Given the acute onset and resolution of his opacity by CXR and acute reversal of CO2 by ABG, an obstructive process, ie mucus plug, was most likely.
