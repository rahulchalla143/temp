Past Medical History: PMH:  DM2 HTN increase cholesterol CAD MI [**2121**] Renal artery stenosis GERD Lung CA  PSH:  LLL adeno CA with resection Fem-po [**2111**] aortofemoral BPG [**2118**] Cardiac cath with stent x 6   Social History: pos alcohol - occ pos tobacco - quit 10 yrs ago 40 pyh   Family History: Mother deceased 54 - DM Father deceased 58 - accident Sister - CAD/MI/STROKE Daughter - bladder ca  Physical Exam: General: No apparent distress, alert and oriented x3.
Extremities: DP and PT pulses non-palpable.
An ulceration measuring  noted over the  plantar aspect of the  right hallux.
The wound measures 1 x2 cm.
[**2125-2-16**] ART EXT: FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation shows monophasic waveforms diffusely and bilaterally, those at the PT level are absent bilaterally.
ABI measurements could not be obtained on the right due to absent pulses and overlying bandage, on the left, the ABI is 0.45.
[**2125-2-16**] CT chest without contrast: 1.
Cardiac cath [**2125-2-19**]: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
LMCA had a 50% tapering distal lesion that was calcified and unchanged from prior angiogram in [**2123**].
LCX was non-dominant with 50% OM1 lesion.
Left ventriculography showed preserved ejection fraction.
Limited hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated systemic pressures and no aortic valve gradient.
Abdominal aortography showed patent aorto-bifemoral bypass without iunflow lesions.
Repeat CXR was consistent with emphysema, and MDI was started.
Repeat CT of chest without contrast did not show any evidence of recurrent lung cancer.
CAD: As a pre-op clearance, a P-mibi was done and showed severe perfusion defect of the inferior wall which is mildly reversible at the apex and a moderate, reversible defect of the inferolateral wall.
For this abnormal finding, the patient undwernt cath which reveals stable lesions compared to the previous cath in [**2123**] and no intervention was done.
h/o lung adenocarcinoma: CXR showed irregular parenchymal densities in R lung and vague opacity in L para-aortic area.
CT of chest without contrast however did not reveal any evidence of recurrence.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease +/- iron deficiency anemia in the setting of chronic ulcer/osteomyelitis.
The patient was transfused 2 units in the setting of hypoxia and anticipated surgery and hct increased appropriately.
Pt remained on Unasyn while getting cardiac clearance and resolution of hypoxia.
DM: Hypoglycemia of 42 in the setting of change in diet and NPO.
The pt underwent a exploration of right groin, right common and profunda femoris artery endarterectomy and Dacron patch angioplasty.
Replete 'lytes K to 4 and mag to 2. .
