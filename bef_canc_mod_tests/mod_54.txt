Subsequently after intubation the patient's blood pressure decreased and the patient was started on Dopamine and his heart rate increased into the 150s.
The pressures were changed to Neosinephrine with significant decrease in blood pressure without any excessive tachycardia associated with it.
An nasogastric lavage was performed in the Emergency Room, which was significant for coffee ground, which were OB positive.
Mild congestive heart failure with an EF between 40 and 50% and an echocardiogram in 9/98 showing left ventricular hypertrophy and moderate aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation with global decrease in contractility.
Pulse 104.
Blood pressure 112/52.
Respiratory rate 17.
HEENT examination normocephalic, atraumatic.
JVP was difficult to assess, but was not appreciated.
Neurological examination was difficult to perform given that the patient was sedated.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  A white blood cell count of 9.1, hematocrit 30.9, platelets 509, sodium 159, potassium 3.7, chloride 123, bicarb 16, BUN 5, creatinine 1.7, glucose 297, CPK was 132, ABG obtained in the Emergency Room was 7.23 with a CO2 of 47 and a PAO2 of 367.
The patient had a chest x-ray, which showed a right lower lung infiltrate and a questionable mild congestive heart failure and electrocardiogram was obtained, which showed the patient to be in atrial fibrillation at a rate of 123 without any acute changes.
The patient was initially placed on vent settings of assist control with a tidal volume of 700, respirations of 10 and a FI2 of 60%.
Arterial blood gases were sent, which stayed within that range with a resolving respiratory acidosis.
A sputum culture was sent, which was consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Therefore Vancomycin was continued for gram positive coverage, Flagyl was continue for anaerobic coverage, and Ceftriaxone was changed to Levofloxacin for further gram negative and atypical coverage.
A legionella and urinary antigen was checked, which was negative.
Throughout the course of the hospital stay the patient became afebrile and his white count decreased and was within normal limits at the time of discharge.
The patient, however, did not seem to be appropriately improving his right lower lobe pneumonia with serial chest x-rays obtained.
A bronchoscopy was performed by the pulmonary fellow, which did not find any focus of infection or any masses.
The patient's vent settings were weaned slowly and eventually the patient tolerated pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of 5 on FIO2 of .4.
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with a negative troponin and multiple negative CK.
The patient had some decreased urine output during his hospital stay, which was felt to be secondary to prerenal azotemia in the setting of possible sepsis verses decreased cardiac output secondary to heart failure.
The patient initially was stable and cultures were all negative.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures were nonspecific and did not show any source of infection.
However, after stopping the antibiotics the patient dropped his blood pressure with a systolic in the 70s and the patient became febrile with a temperature of 103.7.
The patient's blood pressure has also been stable and it was felt that the patient had a transient sepsis, which was corrected with a fourteen day course of broad spectrum antibiotics.
However, all blood cultures were negative and those were felt to be contaminants.
