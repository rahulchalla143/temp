Cath was apparently deferred [**3-6**] increased creatinine and ?need for CABG.
CK 140, cre 1.2, INR 1.4, BNP 2081. pt noted to have troponin 1.24 (0-0.1 range nl), ?pulmonary edema on CXR.
EKG showed ?lateral TWI per report (on review shows ?STD V2-V5 with TWI).
TTE showed global hypokinesis.
Stress test on [**11-17**] also showed depressed EF.
OSH Labs: [**11-13**] admit labs: chem7 141/5.1 105/25.9 23/1.2 , inr 1.4 tropI 1.0 -> 1.24 / 1.45 / 0.97 / 0.45 ck 10 ([**11-14**]) ck mb 6.62 -> 3.47 .
[**2127-11-19**] Cardiac Cath FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
[**2127-11-25**] Cardiac Cath COMMENTS: 1.
(see PTCA comments) The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolisation.
Hyperinflation indicates severe COPD and diaphragmatic calcification probably due to asbestos exposure.
[**2127-11-17**] CXR (OSH): mild congestive changes cannot be excluded, no definte infiltrates, no pleural effusions.
[**2127-11-13**] EKG (OSH): STD v1, v2, v4, v5.
[**2127-11-14**] TTE - limited study, LV dilated, normal thikcness, globally hypokinetic, EF 15-20%, no segmental WMA.
EF 17%.
[**2127-7-24**] ([**Hospital1 **]) MyoView stress test - dilated LV at rest & stress.
EF 32%.
Stress test from [**7-8**] showed depressed EF (15-30%).
TTE on [**11-17**] showed EF 15-20% with global hypokinesis.
Troponin was 1.24, BNP 2080.
As above, echocardiogram showed an EF 15-20%, bilateral ventricle dilation & hypokinesis, but no significant valvular disease.
Similiarly, the pt was not discharged with lasix as his blood pressure had been low post-cath and he did not seem overloaded.
# anemia - pt noted to have hct 38-41 @ OSH, dropped to 34 after heparin started.
iron studies suggest some component of iron deficiency.
smear and hemolysis labs (ldh, hapto, LFTs) (-).
hct was stable cath.
# NEURO - ?right carotid pulse absent on admission, however carotid doppler shows patent vessel, <40% stenosis.
28/30 on mini-mental status exam (can't count back [**Hospital1 **] from 100 by 7s).
CXR The lungs showed lungs hyperexpanded bilaterally.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
