On [**2160-6-22**] she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with rigors and fever and was found to have 5 cm abscess under the diaphragm on the CT scan.
On [**2160-6-27**] the abscess was drained under the CT guidance and a drain was left in place.
She had a CT scan that morning.
The CT scan showed the intraabdominal abscess still present, however decreased in size.

[**2160-8-8**] IR PICC line Placement  [**2160-8-8**] MRA/MRI Brain MRA IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of the left internal carotid artery in the petrous and cavernous as well as supraclinoid portions indicate occlusion in the neck.
MRI Impression: Diffusion abnormalities are predominantly isointense on ADC map with several small areas of low signal indicating late acute or early subacute infarcts.
[**2160-8-11**] Chest Xray The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid lower SVC, with no evidence of looping seen on the current study as opposite to the prior radiograph.
Prominence of the aortopulmonic window is consistent with lymph nodes seen on the recent CT torso.
Within the limitations of this study, no clear evidence of rib fractures is present but repeated evaluation with dedicated rib views might be considered.
She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn and micafungin was added when peritoneal fluid gram stain showed budding yeast, which ultimately grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
A bronchioalveolar lavage was performed and cultures grew gram negative rods that were resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to meropenem.
Blood and urine cultures were sent with each episode of fever.
She became consistently normotensive on post-op day 3 and began mobilizing her fluids on post-op day 4 and was given small doses of Lasix and then placed on a Lasix drip on post-op day 6 with a goal of [**11-24**] L negative per day.
Her heart rate was controlled with metoprolol IV and hypertension was controlled with increased diuresis.
Also near post-operative day 4 the patient was noted to have some decreased movement on right side while intubated and a CT of the head was obtained which showed: cortical hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region, no significant mass effect or volume loss which appeared to represent a subacute infarction, no encephalomalacic changes in the right occipital lobe, and no intracranial hemorrhage or brain herniation.
Culture grew yeast and coagulase negative staph.
On post-op day 10 she became febrile and a CT abdomen showed LUQ abscess which was drained by CT-guided technique the following day.
Culture from this abscess grew yeast and gram negative rods that were sensitive to meropenem.
An ultrasound of the right upper extremity was obtained which showed a superficial clot in the basilic vein around the PICC line.
On post op day 22 a CT abdomen was obtained to evaluate for improvements of the abdominal collections.
Which appeared to show no new focal collection within the abdomen or pelvis, interval decrease in size of left upper quadrant and right lower quadrant fluid collections, with pigtail percutaneous drainage catheters in place, low attenuation pelvic fluid collection appears similar as before, Improved appearance of lower midline and left hemi abdominal wall wounds as compared to [**2160-7-31**], and interval decrease of bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
On postop day 23 both an MRI/MRA of the head and carotid duplex ultrasound's were obtained as neurology recommended.
Carotid duplex showed apparent left ICA occlusion.
Of note, ultrasound is not 100% accurate in differentiating a very high-grade stenosis from an occlusion.
Cultures were routinely monitored and the patient was continued on intravenous Vancomycin, Meropenem and Micafungin for optimal coverage through the time of discharge and will continue on these medications until approximately one week after her drain is taken out per the recommendations of the infectious disease team.
She will also have repeat imaging as an outpatient to evaluate for resolution of her intra-abdominal abscesses with are believed to be her continuing source of infection.
Her blood glucose levels have been elevated at lunch and covered with sliding scale insulin however, it would be in the patients best interest to have an endocrine consult at the rehabilitation facility for continued monitoring.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw weekly vancomycin trough, BUN/Creatinine, and Liver Function Tests and fax these reaults to the [**Hospital1 18**] infectious disease clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9461**] 2.

If the output is less than 500cc or greater than 1200cc please call the office for advice.
The biggest risk for a new illeostomy is dehydration, please keep yourself well hydrated and monitor yourself for signs of dehyrdation including: dizziness, increased thirst, weakness, low blood pressure.
