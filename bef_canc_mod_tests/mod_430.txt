Then the patient began having chest pain, echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from 45->20% and some apical and septal akinesis.
Cath showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA.
RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg.
RA pressures 25 and PAP 73.
Then transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.

STUDIES: [**2120-7-6**] CT Head w/o contrast- No acute intracranial process [**2120-7-6**] C Spine w/o contrast- No acute fractures or malalignment [**2120-7-6**] CXR Portable AP- Midline sternotomy wires are again noted.
[**2120-7-6**] CT Abd/Pelvis-IMPRESSION: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and apex; the rest of the left ventricle appears hypokinetic with regional variation.
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-5-19**], left ventricular systolic function is significantly further compromised.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel disease in the right dominant system The LMCA had a patent stent with mild in stent restenosis, there was a 30-40% distal LMCA stenosis beyond the distal edge of the LMCA stent which was unchanged from prior.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressure with an RVEDP of 24 mmHg and an LVEDP of 26 mmHg.
There was pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 73/35 mmHg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.55 L/min/m2.
The central aortic pressure was 120/73 mmHg.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA which supplied a diffusely diseased LAD.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
[**2120-7-15**] CT abdomen & pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Persistent bilateral nephrograms, compatible with severe renal failure, as the last contrast-enhanced study was performed on [**2120-7-10**].
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-11**], global left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved.
If there is significant clinical suspicion for intra-abdominal infection, then this area could be further assessed with a CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: 68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs, DM type II, hypertension and depression who presented initially on [**2120-7-7**] with weight gain at home and altered mental status.
Then on [**2120-7-11**], he began having chest pain, and echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from 45->20% with some apical and septal akinesis.
Cath the following day showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA, and RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # [**Date Range 7792**]/Cardiogenic Shock: On [**2120-7-11**] while on medicine service, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negative MB, but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 25% (down from 40-45%).
Cath on [**7-12**] showed 80% ostial stenosis of the RCA, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.
A TTE showed an EF of 20% from baseline of 40-45% in 6/[**2118**].
The patient was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted.
The patient's o2 sats decreased at this time and lactate increased to over 6.
#.Acute on Chronic [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5, on admission 2.2.
However after the drop in his blood pressure and after his cath his Cr continued to rise and he stopped making urine.
#Transaminitis - On transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**] service, patients LFTs had noted to increase to ALT 117, AST 418.
The day following cath, his LFTs sharply rose to ALT 1200 and AST 1059, LDH 1900, TBili 1.9.
Concern was for shock liver vs med effect, Hepatology was consulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec'd to hold atorvastatin, obtain RUQ U/S which showed possibly fatty liver with patent vasculature.
MRI with and without contrast was unremarkable.
Information was obtained from PatientFamily/Caregiver.
