As it was felt he may need surgical intervention, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
He was afebrile with a bp of 82/36 and a hr of 76, satting 100% on 2Lnc.
He was bolused one liter of IVF, resulting in a bp of 92/44 and a resolution of his symptoms.
An initial hct was 27.2, not significantly different than his hct prior transfer.

------------------- Shoulder X-ray for R shoulder Pain: Right shoulder 3 views on [**2170-8-13**]; the superior aspect of the glenoid demonstrates subchondral lucencies.
MRI or CT is recommended for additional evaluation.
Moderate angiographic improvement was noted, as well as reduction of mean pressure gradient from 20 to 10 mm Hg across this stenotic area.
Balloon angioplasty to 10 and 12 mm of the stenosis in the central portion of the right subclavian vein and the right innominate vein stent, with unsatisfactory angiographic and hemodynamic result.
The trans-stenotic mean pressure gradient remains unchanged (approximately 15 mm Hg).
Echo [**2170-8-9**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
His hematocrit remained stable subsequently and he was called out to the floor.
As his CVP was 17, IR was concerned that opening these lesions could lead to excessive venous return and CHF, so an echo was obtained.
