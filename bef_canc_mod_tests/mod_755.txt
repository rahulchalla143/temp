CXR on admission showed frank congestive heart failure.
Her beta blocker, Imdur and ACE inhibitor were held because of hypotension.
Her Lisinopril dose was increased from 2.5 mg to 5 mg po QD for afterload reduction given the patient's severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressures tolerated this increased dose.
Her troponin was mildly elevated on admission likely in the setting of CHF.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and had no events.
Patient with baseline CRI - 1.3-1.5.
Her creatinine was elevated to 1.8 on admission, and had come down to 1.3 by discharge likely secondary to improved forward flow/renal perfusion.
Platelet count came down to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 500 on the day of discharge.
Patient's hematocrit was 44 on admission and dropped to 31.5 on HD #3.
Hemolysis labs were checked and were negative.
Iron studies were suggestive on anemia of chronic disease with low normal serum iron, high ferritin, low TIBC and TRF.
Her HCT was at 29 by discharge which is about her baseline.
WBC normal.
CXR negative for infiltrate.
Thrombocytosis 6.
Chronic renal insufficiency    Discharge Condition: Maintaining oxygen sats in mid 90's on room air.
