STUDIES: CXR [**2178-4-21**]: IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
LUNG SCAN [**2178-4-22**]: IMPRESSION: Normal lung scan.
TTE [**2178-4-23**]: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-30**], the current study is very limited secondary to poor echo windows/patient body habitus and limited data acquisition in the setting of a 'Code Blue' on the patient prior to study termination; cannot compare.
CXR [**2178-4-25**]: FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest compared to multiple prior examinations.
CXR [**2178-4-25**]: LINE PLACEMENT CLINICAL INFORMATION: New right IJ line.
CXR [**2178-4-28**]: FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right IJ catheter ends in the lower SVC, unchanged.
TTE [**2178-5-1**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-4-23**], findings similar but technically suboptimal.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen on suboptimal imaging  .

Patient's exam did not demonstrate overt swelling on the medical floor although she was diffusely tender to palpation.
Hospital course also complicated by fevers, initially attributed to inflammation; however, pt grew MRSA from 1 blood culture and Klebsiella in urine.
Pt's albumin quite low, likely [**3-4**] poor nutritional intake.
CE's were negative, and EKG was sinus rhythm with no ST changes/TWI.
Echo was a limited study, but demonstrated preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
LENIs and V/Q scan were negative.
Hypothyroidism considered, though pt had normal TSH.
Skin exam on discharge greatly improved with no more sloughing, and pt had minimal to no pain.
However, pt had positive blood culture and urine culture as discussed below.
# MRSA in BCx: Grew MRSA in 1 blood culture in addition to fevers as above concerning for bacteremia.
Serial blood cultures were drawn, and Vancomycin was started empirically.
TTE was negative for vegetations, but suboptimal.
Surveillance cultures were all pending at time of discharge.
Repeat UCx demonstrated contamination.
Iron studies with no clear picture, suggested iron deficiency anemia, though no symptoms of bleeding.
Hct remained stable and improved, and was 34.3 at time of discharge.
Unclear picture as pt's exam continued to fluctuate and pt was diffusely tender to the touch associated with skin reaction.
CT abdomen demonstrated no acute change and no RP bleed.
LFT's were trended and were normal except for mild elevation in AP, which downtrended.
BP well-controlled during this admission.

You had ultrasounds of your legs and a ventilation-perfusion study which were negative for clots.
You had an echocardiogram to look at your heart, which was normal.
