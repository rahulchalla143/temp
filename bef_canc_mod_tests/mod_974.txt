RADIOLOGY  Final Report  [**2110-2-23**] 10:27 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: R/O ptx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old man s/p s/p esophagectomy, [**Last Name (un) 1236**].
Comparison is made with prior study performed 5 hours before.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2110-2-23**] 6:08 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: PLEASE EVAL.
COMPARISON: Preoperative CT torso of [**2110-1-30**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenously.
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is extensive air and soft tissue stranding within the soft tissues of the neck.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, pancreas are unremarkable.
There is an extensive stranding and marked edema of omentum and transverse mesocolon, that could still be consistent with postoperative state.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, seminal vesicles, prostate, rectum are unremarkable.
Upper mediastinal air and fluid collection, consistent with anastomotic leak at the level of the esophagogastric anastomosis at the level of T1-T2.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 71037**] who was s/p transhiatal esophagectomy POD#12 was re-admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2110-2-23**] with dyspnea, cough and dehiscence of esophagogastric anastomosis seen on CT scan.
He was strictly NPO and a Foley catheter was placed for close monitoring of renal function.
His temperature curve began to decline and he was transferred to the floor in stable condition on [**2110-2-24**].
His WBC continued to trend down and was within normal limits after [**2110-2-24**] and he remained afebrile throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Given these data, along with negative blood and urine cultures, his antibiotics were discontinued on [**2110-3-2**].
An EGD was performed on [**2110-3-4**] (POD#21), which demonstrated a 15-20% circumferential dehiscence/leak at esophagogastric anastamosis at 22cm.
