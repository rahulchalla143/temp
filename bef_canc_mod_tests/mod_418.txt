------ CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2128-1-19**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous contrast and opacification of small bowel with oral contrast.
------- CXR [**2128-1-25**]: IMPRESSION: Probable marginal improvement in extent of pneumonia.
------- MRI c-spine [**2128-1-24**]: CONCLUSION: Mild degenerative disc disease with a small midline protrusion at C6-7 that does not contact the spinal cord.
Determined to have sputum cultures positive for MRSA and treated for multifocal pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn.
3) Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: On admission ABG was 6.88/23/94/4.3/89% and lactate 2.6.
Also found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 5.1.
As noted abovePatient will need a total of 14 day course of this antibiotic combination since his last negative sputum cx ([**2128-1-19**]).Last dose on [**2128-2-1**].
