A segment of jejunum in the left upper quadrant measures 4 cm in diameter.
There are multiple enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes, which are unchanged.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a persistent collection of fluid in the presacral space of intermediate density with a smooth enhancing wall.
INDICATIONS:  The patient presented with massive weight loss and total obstruction of her rectum which may have been due to a pelvic abscess which was not seen early on.
Irrigation of the rectum revealed that it was entirely open at this point up into the point of the obstruction which the area of radiation at the bottom of which was the enterorectal fistula, the most distal.
We then changed gowns and gloves to closure kit and closed the peritoneum, put the Penrose drain which had a tie around it in the peritoneum, irrigated the peritoneum, checked for the nasogastric tube, checked for bleeding which there was very little and then closed the peritoneum with #1 chromic catgut.
Estimated blood loss was 600 cc.
Two sponge counts, needle counts and instrument counts were reported as correct by the nursing in charge.
An abdominal/pelvic CT scan showed increased dilatation of the proximal small bowel, with areas of narrowing and wall thickening in the more distal small bowel; residual rectum with intraluminal mass; implied fistulous connection from residual rectum to the small bowel; persistent presacral fluid collection with enhancing rim; and mild lymphadenopathy (see pertinent results).
A chest xray was obtained which was negative for acute process or effusion(see pertinent results).
A sample of the drainage was sent for culture.
On HD 7 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent an exploratory lap, lysis of adhesions, resection of fistula, and closure of the enterotomy, low anterior resection and colorectostomy, coloproctostomy,takedown of colostomy, transverse colostomy and frozen section biopsy.
Estimated blood loss was 600ml and she received 2 units of PRBCs and 500ml albumin.
By POD 1 the presacral fluid culture grew staph aureus susceptible to Vancomycin and her Levo/Flagyl were discontinued.
Blood cultures from the emergency department were negative.
Urine output and vital signs were stable.
Her WBC count was elevated at 20.2 and a repeat abscess culture was sent from the pigtail.
Her tube feeds were advanced to 30cc/hr and her TPN was continued.
She was advanced to sips and her TPN was continued.
Her pigtail continued to have minimal output of 10cc and her TPN was discontinued.
Her metoprolol was increased for an elevated heart rate.
Imodium A-D 1 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2) mg PO twice a day: Give 10ml liquid down J-tube twice daily.
