On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], oxygen saturation was 40% on 100% non-rebreather.
Potassium was 6.3 on admission, and EKG revealed peaked T waves.
Chest x-ray showed florid pulmonary edema.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had troponin peaking at 0.16, which was attributed to recent cardiac defibrillation.
A chest x-ray was questionable for aspiration pneumonia.

Blood cultures on [**9-2**] pending.
Chest x-ray on [**9-2**] showing bilateral patchy opacities, diffuse peri-hilar haziness suggestive of congestive heart failure; question of superimposed pneumonia.
EKG on [**9-2**] showing sinus tachycardia with a normal axis, normal intervals, peaked T waves V1 to V3, T wave inversions in I, AVL, biphasic T waves in II, [**Street Address(2) 2915**] depressions in V4, V5, V6.
On [**9-3**], resolved T wave inversions and stable ST depressions; resolved peaked T waves.
Blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative and white blood cell count was stable.
Hematocrit was followed and remained stable during his hospital stay.
