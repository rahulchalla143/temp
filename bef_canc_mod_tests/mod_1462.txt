As noted previously the patient had wheezing and dyspnea on admission with oxygen saturation 84% on room air, which improved with nebulizers and Lasix treatment.
The patient had a repeat chest x-ray two days prior to discharge, which demonstrated the resolution of some previously noted small effusions and atelectasis and noted no new lung lesions.
Early in the patient's course the patient underwent a swallowing study, which demonstrated a high risk of aspiration.
Following resolution of the patient's primary infection the patient's mental status improved and the patient was reevaluated by swallowing study who felt that although she was a high risk of aspirating liquids she could tolerate soft solids and pureed foods.
Over the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course the patient's platelet count was noted to decrease from an admission count of 244 to a nadir of 76.
A test for antiheparin antibodies was sent, which was negative.
A CT of her head without contrast was done, which demonstrated the presence of an old large infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution with associated encephalomalacic changes predominantly involving the left parietal region.
As stated before no source of infection other then yeast in her urine cultures was noted and at the time of discharge it was decided not to treat the yeast urinary tract infection as it was felt to be simply colonization rather then true infection.
Multiple NG tube lavages demonstrated no active source of bleeding in the stomach.
