Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-8-23**] no clear change.
[**2159-6-1**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:   IMPRESSION:  1.
[**2159-6-1**]:  cat scan of the c-spine:   IMPRESSION:  1.
Numerous other transverse process and rib fractures are not imaged, seen on accompanying CT torso.
Clinical correlation with history of malignancy should be made and a bone scan can be obtained for further evaluation.
[**2159-6-1**]:  cat scan of the head:   IMPRESSION: 1.
If there is concern for an acute stroke, MR may be obtained for further evaluation  [**2159-6-1**]:  right shoulder x-ray:  Comminuted fracture of the right scapula and displaced fracture of the right proximal clavicle.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-16**], the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.
The mitral valve gradient, severity of mitral regurgitation, and the egional and global left ventricular systolic function are similar.
Compared to the previous tracing of variable A-V nodal conduction is seen.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-6-4**] atrial ectopy is new.
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
Current study demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2159-6-6**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Review of the imaging showed right sided rib fractures [**11-27**] (3, [**4-27**] segmental fractures, right clavicle and scapular fracture, and T2-7 transverse process fracture.
He was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring where he had an epidural cathete placed for pain control with a resultant drop in his blood pressure requiring additional intravenous fluids.
Sputum cultures grew MSSA and H. Flu and he was started on vancomycin, nafcillin, and ceftriaxone.
During this time, he had an eppisode of blood pressure instability where he required pressor support.
His pulmonary status worsened and on chest x-ray was found to have a right lung collapse requiring placement of a chest tube with re-expansion of the lung.
With his hemodynamic instability, cardiology was consulted for a mild elevation in the troponins and an echocardiogram was done on HD # 4.
The echo showed an ejection fraction of 40% and an increase in the severtiy of the aortic stenosis.
His troponins were monitored and they gradually decreased.
They recommended holding his metoprolol because of progression on EKG to Type 1 second degree heart block.
His vital signs have been stable.
