Her BPs ranged in the 120-150s, and her HR remained 70s-110s.
She was monitored on telemetry and was rate-controlled with HR 60s-80s by the time of discharge.
Blood tests showed no evidence of any infection or heart attack.
It is likely that this low blood pressure was from the sedation you had for the bronchoscopy.
