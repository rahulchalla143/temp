During his recent admission, CT scan did reveal fairly prominent parastomal varices although endoscopy (through stoma) did not identify an area of bleed.
His Hct and INR on discharge were 28.7 and 1.4 respectively.
Per patient, baseline BP are in sbp 90's.

Similar appearance to multiple large areas of heterogeneous enhancement in the liver when compared to the previous study of [**2126-5-29**], likely representing areas of infarct.
Continued extensive varices, splenomegaly and non-visualized hepatic arteries which are likely thrombosed, all unchanged since the previous study  [**5-29**].
He was intubated and upper endoscopies performed by GI, showed no active bleed but duodenal ulcers.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and CT scan performed showing increasing abdominal ascites and pleural effusion.
Bedside ultrasound guided drainage of both collections, sent for culture and cytology.
HD continued as clinically needed based on clinical exam and electrolytes, transfused as needed for low Hct, continued on all immunosuppression medications.
Anti-coagulation was held due to parastomal bleeding.
TIPS to attempt to divert blood flow.
Patient's LFT continued to be abnormal as CT also suggested areas of necrosis.
CT also demonstrated SMA thrombosis.
FEN: Patient electrolytes were checked daily and nephrology closely following for dialysis.
Daily cultures continued to be positive and microbe returned with Enterococcus.
Additional cultures positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] and Stenotrophomonas.
