PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission examination was remarkable for tachypnea, respiratory rate of 28, 84% on room air saturation, bilateral crackles to the mid thorax, 9.0 cm jugular venous distention, and an S3 gallop and trace pretibial edema.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Noted for a BUN and creatinine of 99 and 2.1, her baseline is 0.9 as of [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, and a CPK of 170, MB fraction of 7.0, and troponin I of 5.4.
Admission electrocardiogram was remarkable for sinus rhythm at 70, a left bundle branch block that was new, flipped T-waves in I, AVL, V5, V6 that were consistent with lateral ischemia.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly, cephalization, and bilateral effusion.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained by admitting Medicine Services.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2152-10-27**] showed high grade stenosis in the distal left main system, involving the origin of the left anterior descending artery as 90% osteal stenosis, moderate disease of the left circumflex including 50% stenosis of the oblique marginal and other diffuse disease throughout the circumflex system.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of approximately 20-30% and given the relative hypoperfusion of her kidneys, her creatinine rose to a peak of 3.2.
She underwent a thoracentesis drainage of the effusions with marked symptomatic relief on postoperative day four.
Her activity level was rated as [**3-9**] and her blood sugars were well controlled.
Discharge creatinine was 1.2, white count was 13,000 with a normal differential.
Chest x-ray had shown stable, but resolving bilateral effusions and a room air saturation of 93%.
