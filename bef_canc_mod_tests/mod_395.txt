At baseline, she is tachycardic to as high as 120, respiratory rate 40, Blood pressure ~100 systolic.
She initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hosp where she had blood cutlures and a CXR done.
In the ED, initial Vitals were HR 150, hypotensive (map mid 50s), and RR 40-60.
CXR revealed increased consildation RUL persists with decreased aeration and more opacifiction; vague patchy opacities widespread each lung NEW.
CXR line in place, consolidations similar, L infrahilar opacity, no ptx.
IP requested a CT w/o contrast of chest to looks at patency of stent in LMSB, which will happen en route to the ICU as ED feels she is stable enough for CT.

Short-term followup radiographs are recommended to reassess, and particularly of suspicion for discrete nodules were to persist, then chest CT could be considered.
RUQ U/S [**2184-1-6**] Status post cholecystectomy without intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation; trace amount of perihepatic ascites, similar to prior exams.
TTE [**2184-1-7**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2182-12-23**] (images reviewed), the degree of mitral regurgitation appears decreased, although the quality of the current study is inferior and the amount of regurgitation may be underestimated.
CXR [**2184-1-9**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.

CXR [**2184-1-13**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The monitoring and support devices are constant.
The patient's sputum culture from [**1-3**] grew MRSA, with rare pseudomonas which was sensitive to cefepime.
Subsequent sputum cultures were negative.
An influenza DFA was negative.
At the time of discharge, she was able to ambulate with assistance, during which time she had an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.
# Anemia: On admission, the patient had a hematocrit of 30, which trended downward slowly over the course of several days.
Her hematocrit reached a nadir of 18.2, and she was transfused 2u pRBCs.
