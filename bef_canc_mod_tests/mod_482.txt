Meningitis was on the differential, though not felt to be very likely and given his clinical instability, an LP was deferred and Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin were continued.
Head CT was also unremarkable.

1+ dp pulses bilaterally.
CT Head ([**3-6**]): There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct, or intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR ([**3-6**]): Limited study due to low lung volumes.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent the combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, cannot rule out consolidation.
EEG ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with more complex rhythms, at times with faster frequencies, noted on the left compared with a slightly lower voltage and slower frequency activity over the right side.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was of low voltage, disorganized, and slow typically in the [**4-28**] Hz frequency range, admixed with bursts of generalized mixed frequency theta and delta frequency slowing.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 78 bpm.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-10-3**], the findings are similar.

CT head was unremarkable.
Admission exam as detailed above.
Urine osmoles initially above 500.
With mild fluid restriction, sodium improved into mid to upper 130s.
Cultures from OSH grew Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone and he completed a 7 day course.
His urine continued to grow yeast, and he was started on 5 days of fluconazole on [**2142-3-15**].
BLOOD CULTURES were drawn sevaral points during this admission and have all been negative in house.
Sputum cultures did not isolate pathogens.
Echo showed mod LVH with EF 70%.
DYSAUTONOMIA The patient's wife reports that he runs low temperatures, and was very concerned about temperatures which were 98-99, which she considered fever.
He was pancultured for these in the ICU but cultures were all negative or no growth to date.
He had several swings in his blood pressure, for which iv medication for hypertensive urgency (BP 200/100) were avoided.
BP was overall quite labile and required frequent adjustment of his regimen.
