Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): .
EKG [**5-11**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-5-10**] no diagnostic interim change.
In the PACU, the patient dropped his blood pressure to the 70s diastolic, and his HR was in the 130s in an atrial fib/RVR rhythm.
The patient received 1 pack of pRBCs postop for HCT of 27.
His blood pressure was then maintained in the 90s-120s systolic.
However, the [**Date Range 1106**] surgery team was notified in the morning that the patient's SBP was in the high 60s and low 70s systolic, with HR in the 130s.
Of note, the patient was evaluated by the renal service as well, who felt that the patient's blood pressure did not need to be treated if the MAP remained above 50 and if the patient was mentating well.
Patient received an echo which demonstrated no significant change from previous, with no pericardial effusion.

BP improved [**5-18**] and metoprolol restarted at low dose, to be uptitrated as tolerated.
***[**5-13**] and [**5-17**] blood cultures pending at discharge.
Rate control between 80s and 100s was achieved with digoxin 0.125mg PO QOD and metoprolol 25mg tid.
# Hypoglycemia: On [**5-16**] am the patient had a BG of 37, improved to 190 on FS after [**1-10**] amp D50.
