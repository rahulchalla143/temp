TTE ([**1-29**]): Severe LVH with moderate LV dilatation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-1-9**], overall LV systolic function has decreased significantly.
Unremarkable renal transplant Doppler examination with only slightly elevated resistive indices but unremarkable waveforms.
TEE ([**1-31**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Elevated BNP, history and exam consistent with CHF.
Likely precipitated by AS and HTN, and TTE showed worsened systolic function (which improved after diuresis) and increased aortic valve gradient.
His BP was well controlled after these changes.
His immunosuppresant regimen, calcitriol, and sensipar were continued and his creatinine was trending down at discharge.
4) Aortic valve stenosis: TEE showed mod-severe AS with a valve area of 0.8.
He will likely need chest CT and cardiac cath prior to AVR per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
