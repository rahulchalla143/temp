Her Coumadin had been stopped, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was unsuccessful and the barium swallow was deferred secondary to high aspiration risk.
The patient did have sputum which grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
They have become frustrated that she has not been able to progress off the ventilator and are requesting further evaluation at [**Hospital1 1444**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 60, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/60.
Vent settings IMV with a rate of 14, tidal volume 450, pressure support 10, PEEP 5, FIO2 0.45.
LABORATORY FINDINGS:  White blood count 8.6, hematocrit 28.6, platelets 276, sodium 135, potassium 3.3, chloride 94, bicarbonate 35, BUN 30, creatinine 0.5.
Glucose 105, ALT 20, AST 22, alk phos 135.
Total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 2.5, calcium 8.6, phosphate 2.1.
Urinalysis 1.014 specific gravity, trace protein, 2 white cells, occasional bacteria, no yeast, one epithelial.
Sputum with greater than 25 polys and less than 10 epithelial cells with 1+ gram negative rods, 4+ gram positive rods.
Chest x-ray:  Shows slight cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
She was then sent for a CT scan of her chest on [**2120-12-13**] and this showed the following.
Generally aside from the right upper lobe findings, the parenchyma is much improved compared to a CT scan from [**2120-8-7**].
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2120-12-16**], which revealed a somewhat concerning appearance to a heaped up type lesion at the left lower lobe stump.
Bronchoscopy otherwise revealed areas of thick mucous plugs which were clear in appearance and not purulent.
Also, the Pulmonary Interventional Service will evaluate the patient on [**2120-12-17**] to change her trach collar to a different size so that there is no leak as a leak had been noted around the trach collar, however, the CT scan suggested her cuff is overinflated.
The patient had a transthoracic echo, which otherwise unchanged from previous echocardiograms at this institution as well as [**Hospital1 **], revealed question of a left atrial mass.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was scheduled, however, the patient did not tolerate sedation required for the procedure as she dropped her blood pressure precipitously.
This blood pressure drop responded to a brief bolus of pressors.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was still spiking temperatures above 101.0.
She was cultured multiple times, with sputum showing greater than 25 polys and 1+ gram negative rods.
The CT scan did raise some question of whether there is an atypical pneumonia with deep ground glass opacity findings in her right upper lobe.
The patient maintained a good urine output during this admission with a good response to Lasix and Hemodynamic stability.
Status     post biopsy, biopsy results pending.
