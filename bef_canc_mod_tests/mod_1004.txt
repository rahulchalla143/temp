NCHCT at OSH showed new hemorrhage involving left parasagital posterior frontal lobe.
Head CT at that time (per records) was negative.
INR at ED was 1.7.
CXR showed bilateral LL opacities and patient received Lasix for pulm edema.
Exam at OSH was notable for right-sided weakness and confusion.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

A repeat NCHCT showed no extension of bleed.
He received 2 units of FFP on [**1-8**] and another 2 units on [**1-9**] to correct INR of 2.1 for goal of 1.5-1.7.
Since his bleed was stable and since he will need continued long-term anticoagulation given his risk for ischemic [**Month/Year (2) **], it was decided not to give vitamin K, but rather to follow his INR and correct with FFP as needed.
On day of discharge, INR was 1.7.
Until [**2198-1-17**] (10 days post-hemorrhage) goal INR should remain 1.5-1.7 (or less).
After that time, coumadin should be restarted with goal INR 2-2.5.
Additionally, his blood pressure was maintained below 130 systolic to minimize changes of worsenig bleed.
Cholesterol was excellent (total 152 LDL 74, HDL 62, TG 82), and lipitor was continued.
HgbA1C was 6.7, and his amaryl was continued, in addition to insulin sliding scale.
He will need repeat CT with contrast in [**5-23**] weeks to evaluate for any underlying mass or lesion.
Renal/GU: In the ICU, he was noted to have decreased urinary output and a creatinine of 2.2.
Serial neurological exams show patient to be oriented to place and time but with abulic affect and poor attention and recall.
At time of discharge, strength on right as follows: deltoid 3, biceps 5, triceps 4, WE 3, FE 4, FF 5, IP 3, H 4, Q 4, TA 4, G 4, [**Last Name (un) 938**] 3, EDB 3.
As he gets further away from her death, this discussion would be more appropriate.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) for 10 days.
Followup Instructions: Follow up with your primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-19**] weeks for further maangement of your blood pressure, diabetes and other medical problems.
