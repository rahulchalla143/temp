CTA [**2149-3-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Based on [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines, if patient is at low risk, a dedicated one-year followup CT would be recommended, if high risk, a dedicated followup in [**7-4**] months would be recommended.
If the patient has outside CT imaging, comparison should be made to assess for stability.
CXR [**2149-3-1**]: There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.

Flow-Volume Loop: mild restrictive pattern with an early termination of   exhalation.
Lung Volumes: The TLC, FRC and RV are normal.
Echocardiogram [**2149-2-7**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Patient's NT-proBNP was 679 and she had a normal echocardiogram 3 weeks prior to presentation.
She suddenly decompensated in the ER with increased labor breathing and respiratory distress and had a bronchoscopy looking for mucus plug and/or stent obstruction.
However, the bronchoscopy showed patent stent and no mucus.
She underwent a bronchoscopy and there was paradoxical movement of the vocal cords with edematous cords and with patent airways and stent and distal malacia without any evidence of secretions or mucus plug.
In the medical floor there was no clear precipitant of the crisis, so viral panel was sent and negative.
Patient was hydrated and urine output improved.
She will need further titration as outpatient and may be able to switch to an ACEI once breathing stable.
stable hematocrit of ~30 with guaiac negative stools and MCV 93, MCH 32, MCHC 34.4 and normal PLT count.
You had an emergent bronchoscopy to take a look at your airways for the concern of mucus plug in your stent.
You had a CT scan of your chest that showed normal lungs, patentn stent and no clots in your arteries.
