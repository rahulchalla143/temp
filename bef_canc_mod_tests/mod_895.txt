She has had three episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and her recent A1c is 7.2%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient's temperature was 98.6, blood pressure 130/76, heart rate 119, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 liters, respiratory rate 12.
head and neck examination showed pale conjunctiva, relatively moist mucous membranes.
Her lungs had pure inspiratory effort but clear to auscultation without wheezing.
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 3.0, hematocrit 19.5, platelets 427.
Chem-7 showed sodium 141, potassium 3.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, BUN 28, creatinine .5, glucose 250.
Her PT was 13.3, PTT 47.8, INR 1.2.
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for serial hematocrits and close monitoring.
She was transfused 3 units of packed cells to keep goal hematocrit greater than 30.
She underwent angiogram at this time that showed bleeding from a branch upon the antrum of the stomach.
It was at this point that further studies from the heme workup of her elevated PTT came back and so she was treated initially with fresh frozen plasma and then activated Factor VII.
At the time of this dictation, the patient had no evidence for further bleeding and her hematocrit is stable in the high 30s.
However, further concerns lead to sending off Factor levels of [**Name2 (NI) 7060**], IX, [**Doctor First Name 81**] and XII.
Further workup suggested antibody to Factor [**Last Name (LF) 7060**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she had a Factor [**First Name3 (LF) 7060**] inhibitor.
6 hour Solu-Medrol which is the standard therapy in this type of condition.
Further workup and treatment of the coagulopathy will be discussed and dictated at a later point.
Her fingersticks ranged from being within the normal range to being elevated when she started the steroids, however, this was controlled without complication with the sliding scale and Glargine.
