# UGIB: Pt was found with a HCT of 10 at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital and coffee grounds that didn't fully clear on NG lavage.
His BP at [**Last Name (un) 4068**] dropped to the 80s, with tachycardia to the 120s.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was evaluted by GI and lavaged bright red blood taht could not be cleared.
He was transfused 2 additional units of prbcs for a hct of 23.
SBP were stable at 130-140s.
Had abdominal ultrasound with dopplers which was unremarkable and without evidence of portal hypertension making duodenal ulcers unlikely.
He then had a repeat EGD which showed folding in the duodenum likely accounting for intial concern of varices.
His PPI was changed to an oral PPI.
He underwent a colonoscopy which showed diverticui in the sigmoid and descending colon as well as internal hemorroids.
The capsule study was not capturing but during the procedure but he was found to have a small bleeding AVM that was clipped and cauterized.
Thus it was felt his bleed could have been due to this AVM and further pursuit of a capsule study during this hospitalization was felt unneccessary.
His Hct remained stable.
# Cardiac/HTN: Pts Metoprolol and ACE were intially held but restarted once his Hct and BP were stable.
The patient will follow up with his PCP and will likely need to restart his medication in [**6-11**] days as long has his Hct is stable and he does not have further signs of bleeding.
A U/A was negative, blood cultures were sent (NGTD on day of discharge) and a CXR showed no evidence of infiltrate.
