On Tuesday, VNA drew blood cultures from her line.
The line was changed over a wire on [**1-28**].
The line was again exchanged over a wire on [**2-11**], and the culture tip was negative.

Physical Exam: On Transfer to Floor: T 100.3 (99.3-100.3) BP 98/62; HR 95; resp 21; 96% on 2L General: pleasant thin woman in NAD, talking with eyes closed.
BP 80-90's/50-60's which is patient's baseline GEN: NAD, comfortable, thin HEENT: mmm, EOMI, PERRL Neck: Supple CV: regular, no mrg PULM: decrease breath sounds at the bases, otherwise clear ABD: colostomy in place with no skin break down, no TTP over abdomen.
Transhepatic line in place, no erythma or exudate, mild TTP over line site EXT: no [**Location (un) **], warm, well perfused NEURO: A/O to person, place, time and purpose PSYCH: Appropriate  Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: - WBC-5.0 RBC-2.90* Hgb-9.3* Hct-26.0* MCV-90 MCH-32.1* MCHC-35.8* RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-168 - Neuts-87.9* Lymphs-8.6* Monos-2.7 Eos-0.6 Baso-0.1 - PT-13.9* PTT-29.6 INR(PT)-1.2* - Glucose-110* UreaN-21* Creat-0.9 Na-135 K-3.6 Cl-104 HCO3-21* AnGap-14 - ALT-45* AST-20 AlkPhos-253* TotBili-0.9 - Lipase-26 - TotProt-6.0* Calcium-8.3* Phos-2.5* Mg-1.8 - Lactate-1.4  CT abdomen/pelvis, [**2146-2-24**]: 1.
Chest x-ray [**2146-2-24**]: Relatively stable examination with improved aeration at the right lung base with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm across multiple prior studies.
If indicated, consider CT to assess for underlying occult nodules.
Ultrasound [**2146-2-26**]: Focal thrombus within the right common femoral vein.
However, evaluation was somewhat limited by presence of a tunneled catheter.
ECHO [**2146-2-28**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-2-11**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher (and was normal on [**2145-9-23**]).
CHEST CT: 1.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, could be reactive.
CBD dilatation and splenomegaly are unchanged.
Survaillence cultures were negative.
CT abdomen did not reveal a source of infection.
Infectious disease was consulted and patient was ultimately treated with iv ampicillin and fluconazole as outside hospital cultures grew out enteroccus and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Ophthalmologic evaluation was limited as the patient refused dilation, however did not show evidence of fungal sequalae.
Survaillence cultures remained negative.
Visiting nurse to draw survaillence blood cultures on [**2146-3-21**] and send them to infectious disease at [**Hospital1 18**].
Long term plan if survaillence cultures negative is to resite line to femoral vein with tunneling from above to avoid groin flora.
Patient's blood pressures were at baseline of mid 80's-90's after transfer to medical floor.
CT showed multiple PE's.
# Chronic Hypotension:  Baseline blood pressures in 80-90's systolic.
Patient remained stable with good urine output at these pressures.
Hct was stable at baseline of high 20-low 30's for 5 days prior to discharge.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: Four (4) mg Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw 2 sets of blood cultures on [**2146-3-21**], fax results to: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/Dr.

You will need blood cultures on [**2146-3-21**] drawn by Visiting nurses or at the rehab facility.
You will also have blood work drawn on [**2146-3-18**].
