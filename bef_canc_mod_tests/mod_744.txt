A recently performed echocardiogram showed moderate severe aortic insufficiency with ejection fraction of approximately 25%.
A repeat cardiac catheterization performed on [**2131-9-3**] showed one vessel branch coronary artery disease, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild biventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary arterial diastolic hypertension.
[**6-24**] echocardiogram with ejection fraction of 20% to 25% with multiple wall motion abnormalities including apical akinesis, anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, inferior hypokinesis/akinesis as well as lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile, heart rate 70 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/81.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Within normal limits.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Sinus rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur and [**3-28**] diastolic murmur.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 30.5, white blood cell count 10.2, platelets 122.
PTT 35.2, PT 12.2, INR 1.0.
Glucose 119, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.7.
IMAGING:  Preoperative chest x-ray was within normal limits.
Postoperatively, the patient's arterial blood gas was pH 7.38, PCO2 of 34, PO2 of 110.
His hematocrit was stable at 30.5.
Given the presence of a mechanical valve, an INR of 2.5 to 3 was set as the goal.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His incision was clean, dry and intact throughout this hospitalization course.
On the date of discharge, his INR was 1.9.
The patient is to follow up at the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic in two days to have his INR levels drawn and his Coumadin levels adjusted.
