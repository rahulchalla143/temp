History of Present Illness: 72F with a history of type II DM, ESRD on HD, GAVE, HTN, MR, CAD, CHF w/ RV failure and seizure disorder with recent hospitalization from [**5-5**] to [**6-3**] with culture negative sepsis with MS change and c.diff colitis, who presents to the ED on [**6-4**] for HD.
Prior to HD, in ED BP 131/76  RR 16  92% 4L.
Following her ultrafiltration, she returned to the ED for likely discharge back to rehab.
However, both during HD and on return to the ED, she was noted to be hypotensive, to as low as SBP 60s.
Her BP has since been labile and she has had BP to 67/42 with HR 89 at time of transfer to the floor.
The only laboratory sent at the time of admission to floor were CBC and chem 10. .

Imaging: Echo - The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT abdomen and pelvis - CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate-to-large left effusion, simple in attenuation, increased in volume from the prior study.
The transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon is not well distended though it may be thickened to a lesser degree.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Oral contrast reaches the rectum, which is normal in appearance.
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case.
Followup imaging was advised on the prior exam.
Attention on followup studies will be helpful.
Her BP was not responsive currently to IVF, she received total of 1.5 L in ED and 1 L on floor, she was started on neo (did not tolerate levophed) and started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin IV and cefepime IV as well as vancomycin po and flagyl iv for her c.diff.
BPs on discharge in 120s and stable.
HRs in 120s-140s during these epsisodes.
Pt was not on beta blocker during this time because blood pressure were unable to tolerate.
Her mental status improved, we were able to stop the drip and keep her on her normal PO diet and her sugars did much better.
She was given vitamin k initially, however her coagulopathy is likely [**12-27**] to her hepatopathy [**12-27**] to right heart failure.
She does not have any active signs of bleeding and has stable anemia with a hemoglobin between 8 and 9. .
We monitored her liver functions were showed increasing bilirubin.
Her belly exam remained intermittently tight and distended, worsening at time, but improves often after dialysis.
We did ultrasounds studies of her ABIs which were 0.4 and 0.6 in R and L respectively.
# Hx of siezures - on prior admission, had a seizure while hypotensive and in the MICU.
There has been a question of possible lymphoma seen on prior imaging studies, but no diagnosis has been made.
Her breathing is stable on room air and she is not dyspneic on the mild exertion she is able to do.
Liver dysfunction 6.
None of the cultures came back, so we do not know if there was an infection causing you to have these low pressures.
We monitored your electrolytes and liver function tests.
It caused your heart rate to go very high, which is unsafe for your body.
You should continue to try and eat as much as possible several times a day to help your nutrition and blood sugars.
You should come back to the hospital for any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, or other concerns.
