Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-11-19**] no significant diagnostic change.
CXR [**2135-4-15**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
RENAL U/S [**2135-4-16**]: 1.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2135-4-18**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
She underwent ultrasound vein mapping in anticipation of fistula surgery.
Notably, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild LVH, severe pulm HTN and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
# Pulmonary Hypertension: ECHO demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] the patient does not have significant left heart disease would suggest further work-up such as PFTs and polysomnography.
[**Month (only) 116**] also want to recheck ECHO within the next fews weeks to assess whether improved hemodynamics in setting of HD initiation has an effect.
Diabetes, type 1: Blood sugars remain well controlled.
