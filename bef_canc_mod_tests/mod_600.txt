**FINAL REPORT [**2143-10-6**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2143-10-6**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
Duplex ultrasound suggested a stenosis at the proximal anastomosis of the axillary graft to the axillary artery and also a focal high- grade stenosis in the superficial femoral artery just distal to the distal anastomosis on the left side.
The artery had no pulse present within it at all but was very soft.
The C-arm was then draped and rolled into place.
We then directed an angled glide wire into the axillary artery proximal to the proximal anastomosis and, over this, advanced a Omni Flush catheter, which was then connected to the power injector.
Arteriography confirmed the presence of what appeared to be only about a 50%-60% stenosis of the anastomosis into the origin of the left axillary graft; however, the ultrasound had suggested a far more significant stenosis, and we had noted a weak pulse in the axillary- femoral graft when dissecting it free.
A catheter was then placed and connected to a pressure transducer and a pull-back pressure done, which showed about a 5-mm systolic pressure gradient across the anastomosis, with no change in diastolic blood pressures, and about a 2- to 3-mm drop in the mean arterial pressure.
A 6-mm, thin- walled, ringed PTFE graft was taken and spatulated and an end- to-side anastomosis fashioned between the new graft and old graft with running continuous 6-0 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex sutures from either end.
The distal end of the graft was trimmed and spatulated appropriately and a 2nd end-to-side anastomosis fashioned, again with 6-0 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex sutures.
Hemostasis was then secured, the heparin was fully reversed with protamine, and the wounds were closed in layers with 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.
