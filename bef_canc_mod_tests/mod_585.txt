A CT non-contrast was performed which preliminarily is read as concerning for cellulitis along the left auricle root, extending superiorly, although early malignancy otitis externa is certainly of high concern.

UA dirty though urine culture with fecal contamination, history of pan-resistant Klebsiella urine infections (sensitive only to Tetracyclie).
Her CXR appeared normal without evidence of consolidation.
Based on physical examination findings of cellulitis and ear involvement ED was concerned with Malignant external otitis.
Last HIV was negative year ago, but A1c's uncontrolled.
AOCKD: On admission to MICU patient with Acute renal failure to Creatinine of 9.4 from baseline CRF of Cr=2.
Renal ultrasound was unremarkable.
Creatinine downtrended to mid 6 on discharge, will likely improve with time.
Systolic CHF (Chronic, LVEF 40% in [**6-/2113**]), no acute exacerbation.
Lipids drawn prior to discharge and her LDL was 89, good as it is LDL<100 but goal is <70 given already reduced LVEF which likely ischemic in nature.
Anemia: Has known renal disease, with HCT initially at baseline of 25 but trended down to 21.7.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
Her home regimen consists of MORPHINE 10 mg/5 mL - 1 tsp Q3H PRN*, MORPHINE 15 mg Extended Release TID*, OXYCODONE 10 mg Q6H PRN severe pain*, OXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN 5 mg-325 mg 1 tablet Q6H PRN*.
Started on Atorvastatin 20mg Daily, LDL <100 but would push for ideally <70.
Patient should have [**Hospital1 **]-weekly labs drawn to monitor ARF improvement #.
Your course was complicated by low blood pressure and acute renal failure.
You should follow up with a kidney doctor and have your labs checked twice weekly.
This was switched because of your kidney failure - START Oxycontin 10mg twice daily, for chronic pain - START Linezolid 600 twice daily until [**4-22**] - START Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily until [**4-22**] - START Vancomycin by mouth every 6 hours until [**4-29**] - START Carvedilol 6.25mg by mouth twice daily, for blood pressure - You should talk to your primary care doctor about starting Atorvastatin 20mg Daily, for high cholesterol - START Nephrocaps once daily, for your kidney - START Bacitracin: Apply to ear twice daily - CHANGE Insulin Lantus to 3 units each morning and 4 units at night - CHANGE sliding scale: See attached - DO NOT Take Lisinopril until instructed by your Nephrologist - No other changes were made, please continue taking as previously prescribed.
