He was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from to the Emergency Department on [**2168-10-7**] after he was noted to have a hematocrit of 22 (down from his baseline of 30).
A nasogastric lavage in the Emergency Department was negative, and he received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma and was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**10-8**] which showed nodularity and petechiae in the esophagus, antral erosions in the stomach; consistent with aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug induced erosive gastropathy.
It was recommended that serum Helicobacter pylori serologies be checked and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy be done in five to eight weeks.
There were no other problems in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and his hematocrit rose after the transfusions, and he was hemodynamically stable.
(a)  Status post cardiac catheterization in [**2167**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed vital signs of a temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 150/82, his heart rate was 79, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed no scleral icterus.
His oropharynx revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at left upper sternal border.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
His pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on transfer revealed a complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 7.7, his hematocrit was 28.6, his mean cell volume was 90, and his platelets were 354.
His prothrombin time was 14.7, and his INR was 1.4, and his partial thromboplastin time was 28.7.
Chemistries revealed his sodium was 138, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 48, and his creatinine was 2.4 (up from his baseline of 2).
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Of note, an echocardiogram in [**2168-7-26**] revealed an ejection fraction of less than 25%, left atrial mild dilation, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
His esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2168-10-8**] revealed no blood in the stomach, small prepyloric benign ulcerations with no evidence of active bleeding, small duodenal ulcerations, and mild diffuse gastritis.
His hematocrit and coagulations were followed when he came to the floor, and his hematocrit remained stable in the 28 to 30 range until the day of discharge.
He had a repeat endoscopy scheduled with Gastroenterology prior to discharge.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 25%.
It was felt appropriate at this time to restart his beta blocker given the stability of his blood pressure and his hematocrit and no further evidence of bleeding.
He was also transfused for a hematocrit of less than 30 in the setting of coronary artery disease.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, as previously mentioned, with an ejection fraction of less than 25%.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and on transfer to the floor his creatinine was 2.4.
After looking back over old records, it was realized that this was his baseline creatinine and no further investigation was necessary.
No thyroid function tests were tested on this admission.
The patient was instructed to restart his Coumadin on the Tuesday after discharge, with INR checks and followup per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient had serum Helicobacter pylori serologies checked at his endoscopy which were to be followed up for proper treatment if necessary by Gastroenterology.
