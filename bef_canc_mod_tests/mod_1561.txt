His CP also increased with a particularly severe episode 7 days ago (several hours of tightness radiating to both arms with dyspnea without relief with ntg).

Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=17mmHg and LVEDP=28mmHg).
Pulmonary arterial hypertension was noted (41/10mmHg).
The superior vena cava oxygen saturation was elevated suggesting the possibility of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, of unknown significance.
Successful placement of two overlapping Cypher drug-eluting stents in the proximal (3.0 x 23 mm) and mid-LAD (2.5 x 28 mm) after successful rotational atherectomy using a 1.5 mm burr.
Final angiography demonstrated a 40% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2-14**]:  No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
A circular opacity surrounding the right middle lobe is again seen and corresponds with the right middle lobe emboli identified on a CT on the chest recently on [**2126-11-12**].
An underlying infiltrate consolidation cannot be excluded.
His prox and mid LAD were stented with DES and PTCA of chronically occluded diag.
His peak CK 479 after the cath likely [**3-5**] the intervention.
Unfortunately, the patient is quite volume sensitive, and dropped his SBP to the 50's transiently but responded to IVF's.
PA catheter revealed distributive physiology but also a high wedge.
During his second CCU transfer (transferred twice to the CCU during this admission), he was aggressively diuresed, and dropped his blood pressure acutely after a 5L diuresis over two days with the addition of captopril.
Subsequently, he was continued to be diuresed with a lasix drip while in the CCU, titrating to PCWP (were in the low 20's with a cardiac output/index 9.9/3.6).
His heart failure regimen will include anti-ischemic meds, in addition to beta-blockade and standing PO lasix.
He had a hct drop (24) and had melanotic stool, though NG lavage was negative.
CT abd/pelvis did not reveal a retroperitoneal bleed.
A CXR revealed severe diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were new.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2-16**] which demonstrated clear aways but the L lingular washings were bloody and the wash was terminated early secondary to desaturation.
All BAL studies were negative.
It was unclear whether or not pulmonary edema was a component of his diffuse infiltrates, as his fluid balance is difficult to assess on physical exam secondary to obesity, therefore a swan ganz catheter was inserted which demonstrated an elevated wedge pressure.
Subsequent CXRs revealed improvement of the infiltrates, and the patient had no further hemoptysis.
He was able to be extubated after 9 days on the ventilator, and subsequently had oxygen saturations > 95% on 4 L via nasal cannula.
Guaiac positive stools/Anemia:  He was found to have guaiac positive stools during the admission, and a stable anemia, with one hematocrit drop on the day before the second transfer to the CCU at which time he received a PRBC transfusion.
Iron studies revealed an anemia of chronic disease, and despite the macrocytosis, his B12 and folate were within normal limits.
