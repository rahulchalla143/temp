She was noted to have mucus plugging of her trach and was suctioning with improvement of her respiratory status and satting 100% on 15L trach mask.
CT abd was performed which again demonstrated volvulus.
Surgery was consulted and after discussion with the pt the decision is that the pt would not want to live with a colostomy which would be the outcome of the surgery but this was not definitive.
Notable labs were Lactate 3.6, WBC count 14.9, elevated creatinine from baseline 0.7->1.3.
Vitals on transfer were: Vitals on transfer were: 98.9 rectal, Afib - low 100s, 122/72, 95% on trach mask RR 30.

KUB 11:30 am FINDINGS: The large bowel is dilated and filled with air.
CT ABD 12:00pm IMPRESSION: 1.
KUB [**2177-4-29**] 5:52 pm FINDINGS: Two supine frontal views of the abdomen demonstrate increased lucency in the right abdomen and [**Last Name (un) 100916**] sign consistent with a large amount of intraperitoneal free air.
Massive dilatation of the large bowel is not improved from the preceding radiograph, consistent with sigmoid volvulus, better seen on CT performed at 13:50 p.m.
CXR [**2177-4-29**] 9pm FINDINGS: Large free pneumoperitoneum is present causing elevation of bilateral hemidiaphragms.
Lung volumes are low.
There was a discussion with the patient and her sister who is her HCP with the decision that she would not want to live with a colostomy which would be the likely result of a surgery and that she would prefer less invasive option.
A repeat CXR showed massive free air in the peritoneum from a ruptured viscous.
