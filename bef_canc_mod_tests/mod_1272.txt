Echo [**5-29**]: Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Echo [**5-31**]: Conclusions The left atrium is dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-5-29**], no change.
CXR [**5-31**]: FINDINGS: New left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the proximal to mid superior vena cava, directed towards the lateral wall of this vessel.
Otherwise, no relevant changes since the recent radiograph performed a few hours earlier.
CXR [**6-7**]: Large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left side are unchanged.
Bibasilar consolidations, greater on the left side, are unchanged.
