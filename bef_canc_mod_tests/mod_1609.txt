Since the previous tracing of [**2131-11-6**] sinus tachycardia rate is faster.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

A wound swab of her left heel was done which grew out proteus and pseudomonas on culture (see above for sensitivities).
She underwent MRI of both her left foot on [**2-23**] showing multifocal osteo and her pelvis also showing chronic osteo of the R ilium.
Patient will need to follow up with outpatient infectious disease specialists for further management as well as with her outpatient orthopedic surgeon to discuss possible future left below knee amputation.
Vancomycin level should be checked the evening of arrival to rehab with dosing adjusted for a goal trough of 15 to 20.
It appears the patient's baseline blood pressures are in the 80s-90s, and her heart rate on numerous inpatient and outpatient visits has been consistently in the 120s to 130s.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia consistently.
Differential for the patient's strange hemodynamics include neurogenic causes given her transverse myelitis as volume repletion, pressors, and treatment of her infection had little effect on her heart rate and blood pressure.
The possibility of PE was considered but was felt unlikely given the patient's pristine oxygen saturations on room air, lack of dyspnea and baseline paraplegia as well as the chronic nature of her hemodynamics.
An ECHO showed preserved global ventricular function without effusion.
We would not be alarmed when her heart rates and blood pressures continue to trend in the 120s-130s and 80s-90s persistently as this is her baseline.
Concern for decompensation would be heightened if her mental status were to deteriorate or urine output were to fall.
On the morning of discharge hematocrit was 20- on recheck it was 23.7.
Urine output was hard to track as patient leaks around catheter, but she appeared to be putting out good urine.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU because you had low blood pressures and a fast heart rate which were concerning for infection.
You had multiple tests, including MRI's of your foot and back which showed a possible bone infection.
