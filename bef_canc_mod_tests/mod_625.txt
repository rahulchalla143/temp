Recommend MRI and MRA for further evaluation.
MRI [**2156-5-21**]: Left-sided arteriovenous malformation in the left temporal lobe is again identified with an enlarged posterior cerebral artery.
Neuro exam is significant at present for decreased level of arousal (that is worse than prior NSurg eval) with retained brainstem reflexes; focal findings include less vigorous withdrawal to noxious stimuli in the right arm/leg.
Head CT shows IV hemorrhage with extension into both occipital horns.
His exam is notable for right hemiparesis in the absence of signs of herniation; this suggests cause of decreased level of consciousness is bilateral pressure on the thalamus from the third ventricular bleed (and he does have small pupils with dysconjugate gaze).
EVD was placed and repeat head CT was showed stable bleed.
A Repeat head CT for altered mental status [**5-20**] am was unchanged.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed on Tuesday [**5-29**] with stable post-procedure head CT.  Ativan per CIWA scale given alcohol use history.
