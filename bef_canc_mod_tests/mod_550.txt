A renal biopsy of his transplanted kidney did not show acute graft rejection, blood vessel thrombosis, or other pathologic diagnoses.
His immunosuppression (rapamune and cellcept) was discontinued when it became clear that his kidneys were not recovering and his thrombocytopenia was worsening.
His hemolysis labs showed a mixed picture with largely normal total bilirubin and haptoglobin, variable fibrinogen sometimes under 100, and elevated LDH.
He was tried on plasmapheresis x3 for possible TTP, however this did not raise his platelets.
Finally, his immunosuppression was held to let his bone marrow replace the platelets, which showed potential with a reticulocyte count of >7.
His peripheral morphology shows occassional schisotcytes.
