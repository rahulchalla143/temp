CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-5-23**] 8:51 AM SINGLE PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: A dual-lead pacing device remains in unchanged position.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-5-24**] 3:36 AM Allowing the difference in position of the patient, large right pleural effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-5-25**] 3:36 AM In the interim, there is severe worsening of a right extensive pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and airspace disease in the collapsed right lung.
Hospital course by problem:  # Sepsis/Toe Wound: Patient's exam was consistent with infected L 1st toe ulcer and leg cellulitis and he was hypotensive.
His blood grew proteus mirabilis (pan-sensitive) and streptococcus (penicillin-sensitive but clindamycin and erythromycin-resistant).
Gram-positive cocci and more Proteus grew out of a wound culture as vascular surgery continued to follow, drain abscesses and debride tissue.
In terms of ongoing management, on the initial evaluation the wound had probed to bone in the earliest portion of this hospital course.
He had an US-guided thoracentesis on [**5-25**] (therapeutic and diagnostic) which revealed a transudative sterile fluid which carried signs of neither infection nor malignancy.
It declined to 1.3 and 1.4 in early [**Month (only) **], but after an angiographic study gave him a large contrast load, it went back up to the 1.7-2.0 range peaking at 2.1 on [**6-7**].
This was wavering in the period of [**5-26**] with an uncertain direction.
# Diabetes: Maintained patient on insulin sliding scale; his NPH was restarted and was titrated up as the patient's PO intake increased and his scale requirements  increased.
Factor Xa level was drawn in the pm of [**6-12**] after the third dose of lovenox was given, and found to be 0.43 U/mL.
