Per review of records, the patient had a fever at her NH with a Tmax of 102.9 today with a CXR performed at her nursing home that demonstrated increased congestion without consolidation per report.
Labs were notable for a serum potassium of 6.9 with an ECG demonstrating peaked T waves, for which the patient received calcium, insulin, and bicarbonate with a repeat serum potassium of 6.0.
Other notable labs at the time of initial presentation included a lactate of 4.
CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema but no acute consolidation.

CT abd/pelvis Final Report IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation of colon is significantly limited particularly the transverse colon due to underdistention.
Close clinical follow-up and if needed further evaluation with oral contrast should be considered.
Extensive SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] calcifications, potentially increasing risk for ischemia, although no signs specific for ischemia are identified.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR Final Report INDICATION: Fever.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2174-10-31**].
PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Mild cardiomegaly persists.
CT head Final Report INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with altered mental status and some focal signs.
COMPARISON: CT of the head without contrast from [**2174-10-11**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the vertex to the 1st cervical vertebrae without contrast.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT Abd/pelvis Final Report HISTORY: Fever and altered mental status.
TECHNIQUE: CT through the abdomen and pelvis performed after administration of oral and IV contrast.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
FINDINGS: Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate wide patency of both internal jugular veins.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-8-16**], no change (regional LV systolic dysfunction was present - but not reported- on the prior study).
CXR Final Report HISTORY: 76-year-old woman with PE at rest.

INTERPRETATION: Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled with In-111, images of the whole body were obtained at 24 and 48 hours.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-2-9**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are lower.
INDICATION: Preoperative assessment for AV fistula revision.

Final Report PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**3-6**]  HISTORY: Question abscess on previous chest radiograph, does not seem to have pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-2**] and [**3-4**]:  The right perihilar lung has cleared at least radiographically since [**3-4**], [**2175**], probably due to decreasing moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
C. diff was negative and CT abd/pelvis was without infectious etiology.
Lung also possible but initial CXR unremarkable.
CNS possible source given fever and AMS although less likely with CT findings and absence of meningeal signs on PEx.
For the work up of her fevers/baceremia she then underwent a TTE which was unrevealing and an U/S of her fistula/graft and stent in her left IJ which were also unrevealing.
Her SBP at that time was 54.
ACLS was started and her pulse returned after 8 minutes.
During her MICU stay, her hypovolemic shock was stabilized and her HD access issues were addressed with renal, ID, and transplant surgery.
She was transferred back to the floor on daptomycin at this point but still growing positive blood cultures with Staph aureus.
Repeat TTE on [**2-23**] was negative for vegetations.
A WBC scan showed small tracer uptake at the graft site, without any other source in the body.
Since that time her blood cultures have remained negative and she was able to have a tunneled HD catheter placed for long term HD access.
She has diastolic HF based on prior TTE and CXR with signs of mild fluid overload, but no signs of respiratory distress.
TSH was 3.4 during this admission.
Baseline hematocrit of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.
Her hematocrit returned to baseline s/p massive transfusion protocol for her hypovolemic shock/PEA arrest and continued to remain stable throughout the rest of her hospital admission.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
An extensive workup was conducted throughout your body and it was determined that the bacteria was coming from an infection in your AV fistula/graft.
You continued to have positive blood cultures despite being on IV antibiotics after this time and ultimately had a graft revision by transplant surgery after which time your blood cultures remained negative.
