The patient arrived with the following prior labwork: urine cx from [**10-30**] was known to have ESBL E coli and VSE, urine cx from [**11-13**] that ultimately grew ESBL E coli and yeast.
Vanc was subsequently discontinued once the patient stabilized and urine culture was negative.
# Labile blood pressure: Several hours after being admitted to the floor, triggered for BP in the low 80s, subjective malaise / lethargy, and decreased attention.
ABG was reassuring.
# Hypoxia / Possible infiltrate on CXR: Possible infiltrate on CXR: Patchy R Base infiltrate on CXR on admission was concerning for PNA and in the setting of labile pressures, was empirically covered with meropenem.
Saturations were in the low 90s on RA on discharge.
Atypical, non-specific chest pain: Presentation per the patient's usual non-specific CP.
CK & Trop flat x 3.
Echo EF > 50%.
CXR was suggested of pulmonary edema.
The day of discharge a nuclear stress test was performed that showed a partially reversible inferior wall defect with associated hypokinesis and reversible low inferolateral ischemia associated with hypokinesis; EF was 43% from 63% in [**2164**] and EDV was elevated at 104cc.
You were briefly transferred to the ICU for close observation and fluids until your blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
We performed numerous tests which showed that you were not having a heart attack.
