Admission Date:  [**2107-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-6-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial drain placement and removal PEG placement PICC placement Intubation/extubation, mechanical ventilation Thoracentesis X2 (bilaterally)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70 yo man with ho DM2, HTN, and recent diagnoses of AFib who was transferred from OSH on [**2107-1-10**] for evaluation of pericardial effusion.
TTE at that time showed LVEF of 25%.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and possible pericardiocentesis since effusion appears to progress.
On transfer his echo showed tamponade changes and he was transfered to the CCU for pericardial drainage.
Repeat echo [**1-13**] showed no reaccumulation of fluid.
Then pt became more somulent and a ABG showed 7.19/92/56 on a shovel mask with 2 liters.
HR was in the 80s and BP in 120s.

Lymphocytes, monocytes, and mesothelial cells.
Right heart catheterization prior to pericardiocensis showed elevation and equalization of diastolic filling pressures (20-22mmHg) that were similar to the opening pericardial pressure (19mmHg).
The opening pericardial pressure was 19 mmHg.
Subsequent to removal of 920 cc of blood fluid (all sent for studies) and confirmation by echocardiography of complete fluid removal, the pericardial pressure decreased to -2 to 1 mmHg and RA pressure decreased to 15 mmHg.
CT HEAD [**1-11**]: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
ECHO [**1-11**] #1: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: Large pericardial effusion with echo evidence of impaired filling/tamponade physiology.
ECHO [**1-11**] #2: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-11**], pericardial effusion (post tap) has resolved.
ECHO [**1-13**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
CT chest [**1-19**]: 1.
CT chest [**1-27**]: 1.
ECHO [**1-24**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
ECHO [**1-28**]: The left and right atrium are moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-24**], global biventricular systolic function is less vigorous (now low normal), c/w diffuse process.
A CT showed a pericardial effusion and RML PNA.
After failing multiple speech and swallow evaluations, the plan was for the patient to receive a PEG (once his INR was within acceptable limits).
EEG was c/w metabolic encephalopathy, but common metabolic causes ruled out (normal folate/B12).
An urgent head CT was ordered that did not demonstrate e/o of an acute intracranial process.
Carotid U/S demonstrated <40% stenosis on L and 40-60% on R. Recommended MRI, but patient could not tolerate MRI without sedation.
Diagnostic thoracentesis showed exudative processes.
Ultimately, thoracenteses were done bilaterally, removing 3.5-4 liters total.
All the fluid studies came back suggestive of exudative processes.
Repeat CT chest & a CXR performed on the day of discharge did not show signs of infection, malignancy or reaccumulation of fluid.
Etiology for patient's large pleural effusions remains unclear but the patient may benefit from anti-histone serology or cardiac MRI for further work-up if his effusions recur.
They felt that he was safe for discharge, but felt he would benefit from a sleep study to further evaluate the etiology of his apnea and determine whether he could benefit from CPAP once his delirium improved.
Pericardial fluid is negative for malignant cells.
Repeat TTE demonstrated no reaccumulation of the effusion, so drain was pulled on [**1-13**].
Repeat ECHOs showed no reaccumulation of pericardial effusion and patient's physical exam remained benign.
Repeat ECHO on [**1-28**], after removal of large pleural effusions (and pericardial effusion), showed global biventricular systolic function was less vigorous (now low normal), consistent with a diffuse process.
Given the patient's functional baseline, however, myocardial biopsy was not pursued as an inpatient.
A CXR on [**2-1**] did not demonstrate evidence of pericardial or pleural effusions.
Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was found to have a suggestion of multifocal PNA on a CT dated [**1-9**].
Given the fact that the patient was intubated for 10 days, he may have had a HAP, but sputum cultures from OSH taken on [**1-4**] were negative.
CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions consistent with overload, but no obvious consolidation.
Of note, multiple blood, urine and sputum cultures were drawn which were all no growth to date for an infectious etiology to his symptoms.
These episodes resolved, but he also had intermittent episodes of AF with RVR that responded to IV Metoprolol.
Urine Osm?????
His sodium normalized and he was discharged with serum Na of 140. .
Upon transfer out of the MICU back to the floor, patient's creatinine was back to baseline at 0.4 where it continued to be until discharge.
Urology was consulted and recommended an outpatient cystoscopy.
His hematuria improved after anticoagulation was held, but resumed with restarting Coumadin.
Guaiac was negative at OSH.
Fe studies showed 19% saturation, Fe 43, and Ferritin 1190, consistent with ongoing inflammation and possible mild Fe deficiency.
His hematocrit did intermittently decrease to lows of 23, felt likely due to the procedures he underwent.
He did not require any pRBC transfusions while in the MICU or on the medicine floor and was discharged with a Hct of 24.8. .
His blood pressures were well-controlled on this regimen.
The drain was pulled out 3 days later after an echocardiogram confirmed no more accumulation of fluid.
Your heart rhythm showed atrial flutter / atrial fibrillation, which are arrythmias coming from the top of your heart.
You will need to be on blood thinners for further stroke prevention.
