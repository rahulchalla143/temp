The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed no significant coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate left atrial dilatation, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was admitted preoperatively to discontinue her Coumadin, to be started on heparin, and an amiodarone load.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination at the time of admission revealed vital signs with temperature of 98.1, blood pressure of 103/67, heart rate of 70, respiratory rate of 18, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular, a [**1-19**] holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Echocardiogram from [**1-11**] showed a normal ejection fraction with 4+ mitral regurgitation, mild left atrial dilatation, dilated right ventricle, hypokinetic right ventricular systolic dysfunction, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension.
Electrocardiogram at the time of admission showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 55, normal axis, T wave flipped in III and F, T wave inversions in V1 through V3, and flipped in V4 and V5.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data on admission revealed a sodium of 141, potassium of 3.6, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 20, creatinine of 0.6, glucose of 110.
White blood cell count of 9.4, hematocrit of 33.2, platelets of 377.
PT of 13.3, PTT of 69.4, INR of 1.2.
It was noted that her hematocrit was 22, and her urine output was somewhat diminished; and, therefore, she received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
She was begun on Lasix, and an echocardiogram was done to check her valvular function.
The echocardiogram showed normal valvular function with no evidence of pericardial effusion at that time.
Her hematocrit was noted, on postoperative day five, to be 19.7.
Over the next several days, the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit as she continued to have complete heart block while awaiting for evaluation for a permanent pacemaker.
The patient remained on the Cardiothoracic Recovery Floor for the next several days while awaiting for her INR to get into therapeutic range.
On postoperative day 18, it was felt that the patient was stable and ready for discharge to home as soon as her INR was therapeutic; at that time it was 1.9 with the cutoff being 2.
An additional INR will be checked on the afternoon on postoperative day 18.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  Vital signs revealed temperature of 97.9, heart rate of 83, blood pressure of 104/62, respiratory rate of 18, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
Weight preoperatively was 72.9 kg, at discharge weight was 66.9 kg.
Physical examination revealed alert and oriented times three, moved all extremities, conversant.
Respiratory was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell count of 10.9, hematocrit of 28.3, platelets of 575.
Sodium of 137, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 95, bicarbonate of 31, blood urea nitrogen of 31, creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 78.
INR was pending.
(to keep INR between 2.5 and 3).
