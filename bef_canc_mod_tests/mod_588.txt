His white blood count was elevated and he was also in acute renal failure, but his creatinine was already trending down from 4.1 at the outside hospital to 2.1 upon admission here.
Workup for the source of his bacteremia was undertaken with CAT scan of the torso without evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis, although lumbar spine imaging was suboptimal due to the patient's metallic hardware.
The CAT scan did show multilobar pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
Echocardiogram on [**1-30**] showed no evidence of vegetations, left ventricular ejection fraction of 59% and no focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient's antibiotic regimen was switched numerous times in the Intensive Care Unit, but eventually changed to just Vancomycin after a negative workup and after the patient's sputum grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE [**Hospital1 18**] INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: Temperature 99.0, heart rate 105, blood pressure 112/63, satting 100% on ventilator.
PERTINENT DIAGNOSTICS ON ADMISSION TO THE [**Hospital1 18**] INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  White blood cell count 14, hematocrit 30.7, platelets 158.
INR of 2.6.
PT 19.6, PTT 34.2.
Chemistries within normal limits except BUN and creatinine of 70/2.1.
ALT 83, AST 182, CK 2286.
Patient's white blood count trended down and was within normal limits by the time he was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit.
Infectious Disease workup in the Intensive Care Unit was done as outlined in the history of present illness including CAT scan of the torso, echocardiogram, and blood cultures.
On the medicine floor, MRI of the spine with and without contrast showed no evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis, but the study is limited by metallic lumbar spine hardware.
MRI of the head with and without contrast showed bilateral subdural hematomas without enhancing lesions or acute hemorrhage.
Surveillance blood cultures did not grow bacteria.
The subclavian catheter tip was sent for culture and did not grow any bacteria either.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was completed on [**2145-2-16**] to evaluate for endocarditis and showed no evidence of valvular vegetations, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal wall motion, normal cavity sizes.
Vancomycin peak and trough serum levels were tested and were at target, so the patient was continued on his current dosing.
Patient's CKs trended down to within normal limits by the time of transfer to the Medicine floor from the ICU, and the patient denied muscular pain at that time.
Acute renal failure:  Patient's acute renal failure resolved with hydration in the Intensive Care Unit and BUN and creatinine remained within normal limits the remainder of his hospital stay.
MRI of the head without contrast on [**2-7**] showed no evidence of stroke, or mass, or mass effect.
EEG on [**2-7**] showed encephalopathy, but no evidence of seizure activity.
Lumbar puncture with pleural guidance by Interventional Radiology on [**2-8**] revealed cerebrospinal fluid within normal limits.
Vitamin B12, folate, and RPR were within normal limits.
Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 levels were also within normal limits.
A 24 hour bedside push button EEG was performed and was also within normal limits without changes during aphasic periods.
based on his albumin adjusted serum levels.
Patient's blood pressures remained very well controlled on the Medicine floor with metoprolol 100 b.i.d.
Patient also restarted on his Neurontin, which he was on as an outpatient with a starting dose of 200 b.i.d.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable between 28 and 30 throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Iron studies were most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
