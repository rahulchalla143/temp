male with pmh significant for CAD s/p PCI to LAD, LMCA and LCX in [**2163**], chronically occluded RCA with L->R collaterals, dilated cardiomyopathy of [**11-5**]% presenting to his outpatient Cardiologist with several weeks of lethargy, and found to be bradycardic with HR in the 30's.
EKG in office showed Junctional bradycardia at a rate of 30, blood pressure 60/palp.
In the ED his HR remained in the 30-40's with blood pressure of 110/50.
He developed an increased oxygen requirement with O2 saturation 60-70% on NRB.
Head CT was performed to rule out CVA as cause of bradycardia and was found to be negative for acute bleed.
Patient was also found to be in acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.5 from baseline 2.5.
Repeat K was 5.0.
Diqoxin level was found to be 0.7.
Repeat K was 5.0.
Given his progressive hypoxia he was intubated with O2 saturation of 100% on FiO2 100%.
His vitals were HR 37-39, blood pressure (77-116)/(33-46).
On [**1-13**] the patient had increased creatinine detected on routine labs, which resulted in a decrease of his bumex from 4mg to 3mg PO BID.
He then experienced a 5lb increased weight gain and had his bumex increased to 4mg PO BID on [**2167-1-23**].

**  An 86 man with a history of CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF 15%, presented with junctional bradycardia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension.
#Hypotension: MAP on admission was 55.
Recent vitals from outpatient records show baseline BP 95/40.
Peripheral dopamine and fluid boluses were initially given to maintain MAP >60.
Cardiac ischemia was on the differential as well, but EKG without ischemic changes and elevated troponin likely [**2-23**] renal failure.
CXR with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of CHF.
#Acute renal failure: Creatinine was 5.5, up from baseline of 2.5.
Blood and [**Month/Day (2) **] cultures as well as stool for c diff were negative.
EKG was without ischemic changes, troponin was elevated, likely secondary to renal failure, but CK was normal and there was low suspicion for acute ischemia.
Sarna cream was continued.
