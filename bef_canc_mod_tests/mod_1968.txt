The EKG at that time showed ST-elevations in the inferior leads, ST depressions in V2-3, lead 1 and AVL.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where he was found to have three-vessel disease.
In summary, the catheterization showed total occlusion of the proximal RCA, for which the procedures of PTCA and stenting had been performed.
The PA pressures were 22/12 with wedge of 8.
The patient transiently dropped his blood pressure to the 70s during the RCA intervention requiring dopamine times one hour.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's physical examination, at the time of admission, revealed the temperature 94.8; heart rate 83; blood pressure 123/77; respiratory rate 16; O2 saturation 100% on two liters nasal prongs.
Fingerstick blood sugar 333.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema; 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Data on admission revealed the white count of 6.6; hematocrit 41.3; platelets 442; PT 12.7; PTT 23.3; INR 1.1; sodium 136; potassium 4.9; chloride 99; CO2 27; BUN 16; creatinine 1.0; glucose 351; CPK 82.
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates, edema, or effusions, no congestive heart failure.
The EKG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 with a normal axis, intervals 184/144/12; 2-mm ST elevation in leads 2, 3 and AVF; ST depression ?????
At the time of transfer, the patient had an arterial line, CVP line, two ventricular, and two atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal and a left pleural chest tube.
He had a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm, with a mean arterial pressure of 74, CVP of 6 and he was on propofol at 10 mcg per kg per minute, as well as Neo-Synephrine infusion between .25 and .75 mcg per kg per minute to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure.
At the time of discharge, the patient's physical examination was as follows:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98; heart rate 100 sinus rhythm; blood pressure 109/66; respiratory rate 18; O2 saturation 97% on room air.
Weight, preoperatively, is 86.3 kg; on discharge 84.4 kg.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the white count of 5.3, hematocrit 25.8; platelets 435; sodium 140; potassium 4.0; chloride 104, CO2 28; BUN 15; creatinine 0.9; glucose 165.
Respiratory was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
