CXR with possible LLL infiltrate and mild to moderate central congestion.
BNP 937.
He was subsequently intubated for his worsening hypoxia and also to improve his ability to get a CT head.
Neurosurgery recommended repeating the CT head to fully evaluate for SAH, which upon repeat was negative.
His pressures were reportedly in the 180s/100s upon transfer and therefore was given 1gm of nitro paste prior to arrival.

Hazy central opacities, with Kerley B lines demonstrated in the periphery, are compatible with central [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with mild-to-moderate interstitial edema, worse on the right.
[**12-21**]: Echo IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-6-5**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now seen with mild right ventricular cavity dilation and free wall hypokinesis.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is no longer appreciated (may be due to technical factors)  [**12-20**] CT Head: Limited study due to motion despite multiple acquisitions.

The sputum gram stain revealed GNR diplocci, and GPC in pairs and the pt was given Vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin initially to cover for hospital acquired pathogens including MRSA and pseudomonas and was switched to Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin and then to Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin on [**12-21**] to cover CAP.
His sputum cx grew out Moraxella and his antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin on [**12-23**].
The patients cortisol was normal ruling out adrenal insufficiency and he had an echo that showed LVEF>55%.
Presumably the patient has a low baseline BP and an inciting event (MI, PE) occured prior to presentation that resulted in hypotension and AMS.
His hypotension resolved and he was successfully weaned off of pressors on [**12-25**].
EKG and rhythm analysis was consistent with AVNRT.
On the floor he was transitioned from diltiazem to metoprolol 25mg three times per day, which helped his heart rate control.
Pts hypoxia was most likely secondary to V/Q mismatch from PNA on top of baseline significant restrictive lung disease from IPF.
He had a CXR on [**12-23**] that looked like he may have some pulmonary edema and a lasix gtt was started with attempt to diurese and improve respiratory status.
#) Elevated troponin and CKMB: The patient intitially had a troponin= 0.33 which was most likely secondary to demand ischemia and not an NSTEMI given lack of chest pain, stable enzymes and overall septic picture.
#) Acute Renal Failure due to Acute Tubular Necrosis: The patient presented with a creatinine= 2.4 which was likely secondary to hypotension/shock leading to ischemic ATN as the creatinine trended down to baseline of 1.0 with IVF hydration.
