Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**9-27**] CT Head w/o con: 1.
CXR was c/w pulmonary edema and the patient became hypotensive.
A CXR revealed multifocal pneumonia and an ECHO showed a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, normal LV systolic function (LVEF>55%), and no clinically significant valvular disease.
