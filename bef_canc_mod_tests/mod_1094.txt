Blood cultures 2/29 and [**2-14**] pending at discharge .
EKG  [**2132-2-9**]  9:31:30 PM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-2-8**] no change.
CXR  [**2132-2-11**] 2:39 AM Patient is rotated to the left, which should increase the relative opacity of the right hemithorax.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAS [**2132-2-11**] IMPRESSION: 1.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2132-2-12**] at 2:38:20 PM The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 50-60%).
The test was stopped at an achieved submaximal target workload of 80% age-predicted HR max.
There were no significant ST segment changes throughout the study (normalization noted in lead V2 during exercise).
Appropriate blood pressure and heart rate responses to exercise.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 52%.
He was transferred to the ICU where cultures were sent but patient had no obvious source of infection based on exam.
Chest imaging suggested possible aspiration pneumonia, but urine culture from [**2-11**] was negative and u/a from [**1-/2049**] was negative.
Cultures were pending at the time of transfer out of the ICU, but resulted shortly thereafter as gram negative rods later confirmed as pseudomonas.
Abdominal source of infection was considered as the patient had a history of  diverticulosis, however, in the absence of associated symptoms or exam findings, further evaluation with imaging was not pursued.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative for >24hours prior to discharge.
Cardiac echo later revealed no wall motion abnormalities.
Exercise stress test with Sestamibi revealed no anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes and normal myocardial perfusion.
You were treated first with medications with plan to get a cardiac catheterization to check for a blocked artery.
A stress test showed that your heart muscle is working well.
Please follow up with a cardiologist for further evaluation after your infection is fully treated.
