Given her creatinine increase her zaroxylyn and lasix were held for the 3 days prior to admission, with a resultant increase in weight by 3 pounds.
On the day of admission, the patient was noted to have RR 30 with O2 sat on RA of 68% with mildly decreased mentation.
In the ED, and EKG revealed lateral ST depressions, creatinine 1.6.
CXR revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with decompensated CHF.
Also given solumedrol and levaquin for WBC 17.9.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy:  TTE-[**9-11**] EF 20 %, 3+MR, 1+TR 3.
Family History: non-contributory  Pertinent Results: EKG: Sinus rhythm Long QTc interval Q's in the inferior leads consider old inferior infarct Poor R wave progression consider probable anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia Lateral ST-T wave changes less pronounced than previous  CXR [**3-10**]: The diffuse perivascular haze greater on the right than on the left has regressed since the most recent study but has not completely disappeared, indicating improved congestive heart failure.

female with history of three vessel disease (99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA), NSTEMI 8.04, CHF with EF 20%, 3+ MR, who has repeatedly refused CABG/cath, admitted for respiratory failure in setting of rising BUN/creatinine (baseline 1.2).
CHF exacerbation:  Resolved with diuresis and BIPAP support, as CXR with marked improvement, diuresed to -2.5 L since admission, O2 requirement decreased to room air.
Pt did flash again on [**3-10**] AM, thought d/t ischemia with a CK peak of 216.
Pt will need daily weights and lung exams with diuresis as needed.
Continue ASA, simvastatin, carvedilol, and ticlopidine, which was added on this admission.
She was placed on IV heparin for two days and her cardiac enzymes trended down.
Pt refused cath and was managed medically with aforementioned drugs.
After diuresis and correction of CHF exacerbation, pt's creatinine on discharge was 1.3.
Discharged with Hct of 30.
DM: Pt's AM blood glucoses were in the low 100's.
