On [**2-16**] she was found by her family at rehabilitation to be unresponsive except to painful stimuli, hypoxic, and febrile to 104.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
She was intubated and started on pressors and antibiotics; including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.
Her right arm was found to be swollen, and an ultrasound revealed a deep venous thrombosis.
She then developed a narrow complex tachycardia with a systolic blood pressure in the 110s with a palpable carotid pulse.
The patient was intermittently febrile, but cultures were not revealing.
She did develop positive cultures on [**3-15**] and [**3-16**]; which were not treated as there had been no change in her clinical status.
Her urinalysis was negative for signs of infection.
An echocardiogram in [**2106-1-30**] showed a left atrium of normal size.
The left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size were normal.
The left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic with an ejection fraction of greater than 75%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed temperature was 95.6, heart rate was 108, blood pressure was 125/49, and respiratory rate was 25.
The chest revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed sodium was 145, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 17, blood urea nitrogen was 90, creatinine was 1.5, and blood glucose was 124.
ALT was 160, AST was 191, amylase was 524, alkaline phosphatase was 397, lipase was 68, and total bilirubin was 12.2.
White blood cell count was 17.6, hematocrit was 22, and platelets were 82.
Prothrombin time was 13.6, partial thromboplastin time was 30.1, and INR was 1.2.
A urinalysis had moderate leukocyte esterase, moderate blood, negative nitrites, trace protein, moderate bilirubin, greater than 50 white blood cells, greater than 50 red blood cells, many bacteria, and 3 to 5 squamous epithelial cells.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the head done on [**2-16**] showed minimal mucosal thickening present in the right maxillary sinus and within the ethmoid air cells; otherwise, no acute process.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2-19**] showed no evidence of cholecystitis with septated fluid regions representing metastatic spread adjacent to the liver.
An upper extremity ultrasound from [**2-24**] showed an occluding thrombus in the right cephalic vein.
A abdominal ultrasound from [**3-2**] showed no intrahepatic bowel ductal dilation.
A chest x-ray done on [**3-18**] showed an increasing left pleural effusion, retrocardiac, and a right lower lobe opacity which may have been atelectasis versus pneumonia.
A sputum from [**3-15**] had greater than 25 white blood cells, less than 10 epithelial cells, and had 4+ gram-negative rods, yeast, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A urine culture from [**3-16**] grew greater than 100,000 Klebsiella which was pan-resistant except for to meropenem and Zosyn.
A urinalysis from [**3-16**] was negative for nitrites and leukocyte esterase.
She was transfused to keep her hematocrit above 21.
The patient required multiple blood transfusions to keep her hematocrit above 21.
Her vital signs were stable.
On [**3-29**], the patient was noted to have a large amount of frank blood output from her nasogastric tube.
Again, she required transfusions to keep her hematocrit above 21.
She was noted to have a coagulopathy with an INR of 1.7.
This was reversed with vitamin K.  The patient was transfused several units of platelets as well as units of packed red blood cells to maintain a platelet count of above 50 and a hematocrit level above 21.
A Gastroenterology consultation was obtained once again.
On [**4-2**] she required an additional transfusion of platelets to keep her platelet count above 50.
Her hematocrit was stable at that time at 27 to 28.
