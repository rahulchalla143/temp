Past Medical History:  Past Medical History: hypertension and negative for myocardial infarction, angina, diabetes, colitis, stroke, ulcer, lung disease, thyroid disease, hepatitis, gout, sciatica, and glaucoma.
A bladder diverticulum was described at that time.

Initial u/s of kidneys done on [**8-6**] showed moderate-to-severe left-sided hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter.
A L percutaneous nephrostomy was placed under IR on [**8-6**] and follow-up u/s done on [**8-12**] showed almost complete resolution of hydronephrosis on the L.  His creatinine trended down during the admission and on discharge, was 2.6.
He maintained good urine output through the nephrostomy and urostomy and had no electrolyte shifts from post-obstructive diuresis.
All blood cultures were been negative and urine culture from [**8-6**] was growing yeast only (speciated as [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**]).
Towards the end of his stay, his WBC rose (detailed below) thus UA and UCtx were obtained from his nephrostomy and urostomy.
Urine from urostomy did have many bacteria, +leuk esterase, 100 proteins, 15 WBC, but this is likely due to contamination.
Thought initially to be caused by UTI given negative blood cultures to date.
Patient does have prior pelvic imaging ([**7-16**]) notable for simple fluid collections within, likely postoperative lymphoceles.
The patient underwent IR sampling of the fluid collections on [**8-13**] which returned as gram stain negative, cultures pending.
Colorectal team was followed him during this admission and recommending increasing Imodium to 4 mg TID after which his ostomy output decreased.
He will need an ostomy take-down (thought best not to do this during this admission, given were actively treating him for infection), which will be done as an outpatient likely within the next couple of weeks.
RBC smear negative for schistocytes.
Tbili, LDH, and haptoglobin were not consistent with hemolysis.
Hct on discharge was 27.1 .
Transitional Issues: 1) Medication changes: please refer to discharge planning 2) F/u appointments: please refer to discharge planning 3) Outstanding tests: bacterial/fungal/anaerobic culture from pelvic fluid collections ([**8-13**]), stool culture and campylobacter culture ([**8-12**]), urine culture from nephrostomy and urostomy ([**8-12**]), blood culture ([**8-8**]) 4) Antibiotics: please continue fluconazole 200 mg daily until [**8-26**]  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
For your infection, you were initially covered broadly with 2 antibiotics (daptomycin, meropenem) and 2 antifungals (fluconazole, meropenem) but this was narrowed to fluconazole only given that all blood cultures were negative and you were found to have yeast growing in your urine that was sensitive to fluconazole.
Your creatinine trended down during your admission (was XXX on discharge) and renal ultrasound on [**8-12**] showed no hydronephrosis on the R and minimal hydronephrosis on the L.  You had high ostomy output (up to 2.3 liters daily) which improved upon increasing your [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] recommendations from the colorectal team.
Towards the end of your stay, your white blood cell count increased up to 22,200, which was concerning for infection although you had no clinical signs or symptoms of infection on exam.
Prior CT and ultrasound had demonstrated two large pelvic fluid collections which we were worried may have become infected.
On [**8-13**], you underwent sampling of the pelvic fluid collections which showed XXX.

Medication Changes: 1) Please stop taking ciprofloxacin 2) Please continue taking fluconazole 200 mg daily until [**8-26**] 3) Please take acetaminophen (Tylenol) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1999**] mg every 6 hours for pain or fever 4) Please take loperamide ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 28303**]) 4 mg three times daily for diarrhea  Follow-up Appointments: Please see below  Followup Instructions: Please call your PCP (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 131**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 133**]) to make an appointment within the next 2 weeks.
