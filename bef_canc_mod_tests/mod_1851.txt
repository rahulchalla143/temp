Hct was initialy 16.7 in the ED.
She had a bedside EGD, was placed on PPI [**Hospital1 **], and had [**Hospital1 **] hct checks.
EGD was revealing for bleeding ulcers that were clipped and cauterized (see full report below).
Oxygen saturation dropped post-procedure and patient was hyperventilating, CXR revealed left left lower lobe collapse.
IgA nephropathy in [**2169**] - hemodialysis dependant since [**2193**].
Physical Exam: VITALS: T 98.4, HR 98, BP 178/80 99 100%RA GENERAL: Awake, alert, oriented x3 with flat affect in moderate distress complaining of headache.
CHEST: Lungs clear to auscultation on upper lung fields.

IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2195-2-27**] 6:48 PM The mediastinum is shifted to the left, which in combination with new left retrocardiac opacity is consistent with left lower lobe collapse.
ECG Study Date of [**2195-2-27**]  8:26:06 AM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-7-31**] no change.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2195-2-28**] 3:55 AM  REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with left lower lobe bronchus impaction.
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to the previous study obtained on [**2195-2-27**] at 7:13.
ECG Study Date of [**2195-2-28**]  10:48:58 AM Sinus rhythm.
Her hematocrit at admission was 16.
EGD was revealing for esophagitis, non-bleeding gastric ulcer, and a large bleeding vessel in the duodenal bulb, which was clipped and cauterized.
# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had a hematocrit of 16.7 at admission, [**2-21**] UGIB.
Patient's hematocrit continued to rise and she was discharged with a stable hematocrit at 27.4 .
# ESRD - Patient has a h/o IgA nephropathy in [**2169**], and a renal transplant in [**2173**].
She had hemodialysis x2 while inpatient, and her blood pressure dropped after each treatment to an SBP in the 150s.
However, after her first inpatient hemodialysis and upon transfer to the floor, her blood pressure rose dramatically (SBPs 180-190s) and she was given 10mg IV hydralazine to a minimum effect, she also reported a severe headache and nausea.
Labetalol 200mg QID was re-started with a stable hematocrit at 27.5, and her symptoms resolved and blood pressure dropped to SBPs 140s.
Her blood pressures continued to stay with SBPs in the 170-180s.
It is unclear what her baseline blood pressure on medications is at home.
Refractory high BP could be [**2-21**] increases in intravascular fluid after multiple tranfusions.
After 2nd inpatient hemodialysis patient's blood pressure dropped to 150/79.
# Left lower lobe lung collapse: After patient had EGD procedure in the MICU, her oxygen saturation dropped and she began to hyperventilate.
1st CXR revealed LLL collapse, 2nd CXR revealed resolving LLL collapse and LUL non-resolving atelectasis.
While inpatient she had good oxygen saturation (95-100% on RA), did incentive spirometry x10/hr, and ambulated.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a bleeding duodenal ulcer and had an endoscopy where the gastroenterologists were able to stop the bleeding.
Please call your physician if you experience any of the following: recurrence of foul smelling black stools, bright red blood in your vomit or stools, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, and worsening abdominal pain.
3) [**4-24**] arrive at 8:30am for a 9:30 am repeat endoscopy with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2795**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 908**].
