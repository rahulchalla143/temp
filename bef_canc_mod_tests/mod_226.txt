Once at the hospital she received HD, was given a dose of vancomycin, and blood cultures were sent.
The blood cultures showed [**1-10**] S. aureus from 6/24 per [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] Micro-lab.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she started reporting having HAs, she then had an acute decline in mental status and was found to have ICHs on CT of head, likely from septic embolic and complicated by her uremic coagulopathy and ITP.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**6-15**] Echo - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-6-8**], the vegetation appears similar in length and mobility, but of much smaller diameter.
[**6-18**] CT abdomen - Limited evaluation of the lung bases demonstrate bibasilar opacities, consistent with airspace disease.
These appear improved when compared with the prior examination of [**2176**].
A son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign was not present.
[**6-19**] Ct of head FINDINGS: There has been interval evolution of multiple large bilateral parenchymal hematomas, without change in size, surrounding edema, or mass effect, consistent with evolution of hemorrhages.
[**6-29**] CXR -  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-19**], there has been placement of a right central catheter that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
The patient also began to have a nose bleed and a stat head CT was performed that showed large bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages in bilateral frontal lobes and left occipital lobe with surrounding edema.
Pt had blood cultures drawn at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] that showed MSSA bacteremia as well as a TTE that showed vegatation on the mitral leaflet.
After the transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] repeat blood cultures were drawn.
The cultures drawn from [**6-4**] and [**6-5**] were positive for S. aureus.
A TTE was performed and confirmed the moderate vegatation on the mitral leaflet.
Because no source of infection was found in cultures or CT scans, [**Month/Year (2) 621**] was switched again to ceftriaxone to cover MSSA on [**6-24**].
Of note, second echocardiogram during hospitalization showed interval decreased size of her vegetation.
# ITP: The patient had a platelet level was 68 on admission.
DIC labs were checked.
Has had stable blood pressures the past week and a half before discharge.
# Hypotension - had transitory hypotension while in the MICU which was responsive to fluid boluses.
# Abdominal pain - had several days of abdominal pain and had a CT scan and ultrasound that was negative.
She is afebrile and her vital signs have been stable for about 1-2 weeks now and her mental status has been continuously improving.
