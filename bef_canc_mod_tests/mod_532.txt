REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval for infiltrate/interval change REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation for interval change in a patient with bilateral pleural effusions.
The cardiac silhouette is markedly increased due to known right atrial enlargement and pericardial effusion.

The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-6-15**], both atria are even more dilated (massive biatrial enlargement is present) and th tricuspid regurgitation is now frankly severe.
Pleural effusions, CHF, and dementia.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from the same day.
CT of the torso from [**2112-6-16**] and CT from [**2111-9-26**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed before and after intravenous contrast.
Considered PE, however, with quick improvement did not believe it was high likely and CTA was not considered.
