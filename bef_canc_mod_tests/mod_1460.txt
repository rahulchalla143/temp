Per GI recs, IV solumedrol was started, and patient went for tagged red cell scan to evaluate the right colon and small bowel which found ?rectal bleeding, not supported by flex sig findings.
Regardless, patient is refusing catheterization to cardiology who saw her in the ED and continued to refuse on the floor, understanding the risks of not intervening with catheterization (possible risk of continued ischemia and possible death).
We attempted to start metoprolol, but blood pressure and heart rate did not tolerate it resulting in a brief transfer to the MICU in the setting of hypotension and bradycardia which resolved with holding beta blockade.
Transfusion goal was HCT >30 by ACS protocol, ECG showed no ischemic changes and TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and preserved ejection fraction.
Cr 2.1 on admission.
