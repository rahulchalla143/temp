LV wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**2105-3-1**] CXR: Comparison with the previous study of [**2105-2-26**].
EKG without any new ischemic changes concerning for ACS and troponins were flat at 0.05 (pt with CKD).
Although he had a DVT in [**11/2104**], LENI on [**2105-2-20**] was negative for DVT in either leg.
Repeat CXR was concerning for fluid overload so he was diuresed with IV lasix.
ECHO showed worsened aortic regurgitation and prosthetic valve stenosis, so he was transfered to the [**Hospital1 1516**] cardiology service for further management.
Oxygen saturation is currently 95% on 2L nasal cannula, to be weaned as tolerated.
- He was noted to have brief apneic episodes during sleep, so we recommend an outpatient sleep study .
# H/o aortic valve replacement: ECHO shows moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and high transvalvular gradients c/w prosthetic valve stenosis.
# Coronaries: Cardiac cath in [**2085**] was negative for CAD, however recent ECHO revealed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferior wall consistent with CAD.
Patient w/o angina, EKG w/o ischemic changes, and troponins flat at 0.05 (patient has CKD).
# Hypercholesterolemia: Chol 131, TG 126, HDL 42, LDL 64.
Hct stable ~29-33.
