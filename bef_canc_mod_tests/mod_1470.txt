HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37 year-old year-old woman with a complicated past medical history including respiratory distress syndrome, aspergillus and tuberculosis leading to left pneumonectomy, bronchiectasis, congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy.
Her temperature was 99.4 at home.
In the Emergency Department O2 sat 92% on 2 liters increased to 100% on 2 liters after nebulization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2.
Blood pressure 98/43.
Heart rate 118.
Oxygen saturation 99% on 25% FIO2 BiPAP.
Heart tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, present S3.
Extremities 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, purplish color bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  Chem 7 138, 6.4, 88, 50, 37, 0.6, 145.
Calcium, magnesium, phos 9.4, 2.0, 4.3.
CBC 9.4, 40.8, 267.
Differential 68 neutrophils, 16% bands, 3% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes, 0 eosinophils, 1 baso, 1 atypical, 1 meta.
PT 11.6, PTT 38.7, INR 0.9, arterial blood gases 1:30 p.m., 7.15/151/294, at 2:25 p.m., 7.19/142/87 on 40% O2 with lactate of 1.0.
Chest x-ray, possible early pneumonia at right lung base, patchy increased density, some right pleural thickening versus small effusion, status post left pneumonectomy.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia rate at 113, right axis deviation.
Spirometry FEV1 equals 0.41, 13% of predicted, FVC equals 0.6, 15% of predicted, FEV1/FVC equals 68 87% of predicted.
Sputum cultures grew Xanthemonas.
After intensive suctioning and chest physical therapy the patient could tolerate even 1 liter transtracheal O2 with an oxygen saturation on 100%  Subacute decline necessitated reintubation [**2131-1-21**], and eventually patient underwent bedside percutaneous tracheostomy placement to facilitate ventilation and allow adequate suctioning.
She completed a fourteen day course, but appeared to have some increasing patchiness in her right lower lobe on chest film of [**2131-1-18**] and was restarted on Levo and Ceptaz after a fourteen day course had just completed.
In addition her sputum grew out Stenotrophomonas from the culture and was sensitive to Bactrim.
However, she has a sulfa allergy and a repeat culture was sent to determine the sensitivity as the initial plate had been discarded by the laboratory.
On [**1-21**] she remained afebrile with temperature of 98.6.
FEN:  The patient was initially thought not to be fluid overloaded, but over time it was noticed that her weight was increased and a goal was established to diurese her back to approximately her normal outpatient weight of 114 pounds.
