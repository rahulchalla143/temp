Multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are enlarged and measure up to 1 cm.

WBC SCAN ([**6-1**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute osteomyelitis, discitis or focal infection.
Additionally, blood cultures from and outside hospital showed coag neg staph in multiple bottles.
A CT scan of the lumbar spine was performed and showed erosive changes at L4-5 that were consistent with known chronic discitis.
It was noted, after the patient's admission to the MICU, that her blood pressures normally run low and this was kept in mind as we weaned down her pressors.
Neurosurgery recommended getting a CRP and a tagged WBC scan, which showed no evidence of acute osteomyelitis, discitis or focal infection.
At the time of transfer, all of her blood cultures from this hospital (including fungal cultures) were still pending.
Also, attempts were being made to obtain sensitivities from her cultures at the outside hospital.
