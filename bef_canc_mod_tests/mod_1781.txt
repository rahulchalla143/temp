Of note, during this hospitalization, she had new word-finding difficulties and a noncontrast head CT demonstrated a new interval focus of hypodensity in the L basal ganglia, concerning for acute to subacute ischemia, and new subtle hypodensity at the left cerebellum, also concerning for acute ischemia.
However, she could not tolerate CTs with contrast or MRIs so no further imaging was performed.
Neurology felt her symptoms did not correlate with the CT findings.
Today she presented to the ED with painful petechie all over her hands, feet, and legs.
She was dropping her SBP in 60s-70s, which somewhat responded to 3L NS.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2146-8-22**] low voltages are now seen in the precordial leads  [**2146-9-16**] CXR: Improved aeration of bilateral bases with some residual atelectasis.
There is slight increase in the right pleural effusion with potential increase in the right basal atelectasis but note is made that overlying devices are projecting over the right chest and the exam should be repeated for precise evaluation of the right hemithorax  [**2146-9-17**] CT abd/pelvis 1.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the size/site of the atrial septal defect.
LVEF >55%.
[**2146-9-21**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-17**], there is little overall change.
Limited study with no evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which could be reactive  [**2146-10-4**] TEE: Patent foramen ovale with bidirectional shunting at rest and anatomy not ideally suited for percutaneous closure.
DISCHARGE LABS [**2146-10-7**]: [**2146-10-7**] 06:05PM WBC-3.0* Hgb-9.1* Hct-27.1* Plt Ct-288*# [**2146-10-7**] 06:05PM Glucose-113 UreaN-23 Creat-0.8 Na-139 K-4.1 Cl-107 HCO3-25 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 47 year old woman with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Syndrome, multiple abdominal surgeries, resultant short gut syndrome, on chronic TPN, who presented with sepsis and paradoxical emboli.
# Klebsiella Bacteremia - The patient was admitted to the MICU with sepsis, likely [**12-27**] to line infection and was started on Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, and Micafungin empirically.
Initial BCx grew Klebsiella, sensitive to Ceftriaxone, so the patient was started on Ceftriaxone - last day [**2146-10-14**].
She was afebrile with no increase in WBC count during her hospitalization.
Blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 51017**] were negative.
UCx were negative as well.
The patient had a TTE on [**2146-9-19**] to look for vegetations - no vegetations were noted.
# ANEMIA: The patient was transfused with  2U PRBC in the MICU on [**9-17**] for Hct 21.4%, with improvement to 29.1%.
CT showed no large RP bleed.
# ASD: The patient has a known ASD, first noted on ECHO in [**2139**].
The TTE on [**2146-9-19**] showed new R->L shunt, thought to be [**12-27**] to increased pulmonary pressures from untreated PE from [**3-3**].
She was unable to undergo Cardiac MRI for better characterization, as she has b/l rods implanted in her femurs for prior leg fractures.
She had a TEE performed on [**2146-10-4**] that better characterized the ASD.
It was determined to be suboptimal for closure at this point, so the patient was started on anticoagulation to treat her PE and lower pulmonary pressures.
She was scheduled for outpatient EGD for further evaluation, but has missed all of the appointments in the past year [**12-27**] to hospitalizations.
# PE/Multiple line-related thromboses: The patient has a h/o of PE from [**2146-2-23**] that was untreated [**12-27**] to failure of AC with Coumadin (supratherapeutic INR [**12-27**] to interactions with Abx) and Lovenox (adverse reaction - painful welts developed on arms and abdomen).
She was admitted with painful petechiae on her fingers/toes and had episodes of word finding difficulties.
Further work-up for other causes of increased clotting was not done, as the patient has clear risks for clot formation from her multiple stents and indwelling line.
# LEUKOPENIA: The patient was noted to have leukopenia - WBC ~3, possibly from drug reaction.
WBC on discharge was 3.0.
You were also admitted with painful fingertips and toes, which was caused by blood clots.
You had an echocardiogram, which showed that the blood has started shunting from the right to the left side of the heart.
You underwent an EGD and TEE during this hospitalization to evaluate your esophagus and the hole in your heart.
