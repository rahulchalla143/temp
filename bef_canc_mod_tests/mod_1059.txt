He complained of dyspnea and was found to be have a hct of 18 and melenic stool on rectal exam.
He noted there that he had been weak and fatigued for the past two weeks and was found to have a hct of 18. .
In the ED, rectal exam revealed dark, guaiac positive stool; he refused NG-lavage or placement of central line or peripheral IV's.
He denied lightheadedness or dyspnea, his SBP's were initially in the 110's but drifted down to the 90's, and his ECG was unchanged.
He was transfused a total of 3 units PRBC's with increase in hematocrit from 18 -> 25.
Paracentesis was peformed with removal of 4.8 liters of serous fluid.
GI was consulted and is planning for EGD and colonoscopy on Monday.

Family History: Mother- HTN, ?died of MI; Father-83 yo and died of "old age"; no FH of cancer  Physical Exam: PE: T 98, BP 100/60, HR 70, RR 18, SpO2 97% on RA Gen: pleasant, chronically-ill male, fair function, non-toxic, NAD HEENT: anicteric, op clear with dry mucosa Neck: distended ej's that fill from above, not below, no lad, no thyromegaly CV: rrr, soft s1s2, [**3-6**] llsb systol murmur PULM: no resp distress or accessory muscle use, fair air movement, decreased breath sounds at bases ABD: firm, distended but not tense with positive fluid wave, large  ventral hernia (pt states chronic), mild diffuse tenderness BACK: no cva/vert tendrn, no sacral edema EXTREM: chronic venous stasis changes with scars from previous grafts, no edema NEURO: a&ox3, no focal cn/motor defect  Pertinent Results: [**2153-6-29**] 04:40PM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-1.84*# Hgb-5.8*# Hct-18.2*# MCV-99* MCH-31.7 MCHC-32.0 RDW-22.9* Plt Ct-272 .
[**2153-7-3**] 06:09AM BLOOD Hct-28.1* .
TTE [**2153-6-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The  estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-9-30**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and right ventricular cavity size have increased and global left ventricular systolic function is slightly worse.
EGD [**2153-7-2**]: *Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: 78m with cad, chf, tr, cardiac cirrhosis, reccurent avm-related gi bleeds, cri here with increasing abominal distension, fatigue, and a hct of 18. .
Bleed is known to be slow and chronic, and patient maintains symptomatic and hemodynamic tolerance of low hematocrit.
There, he refused multiple interventions, including foley to monitor u/o, NG-lavage, and peripheral IV's, stating he's aware that he may become very ill or die without these interventions.
In the MICU, he received 3 units PRBC's with increase in hematocrit from 18.2 to 25.7.
He was subsequently transferred to the medicine unit and under went enteroscopy which revealed multiple non-bleeding AVM's; cautery was performed.
His hematocrit was 28.1 on the morning of discharge.
INR 1.1, indicating preserved synthetic liver function.
TTE was repeated during this hospitalization, revealing an ejection fraction of 35% with unchanged severe (4+) tricuspid regurgitation.
4) Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine ~1.2 was at baseline during this hospitalization, improved from previous hospitalization.
He was started on Bactrim for UTI, but this was disconinued after urine culture returned with no growth.
You underwent an EGD with cautery of several blood vessels.
Followup Instructions: You are scheduled to undergo an outpatient paracentesis on [**7-17**] at 10:30  a.m.
