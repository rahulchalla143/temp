Nevertheless, the patient's oxygen requirement resolved despite repleting fluids and subsequent chest x-rays demonstrated resolution of the patient's pulmonary congestion.
Sepsis, though intitially treated empirically, and MI were ruled out based on negative blood cultures and reassuring cardiac enzymes/ECG as above.
