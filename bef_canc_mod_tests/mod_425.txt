He had [**Name (NI) 7792**] on admission in setting of severe anemia Then, had repeat [**Name (NI) 7792**] on [**5-7**] in setting of high fever and tachycardia with troponin peak of 3.0 and CK pear in the 700's.
Cardiac cath repeated on [**5-8**] and unchanged since [**2-/2125**]: LM 50%, mLAD 60%, LCx 60%, T.O.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed transbronchial biopsy of the mediastinum, which showed a clot in the right bronchus and negative cytology.
During this whole time he was diuresed for potential CHF, but his fluid status was unclear so a swan was placed with initial wedge 62/30 wedge 14-24 CO 5.9 CI 2.6 SVR 1100.
Pulmonary was consulted and performed bronchoscopy with negative cultures and negative cytology.
He gradually improved over 3 days and was extubated, but still had a significant oxygen requirement, with PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 200 and bilateral infiltrates.
PPD, ANCA, anti-GBM, sputum for cytology and PCP were negative.
All sputum cultures showed only oropharyngeal flora.
A bedside swallow showed no clinical signs of aspiration but video swallow showed significant aspiration.
Biopsy results showed diffuse alveolar damage consistent with ARDS picture.
Also, culture data grew enterococus from BAL and biopsy site.
Echo [**5-8**] showed: 40% EF, global hypokinesis with + 1 MR. [**First Name (Titles) 907**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] after stenting showed EF >55%.
Pulmonary artery catheterization showed intermittent high wedge, range [**1-6**].
#) ARF - Baseline 1.0-1.3, but his creatinine became elevated from agressive diuresis and low BP up to peak of 1.9.
