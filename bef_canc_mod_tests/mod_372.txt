In the ED, initial vital signs were T:97.3, HR:92, BP:120/62, SO2:100% on NRB.
Initial labs in the ED revealed a sodium of 130, K of 7.4 without evidence of peaked T waves on EKG, a BUN of 207, a serum creatinine of 7.0, a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 37155**], and a Troponin-I of 0.12.
Initial ABG showed profound acidosis: 7.01/90/135/25 which was persistent through the afternoon.
Before this, he's had several admissions for HF exacerbations with documented weight gains, HF symptoms, and was diuresed each time.
A complete ROS was unable to be obtained as the patient was intubated by arrival to the floor but the patient's son stated that his father had a cold over the last month with a productive cough and rhinorrhea but no fevers (no further ROS was obtainable as he had not seen his father in days).
Past Medical History: - Coronary artery disease s/p stent (LCx, [**2145**] at [**Hospital1 882**]) - Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 30-35%) - Aortic stenosis (1.2cm2) - CVA [**2145**], left MCA with expressive aphasia, motor planning deficits, right-sided neglect.

[**11-29**] CXR  FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes and body habitus.
As compared to the prior examination increased fullness of the hila and prominence of the vasculature could represent additional volume overload.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-4-22**], global left ventricular systolic function is improved and the gradient across the aortic valve is increased.
CXR [**12-15**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2151-12-9**], there are continued low lung volumes, which enhances the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
However, on [**12-8**] developed recurrent ARF with Cr bumping to 3 and peaking at 7.7.
After discontinuation of dialysis, his creatinine clearance with Cr 2.9 on the day of discharge.
ABG showed respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia.
Overnight CPAP or oxygen at 4L NC CPAP is preferred but patient sometimes refuses in which case overnight O2 by NC can be used at 4L.
