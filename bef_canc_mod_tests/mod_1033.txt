Initial CT scan of the head at the outside facility revealed evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, at which time the patient was transferred to this facility.
On presentation to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was noted to have a GCS of 15, complained of right hand and right knee pain, as well as right-sided face pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.4, blood pressure 118/64, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 16, 98% on nonrebreather mask.
RESPIRATORY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pulses 2+ bilateral upper and lower distal extremities.
LABORATORY:  CBC - white count 12.3, hematocrit 34, platelets 173.
Coags significant for INR 1.1, lactate 1.4.
RADIOLOGY:  CT of the head - bilateral frontal and parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, small left posterior parietal subdural hemorrhage.
CT of the C-spine negative.
CT of the face with fine cuts - right orbital fracture of inferior and lateral orbital walls, medial wall of the right maxillary sinus fracture.
Chest x-ray - right second rib fracture.
Right knee, tibia and fibula - no evidence of fracture.
AP pelvis - negative.
[**3-18**] CT of the head - without change.
Thoracolumbar spine series - significant only for slight disk narrowing at L5-S1 and L3-L4, without evidence of acute fracture.
MRI of the C-spine - spondylosis without evidence of acute injury.
[**3-21**] CT of the head - without significant change.
Given the above mentioned findings on CT of the head, the neurosurgery service was asked to consult on the patient in the Emergency Department.
The patient was then placed on q 1 h neuro checks, and a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 was maintained via arterial line monitoring.
Additionally, Dilantin was loaded intravenously, and the patient's serum sodium was monitored, all per the recommendations of the neurosurgery service.
Repeat CT scans of the head on hospital day #2 and #5, respectively, were without significant.
The neurosurgery service at that time decided that there was no further indication for potential surgical intervention and requested to see the patient as an outpatient with repeat output CT scan of the head.
Given the patient's known intracerebral hemorrhage, a repeat head CT was performed on hospital day #4, which showed no further evolution from prior scans.
On hospital day #6, a bedside swallowing evaluation was performed that found the patient able to tolerate a regular diet with 1:1 assistance.
