Nasogastric lavage was also performed and occult blood was present in the form of coffee ground.
Evaluation of cardiac markers in the Emergency Room also were suggestive of acute myocardial infarction.
She was initially scheduled for outpatient endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography through the [**Hospital **] Clinic, however, she failed to meet her appointment and as described below has refused to have further evaluations.
Her last echocardiogram showed a systolic congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with apical left ventricular aneurysm and diffuse wall motion abnormality.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.7, heartrate 81, blood pressure 137/91, respiratory rate 22, pulse oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric, normal conjunctiva.
Heart:  Point of maximal impulse is in the fifth rib space in the midclavicular line.
Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Vascular examination:  Carotid, femoral, dorsalis pedis pulses are brisk and equal.
LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation the white blood cell count was 8,100, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 293.
Mean corpuscular volume was 93 semptolitiers.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, blood urea nitrogen 36, bicarbonate 23, creatinine 1.2, glucose 236, calcium 10.6, magnesium 2.0, phosphate 2.4.
ALT 13, AST 31, alkaline phosphatase 77, total bilirubin 0.2, albumin 4.1, lactate dehydrogenase 180, lipase 2,434 (when assessed 8 hours lipase was 5,335 and amylase was 1315), TSH 6.5, creatinine kinase 50, troponin T 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm of 70 beats/minute with PR interval of 0.2, QRS was 0.15 with old right bundle branch block, QT was 0.4 with an axis of 0 to -30 degrees and early R wave progression.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Computed tomograph of the abdomen showed fat stranding around the pancreas consistent with a laboratory evaluation described above.
On hospital day #3 her amylase and lipase dropped precipitously consistent with her previous presentation of transient pancreatitis.
In reviewing her medication list, it was decided to ultimately withhold her Atorvastatin as her cholesterol panel was well within the normal range and this is a medication known to cause pancreatitis, however, Ursodeoxycholic, a medication not listed above, in her outpatient medication that she was discharged with on her last presentation and this medication may have to be withheld in the future as may Furosemide.
Gastrointestinal bleeding - Serial evaluations of her hemoglobin and hematocrit showed a stable vascular supply.
Coronary artery disease - Following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit serial evaluation of her cardiac markers supported evidence of myocardial infarction, medical management was pursued exclusively.
Once her pancreatitis resolved and her cardiac issues were stabilized she was transferred to the Medical Floor for further titration of her medication.
