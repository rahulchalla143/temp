OSH was worried about STEMI (for unclear reasons at this point) and their lab was unavailable so patient was transferred over to [**Hospital1 18**] where he went to cath lab.
RHC showed elevated wedge (30s), RA pressures 15, PAP 60.
Echo in lab showed moderate MR, mild AI, preserved LV, RV function.
Received lasix IV in lab 80 mg. LV gram showed mild MR, inferiobasal HK with EF about 45%.
AS study showed moderate-severe AS with valve area 1.0.
PA pressure at 80 and wedge pressures a 30-35 Patient was transferred up to CCU and additional history was performed.
Hypotensive to Systolic 80s-90s when sleeping and after fentanyl injections but increases upon awakening.
Patient -1 L since cath lab.

On the right side peak systolic velocities were 24 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 203 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.
On the left side peak systolic velocities were 75 cm/sec for the proximal internal carotid artery, 106 cm/sec for the mid internal carotid artery, 100 cm/sec for the distal internal carotid artery and 55 cm/sec for the common carotid artery.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 8711**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: SUN [**2195-7-5**] 8:53 PM   Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o male with PMHx of Ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe AS, Severe PVD and other medical comorbidities admitted after PEA arrest with CHF exacerbation s/p diuresis and hemodynamic optimization  # PUMP: ECHO shows LVEF of 45% with mild MR and AS.
# CORONARIES: The patient was originally billed as a STEMI when transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and sent directly to cath lab where 80% occlusion of LAD, 40% LCx, and 100% RCA although with adequate collaterals were found.
Carotid ultrasound was obtained for pre-op evaluation should the patient decide to pursue coronary artery bypass.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
Lisinopril 40 mg PO DAILY Hold if SBP <90 3.
Lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY Please hold for SBP <95 4.
Metoprolol Tartrate 125 mg PO BID Hold if SBP <90, HR<55 5.
MetFORMIN (Glucophage) 1000 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 582**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: #Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with a preserved EF of 45% #Severe 3-vessel Coronary Artery Disease with a 100% occlusion of the RCA (with collaterals) and an 80% occlusion of his LAD that is not amenable to percutaneous intervention #Severe Aortic Stenosis with a gradient of 40mmHg and a valve area of 1.0sq-cm #Peripheral Vascular Disease #Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient is alert and oriented x 3 and in good mental state.
You improved with the diuresis and also with control of your blood pressure using Metoprolol Tartrate 125mg twice a day and decreased your previous dose of Lisinopril to 10mg daily.
The Metoprolol was higher than your home dose because we wanted to tightly control your heart rate given your severe aortic stenosis.
These are for your congestive heart failure and blood pressure.
CT scan showed a possible dissection of your R femoral artery.
Later, with a CT scan, your thigh was found to have a 10x10cm hematoma.
You were transfused with a total of 4 units of Red Blood Cells and your hemoglobin was checked to make sure that you no longer were bleeding.
Your blood counts have recovered from that episode.
A carotid artery ultrasound (a non-invasive test looking at the blood vessels in your neck) was done showing complete blockage of your right carotid artery and a 40% narrowing of your left.
