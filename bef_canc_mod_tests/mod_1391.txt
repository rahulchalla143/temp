If clinical concern for cord injury, MRI of the cervical spine is more sensitive.
CT head ([**11-17**]): 1.
CT torso ([**11-17**]): 1.
CXR ([**11-18**]): Endotracheal tube has been pulled back in the interval, and is now approximately 4 cm from the carina, in appropriate position.
TTE ([**11-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-26**], the degree of TR detected has slightly increased.
CT C-spine ([**11-19**]): No fracture or subluxation.
There is decrease in the height of the intervertebral spaces between C5 to C6 and C6 to C7.
She had significant imaging studies in the ED (see results section) that were negative.
CT C-spine was repeated per spine service recs and again negative.
There were further recs for flexion/extension neck films, which were negative.
Pleural effusion: Appeared on repeat CXR and most likely related to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of fall.
Patient is on anticoagulation and initially had a R main stem intubation, so hemothorax possible; her hct decreased initially, but then remained stable.
CXR was trended and showed stable "small" pleural effusions.
EKG showing only paced rhythm and unable to assess symptoms while intubated.
Notably patient had another set of cardiac enzymes drawn on HD5 in the context of mild chest-pain and shortness of breath.
These again revealed a normal MB-Index, and a down-trending troponin (.04).
EKG was again normal.
Supratherapeutic INR: Patient noted to have an INR of 16.7 on HD5.
INR subsequently corrected to subtherapeutic level of 1.4 on day of discharge.
Patient gradually restarted on home medications (spirinolactone -> HCTZ -> valsartan) with good control of blood pressure on discharge.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has been adequately rate-controlled on home medication without issue(carvedilol 25mg daily) with HR ranging from 50-70.
Hypothyroidism - Stable during admission on levothyroxine.
Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 600-400 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Suburban VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Altered Mental Status Secondary: 1) Hypertension 2) Atrial fibrillation 3) Hyperlipidemia 4) Depression 5) Insomnia 6) Osteoporosis 7) Meniere's disease 8) Deafness 9) Hypothyroidism 10) Osteoarthritis 11) Sciatica 12) Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease 13) Allergic rhinitis 14) Left acoustic neuroma 15) Cataracts 16) [**Hospital1 15309**] neuroma 17) Chronic hyponatremia  Discharge Condition: Good.
