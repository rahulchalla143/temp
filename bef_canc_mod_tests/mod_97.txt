In the ED, she was triggerred for BP 95/44.
CXR suggested ?bilateral pneumonia, and she was started on vancomycin/zosyn.
Labs were suggestive of acute renal failure.
Around 8 AM on the day of admission, her blood pressures dropped to 59/24 with resultant peripheral levophed started.
Initial VS on the floor were HR 95 BP 122/46 RR 21 O2 95 % on 4 L T 99.6.

Imaging  A. CXR INDICATION: Fevers  TECHNIQUE: Single frontal radiograph of the chest was compared to prior examinations, most recent radiograph dated [**2154-9-22**].
B. CT Abd/pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Cardiology A. EKG Sinus tachycardia with poor baseline.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-9-22**] no diagnostic interval change.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-10-9**], the right ventricular cavity size is larger, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is increased, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
Microbiology [**2154-11-9**] 10:19PM URINE Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen Detection-PND [**2154-11-12**] 2:27PM C. Diff Toxin A & B Negative [**2154-11-10**] Urine Legionella Negative x 2 [**2154-11-9**] : Bld Cultures x 2 negative, pending final results DIRECT [**2154-11-10**]: Influenza DFA A&B negative  ### Pending studies: URINE Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen   Brief Hospital Course: 85-year-old female with chronic diastolic congestive heart failure along with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABGx3, history of PE in setting of immobility, and multiple recent orthopedic procedures that presents with fever, hypotension requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressor support thought to be secondary to septic process and decreased PO intake, resolved altered mental status, and infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia that is improving clinically.
Chest xray showed multifocal pneumonia which was thought to be cause of her sepsis.
Urine Legionella was sent and ultimately negative.
A sputum culture was order however Ms. [**Known lastname **] was never able to expectorate a sample.
Other causes of her hypoxia were also evaluated, she had an Echo performed which showed a larger RV cavity size and tricuspid regurgitation however her clinical exam was notable for hypovolemia.
Her cortisol level was 5.81 in the ICU but did not require steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
Given her recent hospital course and antibiotic coverage a C. Diff toxin was sent and was ultimately negative, she also had no evidence of fevers or leukocytosis.
Recommend continuing Maalox for now, if the diarrhea persists would recommend recheck a C. Diff toxin as well as a complete blood count to check for leukocytosis.
Acute renal failure: Patient had creatinine of 2 on admission with baseline around 1 consistent with pre-renal acute renal given responsive to fluids and FeUREA of 25 %.
Her Creatinine was trended and decreased to 1.2 prior to discharge.
She will need to have a Creatinine check on [**2154-11-15**] to ensure she remains close to her baseline especially as her furosemide regimen will be restarted.
- recommend check a repeat BUN, Creatinine on [**2154-11-15**] to ensure Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] renal function remains stable and close to her baseline - would restart her home dose of Furosemide 20mg on [**2154-11-14**] .
Her INR was 5.2 and increased to 6.7 with concomitant PTT increase.
Her INR was reversed with PO vitamin K and 3 units of FFP with a subsequent nadir to 1.2 in the ICU given the Hgb drop and concern for a possible bleed.
Would redose Coumadin based on INR goal.
# Hypertension Prior to discharge Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] was noted to be hypertensive with systolic pressure ruanging from 160 to 180.
If her blood pressure remains elevated would recommend increasing her Lisinopril if her Creatinine remains stable.
In the IC hemolysis labs were checked and were negative.
The patient also had a CT abdomen/pelvis which did not show any retroperitoneal bleed, this was checked as she had a femoral line placed for her septic shock.
She has not had any melena during hospitalization, she received 2units of PRBCs in the unit with her Hgb increasing from 7.6 to 10.2.
Maalox Advanced 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 ml PO four times a day as needed for diarrhea.
In the Emergency Room you were confused, you needed oxygen and your blood pressure was dangerously low; you required care in the Intensive Care Unit.
You blood level was also noted to drop so you were given blood transfusions, you were checked to see if there was a source of bleeding, none was found.
