Syncopal work-up suggested cardiac etiology.
A cath was done on [**2133-6-18**] which revealed three vessel disease, the left main was 20% occluded distally, LAD 80% at bifurcation of diagonal, left circumflex 50% occlusion at proximal, RCA had total occlusion with filling from left to right collaterals.
An echo at that time showed an EF greater than 55%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, no AR, 1+ MR, mild symmetric LVH and borderline pulmonary hypertension.
EKG was suggestive of prior inferior wall infarct at that time showing Q's in 3 and AVF.
In the Emergency Room his blood pressure was found to be 200/117, pulse 130, respiratory rate 50, O2 saturation 91% on 100% non rebreather.
EKG at the time showed sinus tachy with questionable ST elevations in V1 and V2.
His blood pressure fell and he was taken off the Nitro drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, syncopal event, atrial fibrillation, right colon cancer, status post resection in [**2099**], left colon cancer status post resection in [**2115**], benign prostate hyperplasia status post prostatectomy in [**2116**], thalamic bleed secondary to hypertension in [**2125**] and a renal mass, hemorrhagic cyst in [**2129**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a pulse of 79, blood pressure 139/85, respiratory rate 19, pulse ox 100% on C-pap.
His rate was regular S1 and S2 with questionable S4, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LABORATORY DATA:  On his admission his labs were white blood count 12.9, up from 7.5 on [**7-1**], hematocrit 34.8, up from 31.3 on [**7-1**] and platelet count 405,000 with MCV of 86.
His neutrophils were 70%, lymphs 21%, monocytes 2.9% and eosinophils 4.4%.
Sodium 138, potassium 5.8, 106/22, 36/2.0 and 239 for glucose.
His creatinine had been baseline at 1.6 to 1.8.
His ABG at 2:30 a.m. was 7.3, 44, 229.
His PT was 12.4, PTT 25.9.
On his prior admission the patient was noted to have iron of 25, TIBC 260, TSH was 1.3 and free T4 1.0.
Retic count 1.7, Vitamin B12 327, Folate greater than 20.
His hemoglobin A1C was 6.0.
His CEA was elevated at 11.
On prior admission the patient's peak CPK was 127 and his peak troponin was 11.2.
His EKG on admission was heart rate 130, sinus tachy, no axis deviation, ST depressions in V5, V6 and 1 and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V1 through V3.
Chest x-ray was consistent with CHF.
On admission his CPK was 141 and troponin 2.3.
His troponin peaked at 20.
His cath was reviewed two weeks earlier and showed severe three vessel disease with 90% lesions in the LAD and total occlusion of the RCA and 70% of left circumflex.
During the hospital course his EKG returned to [**Location 213**] in terms of ST elevation.
Pump:  Since his chest x-ray was consistent with CHF, the patient was started on Lasix and diuresed 2??????
An echo was done on the first day of admission and it showed an EF of 30-40% LV systolic function moderately depressed, symmetric LVH, severe hypokinesis of anterior septum and anterior free wall, extensive apical HK, AK, no aortic stenosis, no AR, 1+ MR, pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal and no pericardial effusion was noted.
Compared to the echocardiogram done on [**6-17**], his overall LV function was significantly worse secondary to a major anterior septal infarct/injury.
EP was called and interrogated his  pacemaker device which showed that the patient was in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 6% of the time.
Renal:  His creatinine was slightly higher on admission than baseline which is normally elevated between 1.6 and 1.8.
During the course of his admission his BUN and creatinine remained stable.
Heme:  The patient presented with a hematocrit of 34.
His hematocrit rose to 31 but the following day fell again to 28.9.
On discharge his hematocrit was 34.8.
