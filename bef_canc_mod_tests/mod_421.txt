No clear cause of increased occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
Esmolol drip was attempted, however patient's blood pressure did not tolerate.
She was started on a heparin drip and then underwent TEE (which showed no clot) and DCCV after which she converted to NSR with a rate in the 60s on the amiodarone gtt.
She will need frequent INR checks at the acute rehab as amiodarone can effect the metabolism of coumadin.
Her weight should be monitored daily as well as her respiratory status at the rehab facility.
She was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes and continued on ASA.
