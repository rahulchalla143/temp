BCx and UCx were sent, cardiac markers cycled; CXR and U/A were negative.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2150-7-17**], findings are probably similar.
Right ventricular systolic function now appears borderline depressed.
Since the previous tracing of [**2150-8-24**] sinus tachycardia rate has decreased and diffuse ST segment elevation is now seen.
On transfer, her BG was noted to be high, so her humalog SS was tightened and glargine was increased [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs.
Electrolytes were followed closely and repleted aggressively.
Fluids were d/c'ed when she came to the floor and her sodium came down to 142 on HD#2 and remained within normal range for the remainder of her course.
3) CVS: Pump-Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] had 2 echos showing LV hypokinesis and EF 40-45% on her previous admission [**6-24**] when she presented with CP.
At that time, EKGs showed diffuse ST elevation; cath was clean.
An echo was done to evaluate interval improvement in EF.
As the EKG seemed relatively unchanged from prior, there was question as to whether this was due to a new infection vs. a chronic process that had not yet resolved.
She will likely need repeat echo as an outpatient for follow-up.
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] has multiple RFs for CAD, but cath in [**Month (only) 216**] showed no coronary disease.
EKG showed findings described above, cardiac markers were cycled.
With aggressive fluid resuscitation, this came down to the 90s-100s.
4) Anemia: On presentation, Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] HCT was 37.6, after fluid resuscitation, it decreased to 29.5 and remained stable.
Iron studies were sent, but were not available at time o discharge.
Discharge Instructions: Please check your blood glucose levels as directed.
Call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 28500**] and ask to speak with the Nurse on duty to report your blood sugars and adjust your insulin dosing.
2) [**2150-9-29**] 10am with Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**].
If you cannot make either of these appointments, please call to re-schedule: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 20881**]  Please follow-up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 4223**] on Wednesday, [**9-16**] at 2pm at [**Hospital1 7975**] FAMILY PRACTICE.
