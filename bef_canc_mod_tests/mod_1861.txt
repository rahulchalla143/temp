Compared to the previous tracing sinus tachycardia and R waves in lead V1 are new.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Initial CXR showed mild pulmonary edema his pro-BNP was elevated consistent with CHF.
CTA was negative for PE but did show evidence of CHF.
Initial EKG showed initial ST depression in anterior leads which resolved and old slightly wide QRS.
He remained chest pain free and his troponin peaked at 1.2, CK max of 518.
Echo obtained on [**4-12**] showed EF 55-60% with no wall motion abnormality.
