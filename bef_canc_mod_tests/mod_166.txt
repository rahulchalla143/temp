Admission Date:  [**2145-6-23**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2089-5-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred with acute myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
Electrocardiogram there showed ST elevations, V1 through V6, one in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in 2, 3 and AVF, Q waves in V1 through V3, 3 and AVF.
After catheterization ST segments remained elevated in V2 through V6 and an [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions persisted in leads 2, 3 and AVF and Q waves were present in V1 through V4.
The patient was given Aspirin, Lopressor, Heparin, intravenous Nitroglycerin and Integrilin and transferred for cardiac catheterization to [**Hospital6 1760**].
Cardiac catheterization showed normal left main left anterior descending with total proximal occlusion just after a high first septal.
The left circumflex showed serial 30% lesions and a large obtuse marginal 2 had an 80% stenosis.
Left ventriculogram showed anteroapical akinesis with hyperdynamic basis and a 40% ejection fraction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.3, pulse 83, blood pressure 112/69, oxygen saturation 97% on 3 liters.
LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data on admission revealed creatinine kinase 296, MV 13.7, troponin 1.13, INR 1.0, creatinine 1.0, hematocrit 47.0 and electrocardiogram as described above in the history of present illness.
He was also started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, the doses which were increased as blood pressure tolerated.
Persistent chest pain post catheterization was treated with Morphine Sulfate and eventually resolved.
The patient's oxygen saturation was suboptimal in the low 90s on 6 liters of oxygen.
Reduction of saturation improved with this treatment.
A stepup in oxygen saturation between the superior vena cava and the pulmonary artery was noted from 60 to 68% and when the patient follows up with Cardiology in one months time he should obtain a formal echocardiogram with bubble study to check for shunt.
There were no electrocardiogram changes and cycle of enzymes continued to decrease with no bump.
Peak creatinine kinase was 3,050.
