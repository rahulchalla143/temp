RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, spectral, and color Doppler analysis of the right internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, axillary vein, brachial veins, cephalic vein, and basilic vein was performed.
Based on the markers in the guidewire, it was decided that a length of 43 cm would be suitable.
A dressing was applied, and final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrated tip of the catheter to be located in the distal part of the SVC.
[**12-13**] TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.
Nonionic IV contrast was used due to rapid bolus necessary for this study.
A small fluid collection near the left cardiophrenic angle measuring 45 x 22 mm (2:38) appears to be slightly smaller than the previous study from [**2148-12-3**], and also more hypodense.
CT ABDOMEN: Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen with simple characteristics.
CT PELVIS: There is malposition with the Foley catheter likely with the balloon in the urethra.

Evaluation for a mycotic aneurysm is unsatisfactory, as there is no clear visualization of the distal intracranial arterial vasculature, which is the usual locale for mycotic aneurysms.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
He underwent preoperative workup including cardiac catherization and infectious disease consult.
He received hydration and creatinine was monitored closely.
He was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit requiring vasopressors and blood products.
He continued to progress but on postoperative day 4 he was in atrial fibrillation with hypotension and returned to the CSRU for monitoring and vasopressors.
He was weaned off pressors and underwent flap closure [**12-12**].
He has required vasoactive medications during ICU stay for blood pressure support with b/p stable off pressors.
Renal: Baseline creatinine was 1.9 with a peak to 2.3, now 1.5.
He passed his swallow evaluation on [**2149-1-3**] for a full diet, but given his poor PO intake, he remains with tube feeds.
HCT was stable at d/c.
ID: enterococcal mitral valve endocarditis with septic emboli, Mitral valve replaced [**11-20**] and valve tissue culture + enterococcus received vancomycin, fluconazole,levoquin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone based on increased WBC and culture data.
