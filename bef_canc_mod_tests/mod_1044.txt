Round nodule in right upper lobe is again demonstrated and corresponds to a suspicious nodule on recent chest CT dated [**2144-6-19**].
Final length is 23 cm with the tip positioned in the left subclavian vein.
DIAGNOSED BY:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10220**], CT(ASCP) [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 32953**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 32954**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10165**], M.D.
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A 16 x 19 mm lobulated solid solitary soft tissue nodule is seen in the right upper lobe posterior segment, abutting the major fissure.
This study is not designed to examine the abdomen, however, non-contrast images show layering radiopaque gallstones and several kidney cysts that are similar in appearance to the previous exam including CT scan of [**2141**].
T11 wedge configuration is unchanged.
TTE - Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-4-29**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher.
Regional left ventricular systolic function and valvular morphology are similar.
CT spine- CONCLUSION: Acute T11 compression fracture with a small retropulsed fragment encroaching on the spinal canal.
Relationship to the spinal cord cannot be determined on a CT scan.
Left renal mass, further evaluation may be indicated.
Please note non contrast CT has limited sensitivity for detection abscesses.
Low-attenuation area noted within the right maxilla likely represent periodontal disease.
Followup Kidney MRI is recommended in [**4-10**] months for the complex cyst in the right kidney.
Surveillance cultures remain neg so far since [**2144-6-9**].
# Pulmonary nodules/ Abnormal CT chest - concern for malignany.
But bronchoscopic biopsy non-specific.
AFB sputums neg to date.
PPD was negative.
FInal culture results to be followed up with PCP.
CT placed by CT surgery and pulled out after resolution.
Last CXR - tiny residual focus of air.
Patient will need a CT sca nof T spine prior to the appointment.
# Left kidney mass - as above - US showed - 1.5 cm right kidney complex cyst, and 3 cm left kidney simple cyst.
Followup Kidney MRI is recommended in [**4-10**] months for the complex cyst in the right kidney.
# ARF - from ATN/sepsis - resolved.
Creatinine at baseline (1.5)  .
ECHO suspicious of 3 vessel CAD.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 ml IV DAILY:PRN Peripheral IV - Inspect site every shift 6.
