At the OSH emergency department, she was ill-appearing, hypotensive, and afebrile, with a leukocytosis to 22 with 15% bandemia and 70% polys; her creatinine was 1.7.
She was admitted to the MICU at the OSH where she was given stress dose steroids, empiric vancomycin and levofloxacin, 4L IVF, and blood cultures drawn.
An ultrasound guided drainage of the right hand was performed, expressing a small amount of pus that was sent for gram stain and culture; Gram stain showed 2+ gram positive cocci.
Four of four blood cultures grew gram positive cocci, as well.
She subsequently developed respiratory distress overnight with an arterial blood gas of 7.2/14.5/95 and was intubated.
Chest X-ray at the OSH was consistent with ARDS vs volume overload.
An MRI of the right hand showed no definite fluid collection.

Relevant Studies: CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2125-4-16**]): Poorly defined nodular opacities in right upper and left mid lung zones, concerning for septic emboli or fungal infection.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST ([**2125-4-16**]): The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] T-SPINE W &W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-4-17**]): There are signs of extensive osseous abnormality of the mid thoracic spine with a prevertebral collection associated with bone and interspace abnormality.
Abnormality at the C1-2 junction is also identified and though this could represent degenerative change, but infection cannot be excluded in this location.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears preserved (LVEF>55%), however transgastic views were not obtained.
Right ventricular systolic function also appears preserved.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST ([**2125-5-22**]): Pulmonary arteries appear well opacified and there is no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
Again seen are several mediastinal lymph nodes, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.
Compared to [**4-28**], the fluid collection is likely not significantly changed to slightly larger in size.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST ([**2125-5-22**]): The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unchanged.
Scattered mesenteric lymph nodes again seen, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST ([**2125-5-22**]): The rectum and sigmoid appear unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS ([**2125-5-22**]): Again seen is destruction of the T7 through T9 vertebral bodies.
When cultures showed MSSA on HD #2, vancomycin was changed to nafcillin.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
A chest X-ray showed pulmonary nodules, prompting a follow up CT of the chest.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a left iliopsoas abscess.
The orthopaedic spine team was consulted, and an MRI of the spine was obtained for further delineation of these lesions.
The MRI confirmed osteomyelitis of the T9 vertebra, and showed a fluid collection abutting the spine in addition to a fluid collection subcutaneously on the back.
The orthopaedic spine service recommended a conservative approach with CT guided drainage of the paraspinal fluid collection.
The patient underwent successful CT guided drainage of the superficial abscess on the back, in addition to the paraspinal fluid collection (with a pigtail catheter left in place for drainage).
Plans were made for CT guided drainage of the parascapular abscess.
However, the scan showed no drainable fluid in the parascapular region.
Cardiac: She had a mild troponin T leak ~ 0.7, with a peak CK-MB of 95.
An initial TTE showed a depressed EF.
Anemia: Patient had a stable anemia with iron studies consistent with chronic inflammation.
CT was negative for PE.
However, as the acidosis resolved, she developed a significant hypokalemia, with potassium levels down to 2.4.
Potassium was repleted aggressively over the following several days, with subsequent resolution.
You will need these referrals before you see any of the specialists.
