He presented to [**Hospital **] hospital at 3am on Monday where his initial vitals were T 98.7, HR 88, RR 18, SaO2 85% RA and 95% on 2L N/C, BP 151/72 with HR 85.
CXR showed Rt-sided infiltrate so he was started on CTX and azithromycin to treat community-acquired pneumonia.
EKG initially showed NSR with rate 85 and no ischaemic changes.
His hypoxia quickly worsened to requiring 100% NRB and was noted on CXR to possible pulmonary edema with BNP of 1259.
He subsuquently ruled in for MI with CK peak of 211 and CK-MB of 8.5.
He was also noted to have acute renal failure with Cr of 3.5 up from his baseline of 2.8. .
No history of cardiac catheterization   Social History: SOCIAL and FAMILY HISTORY: Former smoker, quit 35 years ago.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS: T 98.6, BP 140/83, HR 95, RR 22, 93 O2 % on 100% NRB Gen: WDWN elderly male in moderate respiratory distress.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
irregular rhythm, tachycardic, normal S1, S2.
EKG on transfer demonstrated coarse atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 120, normal axis, no hypertrophy, normal intervals.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular  filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2198-10-1**], there has been interval development of mild aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy (aortic valve velocity not evaluated on prior study).
Estimated pulmonary artery pressures could not be assessed on the current study.
ETT performed at [**Hospital **] hospital (records not available) on [**2-/2199**] demonstrated:  He exercised for 3 min and 39 sec on a [**Doctor First Name **] protocol achieved a maximal heart rate of 94% with no angina or ischemic EKG changes there may have been a subtle inferior wall defect thought to be artifact.
EF 65%.
EGD [**2203-9-23**].IMPRESION:The previously noted mucosal abnormality on the incisura was not noted on this exam.
CXR [**2203-10-3**] Comparison is made to the prior examinations dated [**2203-9-26**] and [**2203-9-27**].
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.

On [**2203-9-26**], while on medical floor, the patient developed hyperglycemia into the 600s, uncontrolled with NPH, and SOB for 2-3 hours, with oxygen sats dropping to 88% even on supplemental oxygen.
At this Lantus dose his BS dropped to 61 and 1 amp glucose was given; that evening Lantus was lowered to 35U [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recs and morning labs showed BS = 41.
Patient was initially admitted for atrial fibrillation with RVR to 140s, which required esmolol gtt and diltiazem gtt.
He has not reached target HR but well tolerates high HRs (90-110) and drops SBP when rate control is very aggressive.
- We held ASA for risk of bleed, and started ASA after his repeat EGD which showed normal gastric mucosa.
- Current rhythm afib on high-dose Metoprolol and verapamil, with SBP maintained in the 110s-130s and HR ranges from 80s-90s.
We changed his metoprol and verapamil to long-acting forumulations the morning of discharge.
Labile and high blood sugars required insulin gtt and MICU transfer.
His blood sugars ranged 142-291 on day of discharge.
- We continued chest PT, incentive Spirometry -He had a low grade temp and a slightly elevated WBC, a repeat CXR showed showed a L retrocardiac opacity that most likely was a small effusion with atelectasis, but could not exclude pneumonia.
Blood cultures are pending.
Endoscopy (EGD) during admission to CCU revealed no active bleeding, but the presence of abnormal mucosa, possible hematoma.
Repeat CXR showed no change from previous weeks study.
Urine cultures and blood culture pending.
