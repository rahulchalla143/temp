Lactate was 3.4.
CT abdomen showed inflammation of rectum.
MRI showed L4 epidural hematoma.
She was not discharged on IV antibiotics, and will follow-up with ortho spine on [**2144-9-30**].
# L4 Burst fracture:  Discovered on MRI, not present on imaging from [**2144-2-13**], but is unclear whether it is acute or chronic.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout and continued on her home medications.
INR on presentation  supratherapeutic at 3.2, warfarin held, restarted on [**2144-9-6**].
INR on day of discharge was 2.1.
#HCT drop: HCT dropped from 32 on admission to 23, likely hemoconcentrated, baseline crits ~25 secondary to ACD, sideroblastic anemia, G6PD deficiency, and sickle cell trait.
- Monitoring INR in light of oral antibiotic regimen for treatment of C. diff, adjusting coumadin dosing as needed.
