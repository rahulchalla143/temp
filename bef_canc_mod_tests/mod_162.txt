MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-12-21**] 9:20 PM  MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please perform DWI stat to eval for acute stroke  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 32 year old woman with acute stroke.
If the patient's onset of symptoms is hyperacute there is a small false negative rate, particularly in the posterior fossa and a followup study might be of use.
MRA OF THE HEAD  TECHNIQUE: A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs through the inferior cranium.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2113-12-24**] 1:02 PM There is a stable small right pleural effusion.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A focal area of inflammatory stranding and a central round fat density is seen adjacent to the sigmoid colon (series 2, image 70) which may reflect epiploic appendagitis.
Her MRI/MRA was negative for infarction and her symptoms completely resolved shortly after admission to the MICU.
CT scan with contrast was obtained revealing epiloic appendagitis, but no finding that correlated with the severity of the pt's pain.
Nephrolithiasis was entertained, but there was no evidence for ureteral dilation and urinalysis was negative for RBC's.

We performed an MRI of your brain and did not find any abnormalities to explain your weakness.
Serial neurological exams did not find any further abnormalities.
You later developed left sided pain and we performed a CT scan with contrast of your abdomen.
Close monitoring of your blood sugar level and appropriate insulin control are essential.
