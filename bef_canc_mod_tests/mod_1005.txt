He began to feel somewhat unwell about 6 days ago at work when he missed work and had a blood sugar in the 50s.
An EKG was performed and showed ST depression in the lateral leads and ST elevations in R-sided leads.
EKG showed NSR with ST dep lateral leads, ST elevations in R sided leads.

ECHO ([**2170-3-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-12-13**], the findings are similar.

His dyspnea was thought to be his anginal equivalent.
Repeat cath on [**3-8**] revealed that the SVGs were occluded and that LIMA lead to diffusely diseased vessel unlikely to provide significant cardiac perfusion.
Repeat TTE on [**2170-3-9**] showed anterior, septal and apical akinesis with depressed EF that was overal similar to prior ECHO but did not show hoped for improvement in systolic function after bypass.
He has had several episodes of hypoglycemia recently and his blood sugar may be too tightly controlled.
last lipids well controlled on [**2170-1-4**]- TC 104, HDL 37, LDL 48.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute coranary syndrome Chronic Systolic Heart failure, EF 30% Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You will need a repeat catheterization in [**4-4**] weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**].
For your repeat cardiac catheterization please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] to schedule for 4-6 weeks.
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7236**].
Please discuss your recent stay and your blood sugars.
REPEAT CATHETERIZATION DID NOT DEMONSTRATE ANY NEW CHANGES IN CORONARY ARTERY OR GRAFT ANATOMY.
