ECHO The left and right atrium are moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2176-7-9**], left ventricular systolic dysfunction appears regional with global improvement in systolic function.
The cardiac silhouette and the mediastinal contours are normal and unchanged.
Lung exam was consistent with COPD exacerbation, but patient also with asymptomatic bradycardia, with pulse dipping into mid-20s on occasion.
Initial EKGs were notable for QT prolongation to 500s-580s.
He was started on a dopamine drip which did not improve cardiac function - HR remained in low 30s, with resultant hypotension.
Once COPD exacerbation and supratherapeutic INR were adequately dealt with, patient received single chamber [**Company 1543**] VVI pacer.
Post-pacer interrogation was successful, and CXR confirmed proper lead placement.
CXR was without evidence of focal infiltrate but consistent with emphysematous changes.
Increased conspicuity in right hilum was noted on portable CXR -- could not rule out mass, f/u CT was recommended.
Repeat PA/Lateral were without evidence of mass.
Patient's PCP office was notified, and patient will follow-up within 5-7 days after discharge for further lung evaluation.
Patient received several units of FFP and SC Vitamin K, with normalization of INR after 24 hours.
Small Cerebellar Bleed Given supratherapeutic INR in the 40s on presentation, patient received a Head CT in the Emergency Department, which revealed a small cerebellar bleed.
Patient received a follow-up CT Head in 2 days, which showed no interval change in size of bleed.
Weight loss On presentation, patient denied any recent weight changes.
On further evaluation during discharge planning, patient reported 30 lb.
weight loss over past 1-2 months, unintentional.
