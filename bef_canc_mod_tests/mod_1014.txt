MICROBIOLOGY: Beta glucan: Negative Galactomannan: Negative Strongyloides Ag: Negative Sputum [**2-18**]:   >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2139-2-20**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Sputum Culture ([**3-11**]):       [**11-24**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2139-3-13**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
CXR ([**2139-2-18**]):  Heterogeneous opacification in the lower lungs, particularly in the middle lobe, is new since [**Month (only) 359**].
CT chest with contrast ([**2139-2-19**]):  1.
Extensive multifocal parenchymal consolidations, ground-glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities predominantly in a peribronchial distribution, most severe within the right lower lobe.
Mild left hydronephrosis, new compared to prior study of [**2138-11-19**].
MRI L-spine with gad ([**2139-2-19**]):  1.
CTA chest ([**2139-3-10**]):  1.
TTE ([**3-20**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-2-24**], intercurrent inferoposterolateral infarct is evident with consequent severe mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**3-20**]):  1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure with central aortic pressure 119/66 with a mean of 75 mmHg.
TTE ([**2139-3-21**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-3-20**], the findings are similar.
CT Chest ([**2139-3-22**]):  CT chest ([**2139-3-22**]):  1.
Retention of IV contrast in the renal cortices, likely from cardiac catheterization two days prior, compatible with renal dysfunction.
CT Chest ([**4-7**]): 1.
EGD ([**3-27**]):  Varices at the lower third of the esophagus.
Colonoscopy ([**4-1**]): 1.
His hospital course was complicated by Klebsiella pneumonia, worsening mitral regurgitation s/p cardiac catheterization with BMS x2 to the LCx, lower GI bleed and recurrent epistaxis, now clinically stable.
His sputum eventually grew out H. flu, so he completed a course of Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin.
He had a repeat Chest CT on [**3-22**], which demonstrated improvement of the multifocal pneumonia and he had a bronchoscopy on [**2139-3-27**], from which the cultures were negative.
His CXR prior to discharge remained consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
He should have a repeat CT Chest performed in [**2-1**] weeks to assess for radiographic improvement.
He had an EGD, which demonstrated grade I varcies and AVM and flexible sigmoidoscopy showed fresh blood in colon without source of bleeding.
He had a TTE performed, which demonstrated worsening mitral regurgitation, and there was concern for inferolateral hypokinesis, thought to be secondary to ischemia.
A repeat echo was done on [**2139-3-21**] which showed improvement in his MR and wall hypokinesis, somewhat unclear if this was related to the intervention in the cath lab or to improvement in cardiac function with diuresis.
He should have a repeat TTE performed in [**3-5**] weeks.
His peripheral smear was notable for eosinophils and hematology was concerned that he could have chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.
Of note, his baseline WBC is in the 30s and his baseline platelet count is in the 40s.
# HCC s/p OLT:  The patient was continued on Tacrolimus and his levels were checked daily with a goal of [**5-6**].
Hydronephrosis on CT chest:  His creatinine was 1.6 on arrival and improved to 1.2.
The wet read of his renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stone.
His Hep C viral load was high during this admission and his CT scan in [**Month (only) 359**] showed no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease.
His CT of the chest did reveal multiple perigarstric varices.

During the course of this treatment, you had worsening shortness of breath, and a cardiac ultrasound demonstrated that your mitral valve was no longer functioning as well as it once had.
You had a cardiac catheterization performed, during which two metal stents were placed into one of the blood vessels around your heart.
You received 5 units of blood during this hospital stay, and your hematocrit has remained stable for the past week.
Your nose was packed and you were given antibiotics and a nasal spray.
