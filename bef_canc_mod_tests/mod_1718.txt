[**2184-1-22**]: chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-21**], there is little overall change.
The bilateral parenchymal opacities show a decreasing trend.

Following trauma evaluation patient was admitted to ACS trauma service for further care in TSICU intubated/sedated.
CT head showed no TBI.
CT of the head and c-spine were completed as part of trauma evaluation revealing likely carotid-cavernous sinus fistula as well as C2 hangman's fracture.
Per ortho/Nsurg, CT head/c-spine performed [**1-27**] revealed interval placement of multiple embolization coils within the right superior ophthalmic vein.
On [**2184-2-3**] she underwent a repeat cartoid angiogram and had placment of 3 coils to the right carotid sinus fistula.
Bedside evaluation [**1-15**] was notable for bedside periorbital blood evacuation by opthalmology.
[**1-16**] optho exam was notable for pressures as follows: R eye pressure 18,23,21.
L eye pressure 18,22,19.
Opthalmologic evaluation continued on ongoing basis.
The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
S&S tried PMV eval [**1-27**] which patient did not tolerate due to coughing and increase secretions.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
GI/GU: Trauma scan revealed splenic laceration for which patient was brought to IR for attempted embolization.
Dobhoff was placed [**1-16**] and TFs initiated which were tolerated well.
PEG was placed [**1-24**] without incident and TFs resumed [**1-25**].
Urine output was adequate and patient resuscitated accordingly.
BAL specimen was sent showing 3+PMNs, no orgs on gram stain.
Abx d/c'd [**1-22**] as all cultures remained negative.
Noted that evaluation should take place when patient awake/cooperative so formal evaluation deferred through [**1-26**].
On eval for mandibular fx OMFS stated no indication for operative intervention.
Hct throughout remainder of admit remained stable.
She was evaluated by Opthamology for further assessement of visual acuity, but exam deferred related to patient's mental status, but recommendations made for lacrilube to right eye every 2 hours.
In order to better assess her swallowing, she underwent a video swallow and was found to continue to aspirate with liquids, but did tolerate pureed foods.
She did receive her post-splenectomy vaccines on [**2184-1-30**]  Of note:  she will need follow-up for repeat angio on [**2-9**].
