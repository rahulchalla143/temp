Catheterization revealed moderate to diffuse three vessel disease with twin left anterior descending coronary artery systems.
Repeat catheterization done a week later showed mild systolic ventricular dysfunction with two vessel coronary artery disease and mild to moderate left anterior descending coronary artery and diagonal disease, moderate left circumflex disease.
Catheterization done in [**2158**] showed three vessel disease with mild diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and an EF of 67%.
Imaging revealed mild inferior wall perfusion abnormality with partial reversibility and mild inferior wall hypokinesis with an EF of 71%.
In [**2170-4-7**] the patient had an ultrasound to evaluate for abdominal aortic aneurysm, which revealed no evidence of a abdominal aortic aneurysm, although it did show several bilateral renal cysts.
LABORATORY DATA ON [**3-14**]:  White blood cell count 9.5, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 272, INR 0.9, sodium 142, potassium 5.3, chloride 110, CO2 22, BUN 34, creatinine 1.9.
On [**3-19**] the patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 90% left main, 90% left anterior descending coronary artery with another 80% stenosis in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery, D1 is large and diffusely diseased.
Circumflex 70% osteal lesion, 60% proximal lesion, right coronary artery 70% osteal lesion with an 80% posterior descending coronary artery.
His EF is 45% with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Following cardiac catheterization cardiac surgery was consulted and the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room.
On postoperative day one the patient remained hemodynamically stable requiring Nipride to control his blood pressure.
On postoperative day four the patient remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation with ventricular response rate of 88.
Vital signs following cardioversion heart rate 56 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 160/78, respiratory rate 18.
He was transferred back to the floor for continuing monitoring and postoperative recovery.
At the time of discharge the patient's physical examination was as follows, vital signs temperature 97.3, heart rate 65 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 138/58, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 96% on room air.
Weight preoperatively is 160 kilograms.
Laboratory data white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 30.8, sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 103, CO2 25, BUN 34, creatinine 1.7, glucose 89.
Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
until INR is therapeutic.
The patient is to receive 5 mg on [**3-27**] mg on [**3-28**] and have his INR checked on [**3-29**] with results called into Dr.[**Name (NI) 666**] office.
Goal INR is 2 to 2.5.
