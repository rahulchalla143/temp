STUDIES Chest Xray [**2149-6-27**] FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms bilaterally.
CTA [**2149-6-27**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Chest xray post PICC [**2149-6-29**]: There is a new left PICC line with tip in the low SVC.
The blood was washed off and the underlying mucosa appeared normal.
[**2149-7-3**] CT Abd: IMPRESSION: 1.
Hypoenhancing areas within the liver, most likely hepatic cyst terogeneous perfusion, but correlation with prior imaging is recommended and if not stable, follow up MRI or CT should be performed when condition improves.
He was transfused 1 unit PRBCs with appropriate increase in his HCT to 33.
At time of callout from ICU, he was maintaining blood pressures in 90s-100s systolic.
Hyponatremia: The patient was noted to have a sodium of 129 on admission.
Sodium improved with blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation.
On transfer from ICU, his sodium was 134.
A CT was done which demonstrated submassive PEs in the right upper anterior lobe (4:46) and lateral right middle lobe (4:80) subsegmental pulmonary arteries.
EKG was without evidence of right heart strain.
LENIs showed no evidence of DVT.
His diarrhea improved but he was still having loose stools at time of callout from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Stool cx were sent and were negative.
His HCT remained stable throughout.
A cardiac echo showed overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%.
Later that day a sigmoidoscopy was performed which showed a superficial ucler approximately 2 cm without stigmata of bleeding.
On HD 7 he was found to be tachypneic and his abdomen was significantly more distended.
A KUB showed free air.
An urgent CT was consistent with anastomotic rupture.
He was urgently taken for exlap and washout ([**2149-7-3**]).
His pressures began to drop during the surgery and the decision was made to finish at that point and send him to the ICU with an open belly and plan to close the next day once he stablizies.
His HCT remained stable and his urine output was satisfactory.
His hct was low and coags were elevated.
