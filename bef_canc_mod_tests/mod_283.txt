On arrival, patient was in slow VT to 120s, BP 127/59 in NAD, mentating well.

STUDIES: Admission EKG [**2168-1-26**]: Wide complex tachycardia.
Of note on the prior tracing, P wave amplitudes were low and the ventricular premature beat seen does not appear like the wide complex tachycardia on the present tracing.
A moderate area of decreased voltage suggestive of scar was present in the inferobasal and inferoseptal regions.
Extensive mapping of the LV and an area with a mid-diastolic potential and perfect entrainment was found in the basal region of the LV at 4-5 oclock on the mitral annulus.
Conclusion: Successful ablation of V-tach from basal left ventricle  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 year old gentleman with PMH significant for HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p CABG in [**2156**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-ramus, SVG-PDA), remote history of VF arrest in [**2151**] s/p AICD, hospitalization in CCU in [**7-/2167**], [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] [**8-/2167**] due to multiple AICD firings, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, history of endovascular AAA repair who presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] earlier this AM after his ICD fired 8 times due to Monomorphic VT 120s, now s/p ablation.
He underwent nuclear perfusion/stress test on [**2167-8-19**] during which they found LVEF of 43% with similar finding as prior and no ischemic changes.
Coumadin initially held secondary to supratherapeutic INR of 3.3 which normalized to 2.6 on discharge.
He was provided with prescription for an INR check in 1 week.
# Pump: Last EF by perfusion study in [**Month (only) 216**] measured at 43%.
No echo in the [**Hospital1 18**] system.
Patient remained euvolemic to dry on exam throughout admission.
Home Lasix was held in-house as Cr was elevated above baseline, but restarted on discharge.
He was given a prescription for electrolyte/creatinine check in 1 week  Medications on Admission: Amiodorone 200mg daily if SBP > 90 Metoprolol 25 mg XL if SBP > 90 Pravastatin 20mg daily Coumadin, 5mg Wed 2.5 mg the rest of the wk Ascorbic acid 500mg [**Hospital1 **] Folic acid 2.5mg daily multivitamins 1 tablet daily Vitamin B6 50mg daily Lasix 40mg daily ASA 81mg daily Mexilitine 150 daily per outpt EP note  Discharge Medications: 1. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and an ablation was done that burned the surface of the heart that the ventricular tachycardia was originating from.
