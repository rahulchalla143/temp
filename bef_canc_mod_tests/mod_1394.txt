Imaging: [**2173-10-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/CONTRAST: Interval decrease in size of multiple gas containing hepatic fluid collections.
[**2173-10-17**] Portable Abdominal X-Ray: Only a supine portable view of the abdomen is submitted for interpretation, precluding assessment for free intraperitoneal air.
A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is visualized.
Examination is otherwise unchanged since the recent study except for development of linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
Intervals Axes: Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 169 0 80 292/482 0 -53 62 .
[**2173-10-23**] MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC): Correlation is made with prior CT performed on [**2173-10-15**].
The central fluid component on prior CT measured 1.6 x 1.5 cm.
Limited images of the lower chest demonstrate loculated right pleural fluid and atelectasis and minimal left pleural fluid.
Multiplanar reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2173-10-11**] for evaluation of the aforementioned problem.
These antibiotics were prescribed during his last admission for abdominal abscesses, which grew out Pseudomonas, MRSA and beta Strep.
Upon admission, his HGB was 7.5 and HCT 22.7, for which he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs without adverse event.
On HD#2, the patient received an additional unit of PRBCs responding with a HGB of 10.4 and HCT of 31.4.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.
A CXR, ECG, labwork, and blood cultures were performed.
The EKG was unremarkable, and the CXR showed moderate (R) pleural effusion increased, rightward mediastinal shift with opacification in (R) lower lobe most likely representing atelectasis.
A Abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast demonstrated interval improvement in the hepatic fluid collection and a few small new collection less than 1.8cm in size.
A CVL was placed, and IV Cefepime was added for temperature spikes to cover Pseudomonas.
Heart rate was tachy between 104-125, other vital signs were stable.
Labwork, blood and urine cultures were sent.
On [**2173-10-22**], the patient underwent MRCP, which revealed multiple hepatic abscesses, but not significantly changed in size given differences in technique, and no new fluid collections.
Given these finding demonstrating overall improvement and potential risks of interventional biospy, it was ultimately determined in consultation with Infectious Disease to forego planned ultrasound-guided aspiration and biopsy of one or more of the liver abscesses.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was administered when indicated.
His labwork was monitored regularly; electolytes repleted when needed.
