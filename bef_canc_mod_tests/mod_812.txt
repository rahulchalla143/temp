SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..    Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2203-5-16**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Blood Cultures*2 [**2203-5-16**]: No growth  Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen [**2203-5-15**]:   **FINAL REPORT [**2203-5-17**]**    Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2203-5-17**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B, Parainfluenza type       1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2203-5-15**]):       Respiratory viral antigens not detected.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2203-2-15**] there has been interval loss of R wave in leads V2-V3.
Chest Radiograph [**2203-5-14**]: CONCLUSION: Added density at the right costophrenic angle is suggestive of an infiltrate.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is suggestive of a small basal effusion.
CT Head W/O Contrast [**2203-5-14**]: CONCLUSION: Periventricular ischemia and scattered lacunar infarcts.
CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2203-5-14**]: CONCLUSION: 1.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2203-5-17**]: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF=~40-45%?
Diastolic function could not be adquately assessed.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
--Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-1-6**], the left ventricle is now more dilated, left ventricular systolic function is more depressed with new regional wall motion abnormality, the mitral valve chordae appear tethered, mitral regurgitation is now much more prominent.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2203-5-18**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 11mmHg and severely elevated left heart filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 28mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.7 l/min/m2.
This was supported by CXR and CT chest.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was done during her admission to evaluate for suspected diastolic dysfunction, however showed new inferior basal wall motion abnormality and new moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, see below.
# Systolic CHF:  New diagnosis, on this admission.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] showed EF 40-45%, but likely overestimated given significant new MR. Likely secondary to ischemic event, either from plaque rupture given family history, hyperlipidemia, or vasospasm.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which did not show evidence of occlusive disease.
TSH was WNL.
# CKD stage V:  On admission, the patient had mild signs of uremia on exam and labs but denies frank symptoms apart from volume overload.
A PPD was placed .
All hepatitis serologies were negative and there was no induration to PPD.
# Small vessel ischemic disease on Head CT:  Neuro was consulted and recommended aspirin, which was started.
# Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed with patient)   Medications on Admission: Prednisone 2.5mg daily (for GVHD) Levothyroxine 125mcg daily Nortriptyline 10mg QHS Pregabalin 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Calcium and vitamin D Centrum silver Pentamidine 300mg every month Albuterol inhaler (almost never uses)   Discharge Medications: 1.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease Post Herpetic Neuralgia Secondary Diagnoses: History of allogeneic stem cell transplant for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Chronic graft versus host disease Hypothyroidism  Discharge Condition: Good, stable on room air, tolerating PO's, euvolemic   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of shortness of breath.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed evidence of coronary artery disease, but did not explain your heart failure and valve symptoms.
