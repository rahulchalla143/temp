Chest CT: 1.
Increasing size of 13-mm left upper lobe nodule.
Follow-up CT should be performed in [**6-8**] weeks to exclude further growth.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 66 yo M with w/ CAD s/p PCI, s/p CABG c/b wound dehiscence x2 and wound infection requiring ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and tobramycin, h/o rib osteomyelitis, tracheal bronchitis/PNA with pseudomonas, CHF, COPD, HTN who is being transferred from NESH for plastic surgery evaluation of his wound dehiscence.
# Wound Infection: During the prior admission, cultures from the wound grew pseudomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro, acinetobacter [**Last Name (un) 36**] to gent/tobra and MRSA.
These abx were discontinued 4 days prior to admission once creatinine started to rise.
On further evaluation, ID believed that pt had completed a sufficient course of antibiotics for his wound infection.
An MRI was done of the chest which confirmed no evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue collections.
The creatinine improved to 2.1 during the admission but rose to 3.5 after the antibiotics were resumed.
Once the tobramycin was stopped, his creatinine trended down and stabilized at 2.9-3.0. .
His prednisone was changed from 5mg qd to hydrocortisone 25mg for a better replacement dose.
He will need a follow up chest CT in [**5-7**] weeks.
Calorie counts were insufficient so a PEG tube was placed by GI.
