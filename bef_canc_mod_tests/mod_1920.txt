There, his vitals were intially stable with a hct of 36.7, though he was felt to be hypovolemic and this hemoconcentrated; his previous hct was 39 about five months ago.
He refused an NG lavage.
Although an initial DRE showed only clot, he later passed a large, bloody bowel movement, and his bp nadired to the low 90's but rested there only transiently and easily rebounded to the 130's-140's with fluid; he then went to angiography for a tagged RBC scan where they found and embolized two vessels to the sigmoid colon.
His HCT had dropped from 36.7 to 30.8 despite 2U PRBC and 3 U FFP.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2162-9-29**] 3:27 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized.
The patient was transfused from a Hct 29 to 34 on the day of discharge.
- The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday, [**10-1**], which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding.
Given this, it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding.
- The patient had a colonoscopy on Monday [**10-4**] but unfortunately, was unable to complete the study as his bowel prep was inadequate.
Therefore, he had a repeat colonoscopy on [**10-5**] which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis, no polyps, w/ 8 mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon.
- Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results.
#Ulcerative colitis -- The patient's Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI.
After discussing this with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation.
His goal INR should be 1.6-2.0.
