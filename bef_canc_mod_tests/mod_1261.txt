On [**7-4**] the patients exam was notable for new spinal tenderness and some new warmth over his skin.
PCP attempted to obtain MRI of spine at that time but this was recorded as an incomplete study.
A CT revealed a bleed in the psoas muscle on the right.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**2125-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Cholelithiasis without CT evidence of cholecystitis.
ECHO [**2125-7-5**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2121-12-27**], gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve is similarly high, trace aortic regurgitation is now seen.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE [**Date range (1) 21036**]: 60 year old male who presents to the ED with PMH of AVR for endocarditis on coumadin, DM, HLD, CRI baseline Cr 1.5,  who presented to ED with back pain for two weeks and was found to have a right psoas hematoma on CT scan in setting of supratherapeutic INR to 4 and acute on chronic renal failure.
He was admitted to the ICU and his INR was reversed with iv vitamin K.  his hct dropped from baseline of low 30's to 24.
He recevied 2u RBC and 2u plts and his hct rose to 25 and was stable.
Echo done over concern of possible endocarditis given slight leukocytosis which showed no endocarditis (can't be fully ruled out on TTE).
# Right psoas hematoma: Patient likely developed this in the setting of supratherapeutic INR found to be 8.4 on admission.
His INR was reversed by IV vitamin K in the ED and he was transferred to the MICU for monitoring.
His vital signs were stable and he was increasingly able to move his right leg with minimal pain.
After pt hematoma stabilized, vital signs were stable and patient was transferred to the floor he was started on a heparin drip and bridged over to coumadin.
FS and blood sugars were checked and were well controlled through his hospital course.
As pt was treated his Cr trended down back to baseline.

Outpatient Lab Work Patient should have INR drawn every other day with his first INR drawn tomorrow [**2125-7-11**] 9.
This likely occurred because your INR was very high at 8.5.
We want your INR between 2.5-3.5 in order to prevent clots on your valve.
Initially, your blood cultures were positive.
We will also have someone come to your house and check your INR tomorrow, [**7-11**].
