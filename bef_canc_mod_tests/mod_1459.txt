Sepsis:  Pt's sepsis was likely secondary to pneumonia and mild element of adrenal insufficiency (in setting of chronic steroids for Crohn's disease) causing transient hypotensions requiring pressors esp given bandemia, infiltrate on CXR and rapid improvement with abx.
PCP was also considered given pt's immunosuppression but unlikely given an LDH of 194.
An induced sputum was sent for PCP and was pending at the time of discharge.
UA negative and abd CT negative for acute pathology.
Blood cx were negative.
A CXR showed some evidence of failure so she was diuresed gently.
She continued to desaturate to 87-89% on ambulation so she was discharged with home oxygen which she will use until she is able to maintain sats >92%.
She was started on a heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic.
She should have her INR closely monitored for the first several days following discharge due to fluctuating values.
Fasting lipids were checked and a low dose statin was started for an LDL of 117.
