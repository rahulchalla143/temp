Underwent ERCP and CBD stent [**9-16**] to treat obstruction in the lower third of the biliary tree felt to be from stone or stricture.
EGD and C-scope [**10-10**] showed gastritis, duodenitis, and a small erosion/ulceration of the skin at the anal anastamosis with evidence of oozing.
CT there showed ECF.

Surgery compared OSH CT to our prior images and felt that anastamotic leak was old with just increased output now, and recommended conservative management given his poor surgical candidacy.
He does not think that his ostomy output or rectal drainage has changed in quantity.

Piperacillin/Tazobactam sensitivity testing performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**]          [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Ulcerated non-mobile complex atheroma in the descending aorta at the esophageal level of 35 cm from the gum line  CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE  [**2194-11-7**] Following this, an 8 French catheter was then introduced into the collection under CT fluoroscopic guidance using via trocar technique.
CT fluoroscopic imaging confirmed successful placement of the catheter.
At the time the catheter deployment, total of 200 ml of fluid drainage was removed revealing a mixture of stool and blood, of note blood clot was seen on the preprocedure scan in the collection.
[**11-14**] CT ABD/Pelvis - report pending  Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with complicated history including hx of metastatic rectal cancer s/p multiple surgeries including colostomy, and probable neoadjuvant chemo and XRT, and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, recurrent enterocutaneous fistula, and clear cell RCC (s/p partial nephrectomy), was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cholangitis c/b liver abscesses (drained last admission), septic shock, respiratory failure (intubated).
Pt presented 12 days later with complaints of copius rectal drainage, hypotension, and sepsis which appears to be due fungemia.
Pt ERCP was delayed secondary to tachycardia, and in the intervening days his LFT's trended down and it seemed unlikely that this infectious picture was related to a biliary process as the patient grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40140**] from his blood Cx on [**2194-11-4**].
Pt was started on Micafungin and PICC catheter tip was sent for culture and also grew yeast.
ID was consulted for fungemia, and TTE was done to look for endocarditis.
TEE revealed large deep ulceration of an aortic plaque.
# Cholangitis/Liver abscess/Presacral fluid collection: Pt was known to have liver abscesses from cholangitis from his previous hospitalization.
Considering the resolution of his liver abscesses, and the chronic and incurable nature of his pelvic fluid collection, ID recommended discontinuation of the Pip/tazo.
The micro from the pelvic fluid collection shows ESBL e.coli, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to pip/tazo.
It was unclear if pocket resolved or if drain no longer accessing pocket, so another CT scan was obtained which showed enlarged peri=rectal fluid collection.
chronic cholecystitis:  Ab ct showed large fluid collection in the liver, so patient was initially scheduled for IR drainage of this collection.
However, re-examination of the images revealed that patient had markedly appearing gallbladder.
Patient without RUQ pain whatsoever, no fevers, normal wbc count - all off zosyn.
He was counselled that the gallbladder may still represent occult infection and cancer, and that the peri-rectal fluid collection of stool may also become problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
Yet, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] was very clear in his wishes to continue hospitalization for his conditions when necessary.
