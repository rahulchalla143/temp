CT HEAD [**8-25**] POST-OP Expected postoperative changes status post evacuation of right-sided subdural hematoma and right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT Head [**8-26**]: Status post right craniotomy for subdural hemorrhage evacuation,  decreasing size of post-surgical bed with decreased mass effect, evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage  CT Head [**8-27**]: Little change since the previous study with stable leftward shift of midline structures of approximately 6 mm.
CT head [**8-28**]: Improving leftward shift of midline structures, now measuring 4 mm, previously 6 mm, with resolving pneumocephalus.
MRI brain [**8-28**] +/- gad 1.
Post-operative changes of subdural hematoma evacuation with blood products and air within the subdural space measuring up to 1.4 mm as on the CT obtained earlier on the same day, [**2111-8-28**].
No enhancing brain lesions seen on the post-gadolinium images.
CT head [**8-30**]: Stable appearance of the brain, status post right craniotomy with a stable 3.5 mm leftward shift.
CTA chest +/- [**9-3**]: No evidence of pulmonary embolism in the first to fifth order pulmonary arteries, although evaluation distal to this level particularly in the lower lobes is limited by atelectasis.
[**9-5**] CT A/P w/o con:  No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Cardiogram showed a regular tachycardia.
[**2111-9-30**] CT Head IMPRESSION: .
The ventricles are prominent, however, stable compared to CT from [**2111-9-30**].
At the OSH she had a Noncontrast CT scan of the head which showed a Right sided acute on Chronic SDH as well as a Right temporal ICH measuring 2.9cm x 2.5cm.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] her exam was poor as she was following no commands, and her pupils were asymmetric the decision was made to take her emergently to the OR for evacuation of the SDH.
Intraoperatively she was noted to have an INR of 1.7 and a PTT of 56.5.
Plastics was consulted to evaluate her facial fractures and recommended a dedicated Maxillofacial CT to better evaluate the extent of the fractures.
On [**8-26**], a CT of the cervical spine was obtained to rule out neck injury.
Her neurological exam reamined unchanged.
On [**8-27**] - a repeat CT dmonstrated little to no change in the size of her SDH and MLS.
An MRI was ordered to rule out stroke, and this was negative.
Keppra was added to her Dilantin, and her neurological exam continued to be closely monitored.
On [**9-1**], patient's exam much improved.
She was also given a bolus of dilantin for a dilantin level of 6.1.
A CT Chest was obtained and was negative for PE.
EKG showed tachycardia and enzymes were orderd and the first CK was 48.
Her clindamycin was dicontinued as she completed a 7 days course for her nasal fracture.
Neurology was closely followng her dilantin levels and bolusing when appropriate.
CT chest revealed bilateral pleural effusions on [**9-3**].
She also became quite anemic with a HCT of 18.
An anemia workup revealed decreased reticulocytes as well as iron deficiency.
She underwent CT Abdomen/Pelvis which revealed no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
The patient was transfused 2u pRBCs and her HCT remained stable at around 30 for the remainder of her hospitalization.
Urine lytes were consistent with SIADH.
She was started on keppra, dilantin, and lorazepam with tapering lorazepam (stopped prior to discharge)and dilantin based on level (150mg TID).
She had a positive culture which grew enterococcus.
