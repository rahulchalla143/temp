On the following morning the visiting nurse came to her house and found her blood pressure in her L arm to be 220/165.
Of note, during her last admission for hypoglycemia, she had flash pulmonary edema and respiratory distress after her L arm blood pressure was found to be elevated to 218/118.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2124-1-24**], the mitral regurgitation is probably worse (and almost certainly underestimated in both studies), and the pulmonary hypertension is also worse.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 y/o female with significant risk factors for CAD, s/p CABG, AVR, s/p atrial thrombus on anticoagulation, PM for complete heart block who presented with acute dsypnea, and hypertension urgency.
Cardiac enzymes were flat.
Echo prior to discharge showed severe bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis and worse mitral regurgitation compared to previous studies.
You came to the hospital because your blood pressure was high; it's possible that this is because you weren't taking your medications correctly.
We took off some extra fluid and started additional blood pressure medications.
