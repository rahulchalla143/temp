In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 114/68, heart rate 52, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air, 97% on four liters nasal cannula.
The patient's initial electrocardiogram demonstrated antero-septal ST elevations with persistent chest pain.
Heart rate 71.
Blood pressure 115/67.
Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 95% on three liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric sclera, extraocular movements intact bilaterally.
Pulmonary exam:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
LABORATORY AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 9.8, hematocrit 44.6, platelet count 301,000.
Chem-7 with sodium of 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 104, bicarbonate 20, BUN 16, creatinine 1.0, glucose 153.
Cardiac enzymes:  First set:  CK 90, MB not done, troponin I 1.6.
Second set:  CK 4396, CK-MB 613, troponin I greater than 50.
Third set:  CK 2759, CK-MB 299, troponin I greater than 50.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no overt failure, no infiltrate appreciated.
Initial electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 86, right bundle branch block with intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevations in V2 and V3, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in leads V4 and V5, Q waves in V2 through V5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization without complication.
Catheterization demonstrated a right dominant system with multivessel disease including mildly diseased left circumflex, moderate (40-50%) occluded right coronary artery, 20% left main occlusion, and total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.
Right heart pressures were elevated with a right atrial pressure of 9, right ventricular pressures of 34/16, pulmonary artery pressures of 36/17 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.
The patient ruled in for an ST elevation anterior wall myocardial infarction with peak CK of 4396.
The patient also remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry without signs of arrhythmia.
A post myocardial infarction echocardiogram demonstrated severely decreased systolic function with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, severe hypokinesis of the inferior and anterior septum, as well as anterior free wall, and extensive apical akinesis.
The echocardiogram also demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild pulmonary hypertension, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
No thrombus was seen on echocardiogram and the patient was started on anticoagulation for akinetic/poor left ventricular function with heparin and Coumadin, goal INR [**1-1**].
The patient's lipid panel demonstrated a total cholesterol of 172, elevated LDL of 124, low high density lipoprotein of 25, and triglycerides of 114.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-30%.
Patient was prescribed Lovenox, quantity sufficient for four days until next blood work and INR level.
The risk stratification is part of an ongoing Electrophysiology study for potential placement of ICD.
