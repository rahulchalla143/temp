CATH ([**2159-4-24**]) - Clean LCX, LMCA, LAD.
ECHO ([**2159-3-19**]) - EF 60%.
CHEST CT ([**2159-4-30**]) - No PE.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2159-5-23**] 5:39 AM FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next previous similar study obtained on [**5-22**], (15 hours interval).
In MICU, he was thought to have multifocal pna based on imaging although sputum culture was negative.
However, as mentioned, the CT continued to put out a significant amount of fluid and as a result, the patient was transferred to the thoracics service where he underwent a VATS and talc pleurodesis on [**2159-5-18**].
The chest tube was pulled [**2159-5-23**] with post xray showing possible small apical left pneumothorax.
Subsequent CXR showed resolution.
# CHF: The patient has an EF 60%, but likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction.
His hematocrit was monitored daily and remained stable.
A video swallow study is being done to evaluate for aspiration risk.
His son [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19643**] [**Doctor Last Name **] was the primary contact.
