His EtOh level was negative and his Utox was negative at [**Hospital1 46**].
He had a CT head which was negative.
He had a negative UA and a CXR with a question of a LLL density, and pt had left shift with bands at OSH suggestive of infection and possible PNA.
CXR here showed a left sided effusion, but no pneumonia.
He had an abdominal U/S with dopplers which showed an unchanged TIPS occulsion.
He had a diagnostic paracentesis which was not consistent with SBP, however one of the peritoneal cultures sent grew out E.coli.
This was thought to be a contaminent as he had only 56 WBC and 3% poly on examination of his peritoneal fluid.
# DM II:  The patient was monitored with qid finger sticks and was continued on NPH and sliding scale insulin.
# Anemia: Baseline Hct 23-28.
He developed no signs of active bleeding here and his plt remained >20.
Secondary: EtOH induced cirrhosis - Portal hypertension - Grade I esophageal varices - Diuretic refractory ascites.
Your ascitic fluid was negative for SBP.
One of the cultures did grow out E. coli, however, given that you improved on just ciprofloxacin, and you were essentially asymptomatic aside from confusion, we think that this was a contaminant.
