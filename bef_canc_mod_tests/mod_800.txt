Due to his amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, he is completely dependent on ventilatory support and has been a resident of [**Hospital1 20731**] for several years now.
As part of the workup for this, it was found that he had an atrophic thick right kidney with multiple calculi, and it was believed that this was a likely cause of the urosepsis.
Status post colon cancer with resection in [**11-22**], with creation of colostomy at [**Hospital1 188**].
Free water 350 cc q.8 h. 14.
Ventilatory settings have been constant SIMV of 10    to 12, tidal volume 700, PEEP 5, and oxygen content 30    percent.
LABORATORY DATA:  Values on presentation were CBC, which showed a white blood cell count 45.4; however, this was thought to be secondary to intraoperative use of steroids.
Hematocrit 35.8 and platelets 376,000.
Urinalysis unremarkable for blood, nitrate, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, and urobilin, however, greater than 50 RBCs and greater than 1000 WBCs.
Sodium is 142, potassium 3.7 chloride 113, bicarbonate 16, BUN 12, creatinine 0.2, and glucose 179.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pertinent examination in the Post- Anesthesia Care Unit shows a moderately obese man ventilated through the trachea.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination is unremarkable.
Abdominal examination is notable for a G-tube in the left upper quadrant.
Abdominal examination is soft, nontender, good bowel sounds in all four quadrants.
Arterial blood gas on 30 percent oxygen showed a pH of 7.39, pCO2 of 26, pO2 of 195, bicarbonate 16, and base excess of negative 7.
Cardiac echocardiogram and subclavian vein echocardiogram were performed to assess for any evidence of any vegetation, which may have been foci for the infection and none were found.
The subclavian line was then removed and several sets of surveillance blood cultures had been sent and will continue to be followed.
On postoperative day four, the patient's tube feeds were started at a rate of 10 cc an hour of ProMod and gradually advanced to a target rate of 80 cc an hour, checking residuals every six hours.
