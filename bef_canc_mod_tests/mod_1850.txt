CT Head [**5-24**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of CT compared with the prior examination obtained earlier on the same day.
EEG [**5-25**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of intermittent right central parietal and left temporal and central sharp transients.
Echo [**5-28**]: Conclusions: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRI of the head: IMPRESSION: 1.
This finding may represent a technical artifact, or less likely blood products, cells or protein within the subarachnoid space.
Carotid US: FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.
Her symptoms, confusion and cbc returned to her normal baseline upon control of her blood pressure.
After she was changed to Valproic acid, pt remained afebrile over the [**4-24**] prior to discharge and without any signs of active infection.
Initial seizures likely [**2-21**] HTN emergency - hypertensive leukoencephalopathy.
- Head CT negative x 2 on [**5-24**] negative for hemorrhage or mass, MRI was not thought to be necessary at this point, neuro recs.
Her valproic acid have been monitored closely to titrate dosage, currently she is on Valproic acid 500mg po bid standing, last valproic level on [**6-3**] was 75.
Hypertension: Pt was admitted for hypertensive urgency with end organ damage - hypertensive leukoencephalopathy and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
Obtained secondary hypertension work-up was negative (incl.
MRI Abdomen, TSH, Cortisol - serum epinephrine and metanephrine were within normal limits).
BP was hard to control at first but stabilized over the past 72h under enforced treatment with Labetalol, Lisinopril, Clonidine, Nifedipine and intermittent Hydralazine (which was d/c on [**6-2**], due to orthostatic symptoms).
The set goal for her SBP is 120-170, since the pt probably has a history of long-standing maltreated HTN and is used to high pressures.
Initial DDx included Arteritis temporalis (ESR 7) vs. TIA vs. right posterior artery aneurysm.
The obtained work-up included MRI/MRA (questionable subarachnoidal bleeding), carotid duplex (minimal bilat.
Pt initially presented with Hct of 29.8, normocytotic.
Retic count in [**Month (only) 404**] was 1.4%, indicating an impaired production.
The hemolysis studies obtained revealed an elevated LDH and a decreased haptoglobin, which are found in hemolysis.
Hemolysis labs obtained revealed elevated LDH (not compared to previous days), Haptoglobin <20 (measured twice), normal direct and total Bili.
Anemia and decrease in Hct is thought to be due to ESRD, ACD and hospital course (HD, frequent blood draws).
She responded adequately to transfusion, Hct rose from 25.6 to 28.1 to 33.9 in am of [**6-7**].
Thrombocytopenia Pt initially presented with ptl of 44.
Indicative for an underlying TTP are the following findings are thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, schistocytes, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, elevated creatinine, mental status changes and fever.
However the obtained ADAMTS13 to test for TTP was negative.
Given that the pt Hct stabilized once her BP was controlled better made a MHA secondary to hypertensive crisis most likely.
The ptl count has been steadily increasing since [**5-24**], being 148 on day of discharge.
ESRD, s/p renal transplantation in [**2173**], tx rejection in [**1-25**] now back on dialysis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please go to [**Hospital 101208**] Clinic tomorrow to have your blood pressure checked by a nurse.
Followup Instructions: Please have your blood pressure checked at the Women's Clinic at Carny tomorrow; .
Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Doctor Last Name **], Neurology on thursday, [**6-6**] at 1pm on neurology unit CC8 (SB) for seizure follow-up.
