HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, last dialysis Friday, coronary artery disease, CHF with an EF of 40%, presents with acute shortness of breath with gradual onset.
CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%, +1 MR. 4.
for systolic BPs greater than 120.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  In the ED, 99.4, blood pressure 116/38, heart rate 75, breathing at a rate of 19 at 100% on mask ventilation of 5 and 5.
JVP at 9 cm.
Extremities:  Warm, no DP but PT pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 16.0, hematocrit 37, platelets 470.
Chem-7 pertinent for potassium 5.4, BUN and creatinine 79 and 7.3 respectively.
CK 41.
Chest x-ray consistent with CHF, pulmonary edema, consolidation at left lower base with bilateral small pleural effusions.
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 91, normal axis, normal intervals, Qs in III, T wave inversion in III, hyperacute versus peaked T waves in precordial leads, ST depression, 1 mm in V5 and V6, and I which were new.
Given the patient's prior significant coronary artery disease, continued on aspirin and Plavix and monitored with serial enzymes to rule out an ST elevation MI given positive troponins.
The patient was dialyzed on hospital day number one with resolution of her shortness of breath, continued to monitor troponins which reached a peak of 0.2.
LFTs were obtained in-house which were normal.
The cholesterol panel revealed a cholesterol of 129, LDL 65, HDL 33, and triglycerides of 135.
In discussion with the Renal Team, it was felt that the patient's dry weight goal could be decreased and to be further monitored as an outpatient, hemodialysis continued, calcium acetate and Nephrocaps as well as strict fluid and sodium restrictions.
