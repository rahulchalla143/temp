Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M w/ PMHx of HTN, DM, and ESRD on HD who was known to have second degree AV block on prior EKG noted on admission to have deteriorated to complete heart block.
In addition to the hypoglycemia, he may have been particularly sensitive to sedating medications, and there may be some metabolic component given his ESRD although his electrolytes were not markedly abnormal.
His GFS were checked every 4 hours, he received repeated reorientation, and benzodiazepines were avoided.
He received a CXR the day following his procedure showing that the leads were appropriately positioned.
