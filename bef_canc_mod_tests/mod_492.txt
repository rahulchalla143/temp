Her colonoscopy was performed and showed friable inflamed mucosa c/w Crohn's dz.
On admission her INR was supratherapeutic likely exacerbating her GI bleed.
Patient was treated with FFP in the ED for an INR of 3.5.
After her colonoscopy and once she was not actively bleeding, a heparin gtt was started for short term anticoagulation since it was felt that her risk of thrombosis was high with her underlying disease.
Initially her PTT was difficult to control and required frequent adjustments to her sliding scale however this later stabilized within the therapeutic range.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Lower GI bleed 2.
Please make sure you have your INR checked in 2 days and report the results to the PCP.
Please return to the hospital with any bleeding, black stool, fevers, chills, abdominal pain or any other complaints.
