Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy, colonoscopy, right and left cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG (SVG-D, SVG-RCA and LIMA-LAD SVG-RCA which was occluded on [**12/2107**] catheterization), diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation/flutter, type II diabetes presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea over one day.
Of note patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an acute MI in [**2107-12-9**], at that time PCI was performed with SVG to the diag was performed.
Lower back pain, has l-spine compression fractures GI bleed   Social History: Quit tobacco [**2094**]; rarely drinks alcohol; lives with his wife; Currently on disability, former director of an exercise company  Family History: Grandmother with pacemaker, no other known heart disease  Physical Exam: T 98.6; HR 60-65; BP 112/62; RR 19; O2 99% on 4L Gen: Obese male Caucasian, no acute distress.
Gait assessment deferred   Pertinent Results: WBC 20.4 Hct 31.7 (baseline around 30) Plt 434 90 neutophils, 4 bands P-BNP 1650 CK 24 Trop 0.06 INR 0.9 PTT 21.8 Na 141 K 4.1 Cl 107 BUN 26 Cr 1.4 Gluc 182 Digoxin 1.2 .
[**2107-2-1**] echocardiogram 1.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Bleeding Study [**2108-2-7**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 120 minutes were obtained.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show no sites of abnormal radiotracer uptake.
Dynamic blood pool images show no active gastrointestinal bleeding.
Bleeding Study [**2108-2-8**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen from 0-79 minutes and from 150-180 minutes were obtained.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show a normal pattern of tracer distribution.
Dynamic blood pool images show somewhat heterogeneous blood pool throughout the abdomen, most prominent in the left lower quadrant.
The activity does change in distribution throughout the examination but does not appear to collect.
Further diuresis was stopped as his creatinine trended upward the following day.
His hematocrit trended further downward and the patient developed BRBPR, melena was not noted.
Planned catheterization on HD 3 was therefore deferred.
On HD [**4-12**] patient had multiple episodes of BRBPR; however his hematocrit remained stable.
BP and pulse remained stable until the afternoon of HD 5. .
At this time when the patient became tachycardic to the 130's with SBP to 70's after another episode of BRBPR.
NG lavage was negative and stat blood draw revealed no change.
EKG revealed ST depressions in inferolateral leads consistent with posterior.
Posterior lead EKG was also consistent with posterior territory ischemia  The blood pressure spontaneously trended to the 90's range systolic.
His blood pressure stabilized for the next two days.
It was believed the hypotension was secondary to posterior ischemia given the anatomy of his CAD and his EKG changes .
On HD 7 the patient underwent catheterization with DES to the OM1.
His blood pressure and pulse remained unchanged.
GI consult was notified and he was taken to the intensive care unit for endoscopy and further monitoring.
Upper endoscopy revealed gastritis but no active source of bleeding.
He continued to have melanic stools, and his HCT continued to trend down although vital signs remained stable.
Bleeding scan was negative x2.
A colonoscopy was preformed which was filled with blood.
The ileum showed ulcers but since there was no blood seen on colonoscopy in the ileum, this is likely not the source of the bleed.
He was continued on aspirin and plavix given recent MI and s/p cardiac cath with stent placement which likely contributed to persistent bleeding.
Range 12,00 20,000 now [**Numeric Identifier 2686**].
His outpatient regimen was eventually restarted and his creatinine remained at baseline at the time of discharge.
