On [**2160-9-23**], going back, a chest x-ray was obtained to evaluate the right IJ which demonstrated a small lateral right pneumothorax.

Chest x- ray was performed demonstrating no radiographic evidence for pneumonia, bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left.
Also, CT abdomen and pelvis was performed because of the fever and acute elevated LFTs, which demonstrated new right pleural effusion with atelectasis, postsurgical changes in the abdomen, patent portal vein with focal relative narrowing and questionable web, and small free fluid in the pelvis.
