She took hot milk and water, and then felt worse, with a heart rate of 180.
She says this was similar to her symptoms last week when admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], but the intensity of this episode was far greater, especially with regard to her heart rate and SOB.
VS prior to transfer were 98.1, HR 103, BP 107/69, RR 28, O2sat 99% on 4L NC.
A CXR was done and showed minimal change from [**2-6**].
EKG with sinus tachycardia, no significant changes.
Labs without elevation in WBC, normal lactate, cardiac enzymes normal in ED x 1. .
Still feels her heart rate is fast.

ECHO [**2-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-2-3**], the image quality on the current study is suboptimal.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower, but may be related to technical quality rather than a true change.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension, with PA systolic pressure of 70mmHg on room air, with normal to mildly elevated mean PCWP of 13 mmHg.
With 100% inhaled oxygen, the PA systolic pressure decreased to 62mmHg from 70mmHg, and mean PA pressure decreased from 45mmHg to 38mmHg, with a decrease in PVR from 730 dynes-s/cm5 to 645 dynes-s/cm5.
.. CXR [**2175-2-17**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Cardiac events were felt unlikely given normal enzymes, unchanged EKG, symptom resolution.
She has a history of pulmonary HTN, with echo during last admission demonstrating significantly worsening pressures and RV dilation.
She had a CXR in the ED without PNA although with pleural effusion that has been relatively stable; however she had no cough or clear fevers at home so this was not thought to be a contributing factor.
On HD#2, an ABG was drawn.
Her recent CT chest also showed some evidence of pulmonary edema/effusions.
An echo was performed that showed no evidence of shunt.
Ultimately the decision was made to undergo right heart catheterization to evaluate pulmonary pressures.
The catheterization showed decreased pressures with increased oxygen delivery.
Heart rate ranged from 90-110 during majority of hospitalization.
She was monitored on telemetry for the duration of the hospitalization without further episodes.

You underwent several studies to evaluate your heart and lung function.
