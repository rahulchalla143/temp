Daughter stated that she tried to put it on her nose and that it looked like she was "gagging."
In the ED, VS: 98.9  91/53  HR 96  RR 20  96% on NRB.
CXR with cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
EKG unchanged compared to prior.
CT head negative.
CT torso could not be completed as pt without any PIV and cannot run contrast through any central access or PICC.
Per [**Name (NI) **], pt with "labile" blood pressures.
Sarcoidosis 9.
Pulmonary HTN 10.
GEN: somnolent, only moaning and groaning to yelling HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP - unable to examine, no LAD, JVD could not be asessed due to anatomy CHEST: CTAB anteriorly, no w/r/r CV: irreg irreg, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: large ventral midline hernia that is reducible, obese, TTP of epigastric area EXT: no c/c/e NEURO: moving all extremities, screaming in pain during blood draws, attempts at a-line, saying "you put me in hell", otherwise, incoherent DERM: no rashees noted.
Pertinent Results: CXR's: [**2109-8-19**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-13**], the opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema have worsened.
Given that the patient is in hemodialysis, a post-procedure study should demonstrate some clearing of this process.
Repeat CXR on [**2109-8-20**] In comparison with study of [**8-19**], the degree of vascular congestion is decreased.
[**2109-8-13**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-12**], there is again diffuse pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema, though supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Echo [**2109-8-13**]:  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-4**], probable vegetation (vs. torn chordae) is now seen on the tricuspid valve and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has markedly increased.
EEG  [**2109-8-13**]: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to the slow background.
Limited evaluation of the pancreas due to overlying bowel gas.
CT torso [**2109-8-9**]: 1.
Would consider repeat chest CT when patient is stable to better stage sarcoid if alteration in management will occur.
Unchanged large ventral hernia without CT findings to suggest  incarceration/strangulation although this is a clinical diagnosis.
CT Head: [**2109-8-9**] There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The visualized ethmoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are normal.
Again noted is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells, not significantly changed from prior studies when accounting for differences in technique.

**FINAL REPORT [**2109-8-20**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2109-8-20**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Doctor Last Name **] POWERS @  2349 ON [**2109-8-20**].
CT head negative.
EKG with no acute changes.
EEG showed slowing consistent with toxic encephalopathy not seizure disorder.
ABG in the unit ruled out hypercarbia.
Repeated CT scan showed no acute change.
Urine cultures negative.
Blood cultures only one bottle out of many positive for coag negative staph.
Her chest x ray showed pulmonary edema.
She was titrated to 6LNC and a blood gas revealed a PAO2 of 68.
She was dialyzed and her CXR showed improved pulmonary edema.
There was initial concern for pneumonia given her WBC and cough, however, the improvement of her CXR after dialysis argued against pneumonia.
There was concern for PE, given the improvement of her oxygenation with dialysis, a workup for PE was not pursued.
# Tricuspid valve vegetation: Found incidentally on echo while working up for unresponsive episode.
Surveillance blood cultures performed daily, as above only one positive bottle out of many.
Patient has had elevated amylase and lipase since [**2107**] but for brief time lipase normalized.
If patient develops abdominal pain in the future, would consider reevaluation with possible evaluation by GI medicine.
Trended CBC while inpatient, no levels less than 20's, no spontaneous bleeding.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Sarcoid: stable, CT scan that showed diffuse nodular opacities.
Recommend repeat ct scan in future as an outpatient.
# CAD: Unable to restart lisinopril or metoprolol as pt's blood pressure so labile.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1) tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
You were presumed to have had a drop in your blood pressure secondary to fluid being taken off quickly.
NPH insulin was stopped because your blood sugars have been well controlled with only sliding scale.
