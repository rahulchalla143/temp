CXR [**2-8**]: FINDINGS: Single AP portable frontal view of the chest was obtained.
[**2-8**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 139.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-1-20**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate .
CTA [**2-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
# Hypoxia/dyspnea/acute COPD exacerbation/recent RML PNA - Presented with shortness of breath and cough, O2 requirement; + sick contact at home (son); no radiographic changes on CXR, overall improvement in prior PNA seen on CT scan comparison; thought to have likely COPD exacerbation; underlying trigger may be chronic subclinical aspiration events; given recent prednisone 40mg course, started on prednisone 60mg + azithromycin.
CTA was performed and was negative for PE, post radiation therapy changes were noted.
Pt underwent a speech and swallow examination that was not suggestive of aspiration.
Chest x-ray was repeated on [**2-13**] showing improvement.
Given the RML opacification that was seen on CTA and prior CXR, PT WILL NEED TO HAVE A REPEAT CXR OR CT SCAN TO ENSURE RESOLUTION OF OPACIFICATION GIVEN SMOKING HISTORY AND HISTORY OF MALIGNANCY AND POSSIBILITY OF RECURRENT MALIGNANCY SHOULD OPACIFICATION NOT IMPROVE.
Subtherapeutic INR on admission.
INR on day of discharge was 2.9.
INR recheck on [**2178-2-16**] at PCP's office.
Pt will need outpatient follow up and repeat chest imaging in a few week's time.
Continued atorvastatin 40mg daily, asa 81mg and metoprolol equivalent of 100mg XL daily.
#normocytic anemia-appears stable and chronic.
Should this return, consider further work up and/or colonoscopy .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -F/U INR, adjust coumadin prn -repeat chest imaging to ensure resolution of opacities given prior malignancy history -consider outpatient pulmonary evaluation  Medications on Admission: - atorvastatin 40mg daily - fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50mcg/dose [**Hospital1 **] - levothyroxine 25mcg daily - aspirin 81mg - diltiazem Extended Release 120mg daily - warfarin 5mg daily - metformin 850mg daily - metoprolol succinate 100mg daily - omeprazole 20mg daily - ranitidine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] - albuterol prn - ipratropium prn - Tylenol 650mg q6h prn  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: acute COPD exacerbation hypoxemia atrial fibrillation CAD hypothryoidism history of lung and larygneal cancer.
You will need to have a repeat chest x-ray or CT scan in a few weeks to ensure resolution of your lung findings/prior pneumonia.
