Her shortness of breath was felt to be multifactorial, secondary to mild restrictive lung disease/COPD, MG, and cardiac contribution with mild diastolic dysfunction.
A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Plan was made to obtain an out-patient sleep study with neuromuscular montage in [**2113-7-29**].
* In ED, initial vitals T98.4, HR 88, BP 94/56, RR 21, Sat 98% on 2L NC.
ABG performed 7.45/47/108 on 2L NC.
A CTA was obtained, remarkable for bilateral PEs.
Work-up with unremarkable LP [**2111**] (0W, 0R, 24 prot, 82 gluc, lyme neg, VDRL NR, negative oligoclonal bands, cultures negative), normal SPEP/UPEP, and normal folate.
Mild restrictive lung defect, last PFTs with FVC 0.92 (39%), FEV1 0.63 (40%), FEV1/FVC 68 (102%).
Osteoarthritis of hands bilaterally 8.
Preserved systolic function with EF>75% on echo 04/[**2111**].
Physical Exam: VITALS: T97.3, HR 90, BP 136/66, RR 24, Sat 100% on 4L NC.
Complete neurological exam not performed.
Bilateral PEs: Submassive, hemodynamically stable with stable saturation on low flow oxygen.
Her LENIs were negative and no further intervention was required.
An echo was obtained which did not show any RV strain or any clot in transit.
She had PTT checks every 4 hours and was monitored carefully without significant bleeding.
Goal INR [**3-3**].
She also likely has a component of hypoventilation during sleep, and is scheduled for a sleep study with neuromuscular montage to be done on [**2113-8-14**], in the [**Hospital1 18**] sleep lab.
Titrated off oxygen well to room air sats > 95%.
5) Anemia: Chronic due to disease and blood loss due to oozing from pheresis catheter and frequent phlebotomy -she was maintained on iron therapy and hcts were checked daily .
* Code: Discussed with patient and her cousin, DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**].
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: take as directed for goal INR of [**3-3**].
Take your coumadin and be sure to have your INR checked every 3-4 days until the level is consistently [**3-3**].
As your INR was slightly high (4.4) on day of discharge, you should skip your dose on [**7-31**] and resume with the newer low dose coumadin (1mg) on [**8-1**].
You should have your doctor check your INR in [**4-1**] days.
