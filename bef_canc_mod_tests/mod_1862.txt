Admission Date:  [**2111-6-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-6-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old African American female with HIV, last CD4 count 240 and viral load of undetectable in [**2111-4-19**], and a history of Factor VIII deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates.
Spinal stenosis, L4-L5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation, temperature is 95.9, pulse 133, blood pressure 180/71, respiratory rate 32, saturating 95% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
Chest examination - expiratory wheezes noted, decreased breath sounds throughout, no stridor, no crackles.
Cardiovascular examination - tachycardia, II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border.
Abdominal examination is soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no guarding, no rebound.
Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ throughout.
LABORATORY DATA:  Upon presentation, white count was 10.1, hematocrit 24.9, platelet count 343,000, 42% neutrophils, 52% bands, 4% monocytes, 0.7% eosinophils.
Sodium 136, potassium 5.0, chloride 106, bicarbonate 15, blood urea nitrogen 53, creatinine 3.6, glucose 325.
CK enzymes 130.
Arterial blood gases on 100% nonrebreather was pH 7.21, pCO2 46, paO2 296.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 140, left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversion and ST depression in lead V5 through V6.
Chest x-ray revealed the heart size normal, diffuse bilateral interstitial process with septal lines, pulmonary edema versus interstitial pneumonitis.
Her troponins were positive at 9.0.
CK enzymes were 130 and upward trending.
Echocardiogram was obtained which revealed ejection fraction of less than 40% with wall motion abnormality consistent with ischemia.
That evening after cardiology consultation, the patient subsequently became hypotensive and CK enzymes subsequently increased to 1600 with positive MB index and positive troponin greater than 50.
The patient was emergently intubated and was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and subsequently brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where a cardiac catheterization was performed.
Congestive heart failure - The patient during hospital course had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure from a blood transfusion.
Upon initial admission, cardiac echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of less than 40% and wall motion abnormalities consistent with ischemia.
Repeat echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 40% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and akinesis of the basal inferior and lateral walls with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Neurology - The patient upon admission was relatively [**Name2 (NI) 3584**] and oriented times three, however, during hospital course status post cardiac catheterization and intubation and acute renal failure, the patient's mental status subsequently waxed and waned and the patient was subsequently confused most of the time.
Status post cardiac catheterization, the patient was subsequently Dopamine pressors for blood pressure support for a brief period of time.
The patient was able to be weaned down from face mask to nasal cannula as well as maintaining her oxygen saturation relatively well.
Infectious disease - The patient has a history of HIV positivity since [**2104**], on highly active antiretroviral therapy with her last CD4 count of 230 and a viral load which was undetectable.
Renal - The patient had an episode of acute renal failure, status post cardiac catheterization.
The patient's renal failure was thought secondary to possibly contrast nephropathy, cardiac catheterization versus emboli from cardiac catheterization to the renal glomerulus.
The patient's creatinine subsequently began increasing and subsequently plateaued at 6.1 to 6.2 and remained stable at that time level.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - During her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was intubated and did not have good nutrition and subsequently after the patient was successfully extubated, the patient was able to tolerate sips and moderate p.o.
