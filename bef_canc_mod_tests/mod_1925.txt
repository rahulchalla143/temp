With EMS, the patient was speaking in two to three-word sentences, oxygen saturations 90% on 4 liters, respiratory rate 28 to 30, received two nebulizers en route.
Temperature 99.3, blood pressure 170/65, heart rate 106, respiratory rate 15, oxygen saturation 90% on 4 liters.
Arterial blood gas: 7.19/119/85/47.
Peripheral oxygen saturations 96%.
Repeat arterial blood gas:  7.30/83/56/43.
Chest x-ray shows questionable right lower lobe infiltrate superimposed upon long-term right lower lobe opacity with question of scarring.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.3, heart rate 113, blood pressure 144/57, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 88 to 92% on 5 liters.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 20.4 (baseline 20.5), hematocrit 38.4, platelets 352, MCV 102, differential 86 neutrophils, 2 bands.
INR 1.0.
Sodium 147, potassium 4.0, chloride 99, bicarbonate 38, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7, glucose 192.
CK 63, troponin less than 0.3.
Digoxin level 1.7.
Electrocardiogram shows MAT at 110, normal axis, normal intervals, no segmental Q waves, normal R wave progression, no significant ST changes, with nonspecific ST depression in V5 to V6.
Chest x-ray was a suboptimal study with stable appearance of right lower lobe opacification, likely secondary to focal scarring, may have slight increase in opacity consistent with atelectasis or scarring or fluid within fissure.
Her PCO2 was noted to increase to over 100 and then stabilize in the 90s on her ventilation, without any evidence of somnolence secondary to hypercarbia.
She was able to maintain peripheral oxygen saturations and PCO2 in the 90s, with periods of rest off of her BiPAP on Venturi mask and nasal cannula combined, and also just nasal cannula on its own.
The patient remained tenuous during her Medical Intensive Care Unit course, and had an acute decompensation which was requiring increasing oxygen requirement in order to maintain her peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 88%.
When the patient developed a temperature spike and increased secretion production, repeat sputum culture was obtained, which was pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient also developed change in her stools to green liquid diarrhea with an increase in her white blood cell count from the baseline of 20 through her hospital course to 30, with evidence of increased bands.
Her theophylline level was checked as the possible precipitant, which revealed low levels.
Her blood pressure was elevated, and the patient was continued on Zestril, started at 10 and increased to 30 mg once daily at the time of this dictation, which obtained better blood pressure control without any evidence of increase in her creatinine.
Her BUN and creatinine were borderline high upon admission, and she was given some intravenous fluid hydration, given the mask impeded full oral intake.
She had hypernatremia with a sodium of 149, for which she was given free-water repletion via intravenous and then encouraged to take in oral intake.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient is on full oral intake.
