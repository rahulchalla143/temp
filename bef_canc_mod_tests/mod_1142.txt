Given severity of injury, he was on prophylactic levetiracetam, although no record of clinical seizures and continuous EEG monitoring for total of 6 days showed no electrographic seizures, but occasional right hemisphere and left frontal spikes.
Pertinent Results: Initial Labs:  10.4>11.8/34.2<346; 85 PMNs, 6 Bands, 5 Lymphs Na 140, K 4, CL 105, CO2 24, BUN 16, Cr 0.4, Gluc 128 ALT 31, AST 19, CK 357 Alk phos 144 T bili 0.8 Alb 3.6 Ca 8.6, Phos 3.7, Mg 1.6 PT 14.2, PTT 24.2, INR 1.2 Phenytoin 10.6  REPORTS:  EEG ([**2165-1-20**]): EEG gives evidence for a severe diffuse encephalopathy with the presence of persistent epileptiform activity (PLEDs)over the left central-temporal region.
EEG ([**2165-1-31**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of left frontal delta slowing which represents focal cerebral pathology.
While in the Neuro ICU, he was initially monitored on cEEG, which showed left central-temporal PLEDs.
His continued unresponsive to commnads during hospitalization was thought to possibly be related to his [**Last Name (LF) 85127**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the plan is to slowly taper this, while continuing his current doses of Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Dilantin 200 mg q8h.
3) ID: He was initially spiking fevers, which was believed to be due to his autonomic dysregulation, but cultures were sent and he did have blood cultures (both centrally and peripherally) positive for coag negative Staph.
While in the ICU, he also had a BAL, which ended up growing Pseudomonas and coag + Staph.
Repeat blood cx have been negative and a repeat sputum cx only showed sparse growth of Pseudomonas and Coag + Staph; this is likely colonization and as per ID, there is no need to continue antibiotics longer for this as long as there is no further fevers or respiratory distress.
Wound cultures were also performed of his areas of folliculitis on his torso to ensure that this was not a portal of entry of his bacteremia; there were no microorganisms seen on the wound cultures.
A CTA was subsequently performed and despite his IVC filter, there were acute segmental pulmonary emboli involving the right upper lobe anterior and apical segments and segmental and subsegmental emboli involving the posterior basal right lower lobe pulmonary arteries.
Other contributing factors could be pain induced tachycardia and now, from his PE as well.
7. mupirocin calcium 2 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).
10. white petrolatum-mineral oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.
You were then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where you had continued right arm twitching, head deviation to right, and eye twitching, which improved with propofol infusion and resolved with IV phenobarbital load.
On the last day of EEG monitoring, there was still diffuse slowing indicating an encephalopathy, but there were only very rare sharp waves in the left frontal region; this was an improvement from the initial EEGs.
While in the hospital, you were spiking fevers and were found to have blood cultures positive for coag negative Staph and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed while you were intubated and it grew Pseudomonas.
