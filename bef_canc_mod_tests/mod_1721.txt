On presentation to the emergency room, the patient was lethargic with [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing, dry mucous membranes, and a heart rate between 30 and 40.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 99 degrees, pulse 70, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, blood pressure 161/58.
HEENT examination revealed pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
The chest revealed coarse breath sounds transmitted diffusely with rales bibasilarly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed normal S1 and S2, occasional premature beats, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdominal examination revealed T-tube in place.
Genitourinary examination revealed Foley catheter draining cloudy amber urine and leaking at the insertion site.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of acute renal failure with creatinine going from 0.5 to 3.6 with minimal urine output.
His hospital course was significant for an increase in creatinine to a maximum of 7.3.
The differential diagnoses were thought to be acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis possibly with minimal chain disease.
Later in the evening, after hemodialysis, the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped down below 70.
His hematocrit was 20.2 down from 27 earlier in the day.
A CT scan was obtained of the abdomen and lower extremities which showed a right hematoma.
After being transferred to the medical floor, the patient remained stable except for a continued drop in his hematocrit such that he received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells over the course of [**6-25**] to [**6-29**].
In terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation, he has been rate controlled successfully on Lopressor; however within the last week as he has undergone hemodialysis and has begun approaching his dry weight, his blood pressure has begun to decline associated with the start of hemodialysis before volume was taken off.
His blood pressure was felt to be volume sensitive and we are in the processing of titrating his Lopressor down from 100 mg b.i.d.
which was initially used to control his atrial fibrillation to a dose that will be better tolerated by his blood pressure.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable while he was on the floor in the range of 120/70 with a pulse in the 80s.
Urinalysis sent off showed a high epithelial cell count and cultures of the Foley specimen of urine grew out both yeast and Staphylococcus aureus.
Repeat urinalysis and urine culture grew out only yeast at 106 colony forming units per milliliter and no Staphylococcus aureus.
8 hours; Lopressor 100 mg per G-tube b.i.d., hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 55 as well as hold a.m. dose on dialysis days Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; Heparin 5000 units subq.
