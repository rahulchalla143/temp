The patient has been hospitalized 3 times in the last year, most recently [**2136-5-25**] to [**2136-5-29**] for correction of a loose left external fixator.
External fixator was surgically removed and wound swabs revealed MRSA for which the patient was maintained on Vancomycin during the hospitalization, and subsequently discharged on [**2136-5-29**] to Rehab with a 4 week course of Linezolid.
Unfortunately the patient is unable to recall with good detail his recent medical course, but per his report, after his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], he was D/C to rehab and recently returned home 3 weeks ago with home PT where he felt he was doing relatively well.
the patient's vitals were T - 97.5, HR 90, BP 119/63, RR 18, O2 sat 98% (?

The study is technically limited as the patient was not able to rotate for the mortise and oblique views.
Circular lucencies seen on the prior film, which represented location of removal of prior hardware are not well seen on today's exam consistent with new bone formation in these locations.
Evaluation of osteomyelitis is severely limited by the extensive bony remodeling that is continuously taking place over the course of multiple prior radiographs.
[**8-2**] PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST:  A left subclavian central venous catheter is in unchanged position with the tip projecting over the brachiocephalic junction.
[**8-8**] ECHO GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
