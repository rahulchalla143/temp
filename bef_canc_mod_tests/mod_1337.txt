Therefore, pt underwent a videoswallow combined with a barium study and was found to have significant aspiration.
CXR showed pneumonia and pt was started on vanco/cefepime/flagyl with improvement in his symptoms.
Sputum cultures were contaminated with respiratory flora.
Discussed current presentation and radiology and swallow studies with both of [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2759**] [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 401**] in detail.
Stool was guaiac positive in ICU, but Stable currently on the medical floor.
His final blood culture results from ([**9-21**]) will need to be followed up.
