An echo at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 53% and aortic valve area of 0.3 cm with a peak gradient of approximately 130.
Aortic stenosis, 17-18 mmHg gradient by echo with a valve area of 0.3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs - temperature 97.6, heart rate 87, blood pressure 102/54, breathing 21, satting at 92% on room air.
Neck exam - no JVD.
Cardiovascular exam - irregularly irregular, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border, harsh in character, also a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, blowing in character at the apex.
Extremities - 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally without edema.
EKG prior to procedure normal sinus rhythm at 90, normal intervals, ST elevations in V1 and 3, ST depressions V4 through V6, 1, AVL and lead 2.
T-wave inversions V4 through V6, 1 and AVL, no significant changes compared with the prior.
The peak gradient across the aortic valve was 86 with a calculated valve area of 0.32 cm2.
After the intervention, which was a balloon valvuloplasty, the peak gradient was 39 with a calculated valve area of 0.66.
Lab data was significant for a hematocrit of 33.6, platelets of 211, BUN and creatinine of 16 and 0.5 after the procedure.
Her coagulation studies were within normal limits.
She will also call his office on [**12-14**] for an INR check.
