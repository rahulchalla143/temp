In the ED her initial vitals were T 97.3 BP 145/47 AR 103 RR 26 O2 sat 98% on 4L NC.
Patient was taken to CT scan but was found to be in increased distress and was found to be "blue".
She then went to CT scan and then transferred to MICU for closer monitoring.
- Respiratory failure: Admitted to BIMDC in [**1-14**] after cardiac arrest, presumed to be secondary respiratory failure.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals T 98.4 BP 105/66 AR 83 RR 16 Vent settings: AC TV 450 FIO2 1.0 RR 16 Peep 5 Gen: Patient sedated, responsive to tactile stimuli HEENT: ETT in place; anisicoria L Heart: nl s1/s2, no s3/s4, +systolic murmur Lungs: CTAB anteriorly Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS Extremities: 3+ bilateral pitting edema, pulses difficult to palpate .

Limited evaluation of the lung parenchyma with bibasilar atelectasis.
ABG on RA [**2167-8-11**] was also consistent with chronic CO2 retention.
She had a CTA of the chest which was negative for PE but did reveal some atelectasis and interstitial edema.
She also refused TTE to evaluate her cardiac function given her fluid overload on exam.
Overnight pulse oximetry study was attempted but had to be discontinued secondary to anxiety, though it did note that she desaturated to the mid-80s on rooma air.
Outpatient follow-up was recommended but the patient was not interested at the time.
# Positive UA: Urinalysis on admission showed moderate leukocytes & bacteria.
She also had a peripheral leukocytosis with WBC of 12.3.
Urine culture was unremarkable (~[**2159**]/mL gram positive bacteria and ~1000/mL probable enterococcus) so macrobid was discontinued.
You would need pulmonary function tests and a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis.
The best treatment would be to use the BiPAP mask at night, however you have refused the sleep study and pulmonary function tests necessary to qualify for this treatment.
