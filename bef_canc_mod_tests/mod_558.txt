URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2111-8-17**], the left ventricular dysfunction appears more regional.
CT Chest Limited examination due to respiratory motion artifacts.
This was also noted on the prior scan in [**2111**] and the appearance is essentially unchanged.
Blood sugars reasonably well controlled across duration of hospitalization.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of pyelonephritis.
Blood cultures all negative.
# Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure was up to 190s systolic in the ED and required three doses of IV labetalol to bring the BP down to 160s systolic.
# Systolic CHF: EF 40% for several years.
Beta blocker continued once blood pressures were stable.
# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 32.5.
Felt appropriate for further outpatient evaluation and management.
Urine tox screen is positive for opiates only which she is prescribed chronically.
Please follow the new insulin regimen to help control your blood sugars.
