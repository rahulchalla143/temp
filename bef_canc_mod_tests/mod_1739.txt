A VBG showed a K of 8 which was confirmed by peripheral [**Hospital Unit Name **].

Her BNP was likely elevated as a result of right heart strain in the setting of acute pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline Cr is 0.9 - 1.1, and her Cr in the ED was found to be elevated to 1.8.
Lasix should be restarted in the next few days, as her creatinine improves and if she develops any lower extremity swelling.
The patient did have EKG changes showing widening of the QRS complexes in the ED, but these changes resolved with the treatment she received in the ED.
Her potassium on the day of discharge was 3.7.
She did describe symptoms of urinary retention and overflow incontinence, which would increase the risk of urinary tract infection.
Her symptoms subjectively improved somewhat as her potassium level decreased, which would not be consistent with a spinal nerve compression.
Anemia: The patient presented with a Hct of 34.1, but her baseline appeared to be in the high 20's per recent [**2196**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was likely was very hemoconcentrated and intravascularly volume depleted when she first presented.
Her hematocrit remained stable between 28-33 and was 33 on the day of discharge.
