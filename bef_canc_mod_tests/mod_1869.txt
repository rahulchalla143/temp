On arrival, EMS noted that patient to be tachypneic but had a stable oxygen saturation of 98% on a questionable amount of supplemental 02.
The patient was, however, still intubated in the field and brought to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.
Arterial blood gases showed pH 7.17, pCO2 of 42, pO2 of 535.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2111-6-19**], status post catheterization in [**2111-5-19**] which showed 90% right coronary artery, 40% left anterior descending and 100% mid left circumflex stenosis which was stented and an ejection fraction of 40%.
Ejection fraction of 40% and severe mitral regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Patient had a pulse of 100.
Blood pressure 160/90.
Respiratory rate of 30.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales or wheezes were appreciated.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, normal axis and intervals, unchanged from a previous electrocardiogram.
After the patient's onset of myocardial infarction, chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube in good position, mild vascular redistribution likely with curly B lines, however, there was no evidence of failure and no infiltrates on chest x-ray.
PT 13.5, PTT 24.3, INR 1.2.
White blood cell count 7.0, 78% neutrophils, 0 bands, 60% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes.
Hematocrit 36.8, platelets 206,000.
Sodium 143, potassium 6.3, chloride 113, bicarbonate 14, BUN 68, creatinine 3.3, blood sugar 183, CK of 7211, MB fraction of 17, troponin of 0.6.
Urinalysis showed large blood, 100 protein, 4 red blood cells, 0 white blood cells.
Renal:  It was felt that the patient had an acidosis of mild anion gap, as well as nongap variety.
Patient's BUN and creatinine on discharge were 75 and 2.8 and the patient's pH on discharge was 7.32.
CK on discharge was 4,131, again, with a negative MB fraction.
The patient was instructed to have outpatient follow-up for further management of her lipids and to see if another antihyperlipidemic medication could be chosen.
Patient's white blood cell count remained stable.
