Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2145-9-30**]: CT-guided bone biopsy [**2145-9-30**]: Hickman tunneled catheter placement.
In early [**Month (only) 359**], in response to this, her PCP sent blood cultures.
These cultures grew klebsiella; she was then treated with cephazolin for seven days.
She initially went to an OSH hypotensive (71/48) on [**9-18**] with a sepsis picture with Klebsiella bacteremia and Klebsiella [**Month/Year (2) **] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and put on Linezolid and Zosyn.
Her hematocrit hit a nadir of 20 with a bump to >30 after 2 units of pRBC.
Physical Exam: VITALS - T 96.8, BP 90/50, HR 62, 94% on 2 liters GEN - Thin, chronically ill appearing woman.

Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2145-9-25**]):    GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
**FINAL REPORT [**2145-9-26**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2145-9-26**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2145-9-30**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2145-10-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
CXR ([**9-22**]): Left basilar consolidation.
TTE ([**9-23**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-5-8**], the tricuspid regurgitation is reduced .
CT L-Spine ([**9-24**]): Erosive endplate changes at L4/5 with disc space loss concerning for discitis/osteomyelitis.
Additionally, evaluation of extension into the spinal canal is limited on CT. .
Upper Extremity U/S ([**9-27**]):  No right upper extremity DVT.
DISCHARGE LABS: WBC 5.7, Hct 28.5, Platelets 392 ESR 7 Glucose 86, K 5.1, Na 135, Cl 102, HCO3 26, BUN 32, Cr 0.5 Ca 9.6, Phos 3.5, Mg 1.7       Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 46 yo woman with a h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] syndrome s/p small and large bowel resection and resultant short [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] syndrome, who presented with Klebsiella bacteremia, coag negative staph bacteremia, and a [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Her WBC count increased to 57 on [**9-24**].
The patient's WBC count returned to [**Location 213**], she defervesced, and her cultures have remained negative.
Patient's urine cultures have been negative since [**9-24**].
Routine cultures were drawn on the day of admission, and the patient will be notified if these return positive.
She had a CT of her spine on [**9-24**] which demonstrated possible discitis of her lumbar spine.
Thus, an CT-guided Bx of her Lumbar spine was performed on [**9-30**].
She tolerated this procedure without complication and the biopsy did not show evidence of bacteria or PMNs.
# Hypotension: Patient had an episode of hypotension during this admission, which was most likely secondary to line sepsis.
Patient's baseline BP is 80-90/60s.
CXR showed pulm edema/pleural effusions.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) mL Injection every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea.
You were treated with antibiotics and your blood pressure dropped very low, which was most likely a result of the infection in your blood.
You had a CT performed of your spine, which showed that you may have an infection in your L4/L5 disc.
