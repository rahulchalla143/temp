The study is limited secondary to large body habitus; however, no definite free intraperitoneal air is identified.
[**7-1**] Abd/Pelvis CT: TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
CONTRAST: Oral contrast and 130 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Moderate-size bilateral pleural effusion, increased on the right, new on the left, is accompanied by a small pericardial effusion.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A large amount of free fluid is seen within the pelvis.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
[**7-19**] CT Chest 1) Necrotizing pneumonia in right upper lobe posteriorly with foci of gas and probable evolving abscess formation.
[**7-20**] ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-7-2**], there is probably no significant change.
[**7-23**] IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-17**] through 13: Lung volumes remain low marked due to the markedly elevated diaphragm.
Although the patient was on Coumadin, his INR was subtherapeutic on admission.
CT on admission shows PE in superior branch of R PA.
He remained stable on this regimen and his INR trended down.
E coli bacteremia: The patient developed an elevated white count and fevers and blood cultures from [**7-3**] grew Escherichia coli.
Surveilance cutures since initial bacteremia have been negative for bacteria.
Fungemia: After being tranferred to the floor on [**7-11**]/2 blood cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans in the setting of TPN, for which the patient was initially placed on Voriconazole, then ultimately fluconazole.
His PICC line was d/c'd and tip cultures was negative, all subsequent cultures were negative and PICC line was replaced on [**7-16**].
A TTE was performed to r/o endocarditis and showed no vegtations.
Nosocomial PNA: A CXR revealed a necrotizing pneumonia with air fluid level in RUL confirmed by chest CT on [**7-19**].
Hypotension: On the morning of transfer to the MICU, patient's SBP dropped to the 60s/40s.
On admission the patient had a lactate of 2.7 which decreased to 1.6 with volume resuscitation and ongoing abx.
Sputum cultures are AFB negative x 3.
The patient's Hct decreased from 29.6 to 24 in the setting of volume resuscitation without evidence of acute bleeding.
The patient was transfused 2U PRBCs to help oncotic pressure given decreased albumin.
His beta blocker was held after an episode of hypotension which sent him to the MICU.
** Pump: ECHO from [**2-11**] shows EF of 55%, mild sym LVH, no WMA.
SBP around high 90s.
BP normal and stable .
The patient's hematocrit trends down slowly and will need to be followed closely.
Patient received transfusions to maintain Hematocrit > 28.
Albumin was monitored.
Stool studies were sent and were negative.
Stool negative for C.Diff toxin.
repeat Blood Cx from [**6-22**] w/ 1 set showing staph.
E. Coli bacteremia as above, but no further cultures growing staph.
was started on IV vanc and cefepime after the CT chest [**Last Name (un) **] developing abscess, as above.
Creatinine improved to 0.6.
Morphine Sulfate 1-2 mg IV Q3-4H:PRN pain 14.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for abdominal cramps.
