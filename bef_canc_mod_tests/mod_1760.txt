She states  In ED initial vital signs were T 98.2 HR 90 RR 16 BP 134/70 SpO2 97% RA.
She underwent CXR, bilateral hip x-ray, CT abd/pelvis, CT head, MRI C-T-L Spine.
Labs were significant for WBC of 11.3, negative cardiac enzymes, chem 7 within normal limits, and UA with moderate blood.
On the morning of [**10-28**], she went into atrial fibrillation with RVR with HRs in the 160s - 180s; she developed a rate related LBBB at this time and was not otherwise symptomatic.
Her blood pressure at this time dipped to 80s-100s systolic.
She received 1.5 L of IVF with no significant improvement in her blood pressure.
Her BP however failed to improve despite sinus rhythm with BPs continuing to be 80s-100s.
Her O2 sats were holding 90s-95 % on 2 L.  Given her new onset atrial fibrillation, especially in setting of recent bedrest and fracture, a CTA was ordered but has not yet been performed.

# Afib with RVR - Started on [**10-28**].
HR/rhythm should be monitored and risks/benefits should be addressed as an outpatient.
HR in 70-80s on discharge.
Pain was controlled with tylenol and lidocaine patch.
On [**2112-11-4**] she had 15% eos with a WBC of 9.7.
An eosinophilic lung process was considered unlikely even her clinical improvement without steroids.
