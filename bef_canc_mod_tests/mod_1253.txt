There are slightly smaller lung volumes on this exam than on previous exam which may account for the slight increase in vascular crowding.
In the PACU she had significant bloody VAC output and a Hct drop from 34 to 28.
She received pRBC and FFP x1, vitamin K, and was admitted to the TSICU for close monitoring.
Her wound cultures grew Serratia marcens and E. Coli, for which she was initially treated with Zosyn and subsequently narrowed down to IV ciprofloxacin.
There was concern for possible bacteremia given the patient's hypotension, however her blood cultures were negative.

Her carvedilol was decreased to 3.125 mg PO BID.
She was ordered for lisinopril 2.5mg daily while admitted but her blood pressures tended to be on the low side and this was not started.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver.
We tried to start this medication in the hospital but your blood pressures were on the low side.
