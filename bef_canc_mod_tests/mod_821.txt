A endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed and stent was placed.
The patient was in his usual state of health until one day prior to admission when his T-tube accidentally fell out of his side.
He has the prior surgical history of the exploratory laparotomy in [**2101-5-26**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient on presentation was afebrile with a heart rate of 112, blood pressure 99/69, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96%.
He had a regular rate and rhythm and lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratories showed a white blood cell count of 8.9, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count 345,000.
He did a left shift of his white blood cell count with 90% neutrophils.
Sodium was 133, potassium 4.1, chloride 96, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 38, creatinine 1.4 and glucose 145.
His current liver function tests revealed ALT 193, AST 182, alkaline phosphatase 640, total bilirubin 1.1, amylase 55, lipase 41.
Coagulation factors showed prothrombin time 12.4, partial thromboplastin time 26.6, INR 1.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to surgery and given intravenous antibiotics, Linezolid, Fluconazole and Levofloxacin and a CAT scan was performed.
The CAT scan showed a significant amount of intrahepatic ductal dilatation with a persistence of the mass in the porta hepatis compressing the hepatic duct.
The patient was followed with serial examinations over the next 24 hours but unfortunately on hospital day two, the patient acutely decompensated with shortness of breath, decreasing oxygen saturation with increasing heart rate to approximately 160.
An echocardiogram at this time revealed an ejection fraction of only 25% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis.
Troponin levels were increased at this time.
A chest x-ray showed marked bilateral pleural effusions which was confirmed in a CTA that was performed afterwards that also showed the bilateral pleural effusions but did not show any sign of pulmonary embolus.
Multiple biopsies were sent that did not reveal any tumor.
The bilious material was sent for culture and grew back Enterococcus.
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Hemodynamic monitoring with Swan-Ganz catheter.
