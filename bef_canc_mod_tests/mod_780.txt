A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
An additional anterior planar image was obtained after an approximately 5 hour delay.
Blood flow images show no focal perfusion abnormality.
Dynamic blood pool images and the delayed image show no abnormal radiotracer localization to suggest active gastrointestinal bleeding.
Colonoscopy [**6-2**] - Previous side to side ileo-colonic anastomosis of the ascending colon.
CXR (port) [**6-5**] - 1.
CXR (port) [**6-5**] - There continues to be prominence of the right superior mediastinum which likely reflects a small hematoma.
MRI liver [**6-6**] - results pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 70 with history of GI bleed secondary to angioectasias and ulcerative ileitis, aplastic anemia, and hypertension who presented with bright red blood per rectum.
A GI bleed study was negative for active bleeding.
GI was emergently consulted and a colonscopy and small bowel enteroscopy performed on the day of admission were also negative for a source of bleeding.
A capsule endoscopy for a more thourough evaluation was recommended.
However, the pt subsequently had no furhter episodes of BRBPR and her Hct remained stable without need for further pRBC transfusions after the second hospital day.
Her counts were monitored daily and she was transfused to keep her Hct > 30 and plts > 50K.
3) Chronic Renal Insufficiency : With Cr elevated to 1.9 on admission and baseline Cr between 1.2 to 1.5.
Urine lytes were c/w a prerenal etiology, likely in the setting of blood loss due to GI bleed.
The transaminitis had been resolving; however during the hospital course was noted to have a bump in her liver enzymes (AST, ALT) up to the 600s and a TBili up to 4.5.
A RUQ US was unremarkable and a liver MRI was obtained to r/o any evidence of fungal infection given her recent h/o candidemia, the results of which were pending at the time of discharge.
The pt was hepatitis B immune.
She will need to have the final results of the liver MRI followed up on as an outpatient.
5) UTI - The pt was noted to have a fever up to 102F on hospital day 4 and was pan cultured which revealed a Klebsiella UTI sensitive to cipro.
She previously had a L sided port which was removed during a hospitalization in [**State 108**] in [**3-26**], which was complicated by candidemia, presumably from a line infection.
A CXR performed after the procedure was significant for a question of a possible R sided mediastinal hematoma.
A repeat CXR 1 hr later did not show any increase in the area of questionable hematoma.
9) HTN - Lopressor and HCTZ were held on admission in the setting of GI bleed, and were restarted by the time of discharge.

Your GI bleed has since resolved and your blood counts have been stable for 1 week.
You will also need a capsule endoscopy to try to further work-up the cause of the gastrointestinal bleeding.
