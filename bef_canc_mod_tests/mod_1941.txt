An echocardiogram showed new posterior and inferior wall abnormalities compared to a previous echo ([**2131-2-13**]), with a LEVF of 40-50%.
EKG did not show any evidence of new infarct.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT head/c-spine ([**2132-9-23**]):  IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
MRI C/spine w/o Contrast ([**2132-9-25**]):  Provisional Findings Impression: BLjb FRI [**2132-9-26**] 9:37 AM Similar, though slightly progressive multilevel degenerative changes demonstrate ongoing multilevel cord compression with abnormal cord signal within the mid cervical spine as well as moderate-to-severe multilevel bilateral foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hip fracture - patient intially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital where a right two-part intratrochanteric fracture was demonstrated by CT on [**9-22**], and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ORIF.
Patient should receive anticoagulation for 4 weeks with a target INR of 1.5-2.0, and followup at the orthopedic in 2 weeks.
As the strip was not preserved, EP felt that a study would not be helpful, as it cannot be verified that any inducible VT during a study was the rhythm that the patient had experienced.
The patient will need evaluation by a cardiologist before any operations in the future.
NSGY recommended CT C-spine and collar placement.
The CT c-spine showed known severe spinal foraminal narrowing but no clear evidence of acute injury, with MRI showing no bone edema, no ligamentous damage, but substantial degenerative changes worsened mildly since previous MRI ([**2130-12-1**]).
# Supratherapeutic INR - pt was on coumadin 2 mg daily post-operative per ortho; however, after 2 doses, INR climbed to 8.6.
Followed INR daily for goal 1.5-2.
