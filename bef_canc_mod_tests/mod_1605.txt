If there is further clinical concern for a vascular malformation, arteriogram may be required to more definitively exclude this possibility.
MRI brain w/ and w/o [**6-2**]:  IMPRESSION: FLAIR hyperintensity and susceptibility artifact in the inferior cerebellar vermis with extension into some of the folia of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere, most consistent with hemorrhage and correlating to the findings on CT.
An evaluation for a primary neoplasm could be performed to help differentiate these possibilities.
An arteriogram may be needed to more definitively exclude a vascular malformation.
EKG [**6-1**]:  Normal sinus rhythm with frequent and grouped ventricular premature beats.
ECHO [**6-4**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR [**6-1**]:  FINDINGS: Lung volumes are markedly diminished.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service after being transferred from an OSH where he was initially evaluated for an intracerebellar hemorrhage.
Course while on neurosurgery:  "His initial head CT revealed a 1 cm cerebellar hemorrhage.
He also had a CTA which was negative for aneurysm or AVM.
The patient also had an MRI which showed.
His vital signs were stable.
NEURO:  He underwent a CTA to r/o underlying which showed no vascular anomaly no definite vascular malformation, there was asymmetry of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries as well as a prominent vein.
MRI of the brain with and without contrast showed no definitive evidence of an underlying lesion and ddx included a cavernous malformation possibly related to a developmental venous anomaly as well as an AVM in a setting of a quantitative and qualitative platelet d/o of chronic liver disease (see below).
As hemorrahge remained stable and patient improved clinically (improved truncal ataxia), he was arranged for rehabilitation and further diagnostic evaluation on an outpatient basis (follow up with neurology and neurosurgery with MRI w/ and w/o contrast within 2 months time, when the blood products have had the chance to resorb).
EKG was wnl, CEs negative.
He underwent an ECHOcardiogram showing diastolic dysfunction and restrictive disease.
Please refer to pertinent results for CBC results.
On initial evaluation, WBC elevated at 12K and Pltlt counts of 108, which eventually decreased to 6K and 62K on HD3 and at time of discharge were notable for platelet count of 52K and WBC of 3.7K.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] at [**Hospital **] Medical Center, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106895**], thrombocytopenia is a chronic issue in setting of chronic liver failure (evidence by synthetic liver function tests at [**Hospital1 18**] as well).
He will need a CBC to f/u on WBC and platelet count within 24 hours of arrival to rehab.

You will require follow up imaging (MRI) and neurology follow up for this reason.
Followup Instructions: Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 8 weeks with a non-contrast CT scan of the brain and an MRI of the brain with and without contrast.
