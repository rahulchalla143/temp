Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2126-3-19**], global left ventricular ssytolic function is slightly improved and the left ventricular cavity is smaller, the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.
A pulsus pardoxus of 20 was documented.
A stat echocardiogram was signficant for no pericardial effusion (results detailed above).
Her oxygen saturations remained > 93% on room air.
Her echocardiogram was otherwise significant for improvement in her EF, as well as improvement in her known pulmonary artery hypertension.
