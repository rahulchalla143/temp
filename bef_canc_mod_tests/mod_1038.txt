Following this, he was brought to the CT scan, which showed a right parietotemporal hemorrhage approximately 5 x 7 cm with 1 cm midline shift.
At the time, his systolic blood pressure was 200.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was febrile with a temperature of 101.4.
He had a stable blood pressure when seen of 113/68, heart rate 87, respiratory rate 18, 98 percent on room air.
His pupils were 2.5 mm and fixed, nonreactive bilaterally.
On further examination later in the evening, he was localizing his right upper extremity with slight movement to the left upper extremity but not as significant as the right.
LABORATORY DATA:  Upon admission, his labs were unremarkable.
His INR was 1.0 and platelet count of 440.
His toxin screen was negative for alcohol.
A CT of the head showed a large parietotemporal hemorrhage 5 x 7 cm with a 1 cm shift.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was subsequently taken for CT angiogram to assess for possible vascular abnormalities contributing to his bleed.
The CT angiogram was suggestive of some venous dilatation in the area of the bleed.
Given the CTA findings, he was taken for an angiogram urgently.
The angiogram did not show any vascular malformations or abnormalities.
In the interim, an A-line was placed for blood pressure control.
Blood pressure medications were started to keep the systolic blood pressure less than 140.
Post procedure, his examination remained unremarkable.
He did not appear to have a corneal or gag reflex initially.
His platelet count and coagulopathy labs were normal.
He remained in Intensive Care Unit for several days for close monitoring while he was intubated.
Repeat CT scans, as well as postoperative CT scans showed good evacuation of the clot with minimal, if any, residual component.
Serial CT scans performed during the wean showed no significant change.
Initially, he failed the bedside assessment but video esophageal studies showed that he was able to tolerate thickened and _____ thick food.
He should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in two weeks with a repeat head CT prior to his appointment.
He should have serial Dilantin levels checked while in rehabilitation to assure that he is at a therapeutic level.
