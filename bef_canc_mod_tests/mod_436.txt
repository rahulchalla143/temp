[**2173-8-7**] EKG: Sinus rhythm Left axis deviation IV conduction defect Anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia Since previous tracing of [**2173-4-23**], anterior T wave inversion is resolving .
Endoscopy: [**8-7**] - Grade 4 esophagitis; Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus; Blood in the whole stomach; Medium hiatal hernia .
In the ED, he was found to have hct 21 (down from basline of ~30)nasogastric lavage showed coffee grounds, blood.
On Endoscopy he was found to have no active bleed, gastritis, esophagitis, esophagial nonbledding ulcer, [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus,hiatal hernia, and repeat Endoscopy confirmed same thing.
Because patient has history of CAD, he was maintained at a hematocrit to 30.
Patient's hematocrit stabilized in the low 30's and he was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
While on the floor, patient had one episode of melena, however, he was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit continued to be in low 30's, Patient did not require any more transfusions.
While in the MICU, patient complained substernal chest pain, EKG was done which was consistent with old EKG.
Troponins were 0.21-->0.l8-->0.17, however CK and MB negative X 3.
Cardiology was made aware and the EKG seemed to implicate an area near his prior infarct in [**2153**].
Troponin levels along with CK would need to be elevated over time in order to support NSTEMI.
However, while in MICU once GI bleed and hematocrit stabilized, ASA was restarted at 81mg.
Blood pressure was controlled with metoprolol 100mg and hydralizine 25mg.
Patient was discharged on ASA 81mg and plavix was held secondary to further outpatient assessment with gastroenterologist and cardiologist.
Upon admission, creatinine was around baseline with an elevated BUN, likely due to upper GI source of bleeding.
Blood sugars were maintained in the 150's-200's with regular insulin sliding scale while inpatient.
