More recent catheterization in [**2163-6-29**] and [**2164-6-28**].
[**2163-6-29**] catheterization showed an occluded saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery, underwent angioplasty and renal lytic thrombectomy in [**2164-2-27**].
The patient was brought to catheterization while intubated.
The catheterization showed wedge of 13, severe mitral regurgitation, left main 80%, proximal left anterior descending 80%, mid left anterior descending 100%, proximal circumflex 70%, saphenous vein graft to LPL 90%, left internal mammary artery normal.
Intervention, angiogram and renal lytic thrombectomy with a bail-out stent placement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, see history of present illness, diabetes mellitus on Glucophage, Actos and Prandin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, status post transient ischemic attack, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination vital signs revealed temperature currently 96.6, blood pressure 105/51 with a heartrate of 63.
He was on CMV title volume 700, breathing at 13 with positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 on 100% oxygen and his arterial blood gases earlier was 7.28 pH with pCO2 of 47 and pO2 of 36.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal and reactive to light.
Lungs, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed white blood count of 13.0, hematocrit 33.9, platelets 229.
Chem-7, sodium 138, potassium 5.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25, BUN 47, creatinine 1.4, glucose 166.
Electrocardiogram precatheterization showed minimal ST depressions in V5 and V6.
Then on [**2164-7-5**], blood pressures continued to rise.
Systolic blood pressure was up to 190/200.
His arterial line site was tender and was discontinued.
Blood cultures times two were sent.
Sputum and urine cultures were sent.
Then two hours later when he became short of breath with oxygen saturations down to 80% acutely chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V4 and V5, thus he needs a second precatheterization.
The patient was started on 850 cc per hour without bolus and he was put on nonrebreather and weaned quickly to nasal cannula with oxygen saturations to 98%.
Then blood cultures grew out gram positive cocci in clusters and he was started on Vancomycin for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage and continued on Levofloxacin for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage and pneumonia coverage.
The cultures eventually came back Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
Congestive heart failure, the patient with a previous echocardiogram that states that ejection fraction was 15% with 4+ mitral regurgitation, however, echocardiogram done here on [**7-4**] showed minimal decreased systolic function and trace mitral regurgitation.
Infectious disease, cultures grew out Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from blood cultures and from arterial line catheter tip.
Sputum culture showed rare growth.
Urine grew Levofloxacin sensitive enterococcus.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells throughout the course of the hospitalization for hematocrit less than 30.
Renal, creatinine stayed stable throughout this stay.
