proBNP: [**2026**] Lactate:0.7 .
Cardiac enzymes: negative x3 .
EKG: NSR@97, LAD, LAFB, TWI 1/L/V6, Jpt elevation V2-3, 1mm STD V6 .
CXR ([**2130-3-27**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA chest/abd/pelvis ([**2130-3-27**]): 1.
Comparison with prior studies would be helpful for further evaluation.
Echo ([**2130-3-27**]): 1.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is at least mildly depressed but images are suboptimal and EF could be lower.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Pt was noted to be in respiratory distress with O2 sats 83-89% on 6L nc and RR of 51.
She was tachycardic with HR 90-100s and BP 120-130s/60s.
ABG was 7.17/96/63.
Echocardiogram revealed mildly depressed EF of 40-45%, but not other abnormalities.
While intubated, pt's pulse O2 sats ranged from 90-94%, with paO2 range from 72-100; her hypoxia was consistent with underlying COPD and new pna.
On [**3-28**], pt had a bronchoscopy for pulmonary toilet, because of secretions.
Bronchoscopy was normal without any secretions.
EKG showed TWI and lateral ST depression.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x3 and pt was ruled out for MI.
Pt should have a stress test as an outpatient to evaluate for possible CAD/ischemia.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: CXR on [**3-27**] was noted to have mediastinal widening.
CTA was performed for further evaluation and found hilar lymphadenopathy - ddx includes reactive, malignancy, sarcoid.
Pt needs a repeat chest CT as an outpatient.
Potassium remained normal.
