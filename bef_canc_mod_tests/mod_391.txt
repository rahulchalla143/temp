The patient had been recently seen for abdominal pain and had an MRCP that showed CBD dilation and was scheduled for an outpatient ERCP for further workup.
This morning she triggered again for hypotension (80s/50s), fever (101.1), and AMS (A+OX1 when normally A+OX3).
They started zosyn empirically to cover biliary flora, stopped the dilt gtt, and gave her some fluid but BP was still low so MICU called to eval.
In the interim her BP dropped even further so that on my evaluation on the floor just ten mins later she was hypotensive to the 70s and barely responding.
On arrival to the unit the patient's BP was better (after 500mL IVF) and the patient complained of being cold.
ERCP was called and suggested CT scan abdomen but given the instability of the patient said a RUQ U/S (portable) would be sufficient.

CXR ([**8-26**]): PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Persistent linear atelectasis is again noted in the left retrocardiac region, with questionable interval development of mild bronchiectasis since the last CTA chest on [**2107-5-6**].
The pulmonary vasculature and cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged and within normal limits.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

For anticoagulation, a Heparin drip was started to bridge to a therpaeutic INR, changed to Lovenox SubQ on [**9-5**].
At time of discharge, INR 1.3 with Coumadin dose 3 mg.  We will discharge her on this dose and she will need an INR check on Monday at rehab with subsequent dose adjustment.
# Septic Shock/Ampullary Mass: Patient had outpatient ERCP on [**8-27**].
On [**8-29**], she had hypotension, fever and WBC to 15 and was transferred to the MICU due to biliary sepsis in the setting of post ERCP obstruction.
Blood cultures grew pan-[**Last Name (un) 36**] E. coli vanco/zosyn discontinue, and patient completed full 10 day course of Cipro.
CT scan abdomen showed no evidence of an ampullary mass.
Her BP was much better controlled with SBPs in the 120s-140s on amlodipine 5 mg, metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], and Diovan 240 mg.  She will continue these meds upon discharge.

Outpatient Lab Work Please check patient's INR on [**2108-9-10**] and adjust coumadin dose accordingly.
Your blood pressure was also very high, causing you to become short of breath.
You also had a procedure done called an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or an ERCP.
On your last admission, a CT scan showed that you may have a mass near your pancreas.
The ERCP was done to take a sample or biopsy of this area.
They gave you antibiotics to treat the infections and medications to keep your blood pressure up.
Your blood pressure stabilized and you were taken off the breathing tube.
The biopsy taken was negative for malignancy and a follow-up CT Scan showed no mass in your pancreas.
You will continue to use lovenox injections to keep your blood thin until your INR is above 2.
You will have your INR check at the nursing facility and they will adjust your Warfarin dose accordingly.
