Labs were remarkable for lactate 3.9, ARF with a Cr of 2.9, newly elevated LFTs (ALT 117, AST 295), and elevated Tbili at 7.1 EKG significant for RBBB w/ nonspecific changes and no priors for comparision.
She had a negative CXR and was given nexium and pantoprazole and transferred for further management.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], VS were 98 103/68 102 18 99%ra.

CT  Head ([**7-8**]): 1.
If at future time the patient becomes able, patient may return for imaging through C7.
Correlation with mechanism of injury and patient's clinical exam is recommended, and if there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
RUQ U/S ([**7-5**]): 1.
Evaluation for mass is limited due to difficulty with son[**Name (NI) 493**] penetration.
TTE ([**7-6**]): Suboptimal image quality.
Carotid U/S ([**7-6**]): Right ICA stenosis <40%.
CT Head ([**7-8**]): 1.

A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**7-16**] which revealed Grade 2 rectal varices and internal hemorrhoids.
Her Hct and vital signs remained stable for the duration of this admission.
She needs her hematocrit checked on discharge HCT was 31.4.
EEG showed no ongoing seizure activity so no antiepileptics were prescribed.
She was continued on an Ativan CIWA scale while in the MICU, and she did not have any more seizures during her stay.
# Cirrhosis:  On admission, the patient had a RUQ U/S to evaluate for elevated LFTs and clinical evidence of cirrhosis.
Abd U/S on [**7-5**] demonstrated diffuse fatty liver infiltration but the study was unable to verify cirrhosis.
She underwent a repeat U/S on [**7-12**], which demonstrated an echogenic liver and reversed flow in the main portal vein.
A CTA was performed to evaluate for portal system thrombosis but it did not reveal any.
She has acute alcoholic hepatitis, but her discriminant function was less than 32 on the hepatology floor.
Her thrombocytopenia improved and the episodes of bleeding were thought to be due to internal hemorrhoids or rectal varices not due to thrombocytopenia as patient's platelet count was 90-110 during these episodes.
She was given IVFs, and her creatinine decreased back to her baseline of ~0.8.
TTE was negative for valvular abnormalities, and Carotid U/S was negative for stenosis.
Sliding scale insulin is being continued for her rehab stay, but she may not need any upon discharge home, pending her finger sticks during her rehab stay, which should be checked QIDACHS.
8. labwork Please check hematocrit on [**7-19**] and [**7-22**] for stability.
Discharge HCT was 31.4.
Upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy revealed a varices in your esophagus and stomach, varices in you rectum, and hemorrhoids.
- thiamine was added - nadolol was added - folic acid was added - a multivitamin was added  A repeat HCT is needed on [**2178-7-19**] and [**2178-7-22**] for stability.
Discharge HCT was 31.4.
