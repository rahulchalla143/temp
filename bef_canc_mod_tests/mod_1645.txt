On the day of admission after the patient had gone to Hemodialysis she developed a temperature of 103 and was subjectively short of breath.
Upon arrival to the Emergency Department her blood pressure was 50/30 and the patient was started on Levophed.
Her temperature at that time was 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit.
A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department was negative for focal infiltrate.
Blood cultures times two sets were sent from the Emergency Department.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  Temperature 101.9 with a T-max of 103.
Blood pressure was 73/53 which rose to 110/70 on Levophed and intravenous fluids.
Pulse was 113, respiratory rate 24.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Significant for white count of 21.9.
Differential 95.7 neutrophils and 0 bands.
Hematocrit was 43.9, platelet count 347,000.
Chemistries were within normal limits aside from a creatinine of 3.7, baseline creatinine [**4-24**].
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray showed no consolidation, normal pulmonary vasculature.
There was minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, however, this was unchanged from previous chest x-rays.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  Patient's most recent echocardiogram was on [**2153-6-29**], that showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 60% and moderately dilated left atrium and asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex.
This study was said to be consistent with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atypical variant.
P-MIBI on [**2153-7-3**], showed no perfusion defects and, again, hypertrophy anterior and apically of the left ventricle.
Our differential diagnosis included a pneumonia with her history of shortness of breath, however, her initial chest x-ray was negative.
Also in the differential was line sepsis and, therefore, multiple blood cultures were sent.
For the workup of the sepsis sputum cultures were sent and the chest x-ray was repeated, however, no definite pulmonary source was found on the sputum culture.
The repeat chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.
As far as an abdominal source, an abdominal CT and pelvic CT was performed on hospital day two that showed no evidence of small bowel inflammation or obstruction nor abscess.
Clostridium difficile cultures were also sent that were negative.
Multiple sets of blood cultures were sent that were all negative.
The initial concern was perhaps that the patient was septic from a hemodialysis line infection, however, no blood cultures grew out any organisms.
By hospital day three all cultures were negative and the patient's leukocytosis and fever had resolved, therefore, it was decided to discontinue gentamicin and Flagyl.
No blood cultures grew out any organisms.
All respiratory cultures and stool cultures were also negative, therefore, all antibiotics were discontinued on the day of discharge aside from vancomycin which was to be given with hemodialysis for one week post discharge.
The patient was dialyzed on Tuesday as she received a dye load with the CT of the abdomen and pelvis and she was subsequently dialyzed on Wednesday prior to discharge.
Her electrolytes remained stable.
A lithium level was checked that was slightly subtherapeutic at 0.21.
Cardiovascular disease:  The patient is on digoxin and it is not clear from the [**Location (un) 1131**] the records or the patient why she is on this medication as her PR interval was slightly prolonged from baseline on admission.
As the patient was bradycardic when she first came to the floor with a heart rate between 40 and 50, this medication was held.
A digoxin level was checked that was 0.8 which is within normal limits, normal limits being 0.9 to 2.0.
