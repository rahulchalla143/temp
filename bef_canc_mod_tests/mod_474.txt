There, he was noted to have a systolic BP in the 60s and reported lightheadedness for the past 2-3 days.
He was sent to the emergency department, where his initial BP was 90/48.
He has had no other changes in his medications and ocntinues to take his lactulolse, titrated to [**4-19**] BMs daily.
He had a 7L by para yesterday at [**Hospital3 3583**] (no cell count in their system), 10L last week.
In the ED, he recieved a 500cc bolus with improvement in his BP to 101/59.
His CXR showed worsening L pleural effusion and he was given vanc/ceftaz.
A paracentesis was not performed reportedly because of concern about his platelets being 21 and INR 1.8.
He was afebrile, HR in the 60s, and satting 99% on RA.
Past Medical History: # EtOH induced cirrhosis - Portal hypertension - Grade I esophageal varices - Diuretic refractory ascites.
Physical Exam: VS - T 96  BP 96/50  P 59  R   Sat 99% on RA.
Sensation to light touch intact except decreased in toes bilaterally.
Renal failure: Concern for HRS with worsening creatinine despite IVF and albumin.
Repeat PA and LAT CXR with improving edema and no signs of focal infiltrate prior to surgery.
MICU Course: 1) Hypotension:  Patient presented with hypotension with systolic BP's in 60's while sleeping.
He was never febrile or tachycardic, and WBC was initially at baseline ~2,000.
Nonetheless, infectious work-up was pursued with a diagnostic paracentesis performed at time of admission to the ICU.
Peritoneal fluid showed only 56 WBC's and culture was negative.
On the day following admission, a diagnostic thoracentesis of his left pleural effusion was performed, with removal of 1 liter serosanguinous transudative fluid.
Gram stain was negative and cultures were without growth.
Due to persistently low BP's, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency with appropriate result 11.7 -> 19.7.
A central line was placed and CVP measured at 33, following fluid resuscitation.
Sputum culture eventually grew an ESBL e.coli and pan-sensitive klebsiella organism.
- CMV viral load pending  2) Acute renal failure:  On [**2-9**], patient was noted to have decreased urine output in the setting of hypotension.
Renal [**Month/Year (2) 950**] without evidence of hydronephrosis or post-obstructive pathology.
The operation was notable for a 15L blood loss, and he received approximately 64 pRBCs, 54 FFP, 13 platelets, 7 cryoprecipitate, and 1 Factor VII.
On POD [**12-16**] his LFTs and INR rose, presenting a picture concerning for impending liver failure.
A bedside  [**Month/Day (2) 950**] failed to demonstrate portal flow.
His oxygenation and pressures improved after these interventions.
A frozen section demonstrated ischemia but no hepatic necrosis.
On POD [**1-15**], he required multiple pressors to maintain his blood pressures.
His ionized calcium levels were persistently below 1.0, and his pressures transiently improved with calcium supplementation.
A repeat [**Month/Day (2) 950**] was unable to demonstrate hepatic artery flow.
