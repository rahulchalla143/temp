-Blood Cx x2: NGTD -Urine Cx x2: NGTD -UA: unremarkable -LP [**5-18**]: NO PMNs, no organisms -EKG (in ED): NSR@73, poor baseline, normal intervals/axis, no ST/T wave changes, unchanged from prior -CXR (in ED): No acute cardiopulmonary disease -Head CT (in ED): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
-Echo [**2191-5-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Head CT without bleed.
Wbc, LFTs all wnl with EKG unchanged and neg CXR.
Bedside EEG showed no seizure activity.
SBP remained elevated in the ED ranging 157-214 with diastolics 80s-90s.
Through the course of the day, the patient spiked a temp to 104, HR 130s and SBP was persistently elevated above 200s not responding to IV hydralazine and lopressor.
Required IV to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (no west MICU beds) for Bblocker drip for HTN and for further w/u & monitoring.
UA and CXR were negative.
The LP showed no PMNs or microorganisms, but one WBC was seen.
All blood and urine cultures showed NGTD.
An echo was ordered to assess cardiac function and no change was seen from prior echo.
EF was >55% and some left ventricular hypertrophy was seen.Patient remained in sinus rhythm since that episode so tele was dc'd.
She was continued on coumadin and was switched from heparin to lovenox so she could go home, with plan to d/c lovenox once INR >2.
* Hypertension: Patient had an isolated episode of hypotension PTA but was hypertensive at admission with SBPs 157-214.
She initally required IV labetolol to bring her pressures down, but thus was dc'd and she was continued on low dose BB, hydralazine and clonidine patch.
During this admission she had a head CT and LP which were negative, so could r/o meningitis, acute intracranial process or mass.
Her INR was reversed with Vit K and FFP prior to LP.
EF was >55% by echo at this admission.
Bedside EEG showed no seizure activity.
