PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs: 98.5, heart rate of 61, blood pressure 141/67, respiratory rate 18 and saturation 97 on room air.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, injected sclerae, dry mucous membranes.
Pulmonary: Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Initially, his hematocrit was 27.7 and this steadily declined to 25 over the ensuing day.
On hospital day two, he had significant hematochezia and at that time he was transfused two units of blood and was immediately transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in anticipated of a tagged red cell scan and subsequent angiography to attempt embolization of the bleeding vessel.
He underwent the tagged red cell scan but this study failed to show the source of the bleed.
He was admitted to the surgical ICU for close monitoring after this negative test.
On hospital day three, he again suffered colonic bleeding and was again taken for a tagged red cell scan to try to identify the source of the bleed.
On hospital day four, he had a 1300 cc hematochezia and also hypotension which prompted a third red cell scan to attempt to identify the source of the bleed.
The gastroenterology team made preparations to perform an endoscopy and potential colonoscopy earlier, but as he had appeared to stabilize, these studies were post-poned.
The third tagged red cell scan was negative and we brought the patient to the ICU for esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
Thereafter, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were ordered to ensure that the patient did not have an aortoenteric fistula.
This study also proved negative and was considered to be a normal study.
Initially the patient's family had declined surgery but agreed to proceed if a straightforward outcome could be assured.
