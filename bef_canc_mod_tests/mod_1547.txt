She was transfered to the ED where initial vitals were HR 79 BP 110/33 RR 22 O2sat 100 on vent.
Given her hypotension, cultures were drawn and broad spectrum antibiotics initiated.
A bedside ultrasound by the ED resident was notable for what appeared to be global hypokinesis and a full IVC.
Vitals on transfer were HR 80 and BP 83/33.
Mag at [**Hospital 100**] rehab was 1.6.
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 80 with LVH and <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-V6.
Work-up at that time revealed 3 vessel disease and 90% in-stent stenosis of LCX.
Her active problems there included: --hypokelmia --loose stools on vanc po, cdiff pending --anxiety on ativan prn --supratherapeutic INR, coumadin held --Anemia: ob + stool --metabolic alkalosis --delerium, improved on haldol --respiratory failure with complicated pleural effusions, CXR with bilateral fibrosis, effusions --systolic CHF on aldactone, metoprolol, amio reduced and lopressor increased on [**6-29**] --candidiasis with catheter tip positive on fluconazole --anasarca, albumin 1.8 .

EKG [**7-10**]: Atrial paced rhythm with intrinsic ventricular conduction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-7-1**] the anteroseptal ST-T wave changes have improved.
These sensitivities were pending at the time of discharge.
Went to EP study, could not induce VT, induced 1:1 Atrial flutter, which EP felt was the rhythm responsible for the arrest.

C. diff toxin x 2 and C diff PCR negative.
Was discontinued on [**7-10**] per ID recs as inital urnalysis was negative and subsequent cultures were also negative.
She required one transfusion of 1 unit for Hct 24, which appropriately increased.
