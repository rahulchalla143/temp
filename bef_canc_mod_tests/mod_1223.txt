Signed Electronically by [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 251**] on [**Doctor First Name **] [**2126-8-22**] 9:28 AM  Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]             Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 64250**]  Service:  VSU                     Date:  [**2126-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-12-10**]        Sex:  M  Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**MD Number(1) 41313**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Asymptomatic 6.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
URINE OUTPUT:  730 ml.
Attention was then turned to the left flank/subcostal incision which was performed extending from the 11th rib to the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle.
Dissection was performed utilizing electrocautery through the soft tissues down to the level of the peritoneum which was then carefully retracted utilizing blunt dissection in a medial-to-lateral and both inferior and superior fashion with careful retraction of the intraperitoneal contents anteriorly.
Urine output was slow to resume so IV Manitol was given.
Urine output resumed approximately 1/2 hour after removal of the proximal clamp.
Anastomosis was performed utilizing running 5-0 Prolene sutures in end-to-side fashion.
Assessment of the left groin, however, demonstrated minmal antegrade flow at the left profunda femoris artery.
Attention was then turned to the groin incisions which were closed respectively with multiple layers of interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures, first closing the overlying femoral sheath, the subcutaneous tissues and subdermal layers.
TECHNIQUE: Evaluation of the femoral arteries in the left groin was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
FINDINGS: The distal end of the bypass graft is patent with monophasic Doppler waveforms and peak systolic velocities ranging between 57 and 76 cm/sec.
A peak systolic velocity of 67 cm/sec was seen at the graft-to-artery anastomosis.
In the native common femoral artery a peak systolic velocity of 152 cm/sec was noticed with monophasic Doppler waveforms.
Monophasic Doppler waveforms and peak systolic velocities ranging between 78 and 127 cm/sec were seen in the left profunda femoral artery.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement with increased ventilation of the retrocardiac lung areas and near total resolution of the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis.
COMPARISON: MRA runoff from [**2122-8-17**], and abdominal ultrasound from [**2122-8-17**].
A single image shows a small area of central color flow (with diameter measuring approximately 1.5 cm), with no flow seen in the periphery of the mid abdominal aorta.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
On POD #1 on physical exam the left calf was noted to be tight and there was concern of compartment syndrome.
Tmx 102.
Left leg compartment pressures and CK's slowly trended down.
CXR did show bilateral basilar atelectasis with pleural effusions.
He had a bedside swallow evaluation which he failed, kept NPO including oral medications.
Pulmonary toilet encouraged, the patient got OOB with Physical therapy.
Repeat speech exam passed on [**2126-8-22**] for thin liquids and ground solids.

Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
