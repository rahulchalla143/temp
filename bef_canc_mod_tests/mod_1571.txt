PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, low back pain, hypercholesterolemia, history of syncope, nephrolithiasis, recent cellulitis, acute renal failure, baseline creatinine of approximately 1.7 and a history of right shoulder dislocation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.9.
Pulse 70.
Blood pressure 120/70.
Respirations 16.
JVD was not present.
Sensation and pulses were intact.
LABORATORY:  Chem 7 sodium 140, potassium 4.7, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 38, creatinine 2.0, glucose 98, white count 17.9, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 256, 87% polys, 7 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, urinalysis showed nitrite negative, greater then 300 protein, 3 to 5 white blood cells, 6 to 10 epithelial cells, occasional bacteria.
X-rays showed anterior dislocation of her humerus.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 70, normal axis and intervals.
Neuro consult felt that her decrease in mental status was likely secondary to a toxic metabolic encephalopathy from her Tylenol #3 failing to clear with decreased creatinine clearance as well as the possibility of uremic encephalopathy given the fact that her creatinine had increased markedly during admission.
Her baseline creatinine is approximately between 1.7 and 2.1 in the previous months.
Her creatinine rose rapidly on the initial hospital day for unclear reasons peaking at 3.8 on [**6-9**] and it had decreased to 2.3 on the day of discharge.
Workup was essentially negative in terms of negative renal ultrasound and fractional secretion of sodium was less then 1%.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
This proved refractory and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for a Diltiazem drip, which broke her atrial fibrillation.
She will need to continue heparin therapy until her INR is therapeutic at rehab.
Infectious disease:  The patient had two blood cultures drawn off the central line positive for coag negative staphylococcus.
Heparin may be discontinued when INR is greater then 2.0 with a goal INR of 2 to 3.
