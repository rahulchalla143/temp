HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 28-year-old female with SLE/lupus, nephritis, end-stage renal disease status post cadaveric renal transplant [**2175-9-1**], complicated by delayed graft function/ATN, biopsy done intraoperatively during reexploration post transplant for bleeding requiring multiple transfusions.
At that time, fingersticks were less than 20.
At that time, her heart rate was in the 100s.
Systolic blood pressure was 90- 100.
The patient was transferred to the ICU, and labs demonstrated that the patient had a hematocrit of 14, sodium of 125, potassium 8.3, chloride 95, bicarb 11, BUN and creatinine of 37 and 6.6.
The patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of FFP, 1 unit of platelets and bicarb in the setting of severe acidosis.
In [**2173**]     chest CT was with diffuse ground glass opacities.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 5 mg daily, Bactrim SS 1 tablet daily, Valcyte 450 mg every other day, __________ 2.5 mg daily, nifedipine 90 mg sustained release daily, Protonix 40 mg daily, Dronabinol 2.5 b.i.d., Mirtazapine 15 mg q.h.s., MMF 500 mg b.i.d., nystatin suspension 5 ml q.i.d., Epogen injection 3000 units Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Percocet [**12-11**] 5/325 mg tablets 1 tablet q.4-6 hours p.r.n., Labetalol 400 t.i.d., Linezolid 600 q.12 for a total of 7 days, Reglan 5 mg q.i.d., sodium bicarb 650 mg tablets 4 tablets t.i.d., Coumadin 5 mg 1 p.o.
CT of the abdomen was performed demonstrating a large right-sided hematoma displacing the transplanted kidney anteromedially and inferiorly.
The hematoma is larger compared to the CAT scan that was performed on [**2175-6-29**], but appears smaller compared to the CAT scan on [**2175-9-11**].
There was also diffuse thickening of small bowel wall with a differential of wide and intramural hemorrhage, and there was massive ascites.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Exploratory laparotomy and transplant nephrectomy was performed due to a ruptured kidney.
Cultures were obtained on [**2175-11-7**], because the patient became febrile which grew out pseudomonas.
Another chest x-ray was performed demonstrating marked decrease of left-sided pneumothorax, residual small left apical and basilar pneumothorax.
The patient had another CAT scan on [**2175-11-16**], because of ongoing abdominal pain.
CAT scan demonstrated 1) interval improvement in bilateral basal consolidations, 2) there was a collection along the right flank, decreased in size compared to the prior study with catheter in adequate position, 3) there was reduction of gallbladder distention, 4) stable small collection to the right of the uterus consistent with resolving hematoma, 5) stable splenic infarcts.
On [**2175-11-24**], the patient had a bronchoscopy to evaluate and assess airway patency.
On [**2175-12-2**], the patient had another CAT scan because of abdominal pain and persistent fever.
There were splenic infarcts, which was [**Year (4 digits) 1506**].
We continued to check her labs which included CBC, electrolytes daily and were replaced as needed.
Another CAT scan was performed on [**12-22**] at 1 a.m. because of abdominal pain, and was documented: 1.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4300**] needle was advanced to the right flank collection.
Postprocedural films demonstrated that the right flank collection appears in good position.
The 8 French catheter remained in place after the CT was completed.
On [**2175-12-12**], the patient was evaluated for a Passy- Muir valve evaluation, and it was observed that she did tolerate wearing the PMV for 20 minutes with no oxygen desaturation and was able to speak with a clear voice and intelligible speech; however, she then began to cough at the end of the evaluator's exam suggesting either dryness/irritation or possibility of aspiration secretions.
On [**2175-12-21**], the patient had a chest x-ray because of ongoing fevers, and the radiologist documented the chest x- ray report as a long-standing interstitial abnormality in the right lower lobe present since [**5-19**].
The patient had JP drainage of 35 cc.
At that time, abdominal/pelvic CT will be obtained to assess fluid collections to help define further duration of antibiotics.
On [**2175-12-22**], another CAT scan was performed to evaluate the abdominal collections after the drains have been removed.
She has 2 pending cultures from blood cultures that were obtained on [**2175-12-24**].
Her labs on [**2175-12-26**], revealed the following: WBC 9.4, hematocrit 26.8, platelets 111; PTT 30.5, INR 1.1; sodium 131, 3.6, 95, 28, BUN and creatinine of 20 and 3.5, glucose 88, calcium 9.6, phos 2.5, magnesium 0.7, albumin 2.6.
The patient had a tobramycin level of 1.1 on [**2175-12-26**].
When the patient goes to rehab, the patient will need daily CBC, CHEM10 at least once-a-week.
The patient will need to have a CBC with diff and a post dialysis tobramycin level.
Please check residuals q.4 hours and hold tube feeds for residuals greater than 100 ml.
