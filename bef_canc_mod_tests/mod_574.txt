In the ED, he was found to have melena with a Hct of 21.
There, he had a positive NG lavage, and ischemic changes were noted on his EKG in the inferior and lateral leads.
Due to his bleeding and INR of 2.5, he was given 2 U prbc, 2 U FFP, and 10 mg SC Vitamin K, and he was admitted to the ICU.
In the ICU, he was placed on a PPI and his hematocrit remained stable overnight.
He had an EGD performed on [**10-18**] that showed healing duodenal ulcer with no sign of recent bleeding.
Over the course of [**2180-10-17**], he required a total of 5U PRBC's to maintain Hct > 28.
After his reassuring EGD and stabilization of his hematocrit, he was transferred to the floor.

Melanoma: s/p excision [**4-11**] & [**2174-10-3**] R posterior    auricular region, + radiation treatments (last in [**12-14**]), concern for recurrence in [**3-13**] but pt refused further w/u 7.
Diverticulosis 9.

EGD ([**10-18**]): Erosion in the antrum compatible with non-steroidal induced gastritis.
CXR ([**10-17**]):: Interval improvement in the previous possible lingular opacity with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
CXR ([**10-19**]): Vague left lingular opacity, unchanged.
ECG ([**10-17**]): Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are now present.
Urinalysis & urine culture ([**10-21**]): Negative.
Labs on discharge: Hct 28.9 BMP remarkable for creatinine 1.6 INR 1.1  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old gentleman who presented with chest pain and likely demand ischemia in the setting of a hematocrit of 21 due to gastrointestinal bleeding, now with stable hematocrit and free of chest pain after transfusions.
His hematocrit did stabilize, and the gastroenterology team did not feel that a colonoscopy was necessary at this time.
He had a colonoscopy in [**2169**] which showed diverticulosis as well as a single polyp.
The patient should remain on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI for one month; after that, because he is to stay on his aspirin, he should continue on a once daily PPI for life.
A hematocrit should be checked at that time to ensure that he is maintaining a hematocrit of 28-29 as he did in the hospital.
Our goal for transfusion was hematocrit greater than 28.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient is well rate controlled naturally, with his usual pulse in the 50s range.
He was instructed to resume his usual coumadin regimen upon discharge with repeat INR due at the end of this week when he sees his PCP.
It is likely that Mr. [**Known lastname **] has fixed coronary lesions with demand ischemia which manifested itself when his hematocrit was so low.
He does have some [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a chest x-ray was checked to ensure that he did not aspirate during his EGD.
His chest x-ray is unchanged from last month with a vague lingular opacity but no other significant findings.
At the time of discharge, his temperature was 98.4.
His electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
Please have your INR checked later this week (at your outpatient appointment).
At this appointment, you should ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about a need for a repeat endoscopy and/or a colonoscopy within the next few months.
