Microbiology: [**2152-2-5**] 6:37 pm URINE      Source: CVS.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2152-2-10**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Imaging: ========= CXR [**2-4**]: Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
TTE [**2-7**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-12-1**], biventricular cavity enlargement with more depressed systolic function is now present.
The aortic valve gradient is lower (reflecting reduced cardiac output).
Renal US [**2152-2-7**] FINDINGS: Note is made that this is a limited study due to the patient's body habitus.
The right kidney measures 9.9 cm and the left kidney measures 10.8 cm.
Labs on discharge: [**2152-2-28**] ================== BUN: 51, creat: 1.4, bicarb: 34 Na: 139, K 3.9 Hct: 29.6, WBC: 7.2, Plt: 318  Ca: 9.7 Mg: 2.1 P: 4.6     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19122**] is a 72 year-old man with h/o CVA with expressive aphasia, OSA, AS, CAD, OSA on BiPap, chronic systolic CHF (EF30-35%) and thalassemia who was admitted for a CHF exacerbation.
He also has severe AS, valve area 1.0 and mild-moderate AR, with EF>55% in [**11-18**].
He was very volume overloaded on admission with weight 138kg (dry weight ~122kg).
He continued to required significant diuresis and his dopamine drip was subseqently stopped and he was started on a lasix drip with excellent response achieving lenght of stay fluid balance approaching negative 20L.
While intubated, he was diuresed with dopamine and lasix with goal net output of 2L per day achieving a length of stay fluid balance approaching negative 20L.
# Aortic stenosis - severe, area 1.0cm2 in [**11-18**] with repeat TTE showing valve area 0.8cm2.
He was seen by CT [**Doctor First Name **] who identified him as a poor candidate for surgery and was subsequently evaluated by the Aortic Stenosis Service for possible percutaenous AVR who also felt that he was a poor candidate for an intervention.
# RHYTHM: Patient with QTc 460 remained in NSR with PVCs.
His electrolytes were repleted as neeeded and he was was monitored on telemetry.
# Acute renal failure - His baseline is a Cr 1.0 in from a [**11-18**] history of acute failure to Cr 7 in setting of diuresis.
His Cr was 2.0 on admission and trended up to 3.0 with torsemide/lasix diuresis.
Fe Urea was 4% indicating poor renal perfusion, likely in the setting of CHF.
His Cr on discharge was 1.4.
Please check chem-7 and CBC on Wednesday [**3-1**] and consider starting ACE inhibitor in a few days if creatinine is stable.
# Gout: Allopurinol was held initially given ARF and then restarted when creatinine returned to [**Location 213**].
Overnight CPAP or oxygen at 4L NC: CPAP is preferred but patient sometimes refuses in which case overnight O2 by NC can be used at 4L.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
An echocardiogram was done of your heart which showed worsening heart failure.
