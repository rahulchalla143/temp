culture result) which she started on [**2137-10-29**] for a planned 10 day course.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T 102.1, HR 100, BP 132/56, RR 24, 97% on 15 L via nasal cannula.
Blood pressure trended down to 80s systolic.
She was originally on peripheral dopamine for BP improvement but as this was not effective, it was changed to peripheral levophed with subsequent improvement in blood pressures to 120s systolic.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
She received a total of 6 L NS in the ED.

Chest x-ray ([**2137-11-6**]) There is bilateral atelectasis.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2137-11-9**]) The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-9-12**], the findings are similar.
CT head without contrast ([**2137-11-9**]) 1.
MR brain ([**2137-11-10**]) 1.
Limited MRA evaluation of the brain due to a significant image degradation from motion artifact demonstrates no identifiable stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm in the visualized vessels.
EEG ([**2137-11-12**]) IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states.
Chest x-ray PA and lateral ([**2137-11-16**]) There are multiple healed rib fractures from prior thoracotomy on the left, with residual osseous deformity.
When she arrived to the ICU levophed was running peripherally with systolic blood pressures in the 130s.
This was quickly weaned off and her systolic BP stablized in the 90-110s.
A blood culture from this first hospital day later grew out methicillin resistent staph aureus.
A urine culture grew out [**Female First Name (un) **] but no significant bacteria.
Blood cultures were followed serially.
Three subsequent blood cultures grew out MRSA; the last was on [**11-10**].
Surveillance cultures were followed through [**11-14**] and all returned negative.
Once therapeutic on vancomycin, she defervesced and her white count returned to [**Location 213**].
MR brain showed no acute abnormalities.
Her oxygen sats have been fine on RA, CXR was negative for infiltrate, and MR as above was negative.
Her first urine culture grew out >100,000 colonies of [**Female First Name (un) **].
[**Female First Name (un) 159**] was called and instructed us to restart her oxybutynin which had been stopped for concern of mental status change.
Chest x-ray showed volume overload but no infiltrate.
We continued her home COPD regimen of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators, and her oxygen saturation steadily improved.
