TRACING #1  Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 79 150 74 392/425 71 5 55   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19376**] is a 76yo F with severe COPD on 4 L home O2 admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Her sputum, blood, and urine cultures showed no evidence of underlying infection.
Her oxygen was weanred to nasal cannula, with oxygen saturations between 88-95% on [**3-3**] L NC.
She occasionally desaturates down to 80% when eating or beig turned, which returns to her baseline oxygen saturations with repositioning and increased oxygen delivery.
