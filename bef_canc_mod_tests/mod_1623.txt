PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient had a temperature of 99.6?????
?F, a pulse of 53, a respiratory rate of 24, a blood pressure of 164/86 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
In the extremities, the patient had trace pedal edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 4,000, hematocrit of 42, MCV of 88 and platelet count of 293,000.
Coagulation studies were within normal limits.
BUN and creatinine were 14 and 1.0.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray was within normal limits.
After returning to the floor from cardiac catheterization, the patient did have some transient but prolonged episodes of bradycardia and hypotension, most likely secondary to a vagal response.
The electrocardiograms and serial enzymes showed no evidence of in-stent restenosis or active ischemia.
A head CT scan was performed emergently and showed no acute intracranial process.
The patient developed some bright red blood per rectum after her cardiac catheterization while on Integrelin and her hematocrit dropped from 40 to the low 30s; this was stable after discontinuation of Integrelin.
A blood culture showed coagulase negative Staphylococcus in one out of four bottles, which was most likely a skin contaminant.
The patient had a urine culture that showed less than 10,000 enterococcus.
