Differential diagnosis could also include PML if there is history of immunocompromised status.
PET CT Scan: 1.

CT Cspine: 1.
Later at the scene, EMS noticed him to have a GTC with left gaze deviation.
A routine C-spine CT scan performed to clear his C-spine identified the presence of air tracking in the retropharyngeal space, and for this, he received 7 days of broadspectrum antibiotic therapy (IV).
A head CT scan at the [**Hospital1 18**] ER showed the presence of a right frontal mass, which was subsequently further characterized on MRI as being FLAIR hyperintense and non-contrast enhancing, and on the differential diagnosis includes primary CNS lymphoma versus a metastatic lesion or gliosis/glioma of some type.
An LP was performed, and on cytological analysis, he was found to have hypercellular atypical lymphocytes that could occur with a number of benign and malignant processes.
The patient was instructed to come to the neurology clinic if he had not been contact[**Name (NI) **] by the NSG department directly for a brain biopsy admission.
His neurological exam was normal, including tests of frontal lobe dysfunction.
Neurological exam: Nonfocal, nonlateralizing   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for an evaluation of your seizures.
We found a large mass on the right side of your brain that likely led to your seizures, and that likely is a malignancy/cancer.
We performed a lumbar puncture on your spine which did not show an obvious infection.
