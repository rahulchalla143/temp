His baseline creatinine is 2.7.
His CRT postoperative course has been complicated by elevated BUN and creatinine and hyperkalemia which have all resolved.
The rest of the examination was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Unfortunately, postoperatively, the ultrasound on postoperative day number one showed question of blood flow to the transplanted pancreas and it was decided that the patient would go back for evaluation of the transplant.
His last Prograf level was 9.7 on this dose and his last Rapamune level was 18.5 on 5 mg q.d.
The patient's pancreatic functions have been relatively normal; amylase and lipase have remained within normal limits for the majority of this operative stay and the last levels measured were 29 and 26 respectively.
