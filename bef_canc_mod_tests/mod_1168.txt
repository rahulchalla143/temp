Splenic lesions without change from recent abdominal CT  [**2162-12-1**] 3:00 PM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  FINDINGS: There is no intracranial mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage RADIOLOGY  Final Report  [**2162-11-28**] 11:18 AM  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
However, this study could not be completed as the patient's sats dropped and patient did not want to continue the study.
FINDINGS: The few sequences (sagittal and axial T1, axial T2, and axial FLAIR) are limited due to motion artifacts.
This appearance could be due to the retained CT contrast given intravenously, due to the associated renal failure.
Incomplete study as the patient's sats dropped and did not want to continue the study.
Limited images reveal hyperintense cerebral sulci, which could be due to be retained CT contrast given intravenously, considering the patient's renal failure          Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an elderly female who had undergone a left nephrectomy at an outside institution.

Diabetes and high blood pressure can slowly damage the kidneys and trigger a long-term decline in function.
