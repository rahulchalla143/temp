The patient had a urinalysis, which revealed moderate leukocyte esterase, small blood, trace protein, greater than 50 white blood cells, many bacteria, and no epithelial cells.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has mental status change and hypotension requiring pressors in the setting of a positive urinalysis and urine culture, which eventually grew greater than 100,000 colonies of Klebsiella, which was pansensitive.
The patient's blood cultures were no growth at the time of this dictation.
CSF culture revealed no growth at the time of this dictation.
