Echo was performed, and initially showed diastolic dysfunction, but this report was addended to state that cardiac systolic and diastolic function was normal.
In addition, cardiac MRI was within normal limits during this admission.
To review prior records, patient does not carry diagnosis of CHF and last Echo did not show evidence of dysfunction.
Her EKG also does not reveal any concerning findings (ischemia, LVH, or afib).
She was oxygenating well on room air and had ambulatory O2 saturation > 94% on discharge.
There was a question of peribronchiolar soft tissue and nodular opacities on [**2139-9-1**] CT chest, which pulmonary felt was related to fluid and edema; however, f/u imaging in [**4-29**] weeks is recommended.
CXR not revealing for mediastinal or neck mass to cause SVC syndrome.
Renal team agreed with lasix 20 mg daily on discharge, with follow-up with her [**Hospital1 1774**] nephrologist.
She also required transfusion of pRBC on one occasion for Hct ~ 21.

You were admitted on [**2139-8-22**] for close monitoring after an antibiotic related allergic drug reaction.
While you were in the hospital, you also became short of breath and had oxygen saturation levels that reached as low as 60%.
Given this sudden decrease in your respiratory function, you were placed on oxygen and received a chest X-ray on [**2139-8-26**] that revealed significant fluid around your lungs, known as pleural effusions.
A CT scan of your chest on [**2139-8-27**] was also obtained that confirmed the findings from your X-ray, and suggested the possibility of an infection as well.
Approximately 1.5 liters were removed from around your right lung on [**2139-8-28**], and the fluid was sent for studies which revealed that it was largely free of protein and cells.
As your breathing did not significantly improve after the removal of the effusion, you had a repeat chest X-ray on [**2139-8-31**] which showed that much of the fluid had reaccumulated.
Your breathing improved significantly where you no longer needed oxygen, and on a follow-up chest X-ray on [**2139-9-4**], your pleural effusions had decreased significantly.
Your oxygen saturation while walking remained above 95%.
Therefore, we obtained ultrasound imaging of your heart on [**2139-9-1**], which was read as showing significant dysfunction of the relaxing phase of your heart.
To follow-up this finding, you had a Cardiac MRI on [**2139-9-3**] which revealed no dysfunction with your heart whatsoever.
Your previous ultrasound study was also reread by a Cardiology attending on [**2139-9-3**] and he confirmed that there was no dysfunction seen on this modality either.
We had a diabetes specialist from [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center come to see you here in the hospital and some adjustments were made to your home insulin doses.
MEDICATION CHANGES/INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Decrease usual simvastatin to 20mg daily (this is due to possible interaction with amlodipine) 2) Please do not take ibuprofen, instead take Tylenol 650mg q6hrs as needed for headaches and/or leg pain 3) Continue glargine at 3 Units in morning and 7 Units at bedtime and see attached full Humalog Sliding Scale insulin dosing schedule which is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] 4) Please restart omeprazole 40mg daily 5) Please start ferrous sulfate 325mg iron tablets twice daily 6) If you develop constipation on iron, please take over the counter colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] as needed to help soften stools 7) Hold valsartan on discharge 8) Increase metoprolol tartrate to 37.5 mg twice a day .
