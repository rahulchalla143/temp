Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed withglobal hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior wall.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Cardiac Catheterization [**3-18**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with pulmonary hypertension and a severely depressed cardiac output.
Left ventriculography was not performed given the patients renal dysfunction and hemodynamics.
An IABP was successfully placed with good diastolic augmentation.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with inferolateral and inferior, apical and distal anteroseptal akinesis.
Intrinsic LV function may be more depressed given the severity of the MR. 3.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
cath [**2163-3-22**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
In the CCU, he had an emergent TTE which revealed a worsened EF (10%) and inferior wall akinesis, as well as severe global LV hypokinesis.
A stat CT surgery consult was obtained.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring, to further optimize his medical management.
Discussion with CT surgery decided that the perioperative risk is probably to high.
From ID standpoint, as mentioned above, he had enterococcal bacteremia with questionable endocarditis for which he completed 4 weeks of treatment.He grew coag negative staph from [**1-27**] blood cx bottles from [**3-18**].
However, a repeat TTE showed a possible vegetation, which prompted a TEE, which confirmed that there were no vegetation.
Surveillance culture was negative from [**3-18**] to discharge.
You should have your INR and a complete basic metabolic panel checked by your visiting nurse in [**2-24**] days.
