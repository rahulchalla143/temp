His sputum cultures were contaminated and with multiple epis, he completed a 7 day course of vancomycin for potential pneumonia given he had a lot of secretions.
Repeat sputum GS was positive for gram positvies cocci so vancomycin was restarted on [**2119-12-22**] and he should complete a 7 day course, through [**2119-12-29**].
He will need suctioning Q4 hours.
# Pneumothorax: He had evidence of small ptx on CXR after line placement that progressed on subsequent imaging.
Chest tube placed by thoracics, placed on water seal [**2118-12-19**], pulled [**2118-12-20**], and ptx continued to improve on CXR with no residual ptx on discharge.
# ARF: cr 1.7 on admission likely [**1-19**] to hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and responded very well to IVFs with creatinine now at baseline.
