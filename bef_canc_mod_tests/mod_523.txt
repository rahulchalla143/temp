This is a 59 year-old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**5-/2137**] status post exploratory laparotomy, status post chemotherapy with Irinotecan and Gemcitabine followed by resection two months later of the left lobe of the liver in [**12/2137**] who is being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] without recurrence until recently.
Yesterday she came to the Emergency Room, the day prior to admission at an outside hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] with poor po intake and was found to have a blood pressure in the 90s and was given intravenous fluids.
She then had some coffee ground emesis in the Emergency Room and was found to have a hematocrit of 34 and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
There she went into rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 170s and blood pressure of 80/60, which converted after more intravenous fluids were given.
Hematocrit was 32.6 six hours after the first hematocrit despite the fluid.
Nasogastric lavage was done revealing 400 cc of coffee ground.
This was followed by CT of the abdomen, which showed a 10 cm hepatic fluid air collection consistent with abscess.
She was also being treated for hypokalemia and was found to have platelets of 60.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management of hypertension and abscess.
Here the patient spent three days in the MICU where she received the esophagogastroduodenoscopy for workup of the coffee ground emesis that revealed severe gastritis, esophageal varices and no sign of recent or active bleeding.
H-pylori antibodies were negative and the patient's hematocrit remained stable during the admission in the Intensive Care Unit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2.
Heart rate 87.
Blood pressure 93/52.
Respiratory rate 16.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES/STUDIES:  Most recent creatinine [**2139-12-1**] was .6, BUN 8, hematocrit stable on [**2139-12-12**] at 31.8, white count 14.0, platelets count risen from 45 to 161.
Her hematocrit remained stable.
Her platelet count began to rise and the patient continued on intravenous Zosyn.
On [**2139-12-10**] the patient was taken to CT scan and per Interventional Radiology the patient's drains were placed with larger tubes and at that time there was instrumentation across the diaphragm and a chest tube was placed though the pneumothorax was very small.
Serial chest x-rays showed no further pneumothorax.
The patient remained afebrile on the floor with the cultures pending.
Infectious disease will make their further recommendations when the cultures have identified a culprit organism.
