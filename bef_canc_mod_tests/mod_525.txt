Recently, he had a normal TSH ruling out hyperthyroidism as an etiology and a virtual colonoscopy that showed no colonic lesions though there was poor visualization of the descending colon and no intraabdominal masses or other pathology.
His blood cultures grew 4/4 bottles of VRE on [**1-11**] and 4/4 bottles on [**1-12**]; he was started on linezolid.
He appears to have seeded his blood from his urine where his urine culture grew out 10,000 colonies of VRE [**1-6**].
He then underwent a TEE which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
- An initial CT abd/pelvis on admission raised the possibility of intravesical air as a sign of entero-vesical fistula (which might explain the VRE uti and subsequent bacteremia - A f/u CT abd/pelvis was done with rectal contrast to evaluate for this possibility.
While the rectal contrast did not reach high enough to directly visualize a potential fistula, there was no evidence of intra-vesical air on this study, making a fistula less likely.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4035**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 976**] after d/c  *** will need f/u TEE.
His hypotension, oliguria, and acute renal failure resolved within a few days.
Creatinine on discharge was 1.5; lasix and ACE-I were held on account of bump in crn from 1.2 to 1.5  4.
Troponin leak:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin leak which was thought to be secondary to congestive heart failure.
His Lisinopril and metoprolol were initially discontinued, as he was hypotensive.
