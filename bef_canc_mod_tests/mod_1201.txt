A colonoscopy was going to be performed on [**2174-7-4**] but after 2 rounds of golytly, the patients stool was not clearing.
CT ruled out PE, and revealed mild septal thickening without obvious infiltrate.
CXR negative, U/A and urine culture unremarkable.
Blood cultures from [**6-25**] returned positive for CNS (4/4 bottles, drawn before placement of femoral line), concerning for dialysis catheter infection.
On the day prior to admission, the patients urine dipstick showed >1000WBC and culture grew out gram negative rods.
Appears to have recovered some renal function in the interim, with creatinine 1.4 on admission (last HD on [**6-25**]), and electrolytes within normal range.
While in the MICU, his creatinine rose to 2.4, with rising phosphate.
24-hour urine creatinine clearance 12.2 mL/min.
Follow up labs will be sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64412**].
CAD: EKG on admission with RBBB and some lateral ST depressions.
He was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes (peak troponin 0.31, with flat CK and CK-MB).
An ECHO done on [**2174-7-4**] was essentially normal (EF>55%).
An MRI was obtained to avoid any new structural lesions (it was negative).
