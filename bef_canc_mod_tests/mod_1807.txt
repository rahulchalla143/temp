Consequently she was brought to the Emergency Department this a.m. where she was found to be hypoxic with O2 sats in the approximately 75%, hypotensive with blood pressure 90/50 and was treated with supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, broad spectrum antibiotics initially on Dopamine drip and started on a sepsis protocol.
Congestive heart failure systolic and diastolic dysfunction with an EF of approximately 30 to 35%.
Blood pressure 92/50, 25, 96% on 2 liters.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 2.9, 59 polys, 32 lymphocytes, hematocrit 23.9, platelets 404.
Her chem 7 was within normal limits.
CKs of 167, troponin 0.07.
She had a chest x-ray, which showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity.
She had a CTPA, which was a poor quality study, but was negative for any obvious signs of PE.
She had an electrocardiogram that was alternating between normal sinus rhythm and ventricular bigeminy.
CTPA was negative for evidence of PE.
She was doing well on the floor until [**4-14**] when the patient was again noted to become dyspneic with oxygen saturations into the 80%.
Repeat chest x-ray showed worsening shortness of breath.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient has known congestive heart failure with an EF of approximately 30 to 35% with no systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
MRSA/sepsis:  On readmission to the Intensive Care Unit the patient had a temperature of 104 and blood pressures in the 70s.
She ultimately had a positive right IJ culture tip for MRSA and positive blood cultures from the [**2-12**] for MRSA bacteremia 4 out of 4 bottles.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin and subsequent surveillance cultures were negative.
As stated the patient's sepsis resolved and surveillance cultures were negative.
Repeat urine cultures were negative.
Acute renal failure:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of .5 to .7 and subsequently developed acute renal failure with a creatinine rising to 2.1 with diuresis presumed to be prerenal.
However, recent CTPA did not show any obvious metastatic disease.
There was some concern that her preexisting lower extremity edema prior to this admission was secondary to a carcinous meningitis, however, that seems to be unfounded and neurology was unable to obtain LP for diagnostic purposes.
Anemia:  The patient is a known Jehovah's witness and would significantly benefit from blood transfusions.
On presentation her hematocrit was approximately 23 had decreased to 19.
She continues on Epogen and iron and her hematocrit seems to stabilize between the 23 and 26 range.
Surgery was consulted and determined this unlikely as the nidus of infection based on clinical examination findings.
Unfortunately imaging studies were unable to be obtained given the patient's body habitus.
