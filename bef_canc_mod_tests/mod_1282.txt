An electrocardiogram was done which showed her ejection fraction had fallen from previously normal to 25%.
Neck and chest were sore, sharp, and achy but improving.
Coronary artery disease, status post anterior myocardial infarction in [**2158**]; last catheterization in [**2158**] showed 100% right coronary artery with collaterals from distant circumflex and right coronary artery, 80% left anterior descending artery, and 64% ejection fraction, moderate diastolic dysfunction with increased filling pressures.
An echocardiogram in [**2166**] had an ejection fraction preserved with mild left atrial enlargement and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
p.r.n., Lomotil 2.5 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 98.8, pulse 120, blood pressure 215/120, oxygen saturation 100%, respiratory rate 24.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission laboratories revealed white blood cell count of 18.8, hematocrit of 40, platelets of 288.
Chem-7 was notable for blood urea nitrogen of 73, creatinine 11.4, glucose 239.
Anion gap 21.
Creatine kinase of 43, troponin of less than 0.3.
Arterial blood gas was 7.08/56/103/17/-14.
Blood cultures were no growth to date times two.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in place with heart size at the upper limits of normal, diffuse bilateral opacities more focal in the right perihilar regions, small effusions, right chronic hemidiaphragm elevation.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 98 with a normal axis, a Q wave in V2 to V3, with poor R wave progression until V4 with ST elevations in V2 to V3 and ST depressions in II and V5 to V6.
Echocardiogram showed 25% ejection fraction, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, global hypokinesis, no valve disease.
Repeat chest x-ray revealed much decreased edema from the first with a small right pleural effusion, left CPA not seen.
However, after [**3-6**] after receiving a total of 8.4 kg removed at hemodialysis she had blood pressures dropping to the systolic of 70s and received two 250-cc boluses.
A PTH was sent and was pending.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  On transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit she had a creatine kinase of 387 with a negative MB and troponin which was attributed to immobility in the unit.
Cardiology team recommended catheterization or MIBI; however, the latter was done because of her ejection fraction of 25% by echocardiogram in the Medical Intensive Care Unit; normal previously.
Repeat chest x-ray showed slight elevation of her right hemidiaphragm which is chronically blunted, CPA, and mild right basilar atelectasis correlating with rales in her right base.
No antibiotics were used despite low-grade temperatures and a white blood cell count of 12.4.
Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
meclizine 12.5 t.i.d., and her Celebrex 100 p.r.n., and her Vistaril 25 t.i.d., and her quinine sulfate 260 q.h.s., Renagel 4000 mg p.o.
as blood pressure allows, Epogen 3500 units at hemodialysis.
