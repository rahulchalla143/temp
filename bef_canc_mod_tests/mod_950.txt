Bilateral hydronephrosis appears increased compared to CT scan of [**2167-6-3**] but likely not significantly changed from [**2167-6-13**].
[**2167-7-18**] Abd CT : 1.
[**2167-7-21**] CXR : Lung volumes are lower, the small bilateral pleural effusions are new, but the most important change is widespread multifocal peribronchial opacification--most likely widespread infection, perhaps embolic--almost nodular in the left upper lobe, a new large region of consolidation at both lung bases, the right anterior and the left posterior.

She underwent CT guided drainage on [**2167-7-14**] and after draining close to 1 liter the drain accidently fell out.
She underwent serial exams thereafter and she gradually became distended.
Her initial wound culture grew gram negative and gram positive rods and eventual Lactobacillus.
A CT showed re accumulation of her abdominal fluid collection and she had a drain replaced under ultrasound guidance.
During this time she developed diarrhea and specimens for C difficile were sent on 3 different occasions.
Over 3 days the diarrhea gradually resolved and a C Difficile PCR toxin was sent which was negative.
A chest Xray was done which showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations and she was already being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She underwent chest PT, incentive spirometry and nebulizer treatments and within 24 hours had symptomatically improved with a decreased cough and Room Air saturations of 94-95%.
Of note she had a urine culture done on [**2167-7-20**] which grew .100K VRE.
