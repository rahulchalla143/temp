CAD, status post CABG in [**2178**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, status post a non-Q wave MI in [**10-27**] with an ETT MIBI that showed a questionable ischemia.
CHF with an EF of 25%.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 8.2, hematocrit 36.3, platelets 222,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 5.1, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 36, creatinine 1.9, glucose 98.
Baseline creatinine 1.2.
AST 67, ALT 63, alkaline phosphatase 348, total bilirubin 0.7, albumin 2.6 on [**2193-1-28**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2193-2-22**] which found graft occlusion of the SVG RCA.
He was transferred to the MICU and urgent endoscopy showed clots, small bleeding, with friable and granular antrum of the stomach.
The patient was aggressively resuscitated with 6 units of packed red blood cells, vitamin K, and fluid boluses for decreased urine output.
The patient was transferred to the floor and urine output improved.
With his increased urine output, his creatinine trended down.
The patient had a femoral ultrasound which showed a 3 cm pseudoaneurysm.
The patient was noted to still have persistent AV fistula at the site and will need a follow-up ultrasound in one months time.
The patient's urine output began to drop off so the patient was re-initiated on his Lasix, initially 40 mg q.d.
which was then increased to 40 mg b.i.d., aiming to keep his urine output at net minus liter per day.
The patient's creatinine drifted down to 1.7 despite diuresis.
His cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient will see his cardiologist tomorrow for repeat laboratory checks and the determination of what dose of Lasix to continue on.
His alkaline phosphatase remained slightly elevated in the 300s.
