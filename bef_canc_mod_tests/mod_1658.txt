His chest CT showed a large collection of fluid and air in the right pleural space along with pneumonitis and his WBC was 21K.
His oxygen requirements increased and he eventually was intubated and transferred to the ICU.
His post op course was complicated by prolonged intubation and acute kidney injury requiring CVVH on [**2117-4-2**] with a high creatinine of 6.4 and eventually hemodialysis.
His kidney function recovered a bit after 4 days to a creatinine of 2.5 but unfortunately it was short lived and hemodialysis was restarted and continues.
His chest tubes were removed 10 days post op and all of his intraop cultures were negative.
He still uses 1.5-2L nasal cannula oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%.
The patient will receive 6 days of ciprofloxacin to cover a possible urinary tract infection, although to date, urine culture remains NGTD, the patient is afebrile, and white count continues downtrending.
