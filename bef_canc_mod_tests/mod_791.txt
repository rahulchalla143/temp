She was taken to the EW, where she had BP 260s/200s, had a non-contrast head CT showing left frontal ICH, right parieto-occipital ICH, and edema throughout bilaterally thought to be c/w PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) with superimposed ICH, and had a MRI/MRV to exclude venous thrombosis showing ICH in the parieto-occipital lobes bilaterally and pons without venous sinus thrombosis.
Neurosurgery was consulted and felt that she should be managed non-surgically, a labetalol drip was started with a target SBP of 160s-180s, and she was admitted to the MICU.
She was intubated to have an MRI of the head, as there was concern for sinus venous thrombosis.
MRI was negative for thrombosis.
Additionally, she had [**3-12**] sets of blood cultures from [**8-25**] grow oxacillan resistant coagulase negative staph and was started on vancomycin.
TTE was done and negative for vegetation.

MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Nevertheless, if further evaluation is felt necessary clinically, axial and coronal-acquired 2D time-of-flight MR venography sequences could be performed, allowing each of the major venous sinuses to be imaged orthogonally, a procedure which would minimize any in-plane flow artifacts simulating thrombus.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.
However, given the history of SLE, suspicion of underlying "lupus anticoagulant" and non-arterial distribution of edema and hemorrhage, cerebral venous (including dural venous sinus) thrombosis should be excluded, and urgent MRI with MRV has been recommended, below.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION: Unremarkable chest radiograph.
