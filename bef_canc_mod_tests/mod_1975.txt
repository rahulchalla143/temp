Initial labs were remarkable for plt of 60K and grossly positive UA.
Due to persistent pain, she underwent unremarkable abdominal CT scan.

CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, and intrapelvic small large bowel are unremarkable.Fibroid uterus is redemonstrated.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2179-9-29**] FINDINGS:  Liver is homogeneous in echotexture without discrete masses or lesions.
Gallbladder Scan [**2179-10-1**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal hepatobiliary scan with delayed visualization of the gallbladder consistent with chronic cholecystitis.
KUB [**2179-10-1**] FINDINGS:  Supine and left lateral decubitus images of the abdomen demonstrate an unremarkable bowel gas pattern with no evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Head CT [**2179-10-1**] FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial infarct.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2179-10-8**]: Visualized lung bases demonstrate bibasilar opacification, which may represent atelectasis, however, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
Evaluation of solid organs and intra-abdominal vasculature is limited by non-contrast technique.
Cortical thinning along the posterior right kidney is unchanged since a prior examination and dating back to [**2179-8-7**], likely representing a prior infectious or vascular insult.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2179-10-18**] FINDINGS:  Visualized lung bases demonstrate small focal areas of consolidation which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia given the correct clinical setting.
CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal solid organs and vasculature is limited in this non-contrast study.
The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable in appearance.

Brief Hospital Course: 49 year old female with history of urostomy, recurrent UTIs, ERCP in [**Month (only) 116**], GERD, [**Month (only) 54422**]/pseudoseizures who presented with abdominal pain, decreased PO intake, nausea and vomiting, s/p cholecystectomy for cholecystitis c/b post-op hematoma:  # Abdominal pain: Abdomen initially diffusely tender, however as admission progressed, worst pain was in the RUQ/epigastric area.
Lactate 1.6 at presentation, improved with IV fluids.
Urine culture showed mixed bacterial flora.
A non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no acute changes.
Symptoms improved slowly with antibiotics, so RUQ ultrasound was done, which showed cholelithiasis but not cholecystitis.
Her omeprazole dose was also increased, as there was some concern for gastritis vs. peptic ulcer disease and an H. pylori antibody assay was sent, which was negative.
GI was consulted, and at their recommendation a HIDA scan was done which showed delayed gallbladder visualization suggestive of chronic cholecystitis.
Days later, she sustained a 10-pt hematocrit drop and CT of the abdomen showed a perihepatic and anterior abdominal wall hematoma around the cholecystectomy site.
Her hematocrit remained stable after 2 units pRBCs as she was monitored in the ICU.
CT abdomen and pelvis was done, which showed interval resolution of hematoma and no signs of active bleeding.
Hematocrit was stable for the remainder of the admission.
Urine culture also showed recurrence of infection, initially covered with daptomycin and aztreonam for history of VRE and prior infection.
Culture grew vancomycin sensitive enterococcus and she was subsequently treated with IV vancomycin and completed a 10 day course.
# Malnutrition: Patient had poor oral intake for an undefined amount of time prior to admission, and was unable to tolerate oral intake throughout much of her hospitalization, leading to low albumin (2.2 on [**10-10**]), coagulopathy (INR of 1.6 which resolved after starting supplemental nutrition) and hypoglycemia.
Patient began to tolerate PO intake by mouth  # Thrombocytopenia: Patient had a platelet count of 60 on admission, with nadir of 40 on [**2179-10-2**] before eventually increasing back into the normal range.
Peripheral blood smear showed no signs of schistocytes.
Admission tox screen unremarkable, neuro exam non-focal.
Head CT done [**10-1**] showed no acute changes.
Albumin level still low at time of discharge, but can take some time to respond.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and inability to eat.
You had internal bleeding after the procedure and a second surgery was performed to remove the blood and make sure the bleeding had stopped.
