Prior echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2150-12-2**], revealed mild to moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic insufficiency and one plus mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
At the time, she had a peak aortic valve gradient of 43 mmHg and a mean of 28 mmHg.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was treated by the medical service and cardiology for her congestive heart failure that she presented with in preparation for cardiac catheterization and repeat echocardiogram.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was diuresed and ultimately received echocardiogram on [**2150-12-8**], which showed global left ventricular hypokinesis, bilateral atrial enlargement, moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic insufficiency, one to two plus mitral regurgitation, and depressed right ventricular function.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2150-12-4**], which showed 30 percent left main lesion, two plus mitral regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 percent with severe diffuse hypokinesis and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.5 centimeter squared, a peak gradient of 45 mmHg.
She had a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.
Her neurological examination was nonfocal.
Preoperative laboratories were as follows:  White blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count 403,000.
Prothrombin time 14.9, partial thromboplastin time 24.8, INR 1.4.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.6, chloride 103, creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 119.
Prothrombin time 33.9, partial thromboplastin time 57, INR 0.9.
CK 141, troponin less than 0.01.
Hepatitis antibody was negative.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly.
Additional laboratories were as follows:  ALT 339, AST 173, alkaline phosphatase 67, total bilirubin 0.9.
Preoperative electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation.
Preoperative gallbladder ultrasound showed a right pleural effusion and just minimal fluid around the gallbladder attributed to her congestive heart failure.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of double valve surgery with additional studies to be done including the completion of her echocardiogram which was done on [**2150-12-8**].
The elevated AST and ALT were again noted the following morning to be elevated as well as INR of 1.4.
It was recommended that the patient have some Vitamin K subcutaneously and repeat liver function tests and INR check in the morning.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and the patient was then intubated on [**2150-12-7**], by anesthesia given her aortic stenosis and increasing respiratory distress with respiratory rate over 30 and an unobtainable peripheral oxygen saturation.
At the time of cardiac catheterization on [**2150-12-8**], the patient underwent aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty in the catheterization laboratory.
The resulting mean gradient was 25 and the aortic valve area was increased from 0.5 to 0.65 centimeter squared.
Liver function tests continued to trend upward with ALT of 1450, AST 1406, LDH 1380.
A postprocedure echocardiogram also noted by the congestive heart failure fellow was that the patient's echocardiogram showed some worsening of her aortic insufficiency which was now moderate.
Her creatinine rose slightly with sodium nitroprusside but the goal was to get her to an index of 2.6.
Blood cultures on [**2150-12-7**], showed no growth to date.
Sputum had some polymorphonuclear cells with four plus gram positive cocci in pairs, chains and clusters, as well as sputum culture showing moderate oropharyngeal growth.
Electrocardiogram showed occasional premature ventricular contractions with short runs of trigeminy.
The head CT with contrast showed a small hypodense focus seen adjacent to the left side of the left angle commissure consistent with a Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space.
This was noted on prior MRA examination of  06/[**2145**].
Chest x-ray [**2150-12-10**], showed left hemidiaphragm opacity likely a combination of small pleural effusion, atelectasis and consolidation.
Ativan was discontinued and neurologic examination was followed daily.
Magnetic resonance imaging was also ordered to help better determine possible cerebrovascular accident.
She also had her magnetic resonance imaging done with an improved examination.
Head MR showed no evidence of a cerebrovascular accident.
Captopril was started with a goal systolic arterial blood pressure of greater than 110.
Urine culture showed E. coli with Bactrim resistance.
The patient was reevaluated by cardiac surgery on [**2150-12-15**], who noted her decreasing liver function tests and the fact that she had been cleared by neurology for cardiac surgery and heparinization.
Additional preoperative laboratories on [**2150-12-17**], prior to surgery were as follows:  White blood cell count 11.6, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 348,000.
Prothrombin time 13.7, INR 1.2.
Potassium 4.3, blood urea nitrogen 21, creatinine 0.5, ALT 194, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 72, total bilirubin 1.2.
Urinalysis showed some leukocytes with 6-10 white blood cells and no bacteria.
Repeat urinalysis and culture was ordered.
Preoperative carotid ultrasound showed no significant disease.
On postoperative day number one, the patient was in sinus tachycardia in the 120s and blood pressure was 126/66.
Cardiac index 2.9 on an Esmolol drip.
Her chest tubes remained in place and Lasix diuresis was begun.
Creatinine was stable at 0.4, potassium 3.8 and INR 1.2.
White blood cell count 12, hematocrit 32.
The patient's creatinine was stable at 0.7.
She continued to work with physical therapy, had some incisional pain, a little bit of ankle edema as well as right arm edema and weakness which was known to the team from preoperative workup.
On postoperative day number five, her INR was 4.4, partial thromboplastin time was pending.
As the partial thromboplastin time was drawn from the same arm as the intravenous Heparin, so it was repeated.
Coagulation studies were rechecked.
INR rose to 1.6 on postoperative day number six.
On postoperative day number seven, her INR rose to 1.9 and her liver function tests approached normal range.
When her INR hit 2.1, her Heparin drip was discontinued.
The blood pressure was 74/47 and she was completely asymptomatic.
A cortisol level was checked which was normal.
She continued to drop her blood pressure every time she did the stairs but was retested.
DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to follow- up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**], her cardiologist, approximately two to three weeks postdischarge, to see Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in the office in four weeks for her postoperative surgical visit, follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone when she had her INR checked by the VNA.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is to follow her INR and Coumadin dosing, area code [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100298**].
Coumadin 2 mg per day until she spoke to her    physician after her blood draw when she got home.
