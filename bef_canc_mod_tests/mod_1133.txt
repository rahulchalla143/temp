Peak to peak gradient decreased from 60 mm hg to 25 mm Hg approximately with an increase in systemic blood pressure.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more depressed given the severity of TR].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
EKG:  CT Scan : ([**2149-6-12**]) FINDINGS:   CT CHEST: Airways are patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally.
CT ABDOMEN: Liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals and kidneys are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS: Inguinal hernia containing a most likely small bowel loop is noted without strangulation.
Extensive coronary and aortic valve calcifications consistent with known aortic stenosis.

: none   Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old gentleman with history of severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation on low dose coumadin, systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), h/o DVT, HIT, GI bleed on coumadin and colon CA s/p resection came to [**Hospital1 18**] for a corevalvae for severe aortic stenosis.
Patient had a relatively benign post-op course and was transferred down to the cardiology floor for further monitoring until discharge.
[**7-10**] echo showed   trace paravalvular aortic valve leak is present.
No further issues of bradycardia during post-op course  # Chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure: most recent EF 40% on TEE .
We also gave him  IV metoprolol 2.5mg boluses PRN for HR >100 though when his PO metoprolol dose was increased heh no longer needed those doses.
INR upon discharge was 1.7.
#Anemia: Ht dropped from 31 to 26 on the second day of hospital stay after the procedure.
There may also be a hemodiltuion effect bc he is net positive 3L since he has been and his platelets are also lowWe did not transfuse as he was not symptomatic and his Ht was stable.
#Thrombocytopenia: Platelets were 83 dropped from 101.
