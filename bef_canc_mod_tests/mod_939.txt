In the ED, he was febrile to 101.5F, with CXR demonstrating cardiomegaly, perihilar vascular congestion and possible R infiltrate.
A subsequent CTA was negative for PE, though was a limited study, and extensive airspace disease was seen c/w ARDS vs PNA vs CHF.
Head CT reportedly showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
CKs were elevated to 300s with negative MBs.
Troponin was initially 0.01, peaked at 0.11 on [**1-6**], and decreased to 0.07, with positive being >0.30.
Repeat CXR demonstrated progressive infiltrates, and pt became increasingly hypoxic.
He continued to be hypertensive to 180s, and with worsening radiographic CXR findings in spite of clinical improvement.
In the context of fever and mental status changes, consideration was given to performing LP; however, due to inadequate neurology coverage at [**Hospital3 6592**], pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

On anticoagulation, INR 1.8 on discharge.
INR should be checked in 2 days to ensure its therapeutic.
