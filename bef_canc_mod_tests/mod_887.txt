He then became diaphoretic, light-headed, put his head between his knees and fell over into his bed without any head trauma.
At the outside hospital Emergency Department, fasting blood sugar was noted to be 31.
He was found to have bilateral rales on examination and was given 40 mg intravenous Lasix, Aspirin, one amp of D50 and one half Nitroglycerin paste and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation given that his prior cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Multiple myeloma diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy in [**2199-1-26**], with aspirate smears demonstrating a MTE ratio of 3:1, less than 1% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 5% myelocytes, 7% metamyelocytes, 31% bands/neutrophils, 30% plasma cells, 8% lymphocytes, 16% erythroid cells.
The initial IgG level was 4520 with IgA and IgM at less than 7 and 28, respectively.
His last coronary catheterization was on [**2199-10-9**], which demonstrated patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and saphenous vein graft to R1/OM1 and right posterior descending artery, as well as severe three vessel coronary disease of a right dominant system, moderate diastolic ventricular function, left ventriculogram was not performed secondary to renal insufficiency.
The pressures were as follows;  right ventricular end diastolic pressure 18, wedge pressure 24, left ventricular end diastolic pressure 20 and the cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 liters per minute per meter square.
Congestive heart failure, left and right sided, with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, left atrial moderate dilation, left ventricular moderate dilation, mild pulmonary hypertension by echocardiogram performed on [**2199-10-9**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission, temperature 97.9, blood pressure 165/65, heart rate 76 and paced and regular, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extremities showed trace to 1+ sacral edema, cool feet, 2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 3.1, hematocrit 30.0, platelet count 135,000.
Chem7 showed sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 32, creatinine 2.2.
INR 1.8.
CK 91, troponin less than 0.01.
Glucose 96.
Chest x-ray showed findings consistent with congestive heart failure, more confluent opacity in the right infrahilar region, may reflect asymmetric edema or underlying pneumonia, read by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Congestive heart failure - The patient was initially continued on 40 mg of Lasix per day, given the findings on lung examination and the peripheral edema.
Enzymes were cycled and were negative times three.
Blood pressure was initially controlled with a Nitroglycerin drip.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed once the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and demonstrated diffuse segments of akinesis/hypokinesis in the apex, septal region, inferolateral region and inferior region, as well as moderate right ventricular systolic depression and an unchanged ejection fraction, unchanged mitral regurgitation at 2+.
At the time of transfer to the floor, the patient had oxygen saturation of 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Nevertheless, the patient still required D50 pushes for two glucose levels below 50.
Fingerstick glucose levels were checked q1hour.
Beta 2 Hydroxybutyrate was checked.
TSH, T4 and cortisol were checked and were all within normal limits.
An endocrine consultation was obtained which suggested that most likely the hypoglycemia was secondary to decreased excretion of Sulfonylureas in Metformin in the setting of acute renal failure, as well as possible contribution to Hydrochlorothiazide induced insulin resistant.
Liver function tests were checked and were within normal limits.
The D10W drip was eventually titrated down to D5W drip and then after the patient developed hyponatremia was changed to D5 normal saline and was then weaned off on the morning of [**2200-3-2**], at which time fingerstick glucose remained within normal limits and fingerstick glucose checks were changed to q4hours and then to q6hours.
He had some presyncope with light-headedness, was found to have a fingerstick glucose of 184.
The patient's creatinine rose from 2.2 on admission to 2.5 on [**2200-3-4**], and was at 2.2 on the day of transfer to the floor.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient was continued on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.0.
