MRSA Screen [**12-25**]: Negative MRSA Screen [**12-27**]: Negative .
Repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for improvement in LVEF after revascularizing the OM1.
If not, consider repeat viability study (Dobutamine echo) and re-assess the need to open the LCx.
Extremity U/S [**12-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.2 x 1.1 cm right groin pseudoaneurysm.
TTE [**12-25**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-9**], left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now regional and global systolic function is preserved.
CXR PA/LAT [**12-27**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing pleural effusions have minimally decreased in extent.
CT could be performed to clarify this suspicion.
CXR Portable [**12-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
# NSTEMI/VFib Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for elective cardiac catheterization for optimization of cardiac function in preparation for possible renal transplant.
During the procedure OM1 was successfully stented with BMS x 2, but there was an unsuccessful attempt to revascularize AV groove LCx.
Following the procedure the patient developed chest pain with ST depressions in II/III/aVF and positive CKMB and troponins (CKMB peak of 24.1).
Echo after the procedures was significant for increase in estimated LVEF (30-35% from 20-30% on prior) with preserved global systolic function but severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
A second cardiac catheterization was conducted which was significant for a jailed AV groove Lcx with delayed flow and an unsuccessful attempt at PCI of AV groove Lcx due to inability to cross lesion with wire.
He was transferred back to the CCU for continued evaluation and treatment and was loaded with IV then PO amiodarone.
# Femoral Pseudoaneurysm: Following initial catheterization the patient was found to have a pseudoaneurysm reported as 1.2x1.1cm by radiology, read as 0.7cm by interventional radiology.
The patient would benefit from repeat ultrasound in two weeks to assess the status of this finding.
#Chronic Systolic CHF: ECHO during this admission demonstrated an LVEF of 30-35% up from 20-30% on prior.
He will likely benefit from spironolactone in the future when his blood pressures are more robust.
#Blood Pressure: His blood pressures have been a little soft, especially following dialysis which has caused us to lower his home BP regimen (metoprolol succinate 75mg PO daily -> metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily, and lisinopril 20mg PO daily -> lisinopril 10mg PO daily).
Home oxygen order Home oxygen for exertion when oxygen saturations fall below 88%.
Titrate up to 4L's for oxygen saturations less than 88%.
We did another heart catheterization, but no further interventions were able to be made.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as scheduled to arrange to have further studies and potential implantation of a defibrillator device at a later time.
weight goes up more than 3 lbs in one day or more than 5 lbs in one week.
Your oxygen levels have been low in the hospital, especially when you move around.
Ideally your oxygen saturation levels should be greater than 94%.
Your blood levels are also lower than normal.
