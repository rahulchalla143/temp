In the emergency department the patients vital signs were 99, 175/70, 86 and 100% on 2L.
Labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 5.9 and a BNP of 19,000.
A CXR was largly unchanged.
No JVD LUNGS: Listening over her neck, you can hear a high pitched inspiratory and expiratory stridor, which is transmitted to her distal lung fields ABDOMEN: NABS.
Pertinent Results: ==================   ADMISSION LABS ==================  [**2173-9-6**] 01:30PM BLOOD Neuts-62.7 Lymphs-24.9 Monos-7.0 Eos-4.8* Baso-0.5 [**2173-9-6**] 01:30PM BLOOD Glucose-71 UreaN-25* Creat-6.5* Na-137 K-5.9* Cl-94* HCO3-32 AnGap-17 [**2173-9-6**] 01:30PM BLOOD Calcium-9.3 Phos-3.9 Mg-2.2  CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
Lung volumes are low which limits evaluation.
There is coarse calcification in the upper abdomen, likely corresponding with calcifications in the pancreas seen on a prior CT abdomen and pelvis from [**2171-5-28**].
CT AIRWAY FINDINGS: Since [**2173-8-16**], pulmonary edema has cleared.
Lymph nodes are not enlarged using CT criteria.
The inspiration and the expiration images are suboptimal with poor evaluation of the glottic and subglottic area, to be correlated with bronchoscopy.
This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic elevation except to note small- sized kidneys in this patient known for chronic renal failure and left upper extremity AV fistula.
Limited study demonstrating no evidence of stenosis within the intrathoracic airways to the subsegmental level.
Chest CT is recommended in one year to determine stability.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 103090**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, and a recent admission with multiple intubations, who is presenting with acute onset of SOB, wheezing and stridor.
The following morning she underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild cervical tracheomalacia, no stenosis, and the distal airways remained patent.
