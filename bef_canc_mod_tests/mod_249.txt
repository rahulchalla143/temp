A BAL culture from [**10-31**] was positive for moderate normal flora with moderate growth Serratia marcescens of two species, both sensitive to bactrim.
He was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 25 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells in hopes of relieving the patient's dyspnea.
On the date of admission, the patient was reportedly on five liters of nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 90%.
An arterial blood gas done at the time was 7.36/63.8/72.
A VATS procedure was done for right-sided effusion and atelectasis as per operative note, which showed blood clot, which was removed.
No tissue was sent for pathology and the patient was sent to [**Hospital1 1319**] for a vent wean.
Sputum grew out Serratia and the patient was given Levaquin and Ceftazidime.
On admission, the patient was noted to have a cuff leak which was repaired and bronchoscopy revealed minimal secretions.
Serratia was thought at that time to have some element of seizure after he was diuresed, however, an echocardiogram done showed a normal ejection fraction.
From [**10-3**] to [**10-13**] at [**Hospital1 1319**], the patient continued the vent wean and on [**10-2**], the patient felt rapid atrial fibrillation.
His Captopril was decreased and beta-blocker was added with minimal response.
An electrocardiogram was concerning for ST depressions in the anterior lateral leads and the patient was transferred back to [**Hospital6 256**].
Chest x-ray at that time revealed new right upper lobe infiltrate.
The patient's heart rate was controlled with beta-blockers, however, the patient continued to have intermittent hypertension, in which he was given IV fluid.
Pancytopenia thought to be due to MDS, however, bone marrow biopsy in [**2113-7-13**] was nondiagnostic.
HIT antibody positive in [**2113-8-13**].
MVR/TVR in [**2113-7-13**] with hospital course as above.
Echocardiogram in [**2113-9-12**], ejection fraction 50-55%, positive TR, moderate PA systolic hypertension, prosthetic mitral valve seen.
Catheterization on [**2113-7-11**]:  100% occlusion of the left main coronary artery, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to left circumflex, patent right coronary artery stent, severe mitral regurgitation and moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (pressure 45/26).
LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit barely stable at 30, no pandemia on discharge.
Creatinine 1.1.
INR 1.7 on [**11-8**], ALT 27, AST 29, alkaline phosphatase 112, amylase 54, total bilirubin 0.2.
CK 28, sputum culture contaminated.
Blood cultures no growth to date.
Urine culture revealed enterococcus.
Chest x-ray showed progressive loss of right lung volume which may represent a combination collapse and increasing pleural effusion.
Lipase 25 and 60.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.7.
Heart rate 130.
Blood pressure 100/72.
Oxygen saturation 96% on 60% high flow, however, on discharge, at 96% on two liters and 88% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No gag reflex elicited.
Lungs:  No breath sounds at right base, clear to auscultation bilaterally otherwise.
Extremities:  Warm, trace edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
The patient's hematocrit of 25 at the outside hospital, did not seem to be an acute decline.
The patient's stool was OB positive, however, after blood transfusion, the patient responded well and the hematocrit remained stable.
The patient may in the future need a colonoscopy for work-up.
Ocean nasal spray, [**12-14**] sprays in each nostril q.i.d.
The patient needs INR checked on Friday, [**11-10**], and swish and swallow evaluation as the patient failed his swish and swallow here and was kept NPO.
