HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman admitted on [**9-27**] from an outside hospital for evaluation of type B aortic dissection and concern for pulmonary embolus.
The patient was discharged home after a workup for myocardial infarction on [**9-25**].
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2186-8-4**] with ulceration.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on examination revealed his temperature was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 74, his blood pressure was 116/51 in the left arm, blood pressure in his right arm was 120/58, his oxygen saturation was 95% on room air, and his respiratory rate was 18.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear bilaterally with very mild left lower lobe decreased breath sounds.
Extremity examination revealed the extremities were warm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 11.3, his hematocrit was 32.3, and his platelets were 193.
INR was 1.3.
Partial thromboplastin time was 32.2.
Sodium was 132, potassium was 3.6, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 0.7, and blood glucose was 95.
Creatine kinase was 15.
Troponin was 0.05.
Magnesium was 1.7, phosphorous was 3.7, and calcium was 8.8.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse/consolidation with associated layered pleural effusion.
A computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary edema.
A left-sided pleural effusion and a dissection which was unchanged when compared  to an earlier study.
Computed tomography showed a type B dissection from the left subclavian to the diaphragm.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for evaluation of type B dissection.
Cardiology Surgery and Vascular Surgery were involved and evaluated the patient and felt that due to repeat x-ray and decreased symptoms, because the patient had remained asymptomatic, there was no need to intervene surgically and to manage the patient medically.
The patient was managed medically well with blood pressure control.
His blood pressure goal was to keep his blood pressures at 70s which was initially achieved through drips.
On the day prior to discharge, he continued to have some light dizziness, and some of his blood pressure medications were held because his blood pressures were going down to the high 80s.
Since the day prior to discharge, his blood pressure medications were readjusted and the frequency was changed from 500 mg by mouth twice per day to 300 mg by mouth three times per day to achieve better blood pressure control and without any more evidence of hypotensive episodes.
He received a magnetic resonance imaging on the day prior to discharge which showed no change from the previous magnetic resonance imaging when he was first admitted in terms of the dissection or the pleural effusion.
The patient's creatinine tolerated the dye doses well without a bump in his creatinine.
He originally came in blood pressures over 130s to 140s, and now he was in the 110s and 100s to 110s.
The patient was instructed to buy a blood pressure machine for frequent blood pressure checks.
The patient was instructed to check his blood pressure about every four hours by himself and by his wife.
The patient was instructed that it was important to follow up with blood pressure checks and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was also scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging in four weeks to evaluate the progression of dissection.
In [**2186-9-4**] a magnetic resonance imaging was done which showed thoracic aortic aneurysm with large mural hematoma and separate focal dissection in descending thoracic aorta.
A repeat magnetic resonance imaging on [**10-5**] to compare versus prior showed no changes.
