PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.9, heart rate 111, blood pressure 138/71, respiratory rate of 24, 96% on 6 liters of nasal cannula.
The neck is supple, with JVP about 10 cm.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission CBC showed white count of 17.9, hematocrit 40.7, platelet count 510,000.
Coag showed PT of 12.8, PTT 26.3, INR 1.1.
Chem 7 showed sodium 141, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 33, glucose 135.
CK 86, troponin less than 0.3.
Admission chest x-ray shows extensive air space opacity of mid and lower lung zones on the right, seen on previous chest x-rays.
Next, EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, 111 beats per minute, normal intervals, axis 52 degrees, left atrial abnormality.
There are no new ST changes compared with prior EKG from [**2155-4-8**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine service for evaluation and treatment of her multifactorial respiratory distress.
On the morning after admission, the patient went into acute respiratory distress with a respiratory rate in the high 30's and increased work of breathing.
CHF:  The patient's initial history and physical was most consistent with CHF, and she responded to initial diuresis to 80 mg IV Lasix on the field.
Echocardiogram performed on [**5-21**] showed possibly severe LV diastolic dysfunction, with preserved systolic  function.
Work-up at that time was equivocal, and was felt that further work-up was not indicated as the patient would not proceed to surgery or chemotherapy anyway.
On this admission chest x-ray did show a right lower lobe opacity suspicious for pneumonia, and she was treated with Levo and Flagyl, again for suspicion that this process might be post obstructive.
Follow-up potassium every day for the first five days to assess serum potassium levels while the patient begins her new Lasix regimen.
