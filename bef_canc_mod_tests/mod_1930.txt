**FINAL REPORT [**2151-3-7**]**     DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2151-3-7**]):       Negative for Influenza A viral antigen.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2151-3-7**]):       POSITIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
TTE ([**3-12**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-3-8**] .
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-3-12**] 9:30 AM There has been marked improvement in pulmonary edema, still there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
TTE ([**3-8**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-8-28**], the LVEF is now severely depressed .
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2151-3-8**] 11:18 AM BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed which demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN PORT  [**2151-3-7**] 1:14 PM  A limited portable ultrasound examination was performed by the radiology resident.
IMPRESSION: Limited ultrasound demonstrates no superficial mass lesions identified within the abdomen or pelvis.
Findings may be confirmed with non- emergent CT of the abdomen and pelvis if clinically warranted.
Her oxygen saturation and overall respiratory status improved.
A TTE was repeated 4 days later and did not show any signifcant change.
Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated (likely in setting of demand), however did not meet criteria for an NSTEMI.
# Rhythm - Atrial Fibrillation/SSS s/p PPM Rate was well controlled.
Rechecking TSH showed a level of 14.
Calcium 500 500 mg (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 400 unit Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO once a day.
