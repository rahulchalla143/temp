Of note, he was sent out on a course of Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum culture on [**2113-8-22**].
Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin were added empirically for gram-negative coverage after a culture grew gram-negative rods.
ABG at that time revealed 7.25, 71, and 75 on 70% FIO2.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.
In the emergency department, he was noted to have a cuff leak, which was subsequently repaired.
Additionally, he was bronchoscoped by CT surgery revealed only mural secretions.
At that time, CBC with white count was 3.8, hematocrit 38.4, platelet count 148.000.
Status post bone narrow biopsy that diagnosis pancytopenia in [**2113-7-13**].
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Prior to the CT surgery, he lived alone in [**Location (un) **], NH.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  Pulse 85, blood pressure 135/86, oxygen saturation 97%, temperature 99.1.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission were significant for a white count of 13.1, hematocrit 29.5, platelet count 244,000, INR 3.3, BUN 45, creatinine 0.8.
Gas shortly after admission revealed the pH of 7.45, pCO2 44, pO2 of 74.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe opacities, greater on the right than the left, which had been increased compared to the prior study.
CT of the chest was done in the ED, which revealed large right lung consolidation, bilateral fluid collections, left greater than right.

Transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction.
Although there is some speculation that the positive sputum culture was merely a colonizer.
The decision was made not to do diagnostic thoracentesis on him in house, because the INR was therapeutic and if were to stop his Coumadin, he would have to be put on Lepirudin rather than heparin since he has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
because the heart rate was in the low 40s.
In house, the counts all remained stable and the hematocrit never dropped below 21.
to be adjusted to maintain INR between 2 and 3.
