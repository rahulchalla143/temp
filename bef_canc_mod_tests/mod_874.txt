CXR did not reveal CHF or consolidation.
500cc fluid bolus started, BP's continued to drop to SBP in 70's; therefore, levophed started.
SBP increased to 100-110's after 1.5L NS, levophed, and decadron 4mg x1.
ABG on NRB prior to BiPAP 7.32/72/272.

WBC 12.5  PLT 163 HCT 37.2 LFTs including amylase and lipase were all WNL .
all BCX: negative [**2116-3-20**] Sputum cx negative [**2116-3-18**] sputum cx shows beta strep not group A [**3-17**]/ UCx: CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS)  Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo woman w/ h/o Lung Adeno Ca s/p chemo/xrt/resection, COPD, DVT, and HTN, who presents from NH w/ lethargy, respiratory distress, initially hypertensive emergency, followed by hypotension.
She also was noted to have HTN with SBP 200s, which improved with nitro gtt.
Sputum culture grew only beta strep (not group A).
The patient's SBP then dropped to the 70s, requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
The hypotension was felt to be due to sepsis from her pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin as above.
#) UTI: UA was positive on admission, but culture grew only ~[**2109**] of corynebacterium/diphtheroids.
Thereafter, diltiazem was used as above to treat MAT and also to manage blood pressure.
Her SBP on discharge was 130-150 with HR 80-90. .
You have been started on some new medications including tiotropium inhaler and diltiazem for heart rate and blood pressure.
