U/S had shown intrahepatic ductal dilitation and patient subsequently had an ERCP with diagnosis of cholangitis likely secondary to recurrent stones and possible stricture.
Intrahepatic ducts were inaccessible due to prior Roux-en-Y so percutaneous biliary drainage was attempted, the CBD was inaccessible, and a re-attempt was to be tried a few days later.
In the meantime the patient developed bleeding from the drain site, the drain was removed and the intrahepatic ducts were no longer dilated.
Patient appeared to be clinically improving and was to be discharged home, however on [**2172-3-20**] the Hct was found to have dropped to 20%, CT abdomen revealed heterogeneous liver consistent with intrahepatic bleeding.
Patient received 1 unit RBCs and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
