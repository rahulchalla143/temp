[**2199-3-8**] Chest X-ray  INDICATION: Volume overload, pneumonia, assessment for interval change.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient was found to have K 7.4 with prolonged QRS and LBBB.
On admission, weight was ~ 3kg higher than dry weight ~ 39.7 Kg.
Oxygen requirement of 2L was no longer needed after removal of excess fluid.
At discharge, she was at her dry weight of 39KG.
Due to chest x-ray suggestive of questionable right middle lobe pneumonia, was started on vancomycin, cefepime and levaquin in setting of report of chills and cough for 2 days prior to admission.
# s/p mitral valve replacement: Pt is on coumadin with goal INR 3-3.5.
INR was subtherapeutic at 1.8.
She was started on a heparin gtt to bridge and her coumadin was increased to 2mg with increase to supratherapeutic levels and subsequently held.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: * INR - GOAL 3.0-3.5 for mechanical valve.
* Goal dry weight is 39kg, which was her weight on discharge.
Discontinue after INR 3.0-3.5.
We gave you an extra dose of coumadin and you will have to continue close monitoring of the INR at rehab.
