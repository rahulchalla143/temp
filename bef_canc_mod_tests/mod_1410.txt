She was admitted to the MICU and underwent TTE which showed critical AS, with valve area 0.5 cm2 and mean gradient 78 and peak gradient 129.
On the day of admission she was seen to be very SOB by her daughter and was brought to her PCPs office where her amb sat was 86% on RA and she was sent to ED.

No change since the examination done one hour earlier.
Ct scan of chest suggested.
[**3-18**] ECHO The left atrium is elongated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.
[**3-19**] CXR Compared to the film from two days previous there continues to be cardiomegaly.

Further evaluation is recommended, to evaluate for the possibility of a thyroid cancer.

[**3-24**] CARDIAC CATH  COMMENTS:     1.
Resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated moderately elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 25mmHg and RVEDP 24mmHg.
An accurate PCWP was not obtainable after several attempts.
With RV pacing at a rate of 160 we performed 4 inflations manually with a 30cc syringe.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3, P 95, BP 114/52, R 24, 94%RA O2 sat.
EKG with ST depression in V5-6 c/w strain pattern, and CXR c/w pulm edema and LLL infiltrate.
She became hypotensive intermittently to SBP 86/60 and got 250 NS b/c low BPs.
Oxygen requirement increased to 97% on 4L NC.
She denied any chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, fever, chills, cough, sputum production, dysuria, or sick contacts (although does live in [**Hospital3 **]).
PFT's were done which showed a restrictive pattern, not obstructive, please see pertinent results section for more details.
Pt was satting 82% on RA on discharge but 96% with 2L NP.
# Critical aortic stenosis: TTE on [**3-18**] revealed worsening of her critical AS with a valve area of 0.5cm2.
Pt discussed options for treatment extensively with her family, primary cardiologist, and the team, and decision was made to proceed with valvoloplasty instead of aortic valve replacement given higher risks of morbidity and mortality with surgery and with the plan that if this failed to improve her symptoms she could still undergo AVR in the future.
Cath showed 40% stenosis in RCA.
Thyroid function tests, including TSH, T3, T4, were all wnl.

You were transferred to the CCU for closer blood pressure monitoring.
You were seen by cardiothoracic surgery for valve repair but a valvuloplasty was performed instead as it was thought to be easier to tolerate.
New medicines: You were started on low dose Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily to help your heart pump better Your ACE inhibitor was discontinued in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and marginal blood pressure Please continue to take lasix 20mg daily.
