Bone marrow biopsy was done which was consistent with a possible myeloproliferative disorder.
During this admission, the pt was also treated for possible sepsis since he had hypotension with a SBP in the 80s and an elevated WBC count of 23 on admission.
These were then discontinued as his WBC count decreased but he was continued on stress dose steroids.
However, at 6:00 PM he was noted to be pale and diaphoretic with a temperature of 102.8 and BP of 100/50.
Pt was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
Last echo [**7-16**] w/ EF >55%, diastolic dysfunction.
Holter [**2187**]: SR w/ moderate PR prolongation, AEA w/ runs of atrial tachycardia, 2 beat run of VT 2.
Cirrhosis (consistent findings on recent ultrasound, but not seen on CT abdomen [**11-24**])   Social History: The patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **] Corner.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Tm 98.5  p95  bp 100/40 (98-106/40-51)  r 25  97-100 10L cool neb I/o 1800/2400 General: awake, alert NAD, elderly male.
[**12-29**] Non-contrast head CT: FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The noncontrast images of the head are degraded by motion.
Markedly heterogenous echotexture of the liver, with multiple small hypodense areas, the largest one in the right lobe measuring 2.5 cm, which appears to be increased in size and number compared to the prior CT study.
[**12-30**] blood cultures had no growth on bacterial cultures, and preliminarily no growth on fungal or mycobacterial cultures.
LP was done [**12-30**], which showed no evidence of meningitis.
CSF bacterial, fungal, and AFB cultures no growth.
CSF HSV PCR was checked, which was ultimately negative.
Abx d/c'ed once CSF bacterial cultures were negative.
BAL with transbronchial biopsy was done on [**12-31**], and respiratory cultures eventually grew MRSA, and was negative to date for AFB or nocardia.
Pt also found to be in ARF on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with Cr 2.3 from baseline 0.8.
It was observed that Mr. [**Known lastname **]' INR was elevated to 2.7, with tbili elevated to 2.7.
Transaminases were high-normal, but also trended up slowly over course of hospitalization, with AST trending from 50 to 86, and ALT from 16 to 39.
Hep C Ab found to be equivocal.
A RUQ U/S was done on [**1-5**], which demonstrated multifocal areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with microabscesses or metastatic disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated on [**12-31**], and sent to [**Company 191**] service on [**1-1**] for further management.
Thoracic surgery was consulted, who scheduled him tentatitvely for a mediastinoscopy and node biopsy for [**1-11**].
At this point, the idea was entertained to attempt to obtain tissue through a liver core biopsy, which would be less invasive and stressful.
In preparation for a possible lymph node biopsy and to better image the liver lesions, a CT was done.
On [**1-3**], he was found to have an acute decline in mental status, unable or unwilling to open his eyes, and only responding to noxious stimuli.
An EEG was also done, which showed generalized theta slowing c/w toxic/metabolic etiology.
CXR demonstrated LLL, RML, and RLL infiltrates.
He had no corneal reflex and no pulse.
