Repeat potassium 10.1.
Cardiac - CPK 45, CK MB not performed because CK less than 100, troponin C less than 0.3.
Arterial blood gases - pO2 60, pCO2 37, pH 7.29, total CO2 19, base excess negative 7.
Urinalysis revealed specific gravity 1.009, trace blood, negative nitrites, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, urobilinogen, leukocytes.
Microscopic urine examination - 0-2 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria, no yeast, 0-2 epithelial cells.
Urine chemistry - Creatinine 29, sodium 72, potassium 50, chloride 105, total protein 9, protein to creatinine ratio 0.3.
Microbiology:  Urine culture no growth.
AP pelvis - no fracture or dislocation is detected about the pelvis.
Electrocardiogram - sinus bradycardia at a rate of 44 beats per minute, first degree AV block, right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, wide QRS complex and peaked T waves, consistent with hyperkalemia.
Following dialysis, the patient's potassium trended back toward his baseline of approximately 5.0.
The patient's clinical and laboratory examination provided little evidence for either advanced renal failure or marked volume depletion, raising the question of hypoaldosteronism in its etiology.
With these thoughts in mind, the patient subsequently had an aldosterone level drawn, and he was started empirically on Fludrocortisone, for presumed hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a condition that typically affects patients 50 to 70 years of age with diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
At the time of his discharge on [**2167-5-18**], the patient had a potassium of 4.4.
The patient's aldosterone was found to be 13.0 with a reference range of 1.0-16.0 for a patient when supine.
Hypercalcemia - At the time of his admission, the patient's free calcium was noted to be 1.37.
These tests revealed no specific abnormalities, and there was no monoclonal immunoglobulin seen.
Hypoaldosteronism - As mentioned previously, the patient's presentation with hyperkalemia raised the question of hypoaldosteronism in its etiology.
Given the patient's history of type IV RTA, it was thought that the patient's hypoaldosteronism might be due to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a condition that typically affects patients in their 50s to 70s with diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
During the remainder of his admission, the patient's creatinine remained between 1.0 and 1.5.
Cardiovascular - Coronary artery disease - From the time of his Emergency Department presentation on [**2167-5-12**], the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, all of which were negative.
The patient's TSH was 1.2 and his free T4 was 1.5, both within normal limits.
