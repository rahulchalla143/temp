Complaints of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath beginning one week prior led to echo [**7-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which demonstrated an EF of 40%, trace regurg, thickened mitral valve,  increasing pericardial effusion circumferential, no evidence of tamponade.
Echo demonstrating 3 cm anterior effusion with RA inversion and no signs of tamponade.
In ED, vitals 97.1, Hr 58, BP 150/76, RR 20.
Hydral was given.K repleted 40 mg. Nurse found patient stupurous, FBG noted to be 23.
Head CT non contrast demonstrating lacunar infarcts in the past.
Blood pressure elevated to systolic 200.
CHF- Echo [**12-25**]-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated.
1+ MR ; mod PA HTN; small-mod pericardial effusion.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T: 95.9, bp 183/83 range 83-156/64-83, hr 61 (61-70), rr 12, spo2 99% RA Gen: obese, elderly male, snoring in bed, only arousable with shouts HEENT: anicteric sclera, op clear with mmm Neck: JVP difficult to assess secondary to body habitus CV: rrr, s1s2, no m/r/g Lungs: fair air movement, Crackles at bases Abd: obese, soft, nt, nabs, colostomy in place, surgical scars present.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: Echo [**2170-7-9**] infero posterior thinned scarred and akinetic LV, EF 40%.
Head CT [**2170-7-13**] Stable appearance of the brain from [**2169-11-21**], without intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
CXR [**2170-7-13**]: A/P.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2170-1-8**], the effusion may be slightly bigger but there is no signs of tamponade.
LV systolic function appears depressed with lateral wall hypokinesis.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-7-14**], the effusion appears similar in size.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 78 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, stents, CHF EF 40% presented to PCP with shortness of breath pleuritic chest pain, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Known 3 cm pericardial effusion, echo in ED with no evidence of tamponade.
patient became unarousable in ED with blood sugar 28, given 3 AMPS D50 and admitted to the CCU.
Echo shows evidence of RA collapse.
Monitored with serial pulsus checks.
Repeated echo in preparation of possible pericardiocentesis given extent of effusion and concern for tamponade.
TTE [**7-14**] with no evidence of significant worsening effusion of tamponade.
CXR with no remarkable pulm edema.
Head CT did not show acute bleed.
Nebulizer treatments and cxr with no evidece of pulmonary edema or bleed.
