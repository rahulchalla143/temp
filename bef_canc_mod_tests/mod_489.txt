Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed were pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were nonpalpable bilaterally.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 44-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, initially admitted for a left lower extremity cellulitis with hospital course complicated by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, complicated catheterization, and workup of left upper lobe mass found on a pre-catheterization chest x-ray.
In addition, in the interval between developing the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient also had some hemoptysis which was followed up with a CT of the chest which showed a left upper lobe mass.
It should also be noted that the patient also had a echocardiogram after his myocardial infarction which was significant for a moderately dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, with a normal left ventricular cavity size, overall left ventricular systolic function preservation; although, mild basal inferior hypokinesis could not be excluded.
Left ventricular inflow pattern suggested impaired.
Ejection fraction of greater than 55% was determined.
No further workup was done.
While in house the patient developed hemoptysis, and a left lower lobe mass was also seen on a follow-up chest x-ray.
A CT of the chest was done on [**10-27**] which showed a left upper lobe mass that was speculated which was 3.6-cm X 5.3-cm in size.
The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and oxacillin for cultures which grew out Staphylococcus coagulase-positive bacteria.
A hyponatremia workup was initiated while in house, and the patient was to follow up with his primary care physician regarding the results of these tests.
