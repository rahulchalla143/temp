She was not covered for hospital acquired infection (gram negatives and MRSA), but doubt that based on clinical status and CXR findings.
Her pulmonary exam remains rhonchorus and she has not been able to clear her secretions well.
Chest PT was initiated with improvement in her O2 saturation on room air.
Respiratory and blood cultures were negative.
She was maintaining oxygen saturations in the low to mid 90s (increasing to high 90s with chest PT) at time of discharge.
Had 2 episodes of A-fib w/ RVR on [**2-5**], which were largely unresponsive to IV lopressor, but broke with diltiazem 10-20 mg IV.
Weight based heparin gtt (as included in discharge paperwork) can be discontinued when her INR is again therapeutic, but this will need to be followed in rehab.
Her foley catheter was discontinued and her UA did not reveal evidence of infection.
A urine cx is currently pending and should be followed up.
She should call [**Hospital1 18**] urology at([**Telephone/Fax (1) 772**] for a follow up appointment to further evaluate this if persists.
ARF:  She had a very mild bump in her creatinine to 1.2 (BL creatinine nml) just prior to discharge and clinically on exam appeared to be dry with dry MM.
Creatinine normalized on day of d/c to 1.0 after small IV fluid bolus.
Her kidney function and fluid status should be monitored at rehab as well.
With oxygen saturations on room air in the low-mid 90s.
