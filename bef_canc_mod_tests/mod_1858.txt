In the MICU, she was kept on mechanical ventilation until upper airway edema decreased and vocal cords could be visualized.
Also, several allergy labs were sent, including RAST to foods, C1 esterase, C3/C4, and TBII (see results section for details).
Her angioedema improved, and she was successfully extubated on [**2128-7-12**].
Her meloxicam was also discontinued in case it can cause angioedema.
Her nifedipine CR was titrated up to 120mg daily.
Her blood pressure should be closely monitored at rehab.
4) Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: While on ventilator, she developed leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR and sputum 4+ for GPC in pairs and clusters which ultimately grew MSSA and 2+ GNR consistent with haemophilus.
