His ejection fraction has over the past four years progressively gone from normal to about 40% with measurements of synchrony being distinctly abnormal.
An attempt to decrease the fluid accumulation and increasing Lasix has caused the deterioration of his kidney function, such that his BUN is 101 and creatinine 3.2 with concurrent hypokalemia and hypochloremia despite the concomitant use of Aldactone.
Decision made to place BiV pacemarker in attempt to improve cardiac function and secondarily increase his renal perfusion.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the apical anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls, and severe hypokinesis of the mid septum.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
CXR [**1-25**] Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, as before.
Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**1-24**], and lung volumes have improved.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-1-22**], left ventricular systolic dysfunction appears more diffuse/global and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is highe    Brief Hospital Course: [**Last Name (un) 14077**] is a 77-year-old man with CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, RIMA-RCA, SVG-OM in [**2089**]) and PCI (DES to SVG-OM in [**2106**]), multiple atrial arrhythmias and tachybrady syndrome s/p multiple ablations and pacemaker placement in [**2106**], CKD, and chronic systolic heart failure s/p epicardial lead placement via left mini-thoracotomy w/St.
Repeat TTE demonstrated stable EF ~45% with ventricular synchrony.
On admission patient's creatinine 3.4.
After procedure, creatinine peak to 4.0 on [**1-25**].
Creatinine at time of discharge: 3.9.
Monitor creatinine regularly and I/O.
Last cardiac catheterization [**2106**] with stenting of SVG to OM.
Patient with 1/11 Stress echo: Rest and stress perfusion images reveal decreased tracer uptake in the anterior apical region on both stress and rest images with associated apical wall motion abnormality.
