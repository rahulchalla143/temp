Dedicated PA and lateral radiograph is recommended for better assessment.
Previously described ill-defined right basilar air space opacity is not well seen on the current study and may have represented atelectasis.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-8-31**] A-V pacing has been replaced by ventricular paced rhythm.
LV systolic function appears mildly to moderately  depressed with nearly global hypokinesis particularly the inferolateral,  anterior and basal inferoseptal walls.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2150-11-5**] overall left ventricular function maybe similar but prior study is not available for direct comparison.
#Abdominal pain/vomiting/diarrhea - Likely patient received perioperative antibiotics - ?C.
On exam once transferred to medicine pt had crackles [**12-21**] bases R>L and diminished breath sounds b/l.
CXR did not show focal consolidation more c/w fluid and atalectatic picture.
Her O2 sats improved to 100% 1L NC.
Her FeNa is 0.39, which supported a pre-renal etiology.
She was given Toprol XL 25mg PO x1 per NF when called o/n for elevated BP and an episode of desat to 90%RA.
SBP 130s.
#CHF - no peripheral edema and minimal evidence of fluid overload on lung exam initially.
On exam pt had diminished breath sounds b/l R>L and had 2 episoded of decreased O2 sats overnight.
Her lung exam improved.
She was also put back on her BB and lisinopril with good BP and HR control.
Her hct remained stable throughout her admission from 28-30.
