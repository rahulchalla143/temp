He went to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed an approximately 4 x 5 cm left cerebellar mass with resulting effacement of the fourth ventricle and enlargement of lateral and third ventricles.

Differential diagnostic considerations include hemangioblastoma, hemorrhagic ependymoma or a vascular lesion likely cavernoma.
An angiogram can be performed to assess the vascularity of this lesion.
Head CT [**11-9**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no interval change in the size and mass effect of the complex, multilocular and hemorrhagic left cerebellar hemispheric mass measuring 3.5 (AP) x 5.1 cm (TRV).
Head CTA [**11-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Spectroscopy Head [**11-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
While there is no increased flow on perfusion imaging, this may be due to tamponade effect of the hemorrhagic components.
