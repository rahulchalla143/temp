She took her blood pressure at home, and her systolic blood pressure was in the 200s.
On arrival to the Emergency Department, her blood pressure was 264/130.
Her physical examination was notable for bibasilar crackles with diffuse wheezing.
At that point, her systolic blood pressure dropped to 86/40 with a heart rate of 38.
Her blood pressure then rose to 196/94, at which point the nitroglycerin drip was restarted, and the patient was treated with 10 mg of intravenous hydralazine and 50 mg of oral hydralazine.
At that time her systolic blood pressure was in the 230s.
Electrocardiogram done on admission prior to the development of the left upper quadrant pain was unchanged from a previous baseline electrocardiogram.
After receiving her Lopressor, with a decrease in the heart rate, the electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in V4 through V6 and leads II, III, and F.  On arrival to the floor, the patient's blood pressure was 230, and she was complaining of left upper quadrant pain.
At that time, the patient was given 20 mg of intravenous hydralazine along with intravenous nitroglycerin drip without improvement in her blood pressure.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination on admission to the Intensive Care Unit revealed a temperature of 96.9, heart rate of 68, blood pressure of 187/87, respiratory rate of 12, oxygen saturation of 98% on 3 liters by nasal cannula.
Head and neck examination was notable for jugular venous distention to 8 cm.
Funduscopic examination was difficult.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 6.2, hematocrit of 37.6, platelets of 397.
Sodium of 142, potassium of 3.8, blood urea nitrogen of 31, creatinine of 3.3, glucose of 83.
Creatine kinase of 108, troponin of less than 0.3.
A urinalysis showed no evidence of a urinary tract infection.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with cephalization consistent with mild heart failure.
An ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrated a normal caliber aorta.
The left kidney was 11.7 cm, and the right kidney was 9.7 cm.
Serial creatine kinases were 90, 80, and 78.
Troponins were less than 0.3, 0.7, and 0.8.
She had an echocardiogram while in the Coronary Care Unit.
This demonstrated an ejection fraction of 60%, mild left atrial dilatation, mild right atrial dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and no significant valvular disease.
She was weaned off the nitroprusside drip while in the Coronary Care Unit and converted to all oral blood pressure medications.
She was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit with systolic blood pressures ranging from 110 to 180.
While on the floor, her blood pressure continued to be difficult to control with occasional bursts in systolic blood pressures of up to 250.
At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, her systolic blood pressures were running between 140 and 200.
The goal of the Renal and Cardiology consultations was a systolic blood pressure in the range of 140 to 150.
RENAL: She has a history of baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of approximately 3.
During the course of her hospital stay, her creatinine began rising.
The creatinine peaked at 6.3.
The creatinine stayed elevated between 6 to 6.3 for the next three days, and has since started to trend down.
On the day prior to discharge, the creatinine was 4.8.
She was oliguric for several days, but her urine output picked up.
During the course of her hospital stay, she was worked up for a possible renal artery stenosis given her presentation of extremely elevated blood pressure and a history of difficult to control blood pressure on multiple antihypertensive medications.
A magnetic resonance angiography was performed and demonstrated a moderate stenosis in the proximal left renal artery of approximately 50% to 70% of the diameter.
She had no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology on an abdominal ultrasound on the day of admission or on the magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen two days after admission.
A portable abdominal x-ray was performed during the course of her hospital stay which demonstrated a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern and a prominent amount of stool throughout the right hemicolon.
Her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine should be checked daily until they remain at a constant level.
All of her blood pressure medications should be held if her systolic blood pressure drops below 140.
