Upon arrival to the ED, BP 80s.
Gap 15 and bicarb 18.
Last labs improving.
On admission, her CXR was consistent with a RML infiltrate, which ultiamtely ended up growing MRSA, BETA STREPTOCOCCI, NOT GROUP A, and rare GNRs.
On [**2123-5-24**] she was noted to have a large R sided pleural effusion, which was tapped 2 days later revealing 1.4 L of serous fluid, with a pgitail in place initially, but ultimately removed.

Blood cultures ([**5-25**], [**5-22**], [**5-21**]):  NEGATIVE Urine Culture ([**6-1**], [**5-25**], [**5-22**]):  Negative Urine Legionella ([**5-23**]):  Negative RRV Swab:  Negative Stool sample ([**6-6**]) C. Diff NEGATIVE  Imaging:  ECG	Study Date of [**2123-5-31**]  7:56:42 AM Moderate baseline artifact.
Sinus tachycardia, rate 103, with occasional ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2123-5-26**] the precordial voltage is much higher and the ST-T wave changes noted at that time are less prominent.
CXR ([**5-31**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild decrease in lung volume.
The monitoring and support devices are unchanged, except for a newly placed left PICC line with a tip projecting over the inferior SVC.
CXR ([**5-29**]): There is a right IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the mid to proximal SVC.
CXR ([**5-28**]): The tip of the nasogastric tube and side port are well below the  gastroesophageal junction.
CXR ([**5-27**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube are unchanged.
CXR ([**5-26**]): Uniform opacification in the right lower lung is probably severe right lower lobe consolidation or atelectasis.
TTE ([**5-26**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
KUB ([**5-24**]): Nasogastric tube not well seen, although it follows the expected  course, coiling over the expected location of the stomach on the chest radiograph from four minutes earlier.
Abdominal Xray ([**5-24**]): No obstruction or ileus.
CXR ([**5-22**]): In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies at the mid clavicular level, approximately 6 cm above the carina.
CXR ([**5-21**], day of admission): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR supportive of RLL/RML infiltrate as well as left retrocardiac opacity which became apparent as the patient was diuresed and has been stable.
Pleural fluid showed 4+ PMNs without growth and was negative for malignant cells, consistent with a parapneumonic effusion.
Of note, the patient also has right upper lobe collapse which may be old given history of lung Ca; the patient's records regarding her prior chest CT should be compared to see if there any evidence of change or progression of this collapse.
She initially given significant IVF with good response, and was on pressors which were subsequently weaned when the patient's blood pressure stabilized on antibiotics and with discontinuation of sedation for mechanical ventilation.
Her home Atenolol, which was initially held, was re-started prior to call-out from the MICU, and was continued upon her discharge.
An ECHO performed in house showed a normal LVEF, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, as well as a small pericardial effusion, which was echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
#Rapid Heart Rate:  The patient had an episode of HR 170's, and then episodes of HR 140's-150's on telemetry concerning for SVT vs afib, less likely sinus tachycardia vs accelerated junctional rhythm.
EKGs were only obtained with HR's in the 90's and one EKG with HR 119, and these showed sinus tachycardia vs less likely accelerated junctional rhythm, although somewhat difficult to assess consistently due to low voltages.
She was switched from Metoprolol to her home Atenolol prior to call-out from the MICU and tolerated that well with HR in the 90's-100's.
On the floor, her HCT did nadir as low as 21, for which she received 1 uPRBC transfusion, with an appropriate bump in her HCT to 24.
Her anemia should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.
Hemolysis labs were negative, although the patient was noted to have an elevated LDH.
Her iron studies were consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation.
#Elevated LDH: The patient was noted to have elevated LDH at a peak of 600 at one point during her hospitalization, trending down to the 400s.
Etiologies considered where inflammation and cell turnover from her PNA, which was actually improving at the time these labs were drawn.
In addition, there was concern that this elevation in LDH could represent recurrence of her small cell lung cancer; her CT at Tuft's will need to be reviewed, with consideration towards possible treatment/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
Question of recurrence based on current CXRs, and reportedly had CT chest at [**Hospital1 3278**].
Please have your nursing home contact your primary lung cancer doctor as well to discuss the results of your CT Scan at [**Hospital1 3278**].
