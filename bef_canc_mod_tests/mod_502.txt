During her first hospitalization, she was hospitalized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for an upper gastrointestinal bleed with a hematocrit drop to 22.3 and she was found to have a nonbleeding ulcer at the gastroesophageal junction.
After her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her hospital course was notable for worsening dyspnea on exertion and hypoxia with saturations equal to approximately 90% on three liters of oxygen.
On the day of discharge, she had an echocardiogram which was to be forwarded to her primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 4565**].
Diabetes, type 2, for which the patient is taking oral agents.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.7 F, blood pressure 107/52, heart rate 109, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 89% on two liters, oxygen saturation on room air 86%.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, sclerae anicteric, oropharynx clear.
Extremities: 2+ edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count equal to 26.3, with 95% neutrophils, 2.3% lymphocytes, 1.6% monocytes, hematocrit equal to 32.1 platelets equal to 477,000.
Sodium equal to 133, potassium equal to 4.1, chloride equal to 95, bicarbonate equal to 25, BUN equal to 17, creatinine equal to 1.7, glucose equal to 205.
CK equal to 99, troponin equal to 5.9.
PTT equal to 24.8, INR equal to 1.5.
Chest x-ray: mild congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size from prior study.
Chest CT scan: no evidence of pulmonary embolus, partial collapse or consolidation of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe, question pneumonia, large right pleural effusion, moderate left pleural effusion.
She had a chest CT scan which revealed right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient underwent thoracentesis of the right lung which showed loculated pleural effusions, exudative in nature, with a high white blood cell count.
At the time of discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's respiratory status had improved greatly and she was discharged to the floor on three to four liters of supplemental oxygen with oxygen saturation in the mid 90s.
During her time on the floor and at discharge, the patient remained on four liters of supplemental oxygen with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.
Cardiovascular:  Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% as well as septal and inferoseptal wall motion abnormalities.
At the time of discharge, the patient continued to have some moderate lower extremity swelling; however, her lung examination was unremarkable for significant signs of congestive heart failure.
During her stay in the hospital, the patient was seen by Cardiology who recommended that the patient undergo further evaluation following discharge, possibly including cardiac catheterization.
Infectious Disease:  On admission, the patient was found to be febrile with a white blood cell count equal to 26.3.
When she left the Medical Intensive Care Unit and returned to the floor, her white blood cell count had decreased significantly, and cultures of the pleural effusion revealed alpha streptococcus.
During her hospitalization, blood and urine cultures remained negative, as did Clostridium difficile toxin screen times three.
At the time of discharge, the patient's white blood cell count had risen slightly 16.9; however, she clinically showed signs of improvement of the pneumonia.
During her current hospitalization, her hematocrit remained stable and she revealed no signs or symptoms of further bleeding.
Prior to discharge, she was restarted on her Avandia; however, the Glucotrol was held as the patient experienced mild hypoglycemia when this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was restarted.
Renal:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.3.
During her hospitalization, her creatinine was mildly elevated at 1.6; however, remained stable.
