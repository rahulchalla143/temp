Admission Date:  [**2174-8-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-11-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Prochlorperazine / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**] Chief Complaint: Fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2431**] [**Known lastname **] is a 38yo F ALL s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction attributed to chemotherapy for ALL as well as XRT for [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] (EF 15-20%), embolic CVA now on coumadin, asthma, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, well-known to the [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] service who was just discharged yesterday ([**2174-8-10**]) after a prolonged hospital course for acute on chronic CHF thought be be due to cardiac GVHD and acute on chronic renal failure.
CXR was done and cardiac silloette was increased, concerning for pleural effusion.
On arrival to the floor, pt has no complaints.
She has some cough, but no different or worse than prior to discharge.
No calf pain.
Past Medical History: ALL: - initially presented in [**2172-8-5**] right chest and right upper extremity pain and paresthesias and visual blurriness.
- underwent phase I induction with daunorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, MTX; phase II with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, MTX - Bone Marrow Aspirate/Biopsy on [**2172-10-26**] showed no morphologic evidence of residual leukemia - underwent allo double cord blood SCT [**2173-1-11**], course complicated by neutropenic fever and acute skin GVHD - subsequent course has been complicated by pseudomonas pneumonia in [**5-15**], empiric treatment of CMV pericarditis in [**7-15**], chronic nausea and vomiting which has been treated as GVHD with steroids though colonoscopies in [**8-14**] and [**11-14**] were negative for GVHD.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: - Embolic stroke in [**3-/2174**] on coumadin - Asthma - Hypertension - Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia - C-section in [**2165**] - Cardiomyopathy due to early anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity [**10/2172**] - Chronic kidney disease stage III/IV, baseline creatinine ~2.0 - Chronic abdominal pain: Her workup so far has included EGD [**2173-9-5**], [**2173-11-5**] with mild signs of gastritis, no GVHD.
She has had multiple CT scans which have demonstrated moderate ascites with interval increase, no drainable fluid collection, diverticulosis, small fat-containing umbilical hernia with mild fat stranding, no bowel obstruction.
RUQ ultrasound revealed ascites, gallbladder wall edema presumably from third spacing, and no biliary duct dilatation.
Sclera and conjunctiva clear.
No oral lesions or exudates.
Pulm: Bibasilar crackles Abd: soft, NT, ND Extremities: wwp, edema of the feet and distal ankles B/L Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: nonfocal Pulsus paradoxus 2mmHg .
There is no typical configurational abnormality.
The rather general increase of the heart shadow is suggestive of pericardial effusion.
Lateral pleural sinuses are partially concealed by the described parenchymal densities.
Conclusive evidence of pleural effusion is not present, and major pleural effusion is unlikely as it did not exist on the lateral view on the preceding chest examination.
Progression of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in this patient on stem cell transplant therapy.
Echo ([**2174-8-12**]):  Moderate ?partially loculated pericardial effusion without definite evidence for tamponade physiology.
Echo ([**2174-8-18**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echo ([**2174-8-23**]): The left atrium appears extrinsically compressed (mildly) posteriorly, possibly by a consolidated posterior pericardial effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The epicardial surface of the right ventricle as well as atria appears to be encased in a layer of echodense material (epicardial fat vs consolidated effusive material).
No evidence of cardiac tamponade seen.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis, as clinically queried.
Reversed flow in the main portal vein, could be secondary to cardiac tamponade or tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions and a small amount of ascites   Brief Hospital Course: 38 year old female with ALL s/p cord blood transplant complicated by multi-organ GVHD admitted directly to the ICU for recurrent fever and increased pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.
#Sepsis: Patient presented to the clinic with fevers to 102; CXR showed increased pulmonary infiltrates and heart size.
Hypoxia and work of breathing worsening and she required intubation for ventilation (see below).
Microbiology revealed parainfluenza 3, but no other pathogens: sputum bacterial and fungal cultures + BAL cultures/stains/labs were all negative, including negative PCRs for PCP and CMV.
# Hypoxia: Serial CXRs showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
Patient arrived in the ICU unintubated but was intubated on the day after transfer for increasing respiratory effort and somnolence.
She was sedated on fentanyl and versed due to agitation and discomfort on the vent.
#Pericardial Effusion: Admission CXR showed increased heart size, and the echo done on [**2174-8-12**] showed increase in pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Follow-up echo showed worsening moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, which was drained by bedside pericardiocentesis.
#Congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction: Patient has known CHF with systolic dysfunction from chemo, XRT and suspected cardiac GVHD.
Considered whether patient's recent CHF lability might contribute to current respiratory acuity.
She was on torsemide on arrival, but this was held in the context of hypovolemia (see below).
Following pericardiocentesis her cardiac output improved, repeat Echo was performed, and congestive heart failure was thought not to be the cause of her declining clinical picture.
Pt was hypocalcemic to 5.9 (requiring standing supplementation) and hyperphosphatemic, both likely secondary to renal failure.
She became anuric and was started on CVVHD.
CVVHD was discontinued as the patient developed hypotension despite being on three pressors.
She was transiently IV fluid and pressor-dependent with hypotension to 85/45 but maintained BP through most of her ICU stay.
# Hyponatremia.
She was hyponatremic, likely due to diuresis (which was stopped).
# LFT abnormalities.
Stable transaminases, with normal ALT and AST mildly elevated.
Unclear etiology, likely secondary to hypoxia and end-organ underperfusion.
# Thrombocytopenia.
Platelet count remained low but patient did not show signs of coagulopathy.
