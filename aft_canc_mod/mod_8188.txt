Admission Date:  [**2149-10-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-10-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-5-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**] Chief Complaint: Leg pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone Biopsy (right Iliac [**Doctor First Name **])   History of Present Illness: 78F w/ h/o afib s/p ablation ([**2147**]), whipple, HTN, DM2 who p/w weakness in her legs.
She first presented to an OSH on [**9-29**] after being seen at her PCP's office with fevers to 101 and a positive UA.
She then re-presented to the OSH on [**10-3**] with leg pain, weakness, and nausea, as well as increasing pressure in her lower back.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for lumbar spine MRI to further evaluate her lower extremity pathology.
Exam was notable for heme negative stool on rectal with good tone, no saddle anesthesia and intact neurologic exam.
EKG was read as LBBB, rate 110, no SG criteria and amiodarone was discontinued.
Pt underwent CTA abd/pelvis to assess for aortic pathology which was notable for a complex ovarian cyst, multiple likely lytic lesions in the acetabulum and RP LAD.
She received 2L of IVF and vanc/zosyn for empiric coverage.
As her neurologic exam was intact, no acute spinal pathology was suspected and MRI spine was not pursued.
On evaluation of her EKGs, the MICU resident consulted cardiology and given concern for slow VT she is being transferred to the CCU for further management.
On arrival to the floor, patient reports she is w/o pain as long as she does not walk.
Her leg pain is primarily with movement and has been noticeable for the last 2-3 days.
She notes sweats during the day and at night, dizziness at times ("whooziness"), blurred vision a few days earlier, headaches, worsened dyspnea and occasional cough (non-productive).
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Per HPI and: She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Afib s/p ablation [**2147**] ([**State 15946**]) on coumadin - Whipple in [**2142**] hx w/ concern for malignancy; prompted by pancreatic mass on endoscopic u/s; but negative on pathology after procedure) - H/O breast cancer s/p partial mastectomy, radiation, and cobalt in [**2120**] - Hernia repair - Hypothyroidism  Social History: Lives w/ her husband in [**Name (NI) **].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

No cervical LAD appreciated CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Back: No flank pain or paraspinal tenderness EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
EKG OSH: [**10-3**] at 12:48: Wide complex tachycardia c/w VT at 110 bpm w/ northwest axis.
EKG [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**10-3**] at 16:22: Wide complex tachycardia c/w VT at 105 bpm, northwest axis.
EKG [**Hospital1 18**] MICU [**10-4**] at 12:12AM: Sinus tachycardia at 116 bpm.
OSH CT L-Spine w/o contrast: Mild DJD but no metastases or masses.
No acute findings.
There is nodular prominence of the right hilus which may represent engorgement of central pulmonary vessels.
The lungs demonstrate diffuse edema with nodular opacities representing over the upper thoracic spine on lateral view as well as in the mid-to-lower right lateral lung.
There is a trace right and small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions; prominent right hilus may represent engorged vasculature, but nodular opacities within the lung warrant chest CT after diuresis to assess the nodular opacities and right hilus.
No abdominal aortic dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.
2.9 x 1.4 cm lytic destructive right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] lesion with soft tissue component worrisome for metastatic disease, less likely primary lesion.
Two other lucent foci in the right acetabular roof and anterior column which may be metastatic foci versus degenerative change.
Mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and enlarged pericardial lymph node, further raising suspicious for metastatic disease.
Dilated pancreatic duct in the post-Whipple patient with additional hypodense regions.
2.1 x 1.5 cm left adnexal cystic focus.
A dedicated pelvic son[**Name (NI) **] is recommended in a non-emergent setting for further characterization in this postmenopasual patient.
Trace right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
ECHO [**10-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular systolic function is difficult to evaluate due to suboptimal image quality, irregular rhythm and conduction abnormality but overall ejection fraction is probably near normal.
The inferior wall may be mildly hypokinetic.
At least mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
No suspicious lung lesion.
Pulmonary edema is mild with moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement is mild and nonspecific.
Left sternal hypodensity could also be related to radiotherapy.
Bone Biopsy [**10-10**] (pending):   Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo F w/ h/o AF on rivaroxaban and flecainide, HTN, hypothyroidism, and DM type 2 who presented with leg pain, found to be in slow [**Hospital **] transferred to the CCU for further management.
#) Wide-Complex Tachyarrhythmia: Appears c/w VT. Pt w/o h/o known CAD though has multiple risk factors.
Though ischemia is most common etiology of VT, this patient's VT was more likely due to flecainide toxicity, especially considering possible interaction between flecainide and ciprofloxacin.
The VT resolved with treatment, thought he patient did have other episodes of wide-complex VT consistent with afib with aberrancy.
She then converted to atrial fibrillation with RVR up to 130s.
Metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg QID and verapamil 80mg QID was also added for rate control.
She will follow up with Electrophysiology as an outpatient for elective cardioversion.
CT abdomen/[**Last Name (un) 98019**] was concerning for lytic lesion in the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] and overian mass.
CT chest showed no suspicious lung lesion, mild pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral pleural effusions, multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement was mild and nonspecific.
Left sternal hypodensity could also be related to radiotherapy, and pelvic U/S demonstrated 2 cm simple-appearing cyst in the left ovary.
Hem/Onc was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended biopsy of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes or the lytic bone lesion.
Because the patient has had extensive abdominal surgery in the past and has mesh in place, a bone biopsy of the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] was performed by interventional radiology.
In addition, during this hospitalization she had an elevated uric acid up to 7.3.
#) Non-Gap Acidosis: No history of diarrhea or evidence of renal failure on labs.
Thought to be consistent w/ acute flecainide toxicity as low bicarb (17 on admission) can be seen in this setting.
#) Relative Hypotension: Pt hypertensive at baseline on atenolol and lisinopril.
Has not had any documented objective fevers and though had bandemia at OSH has largely resolved.
No clear source of infection to invoke septic picture.

You were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm which we believe was due to the combination of medications that you were on that interact and can cause an abnormal heart rhythm.
You also had a bone biopsy because we were concerned about a cancer that could be growing because of your complaints of fatigue and night sweats.
