Extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in addition to enlarged lymph nodes posterior to the descending thoracic aorta.
In the setting of recent renal transplant, these findings are worrisome for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder or a lymphoma.
Mild ascites.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
No evidence of endocarditis (cannot be excluded).
The right ventricle appears mildly dilated.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He was at [**Hospital1 **] for these fevers for the last 3 days without a diagnosis and continued to experience fevers at home.
He also had a leukocytosis with left shift.
He spiked a fever to 102.6 and was given tylenol 1 gm, vanc/cefepime given concern for fever in the setting of immunocomprise.
On the floor, the patient had no complaints other than fatigue.
He did report increased frequency of urination with decrease volume of urine for the last 4 days.
No tenderness over his transplant site.
He noted drinking fluid regularly but endorses some decreased PO over the last week due to disintrest.
No other complaints.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 2cm, concerning for PTLD v lymphoma.
On the morning of [**4-15**], the patient's lactate began to rise with a worsening acidosis.
He also had an episode of hematemesis on the floor with coffee grounds and some bright red blood.
The source of the patient's elevated lactate was initially unclear, differential included tumor lysis v ischemia.
On [**4-16**], patient had an excisional lymph node biopsy performed with pathology consistent with an aggressive B cell lymphoma.
The patient was also started on CVVH and received IV bicard for his profound acidemia.
On [**4-18**], the patient developed a tachycardia believe to be sinus rhythm with some PAC's.
In the evening of [**4-18**], the patient remained tenuous, he became tachycardiac to the 180s, quickly dropped his blood pressures despite fluid, albumin and bicarb and died with his family at his side.
