There is streaky density consistent with subsegmental atelectasis, as before.
Interstitial markings appear more prominent but this is difficult to assess in the face of low lung volumes.
IMPRESSION: Increased interstitial markings but may represent pulmonary vascular congestion.
No definite focal consolidation.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Aerosolized secretions in the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening in the bilateral ethmoid sinuses.
MRI/MRA HEAD/NECK [**2177-1-19**]: MRA NECK: Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow in the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
No evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size are seen.
CXR AP [**2177-1-22**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in density at the right lung base, potentially suggesting increased atelectasis, notably in the light of minimal overall decrease of lung volumes.
No pulmonary edema.
No evidence of infection.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
ECHO [**2177-1-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Moderate biatrial enlargement.
Brief Hospital Course: 74M with AFib, CAD s/p LAD stent [**69**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, POD#1 s/p [**Month (only) **] for rectal [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU for Afib w/ RVR in setting of fever to 102. .
# Afib w/ RVR: Patient went into afib w/ RVR likely from fluid shifts post-operatively.
This can be addressed as an outpatient given his elevated risk for CVA with high Chad2 score.
Neurology was consulted, a head CT and MRI was not evident for an acute bleed or CVA.
His delirium was likely secondary to medications: Ativan and pain meds.
He subsequently improved by holding ativan and titrating down pain regimen.
# Fever: Patient spiked a fever [**1-19**] to 101.6.
His CXR did not show evidence of infiltrates.
# CAD s/p BMS [**2169**] to LAD: Patient was restarted on his asa and Plavix post-operatively.
# Hypertension: Controlled w/ pain control.
# Rectal CA s/p [**Month (only) **]: Post-operatively, patient's diet was advanced and was maintained on Reglan.
He was pain controlled w/ morphine iv, oxycodone, Tylenol and naproxen.
Patient was transferred to the floor he remained stable in sinus rhythm, no tachycardic.
Foley was discontinued at midnight, unfortunately he had large amount of urinary incotinence with post void residuals of 700cc, Foley was replace.
Please follow recommendation from PCP for urinary retention.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Zofran 8 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea for 2 weeks.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Rectal Cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: Abdominal Wound: Clean and dry and intact, staples in place.
Foley is in place for urinary retention.
