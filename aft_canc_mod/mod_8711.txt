Please note per history, the patient has history of lung cancer.
Large area of opacity projecting over the left lung is worrisome for infectious process, alternatively progression of malignancy/lymphangitic spread.
There may be superimposed pulmonary edema.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
CXR [**2160-12-8**]- As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.
Status post sternotomy, CABG, moderate cardiomegaly, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2160-12-9**]- Poor image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis and distal septal, distal anterior and apical hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or major vascular territory infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 M with history of stage IIIa NSCLC, sCHF with EF 35-40%, CAD s/p CABG presenting initially for n/v/[**Hospital **] transferred to ICU for hypotension, hypoxia, and fever.
# Respiratory distress: Patient transferred to ICU on HD 1 due to episode of hypotension and hypoxia while receiving blood transfusion.
Patient continued to be hypotensive and hypoxic throughout the day with an increasing O2 requirement.
He spiked a fever and CXR was concerning for new pneumonia, so vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin were started.
Concerns were for bacterial pneumonia vs PCP pneumonia vs radiation pneumonitis vs worsening of underlying malignancy.
Patient's oxygen requirement increased overnight on HD 3 and so treatment for PCP pneumonia was started with high dose bactrim.
# Right MCA stroke: On HD 3, housestaff was called to bedside for acute change in patient's breathing.
A code stroke was called and a CT of the head showed a non-hemorrhagic stroke in the right MCA, adjacent to prior stroke.
# Insomnia: Patient struggled with insomnia throughout admission.
He was also given morphine as needed for comfort as part of his difficulty sleeping was secondary to his tachypnea.
However, patient developed increased work of breathing and family requested morphine boluses.
