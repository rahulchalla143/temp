MODERATE GROWTH.
hypothyroidism p/w septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia with suspected pulmonary versus urine source.
Per family pt has a history of PNA versus aspiration PNA, hospitalized three times over the past year and also had dirty UA and ?pna on cxr from ed.
Pressors able to be weaned and antibiotics switched to linezolid for VRE in urine and meropenem for acinetobacter in sputum.
Respiratory Failure: Pt arrived intubated in ventilatory failure believed to be [**1-20**] pna versus ards from urosepsis.
This was complicated by fluid overload in the setting of volume repletion.
Pt's infections were treated and pt was diuresed aggressively with resolution of pulmonary edema at time of discharge.
Etiology was believed to be ATN secondary to hypotension in setting of septic shock.
NSTEMI: Pt showed no ischemic EKG changes in the ED but cardiac enzymes were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5, troponin 0.06.
TWI in I, avL, q in Lead III, small R-wave and aVF inferiorly.
Did not start beta blocker given episodes of bradycardia.
Bradycardia initially thought to likely be due to his hypothermia.
However, had additional episodes of sinus bradycardia periodically, particularly in the evening.
# Anemia: pt?????
Likely [**1-20**] aggressive fluid hydration.
Pt does also have h/o peptic ulcers, and was on xygris which increases risk of GIB, however, stool and NG aspirate both guiac negative, there was no evidence for RP bleed or intracranial bleed.
Pt was maintained on PPI and active type and screen maintained.
Anemia thought to be secondary to renal failure.
Pt can follow up c his PCP regarding whether he will need to continue dexamethasone (this diagnosis is very recent and did not seem definite based on OSH records).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1)  Uro/pneumo sepsis 2) Ventilator acquired pneumonia 3) S/p tracheostomy and PEG tube placement   Discharge Condition: Stable for discharge to rehab.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU because you had a severe infection in your urine and in your lungs that caused your blood pressure to fall.
Because you had trouble breathing, we started you on a breathing machine.
Over the course of several days, your infection began to clear, your fevers improved, and your blood pressure returned to normal.
The following medication changes were made: (1)  Because of renal failure, we stopped your lasix.
As your renal failure begins to clear, this can be restarted.
(2) We stopped your glyburide because of your renal failure.
(3) We stopped your home dose of flomax because of your renal failure.
(4) We stopped your verapamil b/c of your renal failure.
(6) You should continue to take perphenazine 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] as at home; this can also be given PRN for agitation.
