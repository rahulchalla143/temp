History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of dCHF, severe CAD s/p CABG ([**2146**] and [**2156**]) LIMA->LAD, SVG->LPLB (posterior left ventricular branch), with numerous PCI's, most recently in [**2166**].
For the past 1-2 weeks, patient has had upper back pain which he describes as either sharp or pressure.
This pain was thought to be musculoskeletal.
He denied any other symptoms of orthopnea, PND, or LE edema, and lungs were clear at that time.
At baseline, he does not have LE edema, orthopnea, or PND.
Has had more of a cough recently.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of  bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Coronary artery disease as noted above.
Moderately severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis by echocardiography.
Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure with recent exacerbation on beta blocker and diuretic therapy.
History of ischemic bowel disease and subsequent urgent right hemicolectomy subsequent to his last coronary intervention.
Chronic anemia -requiring Epo.
- TIA - GERD - h/o UGI bleed (no NSAIDs aside from [**Month/Day/Year **]) - Glaucoma - Carotid stenosis: 60-69% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
- Myelodysplastic Syndrome s/p BMB in [**2167**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] - Chronic Renal Failure baseline Cr.
Family History: Had family hx of CAD  Physical Exam: VS: T=96.9 BP=124/54 HR=71 RR=15 O2 sat=  100% on 6L nc GENERAL: WDWN M in NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Harsh systolic murmur loudest at RUSB, and 4/6 systolic murmur at apex.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bilateral crackles halfway up the bases.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
2+ LE edema bilaterally.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
ECHO [**2171-9-2**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal [**Month/Day/Year 23115**] is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild regioanl LV systolic dsyfunciton with infero-lateral hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal [**Month/Day/Year 23115**].
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-2-22**], the LVEF appears slightly better (infero-lateral near akinesis was present on the prior study but not reported).
CXR [**9-6**]:  Interval decrease in extent of perihilar alveolar opacities consistent with improving edema.
Small right pleural effusion has also decreased in the interval.
Left retrocardiac opacity, presumably representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion, has not appreciably changed.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Tiny R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible inferior infarction.
Tiny R waves in the anterior leads consistent with possible prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
All micro date negative: Positive MRSA by nasal swab   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of dCHF, severe CAD s/p CABG who presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, associated with orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.
Patient treated for acute exacerbation of CHF, primarily through diuresis.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic congestive Heart Failure<br> Echo from [**2171-1-27**] showed normal systolic function with diastolic dysfunction.
# CORONARIES:  Patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs.
#  Acute on Chronic renal failure: Current Cr 1.7.
Likely [**12-31**] poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure.
Pt was orthostatic and dizzy at this time, now resolved and ambulating safely.
Would recommend following up with PCP and labs for complete resolution of renal failure, however he may have a new, higher baseline at this time.
#  Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia.
Followed by Heme as outpatient, for Epo injections.
Rectal exam showed no bleeding here.
# Diabetes type 2: Poorly controlled FS here with high FS at night and low in am.
Pt should follow diabetic diet.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 5277**] - [**Location (un) 745**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic exacerbation of diastolic congestive heart failure Mitral regurgitation Coronary Artery disease Acute Renal Failure  Discharge Condition: Medically stable.
BUN 90, creat 1.7,   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for chest pain and shortness of breath, and were found to be in a heart failure exacerbation, which means there was too much fluid in your heart and lungs.
You were given medications to remove the fluid with significant improvement of your breathing, and with resolution of your chest pain.
Blood tests and EKGs did not show you had a heart attack.
An echocardiogram performed during your hospitalization confirmed that your heart has an abnormal pumping function, and abnormal heart valves.
You will be discharged on medications to help your heart pump blood and prevent excessive fluid retention.
Because you have an weak heart, you should weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
