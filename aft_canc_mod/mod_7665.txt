OSH CXR: clear  EKG: NSR in the 90s, with PVCs, QTC 475. no ischemic changes  MRI head [**11-29**]: Corresponding to the hypodensity seen on CT, there is a subacute infarct involving the right occipital lobe.
It shows slow diffusion with increased T2/FLAIR signal.
There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
A small focus of abnormal susceptibility is seen in the right centrum semiovale, series 7, image 19 with no corresponding hyperintensity on the CT, likely represents old hemorrhage.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
No abnormal enhancement is seen.
The visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
Given the clinical diagnosis of leukemia the possibility of infarct secondary to thrombosis cannot be entirely excluded.
There is diffuse effacement of the right cerebral sulci and right lateral ventricle.
In addition, there is new trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right parietal region.
Midline structures are intact, with no current evidence of cerebral herniation.
Dense calcifications are noted in the bilateral cavernous carotid and vertebral arteries.
Minimal mucosal thickening is noted throughout the ethmoid air cells.
Mastoids are also underdeveloped, with partial fluid opacification on the left that may be increased from prior examination.
There is cartilaginous narrowing of the bilateral external auditory canals, with trace cerumen.
Multiple new right cerebral hypodensities.
Given the absence of tumor involvement on recent MR, this finding is most concerning for embolic infarcts.
New right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Partial mastoid opacification; please correlate clinically for mastoiditis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least moderate (2+) eccentric mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation now appears more prominent.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo M with hx of COPD, HTN, DM who presents with acute promyelocytic leukemia,  subsequently developed DIC resulting in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and respiratory failure requiring intubation and R MCA stroke resulting in left hemiparesis.
# Hypoxemia/Respiratory distress - Patient with SOB and cough x 4 days, fever, hypoxemia and CXR showing diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
Patient with acute leukemia and functional neutropenia.
Infectious etiologies initially high on the differential, including bacterial pneumonia, atypical bacterial pneumonia.
Viral and fungal infections less likely, but also considered.
Alveolar hemorrhage from low platelets also contributory as patient with hemoptysis.
Pulmonary edema lower on differential as exam is euvolemic and patient lungs without crackles.
Chest CT demonstrated multifocal infection (RLL and RML consolidation likely from aspiration) vs lung hemorrhage vs leukemic infiltration.
Bronchoscopy reveals diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and no micro-organisms.
Platelets transfused to >50 for alveolar hemorrhage.
He initially improved to satting in the mid- to high-90s on RA, but began to aspirate more, secondary to dysphagia from his CVA.
Desat was accompanied by altered mental status.
# APML - Diagnosis of APML was made on admission from bone marrow biopsy.
ECHO showed preserved LV function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Concern for coagulopathy/DIC given elevated INR to 1.7 and fibrinogen trending down from 220 to 188, but then trended up to the 300s.
Started allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
On [**12-2**], patient developed acute R MCA strokes.
Chemotherapy was initially held in the acute setting, but restarted after discussion regarding goals of care and possible curative effect.
# CVA - Mass seen on CT head and MRI on admission, thromboemobolic right occipital infarct, most likely secondary to DIC as complication of APML.
On [**12-2**], while intubated, patient with no movement on left side.
Neuro exam significant for lack of withdrawal to noxious stimuli on left and + Babinski on the left.
Stat CT head showed multiple new hypodensities throughout R centrum semiovale with diffuse hemispheric edema.
Patient could not receive antiplatelets or anticoagulation in the setting of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy from AML.
MRI/MRA of the brain showed acute right hemispheric predominantly deep watershed infarct without occlusion in right MCA.
He was noted to have anisocoria briefly, with head CT showing cerebral edema surrounding evolving infarcts.
He was briefly treated with mannitol, until CT head revealed edema to be stable.
# Neutropenic fever - Infection versus APML.
# Elevated troponins- Troponin elevatd to 0.20, stable.
No chest pain, no EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
Could be in the setting of tachycardia and demand ischemia.
# DM - Not on any home meds.
# Hypertension - Meds initially held as patient was hypotensive on propofol.
# Psych - H/o of Bipolar disorder.
# Inguinal hernia - Stable.
