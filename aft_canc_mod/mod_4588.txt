No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
CT head demonstrates left cerebellar mass measuring approximately 3 cm with mass effect on the fourth ventricle and mild dilatation of the temporal horns.
MRI shows this mass to be containing subacute hemorrhage.
CT angiography in correlation with cerebral angiography demonstrates early venous filling adjacent to the left vertebral artery in relation with the posterior arch of C1 indicating a fistula.
There is no distinct mass visualized in the partially seen upper cervical spine to explain the arteriovenous shunting.
No abnormal arteriovenous shunting identified in the region of left cerebellar mass.
The left cerebellar abnormality could be secondary to hemorrhage from the arteriovenous fistula.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of interpretation of this study on [**2126-11-10**] at 10 a.m.  Cerebral Angiogram [**2126-11-10**]: Possible AVM from the left vertebral artery with possible cavernoma.
No fractures or stenosis noted.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 83717**] is a 35 yo male with a 3 week history of equilibrium problems; an outside MRI showed a right cerebellar mass vs. bleed.
On [**11-10**] an cerebral angiogram was performed which showed a possible AV fistula from the left vertebral artery.
On [**2126-11-13**] the patient went to the OR for a posterior [**Last Name (un) **] craniotomy for evacuation of the hemorrhage and resection of possible cavernoma.
The patient had some difficulty with pain but it was significantly improved by [**2126-11-16**].
Methocarbamol 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO q4hr as needed for Muscle spasm.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, headache.
