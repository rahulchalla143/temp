He states that since this time he has had persistent nausea, though has been able to take pos, and continues to have fatigue, myalgias, subjective fevers, and shortness of breath, which necessitated increasing his home O2 requirement to 3L.
He notes that he has had a stuffy nose as well, but has not had purulent mucus production.
He does also report a frontal headache, but denies photophobia or neck stiffness.
He denies arthritis or a rash.
He notes that his wife has been sick with a viral illness recently.
Received 1gm Tylenol, oxycodone 5mg, Zofran, Percocet 2 tabs, ceftriaxone 1g, vancomycin 1g  Upon arrival to floor, patient notes that he continues to feel unwell with fatigue, myalgias, cough and mild shortness of breath.

ROS: Noteable for recurrent sharp chest pain, abd pain, chronic back pain.
Denies dysuria, change in bladder or bowel habits.
Has history of peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain that has not been characterized completely.
Chest x-ray revealed a right upper consolidation and fullness in the right hilum.
He received a course of antibiotics, but repeat x-ray on [**2161-2-26**] showed worsening of the right upper lobe infiltrate and persistence of the right hilar mass.
The presence of the mass confirmed on CT and PET scans.
In addition to the right hilar mass, there was radiographic evidence involving the bilateral hilar and right mediastinal lymph nodes.
Multiple nodules were seen on PET scan, although they were not FDG avid.
Endobronchial biopsy [**11-27**] revealed squamous cell carcinoma at least in situ with foci suspicious but not definitive for invasion.
Endobronchial biopsy of right upper lobe and four lymph nodes on [**2162-1-1**] revealed squamous cell carcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue.
During the workup for his non-small cell lung cancer, Mr. [**Known lastname 13440**] was found to have a vocal cord mass, although biopsy of this has been unsuccessful, but on [**2162-1-26**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] perform microlaryngoscopy and biopsy of the right true and false vocal cords and esophagoscopy.
Pathology revealed papillary squamous proliferative lesion, mild focally moderate dysplasia and squamous mucosa with epithelialhyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and mild dysplasia.
Flexible bronchoscopy on [**2162-2-11**] revealed occlusion n the right upper lobe bronchus by tumor and the previously placed stent was cannulated.
The mass caused obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus.
There were multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe with some of these nodules having central calcifications suggesting granuloma.
There was persistent mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the left lower paratracheal region with FDG uptake.
Large FDG avid lymph nodes at the right hilum formed conglomerate mass surrounding the right upper lobe bronchus with most of the lymph nodes increasing in FDG size and avidity.
In the abdomen, there were new FDG avid lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and mesenteric stations.

No evidence of new infiltrate  Blood Cultures-P  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 71 year old male with metastatic squamous lung ca s/p C3 carboplatin and paclitaxel who presented with hypoglycemic syncope and resolved respiratory symptoms off abx and on a reduced lantus dose.
# Hypoglycemic syncope / DM2 -  In the unit, she had a BS of 46 and was symptomatic, but no syncope, improved to 108. poor po intake.
sugars continued to drop due to evening lantus night prior and poor po intake.
Another differential is that the mediastinal mass could be stimulating the vagus nerve and causing vasovagal syncope, but have similiar prodromal symptoms, but blood sugars correlating to symptoms suggest former as etiology.
# Resolved respiratory symptoms / COPD - on baseline home O2 of 3L for COPD.
No significant change in cough.
No evidence of brain mets.
He just wants to have his pain controlled.
# FTT: Pt with decreased PO intake at home and appetite and insomnia, difficulty sleeping.
He reports all these symptoms improved so may have been secondary to chemo since appetite now better, TSH normal.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin .
# COPD/Tobacco abuse: COPD see above.
# Chronic back pain: Patient has home percocet and dilaudid.
