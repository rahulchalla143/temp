CC: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo M with hodgkins and non hodgkins lymphoma s/p chemoradiation, paroxysmal Afib with RVR who was admitted [**2130-6-12**] with fevers of unknown etiology, transferred to the ICU for Afib with RVR.
On the day of transfer he converted from sinus to Afib with RVR with rate in 150's, blood pressure 100-110 systolic, asymptomatic other than palpitations.
Of note he had low oxygen saturation in the 90's on admission which is lower than his baseline, unknown etiology, he denies any dyspnea.
He was also noted to have elevated LDH and lactate as well as swelling of his left leg greater than right for which he had CTA chest prior to transfer.
His hospital course during that admission was complicated by volume overload and Afib with RVR for which he was admitted to the ICU twice.
His RVR at that time was felt to be triggered by acute volume overload.
That evening he had a temperature to 100.2 for which he was advised to come to the ED for further evaluation.
He is without localizing symptoms other than nasal congestion.
He has been afebrile since admission, with unremarkable chest xray.
He has been treated with cefepime and levofloxacin to cover for bacterial cause for fever in the setting of recent chemotherapy.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma (diagnosed [**2121**], relapsed [**2126**] treated with AVBD c/b Afib w/RVR, bleomycin lung toxicity, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diagnosed [**2127**], treated w/rituxan in [**2128**]).
Hypertension 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
Oropharynx is moist without erythema, lesions or thrush.
NECK: Supple LUNGS: basilar crackles bilaterally, no wheezing HEART: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur audible throughout the precordium ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended, normal bowel sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly or other masses appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: With trace ankle edema.
Imaging: [**2130-6-14**] CTA Chest - preliminary read - No PE .
[**2130-6-13**] CXR - Borderline interstitial edema which cleared from [**6-4**] to [**6-12**] has recurred.
Mild azygous distention suggests volume overload.
Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Micro: [**2130-6-12**] Blood - pending   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old gentleman with relapsed Hodgkin's disease admitted with fever, transferred to the ICU for Afib with RVR.
No hypotension in response to IV dilt.
He has been prone to paroxysms of atrial fibrillation in the setting of chemotherapy, volume overload in the past.
BMT team concerned for possible pulmonary process such as PE as cause for acute afib given elevated lactate, LDH and hypoxia, however prelim report of CTA negative.
We spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] to help with rate control.
Had very short runs of AFib to the low 110s but this was not hemodynamically significant.
#Hypoxia - new asymptomatic hypoxia of unclear etiology with [**Name (NI) 85993**] of 52 on ABG on ICU admit in the setting of Afib with RVR.
BMT team concerned for pulmonary embolism given elevated lactate, new hypoxia and concern for L > R le swelling.
# Fever - patient is s/p ICE on [**2130-6-2**], last granulocyte count on [**6-9**] was 30, has been given neulasta in the meantime with WBC count up to 23.
No localizing symptoms or signs to indicate pneumonia or UTI.
Has been treated with cefepime for febrile neutropenia by the BMT service.
#Anemia - possibly due to recent chemotherapy with HCT down to 23 from 26 on admission.
No evidence of blood loss at this time however will monitor closely.
History of bleomycin toxicity.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Neutropenic fever Hypoxia secondary to volume overload  Discharge Condition: Stable  Followup Instructions: Pt is to follow up with oncology services and primary care physician within two weeks of discharge.
Pt instructed to notify physician or return to hospital if experiencing fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of consciousness, or heart palpations.
