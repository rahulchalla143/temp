Since that time, the patient reports having little to no appetite.
Over the past week, she has been unable to keep any food down and describes one episode of vomiting after attempting to eat.
Also endorses worsening of her abdominal pain recently, especially over the RLQ.
Pain is described as sharp and non-radiating.
Self-d/c'ed coumadin this past friday after she noticed that she was excessively bleeding following a small cut.
The patient reports N/V with eating as above, but otherwise denies CP, palp, SOB, diarrhea, fever or recent illness.
She was triggered for tachycardia and GI bleed.

Within these limits, note is made of bibasilar consolidation and moderate volume left perihepatic and perisplenic free fluid.
RUQ US ([**2165-8-8**]): Severely limited ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus.
No gross biliary dilatation or ascites identified.
CTA Chest ([**2165-8-9**]): The technical quality of the exam is severely limited and allows only for evaluation of the central pulmonary arteries, and the current CT does not reveal any evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
The lobar, segmental and subsegmental arteries could not be evaluated due to severe artifacts and technically limited CT exam.
Moderate cardiomegaly with enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
US left upper extremity ([**2165-8-12**]): No left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-11-5**], the abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload may be new but images are suboptimal for comparison.
Direct comparison of fibroid size from previous  ultrasound is not possible due to limited visualization.

# Bleeding - Patient presented with an INR >19 and bleeding from her mouth, rectum and vagina.
An upper endoscopy was preformed by GI which showed diffuse continuous atrophy of the mucosa with no bleeding noted in the stomach.
She subsequently had a CT Torso with PO contrast which showed no acute intrabdominal process but was limited by body habitus.
Her bleeding slowed down as her INR was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K.      After her Hct was stable and bleeding was controlled, she was transferred to the floor.
She continued to have vaginal bleeding despite a normal INR, although no further episodes of hematemesis or hemoptysis were noted during her time on the floor.
She was briefly placed on a heparin drip to observe for further evidence of bleeding, although this was stopped after she had some continued vaginal bleeding.
Her INR remained somewhat elevated in the 1-1.5 range despite being off Coumadin.
CTA did not show evidence for a PE in the central pulmonary arteries, although the report notes dilation of the pulmonary arteries.
The leading explaination for her bleeding and coagulopathy is a congestive hepatopathy as mentioned below.
At the time of discharge, her Hct has been stable and she has not had any further episodes of major bleeding.
Ob/gyn was consulted regarding the post-menopausal vaginal bleeding, they had recently performed a very technically challenging biopsy for the same issue which did not show evidence of malignancy, but was a limited sample.
A repeat transvaginal US was obtained during this admission which was unable to comment on uterine dimensions but again noted calcified fibroids, including a submucosal fibroid.
OB/Gyn consult did not recommend any further inpatient procedures but suggested that she will an MRI of her pelvis after the bleeding has stopped.
INR remained mildly elevated around 1.2-1.5 despite being off of Coumadin for many [**Known lastname **].
The coagulopathy was thought likely worsened by congestive hepatopathy.
# Abdominal Pain:  Patient complained of RLQ abdominal pain that had been present for a number of weeks prior to admission, worse with palpation.
CT abdomen was unrevealing for acute process, she was seen by surgery which did not feel this was an acute issue possibly related to calcified fibroids.
RUQ US was unremarkable, limited due to body habitus but showed normal caliber common bile duct.
Her pain waxed and waned during the admission, but at discharge she states it has improved since when she was admitted.
As discussed below, her abdominal pain is thought to also be related to a congestive hepatopathy with likely capsular stretch and possible ascites.
#Congestive hepatopathy - The unifying diagnosis that is believed to be causing the above issues, coagulopathy, bleeding and abdominal pain is congestive hepatopathy.
A TTE obtained prior to discharge showed evidence of elevated right-sided pressure with evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Congestive hepatopathy in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure would explain her coagulopathy and abdominal pain from stretching of the liver capsule.
# Afib: The patient has a h/o afib with RVR.
Beta blockade was initially held in the setting of her acute bleed.
We have informed her of the risk of stroke being off Coumadin and the fact that there is no suitable alternative given her continued vaginal bleeding.
[**Last Name (STitle) 9006**] were notified about the short term plan to hold coumadin until the bleeding has resolved but she will need to anti-coagulated again soon.
# Pneumonia:  Patient had a temperature of 99.9 in the setting of an elevated white count and sputum culture which grew E. coli.
She was treated with Levaquin for 8 [**Known lastname **] given her history of multiple antibiotic allergies.
# Elevated lactate: Her lactate was elevated to 3.3 on admission with the administration of fluids this corrected to 1.3 along with closure of her anion gap.
# Diastolic CHF and Right sided failure: The patient carries a diagnosis of diastolic CHF (EF 50-55% on TTE this admission).
BNP at admission was 2342, no other recent BNPs for comparison.
Transitional Care: -Has follow-up arranged with ob/gyn regarding fibroids and vaginal bleeding -Will need to have her metoprolol dose monitored, this was increased during her hospitalization -She has been discharged without anticoagulation for her AF, the issue of anti-coagulation will need to be re-addressed after her bleeding stops.
Dabigatran may be an option for anti-coagulation as she has been supratherapeutic with significant bleeding on warfarin.

You came in because you had bleeding from your rectum, vagina and mouth and were found to have a very high INR, which means that your blood was not able to clot properly.
You received blood products and vitamin K to correct the clotting problem and your bleeding improved.
There was still some vaginal bleeding which continued and you will follow-up with ob/gyn regarding this issue.
You are not currently on anticoagulation for your atrial fibrillation because you are still bleeding and are have an allergy to aspirin.
Your abdominal pain is believed to have been caused by your heart not pumping effectively, causing blood to back up into your liver.
This also explains why you had the clotting disorder mentioned above, since the liver is responsible for making many of your blood's clotting factors.
You were also found to have a pneumonia, which was treated with levofloxacin (Levaquin) for 8 [**Known lastname **].
The following changes have been made to your medications: CHANGE Metoprolol 100mg by mouth every 6 hours CHANGE Lasix to 20mg by mouth daily STOP Coumadin until your bleeding has stopped and you contact your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
