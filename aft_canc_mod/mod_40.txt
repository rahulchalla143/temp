Admission Date:  [**2149-6-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2149-6-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2081-3-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left lower lobe pneumococcal pneumonia, congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 68-year-old white male with a history of CAD status post three vessel CABG, EF less than 20%, mild COPD, hypertension, history of head and neck cancer, history of Hodgkin's disease, status post resection in [**2144**], in remission, who presents with left sided chest pain, worsening dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath and cough.
Roughly two months ago the patient was still able to walk about one mile without problems, however, in the last month he has started to notice increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
Three weeks ago he began coughing with fevers up to 101 and mild chills intermittently.
In the last two weeks he has also noted increased sneezing and severe non productive cough.
Two days ago he developed [**2158-1-26**] constant stabbing chest pain under the left breast, pleuritic in nature, worse with cough and unresponsive to Nitroglycerin.
His episodes of pain occur approximately one hour at a time and he does experience shortness of breath but no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or radiation.
He does not have a history of pneumonia.
Chest x-ray obtained in the AW showed mild failure and a retrocardiac opacity.
General, alert and oriented times three, pleasant, in mild respiratory distress with face mask on but talking in full sentences.
There is fullness of the neck but no lymphadenopathy.
Heart, normal S1 and normal S2, no S3, no murmurs or rubs.
Abdominal, obese, soft, nontender, non distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no CVA tenderness.
Extremities, 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally, trace bilateral pitting edema up to the knees.
Urinalysis, yellow, clear, specific gravity 1.014, no nitrites, no red blood cells, no white blood cells, no bacteria, no yeast.
Chest x-ray #1 perihilar edema bilaterally, #2 left retrocardiac opacity, effusion vs infiltrate.
EKG, sinus tachycardia with rate 108, normal axis, normal intervals, no acute ST-T wave abnormalities.
Possible CHF exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the MICU on a partial 15 liters of oxygen flowing through partial non rebreather mask.
He did not experience further hypotension for the rest of his admission.
All of his home medications were continued except for Carvedilol which was held as we were concerned for possible CHF exacerbation.
On day #2 of his admission the blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles positive for pneumococcus which was pansensitive.
Theory then to explain his acute and severe hypoxia was that his gas exchange was impaired by pneumococcal pneumonia and a transient bacteremia which may have dropped his SVR and caused him to temporarily decompensate from a cardiac standpoint.
This is in contrast to an echocardiogram done in [**2146**] which showed an anteroapical aneurysm in the LV and an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
On day #3 of his admission the sensitivities came back on the blood cultures, strain of strep pneumonia was sensitive to Penicillin and so the patient's regimen was switched to 2,000,000 units q 4 hours of Penicillin G.  The patient tolerated this well, showing no acute allergic reactions.
On day #3 of his admission a PT consult was obtained and Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was able to walk around the [**Hospital1 **] without any difficulty or desaturation.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease, status post three vessel CABG and silent MI.
Mild Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Advanced Hodgkin's disease status post resection in [**2144**].
