Brief Hospital Course: 36yo newly Dx'd ALL in [**8-13**], currently getting E2993 Tx, phase II day+26 admitted for SOB, orthopnea, n/v found to have heart failure with EF 15-20% with bilateral pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion, pancytopenic.
Heart [**Name (NI) 94059**] pt was admitted to the ICU and Dx'd with acute heart failure, which was thought to be due to Daunorubicin therapy in the past several months VS myocarditis/pericarditis.
She was tachycardic and HTN, had a CTA without PE or dissection and had a TTE showing EF of 15-20%, global hypokinesis of LV, hypokinesis of free wall of RV, and small pericardial effusion.
The pt then had a repeat echo the day after she developed some acute CP (see below) which showed an improvement in her EF to 30%, improvement in systolic fxn of both ventricles, no increase in pericardial effusion.
The pt will be d/c'd on her current HF regimen and will need to be reassessed, including her heart failure meds and repeat echo in the future.
Chest pain--Pt c/o substernal pleuritic type pain on admission, and had one acute episode of SOB and substernal chest pain on the floor, pleuritic in nature, for which an EKG was obtained which was significant for small voltage QRS complexes in V3-V6 (no ST changes), a CXR was obtained which showed continued pleural effusions, and cardiac enzymes were drawn.
Pt was not given any ASA during the admission due to low platelet count.
Several EKG's were recorded through her admission, all without ST changes, and CE's were trended through admission.
CKMB's where flat, however there was a small increase in her Troponins ranging from 0.09 to 0.17.
This small increase was thought to be due to either demand ischemia or to a possible myo/pericarditis picture, for which Cards recommended doing an oupt cardiac MR in the future is still clinically warranted.
[**Name (NI) 94060**] pt had crackles on PE, was requiring O2 via NC, and had CXR showing pleural effusions.
She was started on her home asthma regimen and occasionally given prn Xopenx nebs, Alubterol being avoided due to tachycardia at the time.
She was weaned off the O2 as her HF resolved and by time of d/c was satting well on room air, not tachypneic, not having difficulty breathing.
[**Name (NI) 94061**] pt was neutropenic on admission and started on empiric Cefipime, despite being afebrile.
The pt never spiked a fever through admission and Cefipime was discontinued.
[**Name (NI) 94062**] pt was anemic but felt to be at baseline.
[**Name (NI) 94063**] pt was thrombocytopenic with plts 21 on admission and received 5U plts during admission, with minimal response.
It was felt that the pt had many platelet antibodies as a result of a long platelet transfusion history and considering that she was being followed for future transplantation, that further platelet transfusions would increase her antibodies and make transplantation more difficult.
She had no clinical evidence of bleeding, her Hct remained stable, and her tachycardia trended down as her volume overload and heart failure resolved.
Pericardial effusion--There was some concern for a hemorrhagic pericarditis, with a small pericardial effusion seen on echo and her platelets being low and low voltage QRS complexes seen on an EKG once.
She did not have a rub or pulsus paradoxus on PE.
[**Name (NI) 94064**] pt was complaining of a headache on admission that she said was consistent with what she described as a history of migraines, however she did not have phonophobia, photophobia, or an aura.
She was started on her home dose of Ultram and she refused any narcotic pain meds.
She occasionally c/o this h/a during admission but they spontaneously resolved without any complications with conservative Ultram management.

You had a repeat ultrasound of your heart which showed some improvement.
