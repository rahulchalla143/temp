The patient has a history of depression which her husband, [**Name (NI) **], reports has been exacerbated lately by several stressful situations including her chronic back pain, finances, etc.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS:  123   113/29   27   100% The patient was noted to have 150cc dark coffee ground output from her OGT, but stool was guiac negative.
She was empirically treated with Vanc/Levo/Flagyl and CT torso was obtained, which showed no evidence of infection or acute bleed.
Renal was consulted as the patient had a poor UOP and was acidotic, and CVVH vs hemodialysis was discussed.
The patient was given Calcium gluconate 2gm, Bicarb gtt @150cc/hr, and was prepared for possible CVVH tomorrow.
Past Medical History: - Alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS placement [**1-/2118**] (per GI OSH neg hepatitis serology, had pos Anti-SMA but neg [**Doctor First Name **]) - h/o GIB [**11/2117**] s/p banding of esophageal varices - h/o myomectomy   Social History: - Tobacco:  Has not smoked since her 20s.
Physical Exam: Admission physical exam VS:   98.9   126 -> 110   139/55 -> 92/49   24  99% GEN: Intubated, NAD HEENT: Pupils small (<1mm) but equal and reactive to light, sclear anicteric, MMM, no jvd, intubated with ETT in place CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1/S2, GII holosystolic murmer at LSB, S3 heard best at LSB RESP: CTAB anteriorly and laterally with with good air movement throughout, no wheezes/rales/rhonchi ABD: Soft, mild abdominal distension without appreciable fluid wave, diffuse tenderness to palpation in RUQ and LUQ without rebound or guarding but with grimacing on exam.
Diffuse symmetric thickening of the wall of the gallbladder, likely related to chronic liver disease.
Other forms of more advanced liver disease such as fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
The right posterior portal vein is not visualized due to breathing artifact - [**6-15**] fluid study: negative for malignancy - [**6-22**]: Flexsig no active bleeding - [**6-23**]: endoscopy: no active bleeding - [**6-25**]: CT abdomen: 15-cm left anterior abdominal/pelvic wall hematoma and correlation with trauma or intervention is suggested.
No free intraperitoneal air with extensive ascites and cirrhotic liver as before.
Unchanged multiple vertebral body compression fractures - [**6-26**]: GIB study: No active GI bleeding during the imaged time period - [**2119-6-27**] EGD no active bleeding - [**2119-7-4**] CT ab/pelv LLQ abdominal wall hematoma - [**2119-7-4**] Colonoscopy no active bleeding - [**2119-7-5**] Paracentesis 2+PMNs, no microorg.
- [**2119-7-6**] Paracentesis 2+PMNs, no microorg.
- [**7-8**] CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, edema and lower lobe atelectasis/pneumonia - [**7-9**] CXR: Minimal improvement of pulmonary edema which is still severe - [**2119-7-12**] paracentesis - [**2119-7-12**] ucx 10-100,000 VRE - [**2119-7-11**] UA few bac, 19 RBC, 9 WBC   Brief Hospital Course: 55yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**1-/2118**] found down by her husband and admitted to MICU with GIB and resp failure.
Abdominal wall hematoma: pt began to complain of pain at site of what was originally though to be a ventral hernia in LLQ.
the abd protrusion was palpated and had crepitus and could be reduced, so no action was taken and mass was thought to be a hernia at that time.
pt felt diarrhea had improved this day.
Creatinine was elevated to 2.1 and this thought to be [**1-18**] poor renal perfusion.
Renal u/s was negative for obstruction.
It developed a bluish appearance - surgery was consulted and pt sent for non con CT which showed a hematoma.
2. post-operative course: Patient was taken for evacuation of hematoma on [**2119-7-5**] and [**7-6**] with intraop 2L paracentesis.
Patient transfused 2u PRBC's for Hct 25 in setting of active bleeding.
JP putting out sanguineous fluid, Hct decreasing.
Pain control adequate.
Pt later became acutely dyspneic with desaturation to high 70s.
CXR was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
Remained persistently tachycardic throughout.
She complained of shortness of breath during the day when she was sitting but also had a component of anxiety.
Differential was initially anoxic brain injury vs. hepatic encephalopathy vs. delerium vs. withdrawal.
Lactulose was provided and an MRI brain revealed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.
Given the prominence of the patient's confabulations and the absence of memory loss, it was suspected by neurology that the patient was suffering from Korsakoff's amnesia.
GIB: Patient with coffee grounds out of NG tube on admission and noted to have bright red blood coming from NG tube during first several days of admission.
Liver was consulted, and felt since imaging showed patent TIPS that UGIB from portal HTN was unlikely.
Pt was eventually scoped which showed 2cm non-bleeding ulcer with clot overlying and she was given an NG tube holiday to prevent irritation and allow healing.
Also showed mild portal gastropathy.
The patient had undergone a sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for ?ischemic colitis the day prior without a bleeding source noted.
On the AM of [**6-23**] she underwent an endoscopy also without evidence of a bleeding source.
The patient was transfused with appropriate HCT response and remained stable without BRBPR afterward.
Of note, after weaned from pressors and stabilized, necessitated diuresis for volume overload/pulmonary edema.
Renal failure: Felt to be ATN due to hypotension vs HRS vs mild rhabdomyolysis given mildly elevated CK's.
Alcoholic Cirrhosis s/p TIPS:  Patient with US in the ED showing patent TIPS.
No further issues.
8. glucagon (human recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
9. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for itching.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hepatobiliary service at [**Hospital1 18**] after evacuation of your abdominal wall hematoma.
You have 2 JP drains in what used to be the hematoma cavity, which have put out serosanguinous and ascites fluid.
