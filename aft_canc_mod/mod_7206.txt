An x-ray performed at her nursing home showed a right intratrochanteric fracture.
The patient denies hitting her head, denies loss of consciousness, chest pain, dyspnea or lightheadedness.
The patient ambulates with a walker and has a history of recurrent falls.
She was seen at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for a laceration of her left hand, which was glued with skin glue, and a dressing was applied.
The patient had a recent admission [**11-17**] for left lacrimal gland abscess/cellulits and currently on ceftin.
Past Medical History: l.   CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG 2.
h/o MRSA UTI   Social History: Social History:  The patient lives at [**Hospital6 459**].

Pertinent Imaging: CXR ([**2154-12-31**]): Impression: Findings consistent with fluid overload including pulmonary vascular engorgement and small left pleural effusion.
R hip x-ray ([**2154-12-31**]): Impression: Intertrochanteric fracture, with minimal distraction and varus angulation.
R Knee x-ray ([**2154-12-31**]): Impression: No evidence of fracture about the knee.
These demonstrate successive steps of open reduction and internal fixation of an intertrochanteric fracture.
She did well through surgery with no complications.
POD 1 she had substantial pain with movement.
She was written for standing pain control with tylenol 1000mg PO Q8AM, 2PM, and 10PM and oxycodone 2.5mg PO Q8AM, 2PM, and 10PM; with PRN for breakthrough and "anticipated pain events" (such as PT).
Her pain became well controlled and she had no confusion on the regimen.
Hyponatremia: Patient is hyponatremic at baseline and requires fluid restriction at rehab.
She has h/o breast cancer and h/o leukemia per family.
There was some evidence of volume overload prior to surgery, however she now does not require oxygen and appears euvolemic.
Urinary Frequency: Had UTI prior to admit.
Osteoporosis: Per Xrays, fracture appears to be osteoporotic in nature (not pathologic, as this would be a concern in the setting of hx of breast cancer).
Outpatient PCP should have risk/benefit discussion regarding increased risk of falls and these medications.
Family also mentions that she refuses to wear incontinence products and has urinary frequency symptoms.
No symptoms this admission.
H/O breast cancer with sternal lump: Defer to PCP to address as outpatient.
DNR/DNI MICU COURSE  - Admitted [**12-31**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after fall, with non-displaced intertrochanteric fracture and left hand laceration - Had mildly elevated troponin (<0.1) on admission - [**1-1**] had ORIF right hip by orthopedics - [**1-3**] CXR demonstrated left retrocardiac opacity, also with increasing fever curve; levofloxacin started - [**1-6**] developed abdominal pain and distention; KUB suggested volvulus, but barium study demonstrated freely passing contrast; GI consulted.
Mildly hypotensive overnight [**Date range (1) 11104**], resolved with fluid.
Several episodes of diarrhea.
ABG 7.51/34/71 with lactate 1.1 - [**1-8**] R SFA occlusion noted on CT scan; vascular surgery consulted and recommended no intervention.
Renal team consulted for hyponatremia and increasing creatinine (increased 0.8 to 1.2) thought secondary to hypovolemia - [**1-9**] creatinine increased to 2.0, sodium decreased from 125 to 120; ABG checked 7.48/21/118 with lactate 8.4, anion gap 16.
On [**1-9**], she was transferred to the MICU for altered mental status, at which time a lactate was checked and was found to be 8.4.
Her clinical exam changed; she developed rebound tenderness.
Surgery was consulted; the patient and the family did not wish to pursue surgery, and no invasive procedures (e.g.
