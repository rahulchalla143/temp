On [**2140-7-27**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] spoke with the patient and discussed the possibility of having her brain tumors resected.
She was seen by Neurology/Oncology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], who also recommended the resection of her brain tumor and then most likely starting radiation after the surgery.
On [**2140-7-28**], the patient did have craniotomy and had the metastatic tumor removed.
She was continued on Decadron and neurologic checks and remained in the recovery room overnight for monitoring.
On [**2140-7-29**], the patient was seen by thoracic surgery for a lung lesion that was 3.3 by 4.2 centimeters in the superior segment of the left lower lung and basically recommended to wait for her pathology results and that she follow-up in the thoracic oncology center  She was also seen by the hematology/oncology service who felt that most likely her cancer represents a metastatic lung cancer.
Based on her CT scan, the patient would have a Stage IV (T2, NO M1) lung cancer if the pathology returns as a NFVLV.
During the day of the [**2140-7-30**], the patient did complain of a headache that was not relieved by her Percocet.
At that point, we did decide to do a head CT which showed no new blood, continuing edema that was not worse than the magnetic resonance scan that was done on [**2140-7-29**], which also showed extensive edema and some enhancement around the border of the previous sites of the brain tumors.
She remained neurologically intact overnight and did better with some increased pain medication.
She also needs to call the thoracic oncology service and she was given both telephone numbers for her appointments.
She will return on [**2140-8-5**], to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Five to have her staples removed between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.  She should have no strenuous activity.
She should return if her headache becomes worse and is not relieved with pain medication or if she develops any vomiting or fevers.
