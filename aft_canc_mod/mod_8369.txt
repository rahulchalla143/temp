Admission Date:  [**2147-6-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-11-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plavix / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Fever, tachypnea, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 69 y/o F w/ a h/o respiratory failure s/p trach placement and revision [**5-/2147**], pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, recently discharged [**2147-6-16**] for hemoptysis, trach stenosis, VAP and sepsis who was referred to ED intensivist at [**Hospital **] rehab, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 83106**], for tachypnea, tachycardia to the 140s, minute ventilation of 16, pancytopenia(unchanged from recent hospitalization), and non-gap acidosis.
Patient has remained febrile, presumed secondary to medication reaction (see below).
Also noted that she had a modest amt of hemoptysis (thin, frothy).
Recent admission [**Date range (3) 102692**] for hemoptysis, inability to ventilate, VAP, and septic shock.
Septic shock presumably secondary to VAP and was treated with levophed, IVF, cefepime, and tobramycin (colonized with MDR pseudomonas and initially treated with cefepime but isolated again from sputum now resistent to cefepime).
Patient then became volume overloaded following fluid resuscitation but responded well to diuresis.
However, patient had creatinine elevation prior to discharge thought to be due to Tobramycin, which was discontinued.
Patient found to have 80% stenosis of trach tube with granulation tissue.
Patient required mechanical ventilation throughout hospitalization with periods of apnea and presumed to have muscle weakness potentially from central process due to h/o CVAs.
Hospitalization complicated by persistent low grade fevers despite appropriate antibiotics thought to be most likely medication related rather than infectious(INH, ethambutol most likely).
Also complicated by chronic pancytopenia secondary to MDS and chronic hemolysis from frequent blood transfusions.
She was volume resuscitated with 7L NS but remained persistently hypotensive so Levophed started with SBPs to 90s.
Patient remained tachypneic breathing over vent.
However, a repeat CXR following volume resuscitation showed blossoming consolidation in R lung.

Physical Exam: T: 99.6 BP: 100/52 HR: 115 RR: 30 O2 100% on 0.5 FiO2, AC 400x26, PEEP 5 Gen: intubated, sedated, responsive to pain HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive.
No JVD CV: regular.
FINDINGS: Compared to prior examination, there is again evidence of prior right frontal lobe infarct with cortical gyriform calcifications.
There is also a focal hypodense lesion seen in the region of the right internal capsule, which may represent prior lacunar infarct.
There are prominent sulci and ventricles with parenchymal volume loss.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or new areas of infarction.
There is moderate mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinus on the left side.
There is minimal mucosal thickening of the left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage or new areas of infarction.
[**2147-6-23**] MRI HEAD: FINDINGS:  There is an area of encephalomalacia seen in the right frontal lobe with areas of low signal on susceptibility images indicative of chronic blood products.
In this irregular area of encephalomalacia there is a irregular area of high signal on diffusion images with low signal on ADC map indicating slow diffusion.
Given the presence of chronic blood product slow diffusion is most likely related to the blood products.
This is unlikely to represent acute ischemia in this location given the appearance.
Also in absence of vasogenic edema and presence of encephalomalacia an abscess within this location also appears less likely.
There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and changes of small vessel disease are seen.
Coronal images through the temporal lobe demonstrate medial temporal atrophy without evidence of intrinsic signal abnormalities within the hippocampal regions.
IMPRESSION:  Large area of encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe extending to inferior frontal lobe region which could be related to prior trauma or ischemia.
Irregular area of chronic blood product is seen in this region which demonstrate slow diffusion and which most likely is secondary to chronic blood products.
However if patient's condition permit, gadolinium.
Soft tissue changes, left mastoid air cells.
No acute infarct is identified.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.
There were no prominent focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features.
There were no repetitive discharges or electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
However, this continues to be an abnormal bedside EEG due to the presence of a slow, disorganized, and poorly modulated background rhythm consistent with a severe encephalopathy.
Medications, infection, metabolic disturbances, and anoxia are among the most common causes but there are others.
No electrographic seizures were noted on this recording.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICAL ICU COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU from the ED with acute renal failure and evidence of worsening pneumonia and sepsis, recently discharged [**2147-6-16**] after a hospital stay treating hemoptysis, trach stenosis, VAP and sepsis.
Sepsis: Her sepsis was presumed secondary to pneumonia seen on CXR.
Initally her hypotension was unresponsive to aggressive volume resuscitation in ED requiring pressors; however, pressures stablized in ICU.
Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**].
For the new PNA and sepsis, the patient was initially administered vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem for broad coverage with day 1 of therapy [**6-18**].
This admission her renal failure was thought to be due to ATN given her history of hypotension, noting a possible contribution of Tobramycin to renal failure; the benefits of tobramycin in treating infection were felt to be greater than their contribution to her renal failure.
# Respiratory failure: She was tachypneic on admission and has chronic respiratory failure s/p trach placement.
ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with concomitant metabolic acidosis, which could be primary non-gap acidosis due renal failure or respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis due to sepsis with baseline chronic respiratory alkalosis due to increased central drive (bicarbonate less than expected for acute, but bicarbonate values perhaps consistent with chronic pC02 drop).
Upon discharge her respiratory status was ventilatory dependent and stable.
Thigh bleeding was noted on exam in the region of a femoral line, which was removed secondary to question of possible art stick initially.
Retroperitoneal bleed was ruled on imaging.
# Altered Mental Status:   Her GCS was 9 upon discharge (nonverbal, withdraws to pain, eyes open).
Per her family, the patient had decreased alertness and orientation during this admission.
Anoxic brain injury was suspected given recent history of hypotension/hypoventilation.
A CT head showed no interval change, old R frontal stroke.
# Fever: No leukocytosis or left shift was noted during stay but has h/o pancytopenia.
Sputum cultures grew culture PSEUDOMONAS, SENSITIVE to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, resistant to meropenum.
# Tachycardia: HR was systolically in 170s on admission and had appearance of sinus tach on EKG though it was doubtfully sinus given patient's age and level of tachycardia.
Tachycardia was likely secondary to hypotension and a PE was unlikely as oxygenating well.
# Disseminated TB: Pan sensitive TB with liver and spleen granulomas on INH, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide since 2/[**2146**].
Recently ruled out for active TB w/ 3 negative sputums last admission [**5-27**].
No respiratory precautions were observed given negative sputum x 3 for TB.
# Pancytopenia: She has a h/o MDS seen on bone marrow biopsy with borderline transformation to AML.
However, no blasts on peripheral smear during recent admission to raise concern for progression.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Reasonable BG control currently.
# h/o CVA: h/o R ICA with residual L arm/hand hemiparesis and aphasia.
Neuro exam cannot be assessed secondary to patient's clincial status.
CT head and MRI during this admission showed no new CVA.
# Asthma: No evidence of obstruction on ABG in ED.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was held given mild LFT elevation.
# PPx: - No heparin give h/o +HIT.
# ACCESS: PICC.
