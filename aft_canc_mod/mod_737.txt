Admission Date:  [**2177-2-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-8-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Demerol / Unasyn / Cephalosporins / Levaquin / Moexipril / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11304**] Chief Complaint: Bilateral renal masses  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bilateral laparoscopic radical nephrectomies, ex-lap and evacuation of hematoma   History of Present Illness: 29yF with ESRD secondary to SLE s/p failed renal transplant in [**2174**] now with bilateral renal masses noted on MRI.
The least morbid and most efficient approach was considered laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomies.
SLE diagnosed [**2166**] complicated by lupus/nephritis, anemia, serositis and ascites 2.
End stage renal disease secondary to lupus, HD T/Th/Sat 3.
History of VSD s/p corrective surgery, age 13 4.
Hypertension 5.
Sickle cell trait 8. s/p left oophorectomy related to IUD associated infection 9.
Restrictve lung disease noted on PFTs [**2166**].
In [**2173**], chest CT with diffuse ground glass opacities.
GERD 11. s/p cadaveric renal transplant on [**8-/2175**] complicated by rejection and capsule rupture 11/[**2174**].
Right pelvic abscess s/p TAH/RSO 13.
There were no intraoperative complications.
The patient's post-operative course was complicated by post-op bleeding noted as increased abdominal pain and falling hematocrit on POD 2.
She was started on vancomycin for elevated temps.
The patient was found to have a coagulopathy and aggressive resuscitation was started.
Bilateral retroperitoneal hematomas with some active extravasation on the left and the patient is status post bilateral nephrectomy.
Free intraperitoneal air status postop.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Several cystic areas in the pancreas which measure 1-2 mm which may represent IPMT.
She contineud to have a significant requirement for PRBC's (9 units total at this point), platelets, and cryo.
Due to difficulties in peripheral access a right femoral line was placed.
An ECHO was obtained on POD #5 which revelaed a Linear mitral annular echodensity and mitral regure, which was seen on a previos echo.
The renal team followed the patient regarding her dialysis and electrolyte control.
-On POD #9 the patient had a large requirement in her pain medications and developed severe increasing abdominal pain.
She also had increased bleeding around her incision.
Marked interval increase in size of right retroperitoneal hematoma in the nephrectomy bed.
Given the relative high attenuation of this collection, the degree of short-term increase in size, and the presence of a small hyperenhancing focus, active extravasation cannot be excluded.
There was a small hematoma on the left retroperitoneum, which was also controlled in a similar fashion.
There were several mesenteric hematomas both in the small and large bowel, but all of the colon and small bowel itself was viable.
Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18846**] operative note for further details.
She was continued on dialysis and her pain was controlled with a PCA.
A chronic pain service consult was requested who started her on a PO pain regimen on [**2177-2-19**].
Her pain was controlled with PO meds, she was tolerating a regular renal diet, and her CVL was d/c's on [**2177-2-20**].
Over the weekend on [**4-23**] the patient did extremely well - she was able to ambulate, her pain was controlled on PO meds, and she was tolerating a regular diet.
On [**2-24**] the patient developed increasing left abdominal pain and her HCT dropped 4 points.
Post-surgical changes in both nephrectomy beds with fibrin net placement.
Slight increase in size of fluid collection in left nephrectomy site.
High-density internal areas likely represent residual clot.
The collection is lower in Hounsfield units than on the prior study and is likely due to combination of hematoma and fluid.
The patient continued to do well, tolerating her renal diet, ambulating, and her pain controlled on PO medications.
-Due to some increase in abdominal pain on [**3-1**], a CT repeat CT was obtained which revelaed postsurgical changes in both nephrectomy beds with bilateral hematomas in evolution, which have not significantly changed in size compared to 4 days prior but are smaller and liquifying compared to [**2-13**].
The CXR showed: Slight improvement in fluid balance with persistent bilateral patchy opacities in lung bases, suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration.
Underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension as previously noted.
The pulmonoly team was asked for advice on treatment of the consolidation and PA HTN, and recommended no Abx at this time due to the fact the the patient has no clinical symptoms of a pneumonia, she has been afebrile, and has a normal WBC.
Her labs were stable and she had no further complaints.
She is being discharged in stable condition, tolerating a regular renal diet, pain control on PO meds, ambulating well, with stable HCT's, WBC's, and a benign abdominal exam.
if fever > 101.5, nausea, vomiting, increasing abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, difficulty urinating, , noted bleeding, dizziness, or any other concerns.
Activity as tolerated except no heavy lifting or strenuous activity.
A VNA will visit you for the first week to assess your wound and make sure you are not having any problems.
Call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 513**] to schedule an appointment in [**12-10**] weeks for followup of pulmonary hypertension.
