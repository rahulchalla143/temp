No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= XX %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo man with a complicated PMH including Afib on coumadin, prior strokes, vasculopathy (s/p right CEA, CABG, AAA), malignancy (prostate cancer s/p resection and XRT, cholangiocarcinoma s/p biliary stent with possible metastatic disease, as well as colonic mass path pending), hypothyroidism, now off coumadin since [**2-27**] after a recent GIB with a Hct of 20 in the setting of significantly supratherapeutic INR ~8, who presents today with 5 discrete episodes of a non-fluent aphasia with reported return to baseline between events.
His INR at the outside hospital was subtherapeutic this afternoon at 1.8 and he was somewhat hypotensive there.
General exam reveals a systolic ejection murmur and bilateral lower extremity edema.
Neurological exam including language was normal, with the exception of slight right NLFF.
His MRI did not show any evidence of stroke.
His MRA showed mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease with probable ulcerated plaque at the left internal carotid origin.
The neurology resident witnessed a few of these episodes which were preceded by tachycardia on telemetry, otherwise no aura, characterized by abrupt onset of expressive aphasia during which he could only stutter syllables but no words, though comprehension was intact, vital signs normal, and remainder of neurological examination normal.
He proceded to have a cluster of at least five of these within a few hours, which were all stereotyped, and so after speaking to his [**Hospital3 **] Gastroenterologist who felt that his bloody bowel mvts were most likely related to hemorrhoids rather then the hepatic flexure polyp, we decided that the risk-benefit ration was in favor of anticoagulation for these presumed TIAs in the context of his vasculopathy to prevent stroke and so we started him on a Heparin drip with goal INR 50-70.
We also ordered a bedside video-EEG to r/o seizures and no further episodes of aphasia occurred with normal background.
He had some mild BRPBR but vital signs were stable and Hct was slowly trending downward.
He developed fluid overload and was transferred to the cardiology floor for diuresis prior to GI surgery, which was acheived with IV lasix.
ECHO showed severe aortic stenosis with moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, mild focal LV systolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and massive biatrial enlargement.
He was fluid resuscitated for hypotension and low urine outbut and was continued on lopressor IV for heart rate control.
On post op day 2 ([**3-21**]), he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea.
It was decided to electively re-intubate him for management of his respiratory distress.
On POD 5 ([**3-24**]) he was tachypneic with increased work of breathing and was reintubated the morning of [**3-25**] for respiratory distress.
His chest xray showed some increasing right pleural effusion.
On POD 8 ([**3-27**]), the ICU team performed a thoracentesis of his R pleural effusion with 800cc withdrawn.
Cardiology again saw the patient for occasional episodes of SVT and the patient was continued on lopressor and diuresis as tolerated.
His ventilatory settings were weaned down and he was able to tolerate trach collar on [**4-1**] for a short time.
He was found to be Cdiff positive again on [**4-5**] and was started on flagyl and oral vancomycin.
He was followed for some mild erythema around his abdominal incision which improved and remained stable.
Metoprolol Tartrate 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Five (5) mg Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for SVT (HR > 120).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78040**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed respiratory failure malnutrition   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 11471**] office or return to the emergency room for any increased abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, fever >101.5F, increased redness or drainage from the incision, difficulty breathing, chest pain or anything else that concerns you.
