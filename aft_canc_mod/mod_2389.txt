Admission Date:  [**2161-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-1-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: adhesive bandage / Benzoin / Mastisol Stertip / Compazine / gabapentin / Neurontin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53 year old male with history of gastric bypass and multiple other abdominal surgeries [**2-11**] nesidioblastosis including pancreatectomy, splenectomy, gastrectomy and thoracotomy, chronic TPN with indwelling PICC lines, cachexia, multiple admissions to the intensive care units for PICC line sepsis, and a recent fall from bed complicated by rib fractures and hemothorax, which required chest tube drainage and VATS/decortication for reaccumulation/loculation returns again with fall from bed.
He reports onset of 10 out of 10 sharp, pleuritic, left-sided chest pain subsequent to the fall.
Patient noted that he did strike the left side of his face, left shoulder and elbow with subsequent pain and decreased range of motion, left hip, left knee, and left ankle.
Thr patient's ROS is positive for shortness of breath at rest, cough, nausea.
He denies V/D, seizure activity, neck pain, focal numbness or tingling, dysuria, no abdominal pain, palpitations, lower back pain, GI incontinence, or GU retention.
He reports that the chest pain is similar to the pain that the patient has had previously in the setting of a hemopneumothorax from a fall with multiple rib fractures.
Exam was significant for  superficial abrasion to nasal bridge with no septal hematoma, pain with active and passive ROM over L shoulder/elbow/hip/knee/ankle and normal neuro exam.
L shoulder/elbow/hip films and CT sinus showed no evidence of fracture.

Family History: Significant for CAD in his father and a sister w/ SLE   Physical Exam: Discharge PE: Vitals: 97.4 115/80 61 18 95%RA General: Thin man in NAD HEENT: MMM CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: good air movement, clear b/l Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: grossly intact, has some dyskinesia noted previously.
IMAGING: TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST [**2161-11-8**]:  The lungs are low in volume and show a new or substantially worsening heterogenous right upper lobe opacification and progression of similart left upper lobe abnormality.
Mediastinal fullness in the right lower paratracheal region and bilateral hilar enlargement have progressed since [**10-4**].
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Progressive bilateral pneumonia and concurrent cardiac decompensation.
TECHNIQUE: Volumetric, multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast.
FINDINGS: Since the prior chest CT of [**2161-9-30**], a left hemothorax with loculated pneumothorax component has improved, with resolution of blood contents and air contents.
A residual small, dependent left pleural effusion remains, with simple fluid-attenuation characteristics.
A small right pleural effusion is also present and has slightly increased in size since the prior study.
Within the lungs, preexisting areas of atelectasis in the left lower lobe adjacent to the pleural effusion have improved, but extensive peribronchovascular consolidation, more centrally in the left lower lobe is new.
Central consolidation in the left upper lobe and lingula has progressed, and centrally distributed perihilar consolidation in the right upper lobe is mostly new.
Basilar-predominant smoothly thickened interlobular septa have increased since the prior study.
Scattered peribronchiolar opacities in superior segment right lower lobe are slightly improved compared to the prior exam, and an area of opacity in the right middle lobe on the prior exam has resolved.
Although, the airways are patent, note is made of mild narrowing and irregularity of the lingular bronchus which in retrospect was present on the prior study as well.
There is likely bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy present, difficult to measure in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Heart size is normal, and diffuse coronary artery calcifications are present.
Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but note is made of postoperative changes in the upper abdomen and a persistent 4.2-cm diameter fluid-density structure adjacent to the mid pole portion of the left kidney, roughly similar in appearance to prior abdominal CT scan, but incompletely imaged on this chest CT exam.
Healing lower left rib fractures are present at the costovertebral junctions and possibly also at the L1 vertebral body level.
The thoracic fractures are at the T7 through T12 levels.
Multifocal consolidations in both lungs, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Coexisting pulmonary edema is likely, particularly in the setting of smooth interlobular septal thickening with basilar predominance.
Irregular narrowing of lingular bronchus, raising the possibility of intrinsic stenosis or extrinsic compression.
Followup CT scan in 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy may be helpful to document resolution of the pneumonia and to revaluate the lingular bronchus.
Improved left pleural effusion with residual small, simple effusion remaining.
Slight increase in small right pleural effusion.
CXR: [**11-12**]: Marked improvement of pulmonary infiltrates during the last two days examination interval.
Remaining changes resemble those that existed previously when patient was treated for trauma and hemothorax.
The rather extensive parenchymal infiltrates were identified on chest examinations of [**2161-11-8**], [**2161-11-9**], and [**2161-11-10**] and also documented on chest CT of [**2161-11-9**].

Sepsis: The patient was admitted with sepsis requiring IV antibiotics and 12 hours of pressors in the ICU.
He improved markedly, with stable vitals and no O2 requirement by the time he was transferred, approximately 24 hours after admission.
It was felt that the most likely source was pneumonia seen on CT.  A repeat CXR several days after admission showed marked improvement in infiltrates seen initially.
After an infectious disease consult, it was decided to narrow antibiotics to 7d of levofloxacin, and he was discharged after remaining afebrile for 24 hours on PO levo and flagyl.
The flagyl was added after stool was positive for C. Diff, though the patient was not having loose stool or signs of megacolon.
# Antibiotics: Will complete 7d course of levofloxacin, and 14 day course of flagyl for pna and c diff colitis respectively.
# F/u CT: A CT scan done this admission suggested a follow-up scan in ~1 month to assess for interval change.
# Psychosocial issues:  The patient has had a marked decline in nutrition and weight over the past year.
It is very possible that underlying his extensive medical disease is an eating disorder.

It is likely you had a pneumonia, and a c diff infection (a bacteria in the bowels, that usually happens when people are treated with multiple antibiotics).
