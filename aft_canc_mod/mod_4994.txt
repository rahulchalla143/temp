There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Very large mass (8 x 5cm) in the right ventricle, extending from the apex and almost filling the entire ventricle.
There is only a small amount of residual right ventricular cavity present.
There is a moderate to lareg pericardial effusion, seen mostly over the right ventricular apex with evidence of near-tamponade physiology.
There is comparatively little fluid over the right ventricular free wall.
Post-Procedure There is a large, circumferential pericardial effusion which is completely drained by the end of the procedure.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is a large mass in the right ventricle measuring approximately 7.8cm x 3.4cm which occupies most of the apex of the RV.
A component of this mass appears to obstruct the full coaptation of the tricuspid leaflets, causing moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There is diastolic flattening of the interventricular septum, consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted [**2136-1-19**] and taken to the operating room for pericardial window for pericardial tamponade.
His Lovenox was restarted for the right atrial mass, he was closely monitored overnight for bleeding and transfer to the floor on POD1.
On POD 4 he was tolerating a full oral diet, his incision was healing well and he was ambulating without difficulty.
TTE prior to discharge showed small circumferential effusion.
