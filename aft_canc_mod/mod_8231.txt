Brief Hospital Course: 84 year old female with history of CLL, HTN, lymphedema of LE, atrial fibrillation, and HCV, who was sent in by her PCP for symptomatic bradycardia and creatinine elevation.
She was started on epogen for her anemia, attributed to her chronic renal insufficiency, however she may not need this in the future.
1) Bradycardia:  The patient had a history of PAF, and presented with symptomatic bradycardia, taken together likely representing sick sinus syndrome.
However, the patient was on amiodarone and a beta blocker, and given her renal failure on admission, she may have had impaired clearance of her BB, further contributing to her bradycardia.
Unfortunately the following morning she was becoming hypoxic from fluid overload, and her heart rate had not improved.
The patient was therefore transferred to the CCU, where she was started on a dopamine drip with little resultant increase in blood pressure or heart rate.
This refractoriness did not respond over several days, making beta blocker toxicity less likely as an etiology and indicating a likely underlying sinus node/conduction dysfunction.
Post-procedure she had an episode of afib, which was also complicated by a pacemaker sensing error and wide complex tachycardia from pacing.
She remained atrial paced during the admission, however her pacer does not guarantee that she will not go into paroxysmal A-fib.
2) Pump:  Her echo on admission showed normal EF, however it may actually be lower given her MR.  She had massive LE edema, with chronic changes, however this did improve significantly during the hospitalization, implying that she was volume overloaded on admission.
However, on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] she remained fluid overloaded by exam and CXR and therefore received 1 more dose of IV lasix prior to being switched over to her usual daily dose of 40 mg PO BID, which she will be discharged on.
She had no enzyme elevation, no chest pain, echo without evidence of ischemic changes.
4) Acute renal failure:  Her creatinine had increased from 1.8 in [**11-5**] to 3.3 on admission, most likely in the setting of decreased renal perfusion from hypotensive bradycardia.
On transfer to the CCU, she was in frank oliguric ATN and over the next couple of days required hemodialysis once due to concerns of increasing acidosis and hypervolemia.
She continued to have satisfactory urine output on the floors, with creatinine decreasing to 1.4 on the day of discharge.
This was felt secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency, and she was therefore started on epogen by the renal team.
7) R Hip Pain:  The patient complained of R hip pain with weight bearing, however there was no tenderness on palpation of the region, and a hip x-ray was negative for fracture.
Hyoscyamine Sulfate 0.125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for bladder spasm.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 1952**], [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sick Sinus Syndrome Acute on Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis Hypotension secondary to bradycardia Urinary tract infection Anemia secondary to chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: You have the appointments below, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Nephrology), Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2357**] for your heart, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
You will need to follow up in coumadin clinic to have your blood drawn every few days in the beginning, and then less frequently once you are on a stable dose of coumadin.
