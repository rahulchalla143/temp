Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation (at OSH) Central Line Placement Bronchoscopy x 2  History of Present Illness: 34 y/o male with a h/o HIV, visceral Kaposi's sarcoma, Castleman's disease, and pancytopenia who presented to an OSH with weakness, anemia, and FTT.
He was hydrated with IVF and closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of infection.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital (NH) from [**Date range (3) 74583**] for FUO workup, diffuse adenopathy and splenomegaly.
A left cervical LNB revealed metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma and Castleman's disease.
He had a follow up appointment made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] ([**Hospital1 18**]) for further management of his metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma/Castleman's disease but he did not keep that appointment.
There was concern that the pt sustained a transfusion reaction because shortly after receiving his first unit of blood.
Pancytopenia 6.
Recurrent hyponatremia (?
Chronic interstitial infiltrates on CXR   Social History: No tobacco or alcohol.
Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen: Massive splenomegaly with adenopathy .
EKG: ST at 131, no axis deviation, no acute ST changes .
PET Scan [**2181-7-25**] (performed at [**University/College **]) "Increased metabolic activity seen within the lymph nodes of the right and left anterior and posterior cervical chain extending into the supraclavicular regions.
increased metabolic activity is seen in the lymph nodes of the right paratracheal region.
Mild increased metabolic activity seen in the lymph nodes of the paraaortic, left and right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes.
Abdomen shows a normal-appearing liver, shows and enlarged spleen which has increased metabolic activity.
Increased metabolic activity seen in lymph nodes which begins at the crural level and are to the right and left and in front of the lumbar vertebrae.
The increased metabolic activity within the lymph nodes is seen within the paraaortic, the common iliac, and the inguinal on the right and left.
The scan extends to the proximal thigh; no abnormal increased metabolic activity is seen in the muscle or bone."
CXR [**2181-7-29**] Findings most consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema likely due to fluid overload in the setting of apparent anasarca and ascites.
TTE [**2181-7-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There  is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis  of the basal half of the inferolateral wall.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Bronchial washings were negative for malignant cells.
Massive splenomegaly with infiltrative intrasplenic lesion concerning for lymphoma.
2) 1.4 cm echogenic lesion in segment II of the liver may represent a hemangioma.
4) Echogenic kidneys suggesting interstitial renal disease.
5) Ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
Bone marrow from the OSH revealed a hypercellular marrow.
Brief Hospital Course: 34 y/o male with a h/o HIV, metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma, Castleman's disease, and G6PD who presented to an OSH with weakness, anemia, and FTT.
He was later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of fever and respiratory failure along with metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma and Castleman's disease.
# Respiratory failure The patient was intubated [**1-5**] to respiratory distress at the OSH prior to transfer.
Per OSH records, he has had B/L pulmonary infiltrates for several weeks.
However, given his fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress along with his CXR finding of B/L pulmonary infiltrates, there was an initial concern for ARDS/sepsis.
He was hypotensive as well and there was concern for progression to septic shock.
In addition, there was an outside hospital report of AFB organisms cultured on recent EGD as part of his FUO workup.
He was moved to respiratory isolation given concern for possible pulmonary TB.
He was initially started on broad spectrum ABx given concern for an infectious etiology for his respiratory failure and clinical decompensation.
On his second bronchoscopy, there was evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma.
His malignancy is the most likely etiology for his respiratory failure and B/L infiltrates on CXR.
# Metastatic Kaposi' sarcoma/Castleman's disease The patient was diagnosed with metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma and Castleman's disease during recent admission at the OSH when he was evaluated for FUO.
A left cervical lymph node biopsy was consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma and Castleman's disease.
After infection as an etiology for his clinical deterioration and respiratory failure was unrevealing, the most likely etiology for his fever and respiratory failure was his malignancy.
On the second bronchoscopy that was performed, there was evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in his bronchial tree.
He no longer required pressor support for his hemodynamic.
# Fever Initially, there was a concern for an infectious etiology causing his fever, respiratory failure, and clinical decompensation.
As his cultures became negative and it was clear that his metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma was the reason for his respiratory failure and B/L infiltrates on CXR, ABx were gradually D/C.
He was started on a brief course of doxycycline for concern for tick borne illness but this was also D/C.
His fever curve trended down.
At discharge, he was afebrile and his ANC>1000.
His HAART regimen dose was adjusted for his renal function.
Last CD4 count was 104 so there was no need for MAC Px with azithromycin (did receive a couple doses).
He was started on Mepron for PCP Px as he has a h/o G6PD deficiency and Bactrim would not be the best choice.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia The above are most likely [**1-5**] to his HIV and metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma/Castleman's disease.
There was a question of TROLI at the OSH after receiving blood; however this is unclear and a full panel of tranfusion reactions labs were ordered at the OSH.
PLT goal after chemotherapy is > 20 given concern for pulmonary hemorrhage.
# Acute renal failure The patient's acute renal failure is thought to be [**1-5**] to ATN/intrinsic renal disease.
He was given aggressive IVF along with diuresis to maintain adequate renal perfusion in light of his recent chemotherapy treatment.
# DIC The patient had evidence of DIC on his labs.
DIC was secondary to his metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma/Castleman's disease/systemic inflammatory process.
