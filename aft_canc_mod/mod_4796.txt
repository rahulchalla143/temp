Level 7 lymph nodes (A-J): Twenty four lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/24).
Esophagogastrectomy (K-AK):Poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, arising in the proximal fundus/distal gastroesophageal junction, most consistent with a gastric origin; see synoptic report and comments.
Lesser curvature gastric lymph nodes ([**Doctor Last Name **]-AN):One of two lymph nodes, positive for metastatic carcinoma ([**11-29**]).
Gastric fundus (AO-AR):Segment of gastric fundus/corpus with no carcinoma seen.
V.  "Esophageal donuts" (AS-AY):Esophageal and gastric fundic fragments with no carcinoma seen.
Barium Esophagogram [**2133-10-18**]: Small leak at esophago-gastric anastomosis, possibly contained.
She was extubated in the OR, then brought to the ICU for initial monitoring, with epidural, JP, right Chest tube and NGT, and was kept NPO, with IV fluids.
She had pain on arrival to the SICU, and was bolused w/dilaudid then split epidural.
She also had high blood sugars, with a history of poorly controlled DM at home, and was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] post-op.
She had pain issues, which improved when her epidural was replaced on POD 4.
She had a mild cough but was otherwise asymptomatic.
On POD 6 her JP output changed from serous to brown fluid and she was started on zosyn, cipro, and flagyl.
A barium swallow was obtained at that time, which showed a small leak at the anastomosis, which appeared to be contained.
On POD 7 she developed copious, foul-smelling respiratory secretions, as well as air output into her JP drain with respiration and coughing.
After discussion of the high morbidity associated with any further operations and the prognosis and quality of life after surgery, her family elected to make her comfort measures only.
