One month ago patient began wheezing and coughing which was treated with 3 weeks of prednisone and nebs for presumed asthma by her pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] symptoms did not improve with treatment.
Patient also describes progressive shortness of breath with exertion (currently can only walk 6 feet) and significant orthopnea (sleeps in a chair sitting up) of 1 month duration.
1 week ago patient began experiencing pleuritic chest pain.
She denies PND or syncope.
Patient reports chills, mild sore throat and ear infection which was treated with 5 days of antibiotics (unknown) by her pcp one month ago.
Patient additionally reports 1 month history of decreased po intake, weight loss and intermittent vomiting.
EKG demonstrated electrical alternans and consequently a bedside ECHO was done which demonstrated large effusion with suggestion of tamponade.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Stage I (T1C, N0, M0) 1.5 cm, ER positive, infiltrating ductal carcinoma diagnosed in [**2100**].
In [**10/2107**], diagnosed second primary, stage II B (T3, Nx, M0) 6 cm, grade III, ER positive, HER/2-neu negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast.
Diagnosed with recurrent disease involving the left chest wall 01/[**2110**].
Renal colic.
Chronic lower back pain  Social History: Lives with her husband and 2 children.
cardiac event, patient states mother had multiple medical and psychiatric problems and may have had an MI but history is unclear.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No murmers or rubs, but difficult to examine due to frequent coughing.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Pedal edema 1+ pitting.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Bilateral effusions.
Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
Cephalization of the pulmonary vessels consistent with mild congestive failure.
Pericardial fluid biopsy 10/10/9: Positive for malignant cells.
Consistent with breast carcinoma.
10/10/9 Echo: IMPRESSIOn: Large circumfirential pericardial effusion without overt echocardiographic tamponade.
Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic pressure contours.
Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of right atrial and pericardial pressures.
After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial  pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign, consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.
Pericardial effusive constrictive disease.
There is a residual pericardial effusion.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Bilateral effusions.
Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
Cephalization of the pulmonary vessels consistent with mild congestive failure.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
10/10/9 EKG: Sinus tachycardia.
10/11/9 EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Non-specific diffuse ST-T wave changes are suggestive of pericarditis.
[**9-16**] Pleural fluid analysis: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Large nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Multiple new scattered sclerotic lesion throughout the thoracolumbar spine compatible with osseous metastases.
New 5-mm nodular soft tissue in the anterior mediastinum since [**2111-12-29**].
Pathology - pleural biopsy & pericardium: I. Pleural biopsy: - Fragments of pleura and skeletal muscle.
- No malignancy identified.
Pericardium: - Fragments of pericardium with chronic inflammation.
- No malignancy identified.
10/15/9 CXR: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position and analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of [**2116-9-16**].
One of these tubes meanders in cranial direction and terminates in a loop shape in the upper lateral pleural space overlying the anterior third rib frontal view.
No new parenchymal abnormalities are present.
The previously noted left lateral pleural effusion has been practically eliminated.
IMPRESSION: Two chest tubes in place, small 1.5 cm apical pneumothorax is present.
No new other abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with 1 month history of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea; 1 week history of pleuritic chest pain and 1 day history of bilateral lower extremity edema.
# Pericardial effusion: Explains patient's symptoms of DOE, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain and lower extremity edema.
On physical exam patient has distant heart sounds, increased JVP suggestive of tamponade.
Patient currently tachycardiac with stable blood pressure and no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
ECHO demonstrated large pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Differential for pericardial effusion is broad including viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune, hypothyroidism however based on patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss is very concerning for metastatic malignancy.
Viral infection possible with patient's history of sore throat and chills.
Labs do not demonstrate renal or liver disease.
Weight loss makes hypothyroidism less likely.
No recent rashes or joint pain to suggest autoimmune.
Pericardial effusion was sent to pathology - found to be a malignant effusion, with cells consistent with breast carcinoma.
# Pleural effusion: Patient with bilateral pleural effusions.
Thoracentesis done in the CCU to drain the right pleural effusion ([**9-16**]), with cytology & laboratory studies sent.
During surgery's pericardial window creation procedure, the left pleural effusion was also drained and a talc pleuradesis was performed.
Patient had 2 chest tubes s/p surgery, and then those were pulled by surgery prior to moving from the CCU to the floor.
Patient's last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking and is over due for mammagram.
Patient found to have metastatic disease, with radiologic evidence of metastases to the spine, and cytology in the pericardial fluid.
Patient was given the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer during a family meeting, and patient had multiple opportunities for discussion with the team of physicians, after the diagnosis was given.
# CORONARIES: Postivie risk factors of HTN and smoking (smoking cessation discussed).
Pleuritic chest pain does not support angina or ACS.
Once patient's hypotension resolved (s/p drainage of pericardial fluid), patient restarted on home lisinopril.
# PUMP: No history of congestive heart failure.
See treatment of tamponade above.
CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
Patient with cough during hospital course.
# Vaginal itching: concern for yeast infection, treated with antifungal [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Social Work consulted and followed closely, including being present when diagnosis of metastatic disease was given to patient.
