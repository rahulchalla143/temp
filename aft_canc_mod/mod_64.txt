Admission Date:  [**2125-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**] Chief Complaint: Rib pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Stress MIBI   History of Present Illness: 71 y/o F w/ metastatic breast ca, w/ bone involvement, on tamoxifen, who presents with worsening right rib pain.
She reports that rib pain has been a chronic problem, but has been worse over past one week.
The right side is worse, but she also reports left sided rib pain and chest wall pain.
She does not report any trauma or heavy lifting or turning that seemed to precipitate the pains.
She was recently started on percocet for pain which did help, but she has had to take it around the clock without full relief.
no chest pain.
+ shortness of breath- secondary to not able to take in full breaths from pain in right side; No associated rash; + constipation.
Hypertension 2.
Glaucoma 3.
Breast cancer 4.
Rib pain 5.
Atrial fibrillation .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Initially diagnosed in spring of [**2110**] with a dimpling in her right breast and a positive mammogram.
Excisional biopsy demonstrated infiltrating and intraductal carcinoma which was greater than 2 cm and she subsequently went for a right modified mastectomy and axillary dissection.
Had long disease free interval, with subsequent recurrent disease w/ bony involvement in [**2120**].
On progression from this she was placed on aromasin in [**6-15**] but did not do well with this, with increased bone pain.
Rare social alcohol.
Family History: sister died of breast ca, 56  Physical Exam: vitals- 98.3, 162/94,76, 18, 97% RA gen- NAd heent- EOMI.
no m/r/g abd- soft,non-tender, mild distension, NABS ext- 1+ ankle edema b/l LEs, no calf swelling, tenderness neuro- alert and oreinted x 3, CNII-XII intact.
back/flank- no focal spinal tenderness; + tenderness to palpation diffusely along right posterior and anterior rib cage, also w/ tenderness on L side (R>L).
+ tenderness over sternum and anterior chest wall to palpation.
no associated dermatomal rash  Pertinent Results: CXR [**2125-4-29**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an opacity within the left lung base with associated volume loss consistent with atelectasis/consolidation.
Small left pleural effusion is present.
Mild loss of height is seen in mid-thoracic spine vertebral body as well as mottled appearance and fractures involving multiple ribs.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RIB FILMS [**2125-4-30**]: Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures and osseous metastatic disease involving the ribs.
Possible acute fracture of lateral left sixth rib.
The study was reported by myself and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5325**] as revealing "diffusely abnormal appearing vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine as seen on the prior MRI scan consistent with metastatic disease.
A focal lytic lesion in T5 vertebral body has progressed since [**2120**].
Anterior wedging of T12 with an associated central lucency extending to the superior endplate suggests pathological fracture.
Comparison with the prior study of [**2124-5-26**] reveals likely progression of diffuse metastatic disease of the thoracic spine.
While the present study appears to be of higher spatial resolution than the prior examination, there has been some progression of compression fractures, including nearly all thoracic vertebral bodies, most notably at T7, T8 and T12.
However, there does not appear to be retropulsion of pathologic fractures into the central spinal canal.
The T5 lytic lesion is not as clearly discernible at this time, suggesting there may have been some interval reactive sclerosis.
There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more evident on the left side, as well as multiple small wedge-shaped areas of soft tissue density within the posterior lung fields.
These pulmonary lesions were not present on the prior spinal CT scan but were seen, at least in part, on a recent torso CT scan.
Finally, there is no overt sign or an epidural mass on this study, although in this regard, MR scanning is more efficacious at detecting such an abnormality.
CONCLUSION:  Apparent progression of what is likely diffuse osseous metastatic disease, with the appearance of multiple compression fractures as noted above.
[**5-14**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-4-30**], the mitral deceleration time is now shorter suggestive of more severe diastolic dysfunction/elevated left atrial pressures.
Significant tricuspid regurgitation is now detected (suboptimal visualized in prior study).
Significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in now detected (unable to assess in prior study).
Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o F w/ metastatic breast ca, w/ bone involvement, on tamoxifen, who was admitted with worsening chest wall pain.
The patient was intially admitted to the oncology service for pain control.
Rib films revealed multiple chronic and acute rib fractures.
Given persistently poorly controlled pain despite uptitration of narcotics, CT of her T-spine was obtained; this study revealed multiple vertebral compression fractures.
On [**5-14**] the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular resonse, and developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Respiratory failure: Due to pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension and atrial fibrillation with underlying diastolic heart failure.
She did well, and was transferred to OMED on [**5-24**], however, became quite anxious, hypertensive and developed recurrent pulmonary edema requiring transfer back to the ICU on [**5-25**]; her respiratory status quickly normalized with diuresis as well as control of her anxiety and blood pressure.
After extubation, she developed another episode of hypertension in the setting of anxiety and was noted to have persistantly elevated SBP, therefore her Diovan was restarted on [**5-25**].
She was transferred to cardiology for optimization of her cardiac regimen.
3 PAF: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
On [**5-14**] the patient developed Afib with RVR, developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
While in the ICU, her coumadin was discontinued due to anticipated procedures.
She was loaded on Amio; she converted to NSR and remained there for the remainder of her hospitalization with intermittant brief periods of asymptomatic PAF, .
4 Pain control: The pain team was consulted.
5 Anxiety: The patient has significant anxiety which exacerbate her HTN and atrial fibrillation.
6 Metastatic breast cancer: The patient was continued on tamoxifen.
7 Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea on [**5-24**].
She has had good success with physical therapy, and her breathing feels improved.
Outpatient Lab Work INR check every thursday   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Rib fractures Vertebral compression fractures Metastatic breast cancer Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, tolerating POs.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for pain control.
You were found to have several rib fractures, as well as multiple vertebral compression fractures in your thoracic spine.
Additionally, you experienced 2 episodes of pulmonary edema (fluid on the lungs).
These may have been due to your atrial fibrillation and hypertension.
