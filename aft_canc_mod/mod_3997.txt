Patient presented to clinic [**7-7**] with persistent fevers up to 104 and diarrhea and was re-admitted.
Torso CT demonstrated ground glass opacities bilaterally, and "tree-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]" pattern opacities ?for fungal vs viral etiology.
Pt developed septic physiology on [**7-9**] and was transferred to the MICU for management.
CXR at that time consistent with ARDS/capillary leak.
Had bx of duodenum to r/o recurrent lymphoma.
Was sent to floor on [**7-12**] afebrile and normotensive but still hypoxic.
On floor, progressively more hypoxic from [**Date range (1) 9845**] despite diuresis and added empiric coverage for PCP.
ECHO with new pericardial effuison with no HD significance on ECHO.
Developed hypotension and started on vasopressin with LR fluid boluses.
Also developed ARF with Cr peak at 5.1 and started on CVVH.
LDH thought initially to be secondary to hemolysis with increased lactate secondary to sepsis/hypotension.
It was then thought that the increased LDH may be secondary to recurrence of lymphoma and noted that lactic acidosis can also occur with recurrence due to inc production of lactate by the tumor and [**Month (only) **] metabolism by the liver.
Sternal bx was done on [**7-19**] which showed recurrence of lymphoma.

LDH and lactate cont to climb throughout ICU course and eventually thought to be secondary to recurrence of lymphoma.
A sternal bx was done and found to show diffuse lymphoma.
