Admission Date: [**2146-5-18**]        Discharge Date: [**2146-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-2-22**]        Sex:  F  Service:   SERVICE:  Biologic Service  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 80727**] is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma being admitted today for cycle 1, week 2, high-dose IL-2 therapy.
Her oncologic history began in [**2146-1-20**] when a torso CT to evaluate worsening edema and anemia revealed a 16-cm mass in her right kidney.
There was a prominent lymph node between the aorta and vena cava and a possible bone metastasis in the L3 vertebral body.
Chest CT revealed a 5 x 3.5-cm soft tissue mass in the sternum.
Multiple small lung nodules were also noted.
Pathology revealed renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, predominately grade 3 with focal sarcomatoid areas.
There was no renal vein invasion and margins were negative.
Biopsy of the chest wall lesion was consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Pretreatment torso CT revealed a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion.
An echo confirmed a small effusion without tamponade.
She then underwent a VATS pericardial window and left upper lobe wedge resection on [**2146-4-20**], due to concern for worsening effusion during IL-2 thick high-dose IL-2 therapy.
She otherwise passed stress test and PFTs and began cycle 1, week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy in [**2146-5-2**], receiving [**11-2**] doses with course complicated by toxic encephalopathy and acute renal failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, renal cell cancer as above, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, status post C-section 26 years ago, status post gallbladder surgery and primary carcinoid tumor of the lung diagnosed on [**2146-4-20**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: Well-appearing female in no acute distress.
Lymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Chest: Decreased breath sounds at the left base; otherwise clear.
No HSM or masses.
During this week she received 7 of 14 doses, the doses held due to by shock and atrial fibrillation.
Side effects early in the week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; diarrhea improved with Lomotil therapy; hypotension on treatment day #2 improved with fluid boluses.
On treatment day #3 she developed mild restlessness and confusion felt to be consistent with toxic encephalopathy and had IL-2 placed on hold until her mental status had improved.
On treatment day #4, approximately 5 hours after her dose of IL-2 therapy, she developed hypotension and was placed on Neo- Synephrine to a max dose with addition of dopamine to max 6 mcg/kg per minute.
She was weaned from dopamine with the addition of Levophed and weaned off pressors over the next several hours with return to the floor on treatment day #5.
On treatment day #5 she was noted to have an elevated CK to 143 with a CK-MB of 14 and troponin of 0.23.
This was in the setting of acute renal failure with a creatinine of 5.5.
During this week she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 5.5 with associated oliguria.
Metabolic acidosis was noted with minimum bicarb of 16 improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
IV fluids were decreased, given concern for diastolic dysfunction the setting of acute renal failure.
She developed a transaminitis with a peak ALT of 111 and a peak AST of 139 improved to within normal limits at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 7.1, improved to 3.0 at the time of discharge.
She had no thrombocytopenia noted.
As noted on treatment day #4, she developed shock related to capillary leak syndrome requiring initiation of Neo- Synephrine to max 3.5 mcg/kg per minute, as well as the addition of dopamine 6 mcg/kg per minute.
She went into rapid atrial fibrillation and required transfer to the ICU where dopamine was weaned off and Levophed was used until the blood pressure stabilized.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post cycle 1 week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock, acute renal failure and toxic encephalopathy.
fever or pain, Zantac 150 mg p.o.
