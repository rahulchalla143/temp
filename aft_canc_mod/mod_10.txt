MRI Brain [**5-6**] Pre-op Limited post-contrast images obtained for preoperative planning of left temporal lobe lesion which may represent hemorrhage or metastasis given patient's history of lung cancer.
Stable foci of hemorrhagic contusions in the left frontal lobe and right temporal lobe.

There may be minimal residual enhancement in the anterior aspect of the previously noted enhancing lesion.

Moderate hiatal hernia.
Right adrenal adenoma.

His hospital course was complicated by Afib with RVR and ultimately rate controlled with oral diltizem and lopressor.
He also developed enterobacter bacteremia and was treated for 14 days with meropenem.
Neuro-Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss the possibility of XRT or other chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] however, the patient was too agitated to tolerate mapping and sitting still long enough for XRT.
Initially the decision was made to wait to see if his mental status improved, unfortunately it did not.
