It was unclear why the patient suddenly became hypoxic from her congestive heart failure during the operation or in the interval following her operation as she only received 200cc of crystalloid during the AV fistula ligation and her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air pre-operatively.
Soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum, which is highly suspected to be thymoma.
There are multiple areas of discoid atelectasis.
The findings on the CT scan did not clarify the reason for the patient's gross hypoxia.

Her initial symptoms of left hand numbness, tingling, and weakness had also improved after they surgery.
