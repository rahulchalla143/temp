Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 80283**] at the nursing home, patient had had hematuria requiring re-admission.
At time of admission, patient was making good urine, however was noted to have dark maroon colored urine with significant hematuria.
Urology was consulted the morning after admission, and in light of his recent carcinoma resection, continuous bladder irrigation was recommended and initiated.
This was continued until his urine was no longer bloody grossly on appearance, and was then discontinued upon urology recommendations.
His foley was also discontinued, and the patient continued to have dark red urine.
The foley was replaced so that these final clots can be irrigatated and the patient is expected to get better over the next week.
It is expected that the patient will continue to have hematuria at time of discharge.
- foley should be kept in for at least 3 days, if the patients urine returns to completely yellow it can be taken out at that time, but the foley may be kept in place if pt continues to have hematuria.
- please irrigate foley any time patient has blood clots or urinary obstruction in the foley - only if the clots become so severe that the urinary retention does not improve from flushing the foley, or the urine becomes very thick like tomatoe paste, only then should he return to the hospital, and to call the patient's primary Urologist  #) Altered mental status: It was unclear what prompted the patient's acute mental status change.
Based on his initial arterial blood gas post-intubation, it was supsected that there was some degree of carbon dioxide retention secondary to his COPD, which may have contributed in the setting of an infection.
Potential sources of infection included pulmonary given that his CT appeared possibly consistent with an aspiration event, urinary given his recent instrumentation, or prostatitis.
There was no focal neurologic deficits to suggest a stroke or seizure activity as patient would follow commands.
A head CT was negative for an acute process.
During his ICU stay, an MRI was obtained that did not reveal any evidence for acute stroke, metastases, or focal findings.
An EEG was not consistent with seizure activity.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
His telemetry initially had some evidence of ectopy, however there were no arrhythmias that would account for a change in mental status.
A lumbar puncture was attempted, however was unsuccessful, to evaluate for abnormal cytology.
He had no episodes of confusion.
#) Respiratory failure/ Presumed Aspiration pneumonia: Patient was intubated initially for airway protection given concerns about his mental status.
His x-ray on [**2166-11-16**] was consistent with fluid overloaded state (he had previously appeared dry and had received some intravenous fluids), so diuresis was initiated.
Based on his chest x-ray and CT scan, patient was treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia given his recent admission to [**Hospital3 **], with vancomcyin, zosyn, and azithromycin.
By time of discharge pt did not complain of SOB even though he continued to have rales on exam R>L.
[**Month (only) 116**] be the case that the patient also has some component of diastolic dysfunction.
Given the bibasilar crackles, and incr JVP 10cm.
#) COPD exacerbation: Once pt was on the floor he continued to have expiratory wheezes.
Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history of renal metastases that son provides.
Pt was eventually overdiuresed and Cr increased to 1.7, but lasix was decreased at that point.
Will hold off on transfusion as he does not have significant hematuria, but transfuse if <25 or symptoms.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Altered mental status - hematuria  Secondary Diagnosis: - probable aspiration pneumonia - Acute on chronic heart failure - transitional cell carcinoma - COPD   Discharge Condition: good, vitals stable, breathing well, still has rales [**3-15**] resolving pneumonia R > L, and continues to have hematuria   Discharge Instructions: You had confusion that was thought to be from respiratory failure and an infection.
Your urine is still bloody from the the bladder cancer but it is improving and eventually you will be able to get the foley removed.
Medications changes: - you lasix was increased to 20mg twice per day - potassium 10 mEq was added once per day - your bicarbonate was discontinued since you no longer needed it - you albuterol neb and was discontinued so it was redundant since you are already getting DuoNebs (which includes albuterol in it)  If your breathing significantly worsens of you have a fever > 101 please return to the ED immediately.
