Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: (Per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91178**] Note [**2185-11-10**]) NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma EGFR/ALK/KRAS w/t - [**7-/2185**] Developed progressive DOE and weight loss - [**2185-9-8**] Presented to her PCP with DOE, referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was found to have a LUL mass on CXR.
CT chest showed mass in the left upper lobe measuring up to 4.6 cm, causing complete collapse of the left upper lobe.
Outpatient work up arranged - 08/12-13/11 Presented with L sided numbness c/w a complex partial seizure.
Heat CT revealed new brain mets.
- [**2185-9-9**] Brain CT showed right parietal lobe mass at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction, with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and 5-mm left [**Hospital1 **] shift.
- [**2185-9-10**] Brain MRI showed right posterior frontal and anterior parietal mass measuring approximately 3 cm.
- [**2185-9-14**] Resection of  brain met, consistent with NSCLC adenocarcinoma of lung primary - [**Date range (1) 91179**] CyberKnive to brain lesion - [**2185-10-6**] PET CT showed intensely avid paraortic lymph node demonstrated adjacent to the primary left upper lobe mass measuring 21 x 17mm.
Known FDG-avid left upper lobe mass as detailed above, most compatible with the primary carcinoma.
Several other scattered pulmonary nodules in the left hemithorax as detailed above.
Increased bilateral adrenal FDG-avidity to SUVmax of 4.6 most compatible with metastatic involvement, left greater than right with an associated soft tissue lesion on the left.
Known right cerebellar metastasis is better appreciated on the prior MRI from [**2185-9-30**].
Post-surgical changes from prior right parietal craniotomy.
She has no children.

No signs of tension at this time.
Large left pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
Right upper lobe pulmonary embolus in the apical segmental artery.
Right lower lobe pulmonary emboli in the lateral basal and posterior basal segmental arteries.
No evidence of right heart strain or definite pulmonary infarction.
Large DVT in the left common femoral and right superficial femoral veins likely source of pulmonary emboli.
Enlarged left upper lobe mass with areas of hypoattenuation suggesting necrosis or pulmonary infarction.
Continued encasement of the left pulmonary artery, which is narrowed to a diameter of 3 mm, also seen on prior study.
Obliteration of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery and left upper lobe bronchus.
Complete occlusion of the left superior pulmonary vein with eccentric filling, which may represent thrombus or tumor invasion.
Extensive progression of metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Progression of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with new epicardial lymph node.
New right lower lobe spiculated lung nodule.
Multiple new intra-abdominal metastases including lesions too numerous to count within the liver, bilateral adrenal and bilateral renal metastases.
No acute intracranial process.
Encephalomalacic post-surgical changes in the right frontoparietal region.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo P with PMH NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma with brain mets s/p met resection, cyberknife, whole brain radiation completed on [**2185-11-29**] not currently undergoing chemo (planned to start this on [**2185-12-8**]) who presented with lethargy and hypotension, found to have PTX and bilateral PE in the setting of cancer progression on imaging.
# Hypotension: SBP to 70s on admission.
Likely secondary to poor po intake as pt reports being bedbound for several days.
While she has a PTX and PE, these are not likely to have contributed to hypotension as PE were subsegmental and PTX was not tension and had no shift.
Obtained blood and urine cultures to rule out infection/sepsis as cause of hypotension.
Pt did require 1L fluid bolus while on the floor for drop in BP to 80/40 with standing.
This episode of hypotension was asymptomatic.
Right upper/lower PEs/DVT: Evidence of large left common and right superficial femoral vein DVTs.
Gave heparin drip without bolus to reduce bleeding risk and then switched to lovenox on hospital day 2.
# Pneumothorax: No evidence of tension pneumo.
This issue was readdressed on the third day of admission, and the patient decided that she was comfortable w/o a chest tube.
# NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma with brain/liver/abdominal mets: Per primary oncologist, no current indication for chemotherapy given her very poor prognosis and performance status.
# Leukocytosis: Given PNA on chest CT, leukocytosis may be secondary to infection.
