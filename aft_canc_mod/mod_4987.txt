Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Diagnosis of Stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma - [**2163**]: Left-sided nephrectomy about ten years ago at [**Location (un) 86773**]Hospital (we do not have the original pathology or details surrounding this operation).
- [**2173-12-31**]: Presented for evaluation of pain in his left groin and testicle.
An abdominal CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules at the lung bases, up to 1 cm in size.
- [**2174-2-7**]: CT-guided biopsy confirmed metastatic clear cell carcinoma thought to be consistent with a renal cell carcinoma primary.
- [**2174-2-11**]: PET CT confirmed multiple pulmonary nodules (though they were not found to be FDG avid) and showed "complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus by soft tissue attenuation which demonstrates mild hypermetabolic uptake.
There is associated destruction of the anterior,posterior, and medial walls of the right maxillary sinus, the floor of the maxillary sinus as well as destruction of the inferior wall of the orbit."
- [**2174-3-4**]: Biopsy of the right and left maxillary sinuses: the right maxillary sinus mass biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma; the left-sided sinus biopsy was benign.
- [**2174-6-27**] Started therapy with Sunitinib + AMG 386 on protocol  09-014 (CT Torso [**7-12**] showed decrease size of some of the pulmonary lesions, the other being stable)- sunitinib d/c [**7-18**], AMG 386 third and last dose 7/12, held due to worsening of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, hallucinations.

**FINAL REPORT [**2174-8-5**]**     FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2174-8-5**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2174-8-5**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
No evidence of pathologic lymphadenopathy.
The right maxillary sinus mass is stable compared to the [**7-26**] MRI, though smaller compared to earlier studies.
Right vallecular soft tissue density.
Increased size and density of a nodular opacity in the apical left lung.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Secondary prevention of CAD 6.
CT scan of the neck was performed to look for underlying pathology showed no evidence of pathologic lymphadenopathy.
# Chest Pain - Pt developed chest pain during his hospitalization described as [**8-9**] substernal, nonradiating, reproducible with pressure applied to sternum.
EKG showed ST-T depressions in leads V3-V6.
Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated and notable for upward trend [**Date range (1) 20341**].
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for cardiac cath, during which he was found to have diffuse disease, particularly in the mid circumflex and OM1.
When the dissection occurred, patient became hypotensive, hypoxic, and complained of chest pain.
Pulmo edema unlikely given lack of physical findings and normal chest xray.
PNA unlikely given lack of leukocytosis, fever or clinical presentation.
Patient's vitals otherwise stable and patient had no episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath.
#Hypertension: Patient had one episode of hypotension during his catheterization, but stabilized throughout his stay in the CCU.
Hypotensive episode likely [**2-1**] to dissection in cardiac cath.
# Hypothyroidism: On last admission diagnosed w hypothyroidism: elevated TSH and markedly suppressed free T4 was noted.
Patient with multiple symptoms including peri-orbital swelling, cold intolerance, and possible dysphagia.
Patient without evidence of myxedema coma clinically on admission(no hypotension or altered mental status).
Hypothyroidism may also explain hallucinations as is a reversible cause of altered mental status in the past.
Etiology of hypothyroidism is unclear, as patient has not had any URI symptoms recently.
# Renal cell carcinoma: s/p Left nephrectomy in [**2163**].
Metastases to lung and maxillary sinus, last dose of Sunitinib and AMG 386 stopped at end of [**Month (only) 205**] secondary to nausea and vomiting.
