HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old female with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma who had undergone a course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy who presented for elective abdominoperineal resection on [**2192-4-5**].
Otherwise, initially she was in no acute distress.
She had no lymphadenopathy.
The neck had no masses.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was no peripheral edema.
The case was noted to be quite technically challenging given the low lying nature of the cancer the patient's morbid obesity.
There was no note of intraoperative complications.
Given her history of heart disease, and the fact that it had been trending down, she was given several transfusions of packed red blood cells.
In terms of her hospital course, from a neurologic standpoint, the patient had occasional episodes of agitation but these resolved.
They were thought to possibly be secondary to medications.
Her inability to wean was felt to be secondary to her size and acidosis.
Otherwise, there was no effusion or pneumonia during the hospitalization.
Her stoma appeared somewhat dusky on postoperative days three and four, and there was a concern this might be growing somewhat ischemic.
Her perineal wound was inspected, and this was also healing well.
She also notably experienced acute renal insufficiency.
The Nephrology Service was consulted after initial workup was somewhat unrevealing, and it was felt that she was experiencing acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency with some acute tubular necrosis.
In order to maximize her recovery, the goal was to keep her hematocrit at 30 or above.
Her metabolic acidosis was also continuing to improve prior to discharge.
Her renal insufficiency was, as noted, improving slowly, and her creatinine was 2.9 prior to discharge.
From a hematologic standpoint, the patient received several transfusions for blood loss anemia; as noted earlier.
From an infectious disease perspective, the patient had no issues.
