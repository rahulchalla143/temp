The right colon including the cecum and the duodenum were densely adherent to the inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver and the site of the prior segment 5, segment 6 resection.
There was a small purulent fluid collection in the subcutaneous space laterally.
There was also undrained fluid around the drain and the resection site.
Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated multifocal disease in the right lobe and medial segment but no evidence of any disease in the left lateral segment.
We could not palpate, visualize, or see by ultrasound any lesions in the left lateral segment".
The estimated blood loss was 1200 cc.
There is no excretion into the bowel.
Findings compatible with a small biliary leak.
This showed free extravasation of contrast at the common hepatic duct and left intrahepatic duct juncture, which extends laterally along the liver edge.
The stent crosses an area of focal narrowing in the proximal portion of the left intrahepatic duct.
The Hct increased appropriately but remained around 28% and then with a slight downward trend for the rest of the hospitalization.
Empty drain output from 2 drain bulbs 1-2 times daily or as needed and record amounts.
Please call Dr[**Name (NI) 1369**] office if you notice an increase in drain output or the drainage appears bloody or more brownish than it has been.
