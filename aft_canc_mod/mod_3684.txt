?s dementia, admitted initially by trauma surgery to SICU s/p fall down stairs onto concrete with LOC and witnessed seizure-like episode.
Pt sustained multiple facial fractures, small R front SAH, and significant epistaxis.
ED: # VS: T unmeasured, BP 140/80, HR 102, RR 24, SaO2 96/RA # Intervention: Intubated given epistaxis # Notable studies --CT head:  R frontal subdural, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
R temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
B inferior temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusions.
No midline shift.
--CT cervical spine: No fracture.
# Transferred to Trauma SICU # Consults --Plastics: No intervention recommended --Neurosurgery: No acute issues .
After initial admission, pt had increased delirium requiring 1:1 sitter.
Pt also developed hypernatremia, and was transferred to medicine for management of hypernatremia and delirium.
Past Medical History: # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # Alzheimer's dementia # Prostate CA # B glaucoma # B cataracts # Chronic back pain # GERD  Social History: # Personal: Lives with wife in son's home # Professional: Retired school custodian # Tobacco: Never # Alcohol: Never # Recreational drugs: Never  Family History: Pt was adopted and does not know his biological FH.
Gen: NAD, sleeping HEENT: B raccoon ecchymosis under eyes CV: RRR, S1S2, no m/r/g appreciated Chest: CTAB although pt difficult to position.
# CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**] 2:14 PM IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures as described above involving both orbits, the right temporal bone, and the sphenoid bone with several fracture clefts extending intracranially as described above.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**] 2:14 PM IMPRESSION: Since approximately 13 hours prior, there is increase in extent of subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Newly visible are hemorrhagic contusions of the inferior temporal lobes bilaterally.
There is new intraventricular blood within the lateral and fourth ventricles.
No significant change in the subdural hematomas over the right frontal and temporal lobes as well as layering along the tentorium.
Lateral chest radiograph is technically nondiagnostic due to low lung volumes and respiratory motion.
Allowing for this limitation, lungs are otherwise grossly clear and there are no pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Improving left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to resolving area of aspiration or atelectasis.
[**2137-8-28**] Head CT FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there has been evolution of both the right frontal epidural hemorrhage, which is less evident than on the prior study, adjacent to the nondisplaced right frontal and temporal bone fracture.
There has also been evolution of the bilateral extensive subarachnoid blood, which is not now as evident as it was on the prior study.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
A small subdural hemorrhage tracking along the anterior convexity on the left is likely, and also appears to have evolved since the prior study.
Hypodensity of the left temporal lobe is seen, consistent with contusion.
Small hypodensities of the left basal ganglia region and the periventricular white matter are noted, which likely represent microangiopathic changes.
Fractures across the lateral orbital walls bilaterally also appears stable.
Air-fluid levels are noted within the sphenoid air cells with a fracture through the sphenoid bone again noted as well.
No new hemorrhage.
Apparent mild increase in the size of the lateral ventricles as well as the third ventricle.
Continued attention in followup is recommended to exclude developing hydrocephalus   Brief Hospital Course: 72M h/o HTN, Alzheimer's dementia, admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after falling and sustaining R frontal and temporal SAH and SDH, bilateral infratemporal contusions, and extensive facial fractures which did not require intervention.
Pt's admission complicated by hyperactive delirium.
His mental status still fluctuates, being most alert during the day and most somnolent/confused in the evening and early morning.
# Pain control: patient has been receiving acetomenophen 1000mg PR TID for pain control.
Pt was started on phenytoin 100 mg PO TID as inpatient ppx against seizures, given his subdural and subarachnoid hemmorrhages.
# Hypernatremia: Patient developed hypernatremia secondary to dehydration.
The hypernatremia resolved with fluid resuscitation.
# Alzheimer's dementia: Pt continued on home regimen of Exelon *NF* 6 mg PO BID.
# Hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance: Pt's fasting blood glucose had been high during this admission, ranging between 130-190, and pt was therefore covered with humalog insulin sliding scale.
The patient should be evaluated by his PCP for further management of impaired glucose tolerance.
# Urinary retention: Pt had been having difficulty voiding during this admission, and therefore was started on terasozin 3 mg QHS.
The subsequently developed hypotension and so his terazosin was discontinued.
# Prostate CA: Pt continued on home regimen of megestrol 20 mg PO BID.
Medications on Admission: # Rivastigmine 6mg [**Hospital1 **] # HCTZ 25mg daily # Furosemide 40mg PO BID # Simvastatin 80mg daily # Fenofibrate 145mg PO daily # Megestrol 20mg [**Hospital1 **] # Pantoprazole 40mg PO daily # MVI # Vitamin B + C # Trazodone 100mg QHS  Discharge Medications: 1.
