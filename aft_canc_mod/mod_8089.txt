Admission Date:  [**2133-8-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-10-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3963**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, facial swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis Bone Marrow Biopsy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 26248**] is a 38 y/o female with a history of depression who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**8-6**] with worsening shortness of breath and recurrent headaches.
She notes that she started having symptoms approximately 2 months ago mainly with fatigue and voice hoarseness.
She then developed worsening headaches and noted that since [**7-30**] she was having some facial swelling and upper extermity swelling.
The swelling was most prominent in the morning and would get better as the day went on.
She then started having some shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing.
Her symptoms progressively got worse, especially her shortness of breath and dysphagia and presented to [**Hospital3 3583**].
At [**Hospital1 3325**] she was noted to have extensive adenopathy of the neck and mediastinum as well as a large pericardial effusion and right sided pleural effusion.
Echocardiogram was performed and showed a moderately sized effusion with blunted diastolic filling of the right ventricle.
There was also slight collapse of the right atrial free wall in late diastole consistent with early tamponade.
She was slightly anxious however denied any pain or discomfort.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS + per HPI, some calf cramping and dysphagia On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2133-8-8**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
[**2133-8-8**] PERICARDIAL FLUID.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST.. Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2133-8-9**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2133-8-9**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2133-8-11**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2133-8-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2133-8-9**] 3:25 pm BLOOD CULTURE X2 NO GROWTH.
[**2133-8-13**] 3:16 pm STOOL    OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2133-8-14**]):       NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
Pathology: [**2133-8-10**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: immunophenotyping - PB, necrotic neck mass INTERPRETATION.
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia are not seen in specimen.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
INTERPRETATION:Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Lambda restricted monotypic B cell population.
A concurrent cytospin preparation shows numerous large lymphoma cells.
Taken together these findings are consistent with pericardial involvement by primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma.
DIAGNOSIS: HYPER-CELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND NO EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA.
[**2133-8-8**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: left neck necrotic tissue DIAGNOSIS:  DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, CONSISTENT WITH PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL (THYMIC) LYMPHOMA  Imaging: [**2133-8-7**] Cardiovascular ECHO IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular function.
Moderate-sized pericardial effusion with findings concerning for early tampoande.
CXR [**2133-8-7**] There is an extremely large mass in the superior/mid mediastinum with  maximal overall  width of approximately 11.5 cm.
The mass obscures the aortic knob, making it difficult to exclude aortic pathology.
There is slight biapical pleural thickening.
Pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
There are small, right-greater-than-left effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
[**2133-8-10**] CXR There is interval increase in right pleural effusion.
There is also no change in small left pleural effusion.
Pericardial effusion is also seen on the prior study, moderate, partially imaged and should be assessed with echocardiography to exclude the possibility of tamponade physiology.
[**2133-8-17**] ECHO IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion, located mostly over the inferolateral wall and near the right atrium.
No echo evidence of tamponade physiology.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 26248**] is a 38 y/o female with a history of depression who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**8-6**] with worsening shortness of breath and recurrent headaches found to have a large pericardial effusion with ECHO findings conerning for tamponade.
The patient was diagnosed with primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma without involvement of the bone marrow.
A PET scan was done which showed extensive bulky FDG-avid lymphadenopathy involving the mediastinum, with additional FDG-avid disease seen in the bilateral lower cervical regions, supraclavicular regions, right axillary, hila, and paraesophageal region.
Of note, there is a single FDG-avid lymph node along the celiac axis.
Findings are consistent with known diagnosis of lymphoma, with disease present both above and below the level of the diaphragm.
The PET also showed a right and small left non-FDG-avid pleural effusions and3-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule versus focus of atelectasis/inflammation, with slightly above baseline FDG avidity.
She remained afebrile and her WBC count on discharge was 4.1.
Tumor lysis labs were drawn twice per day, without any evidence of tumor lysis.
# Pericardial Effusion: She was noted to have a large pericardial effusion with some evidence of tamponade.
Chemistry revealed and exudative effusion.
The cytology was consistent with primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma.
The pericardial effusion was followed with serial ECHOs, pulsus paradoxus checks and telemetry.
# Depression/Anxiety: She denies any depression and is being well managed on current regimen.
# Eosinophilia: The patient was noted to have a significant eosinophilia on admission.
Infectious disease was consulted and the patient was tested for Strongyloides, Histoplasma and O+P.
