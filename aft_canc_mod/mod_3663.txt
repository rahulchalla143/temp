History of Present Illness: 59 year-old male w/hx of renal cell CA with lung mets diagnosed in [**1-7**] s/p nephrectomy and experimental chemotherapy who initialy presented to OSH with 3 episodes of hemopytsis and was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
He had 2 episodes of frank hemoptysis in [**Hospital1 **] ED (up to 300cc).
CTA was done and showed consolidation of middle lobe and suspicious lymph node in area of pulmonary artery bifurcation and bronchial tree.
He was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and underwent selective right mainstem intubation.
Rigid bronch showed massive bleeding from left lower lobe.
There was no endobronchial lesions seen initially.
Diagnosed [**12-7**] when presented with cough and noted on CT to have Left hilar mass and right renal mass as well as RP lymophadenopathy.
S/p debulking nephrectomy at OSH on [**2184-3-1**], complicated by pulmonary embolism and near fatality.
HTN 3.
Pulmonary Embolism after nephrectomy [**2-4**], treated with lovenox x 6 months, s/p IVC filter placement.
Family History: The patient notes he has 4 maternal uncles who died of colon cancer.
CV: regular, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g Pul: CTA b/l, no wheezes Abd: + BS, nontender, ND, no rebound or guarding.
Neuro: A&Ox3, no gross focal neurological deficits   Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: [**2185-4-30**] 01:35PM BLOOD WBC-10.6 RBC-5.46 Hgb-16.7 Hct-46.5 MCV-85 MCH-30.6 MCHC-35.9* RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-286 [**2185-4-30**] 01:35PM BLOOD Neuts-76.5* Lymphs-16.4* Monos-4.7 Eos-2.1 Baso-0.3 [**2185-4-30**] 01:35PM BLOOD Glucose-102 UreaN-14 Creat-1.2 Na-142 K-4.6 Cl-112* HCO3-18* AnGap-17 [**2185-5-1**] 03:07AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.9 Mg-2.1 [**2185-5-1**] 12:58PM BLOOD Lactate-1.2 [**2185-5-1**] 12:42AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-384* pCO2-52* pH-7.26* calHCO3-24 Base XS--4  Labs on discharge: [**2185-5-6**] 08:30AM BLOOD WBC-8.9 RBC-4.64 Hgb-13.9* Hct-39.6* MCV-85 MCH-30.0 MCHC-35.2* RDW-13.4 Plt Ct-262 [**2185-5-6**] 08:30AM BLOOD Glucose-101 UreaN-16 Creat-1.3* Na-140 K-4.2 Cl-108 HCO3-21* AnGap-15 [**2185-5-6**] 08:30AM BLOOD Calcium-9.1 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.0  MICRO DATA: [**5-1**] Blood, urine, sputum cultures no growth [**5-6**] Urine cx <10,000 organisms  CTA [**2185-4-30**]: 1) Interval development of ground-glass opacity within the left lower lung lobe and left lingula, which in this patient with history of hemoptysis, may represent alveolar hemorrhage.
Differential diagnosis also includes infection or pulmonary edema.
In the bronchus supplying this region of the lung is seen small amount of soft tissue density, which could represent metastatic disease, blood clot or alternatively respiratory secretions.
2) Small nonocclusive pulmonary embolus in a branch of the pulmonary artery to the left upper lung lobe.
Dilated bronchial arteries seen within the aortopulmonary window, which could be secondary to chronic pulmonary emboli.
3) No evidence for aortic dissection within the thoracic, abdominal aorta, extending to the bifurcation.
4) Unchanged disease status from the CT torso 5 days prior.
CXR [**2185-4-30**]: No evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusions, or hemothorax.
CXR [**2185-5-6**]: Persistent left lower lobe patchy opacity with small effusion, which may represent pneumonia in this patient with fever.
On [**5-1**], he underwent another bronchoscopy which revealed old blood clot and endobronchial mass in the superior segment of LLL.
There was no active bleed.
He was called out to the floor on [**5-2**] but shortly after the transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname 20889**] had another episode of hemoptysis (~400cc).
Interventional radiology concluded that the endobronchial lesion seen on CT is unlikely the source of the bleed and therefore another rigid/flexible bronchoscopy was performed [**5-5**] for Argon coagulation of endobronchial lesion in left superior lingular segment.
He was monitored overnight and had no further episodes of cough or hemoptysis.
The patient was started on codeine for cough suppression.
Shortly after initial presentation, the patient spiked fever and was transiently treated with Levo/Vanc empirically for fever but this was discontinued.
However, the patient continued to have intermittent fevers.
CXR was read as patchy LLL opacity with small pleural effusion for which pneumonia was in the differential.
Because the patient was on codeine for cough suppression which could have masked his symptoms and because of his likely immunocompromised status due to malignancy/chemo, the decision was made to treat him empirically with a 7-day course of Levaquin.
Renal cell carcinoma, stage IV.
H/o peri-operative PE s/p IVC filter placement in remote past.
CTA revealed subsegmental subacute PE.
He also has a h/o GI bleed while on Lovenox.
