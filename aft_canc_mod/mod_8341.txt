She presented on [**2-17**] with nausea and vomiting and dehydration.
She had a recent admission with similar symptoms in [**Month (only) 958**].
At the end of [**Month (only) 958**], roughly 22 to 31, with fever and abdominal pain, where she was evaluated with multiple tests including cholangiogram and carotid arteriogram and improved on discharge and now represents with similar type symptoms but worsening with the vomiting being a new complaint.
She has a past medical history significant for an orthotopic liver transplant secondary to end stage liver disease secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis.
She had a postoperative course which was complicated by hepatic artery thrombosis where she underwent emergent thrombectomy and recurrent cholangitis and also multiple hepatic abscesses.
She also had metastatic colon cancer.
She underwent a right colectomy and stated that the colon cancer had metastases and she had received some treatments with chemotherapy, but a full course was not able to be completed.
Past medical history was also significant for hepatitis B, anemia, PTC tube placement and multiple infections in the bile including yeast, enterococcus.
Also of note in the medical history is at the time of the orthotopic cadaveric liver transplant she also had a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
Her abdomen was soft and nondistended and nontender with a well-healed abdominal scar with a bile drain in place, and warm extremities without edema.
Abdominal imaging first with x-rays showed some distended bowel pattern and temperature curve increase to 101 range.
She had pretty mild output but her abdominal x-rays never improved, and the computerized tomography scan showed dilated bowel, so on [**2-21**], after discussion with the family and the Transplant Team, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy for small bowel obstruction unresolving.
Upon opening the abdomen, the findings were that of diffuse carcinomatosis including frozen section, consistent with carcinomatosis.
The procedure performed was limited by the degree of recurrent metastatic colon cancer, so she underwent an ileotransverse colon bypass with a primary anastomosis, also the patient had a gastrostomy tube and biopsies of the peritoneal implants.
She tolerated the procedure, although she was tachycardiac with low urine output initially postoperatively.
Given the findings in the Operating Room, Dr.[**Name (NI) 71453**] Team was contact[**Name (NI) **] with these findings.
Diffuse carcinomatosis for metastatic colon adenocarcinoma; 6.
Status post postoperative oliguria resolved; 9.
