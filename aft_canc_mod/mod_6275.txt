Course has been complicated by intermittent rigors, n/v/diarrhea, and hypotension responsive to IVF boluses.
Initially began to complain shortness of breath yesterday afternoon when she triggered for RR 24, O2 sat 85% RA, increased to 93% on 50% shovel mask.
Awoke at 1 am acutely short of breath and gasping for air with O2 sats 76% on 2L NC --> 92 % on NRB with RR 40.
CXR revealed marked bilateral interstitial markings with blurring of the heart border concerning for pulmonary edema vs. ARDS.
Given another lasix 20 mg IV and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxia.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient feels her breathing is slightly improved but still labored.

Brief Hospital Course: In short, Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 56F with h/o metastatic melanoma on IL-2 therapy started on [**7-10**], who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after developing respiratory failure in the setting of chemo.
# Acute Respiratory Failure: Thought to be [**3-5**] ARDS in the setting of systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy at first, w subsequent overlying HAP, which eventually grew MRSA and Enterobacter cloacae from the sputum.
PE is a consideration, but less likely given that hypoxia could be explained by pt's worsening interstitial lung markings.
Concern for palatal swelling and aspiration post-extubation (given s/p palate resection on [**4-/2187**] by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 65219**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82659**] for melanoma mets), however, per discussion w ENT, no intervention needed.
