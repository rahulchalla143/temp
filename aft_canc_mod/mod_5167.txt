Question GVHD from recent transplant vs other toxic effect of possible medications versus likely transfusion related hemosiderosis which is supported by biopsy.
Liver MRI consistent with hemosiderosis and biopsy cannot rule out GVHD due to mild bile duct dilation.
Ground glass opacities on CXR and CT and bronchial washings done to investigate etiology.
Cytology negative for malignant cells.

Lung, core needle biopsy: - Organizing pneumonitis with features of BOOP/COP (bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia/cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), see Hemepath addendum.
- Patchy infiltrate within pulmonary interstitium morphologically and immunophenotypically consistent with involvement by patient's known acute myeloid leukemia in a background of organizing pneumonitis as described above .
Reports: - Nodule US [**2128-11-24**]: No abscess .
Slight progression of AML nodules or concurrent infection.
No pulmonary embolism.
It is unclear whether this is the same process seen on the prior studies (i.e., biopsy proven AML nodules) or areas of new infection.
Small pericardial effusion has slightly increased in size since the prior study.
There is abnormal septal motion/position associated with ventricular interaction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TTE [**2128-12-3**] IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
TTE [**2128-12-9**] Mildly depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Possible minimal or early proctitis without evidence for abscess.
Mild retrocardiac opacification could reflect atelectatic change.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a 25 yo F with refractory AML s/p allo BMT [**2128-4-15**], s/p dacogen [**2128-10-26**], ARA-C and lymphocyte infusion, h/o VRE bacteremia, h/o c. diff admitted from clinic with subcutaneous nodule on her R posterior calf found to have GPC and GPR Bacteremia, rising blast counts and received 5 doses of MEC during admission complicated by severe mucositis and neutropenic fevers.
Upon presentation to the intensive care unit, the patient had a severe multifocal pneumonia and septic shock, requiring intubation to facilitate bronchoscopy.
Throughout course in intensive care unit, patient required pressors to sustain blood pressure and sedation for intubation.
Multiple units of platelets were given for dropping platelet counts < 10.
Patient was semi-lucid while self-extubated and clearly did not want re-intubation.
When father arrived, communicated these with him, and he determined the patient should be removed from life support, including pressors and intubation, and the patient be made comfort measures only.
The patient was extubated and was anxious, in respiratory distress and pain.
She was febrile during first week of admission and after treatment remained afebrile for sometime before becoming febrile again end of [**Month (only) 404**].
She was taking Posaconazole 400mg PO BID as an outpatient which was converted to Micafungin when she developed prolonged QT syndrome from high dose Zofran.
She was also continued on Atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis and Acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis.
CT searching for source revealed organizing pneumonia consistent with biopsy results but improving.
# Mucositis: Oropharynx and rectal involvement, related to MEC.
CT pelvis with proctitis without abscess.
She was put on a morphine PCA but pain still uncontrolled, dose titrated up to 5mg/hr infusion and bolus 1mg Q10mins.
She also received Amicar 5mg PO x1 for bleeding [**12-23**] mucositis.
CT neck showing edema of esophagous, retropharynx and hypopharynx but without abscess formation.
After acute febrile illness resolved patient received 5 days of MEC with half dose of Mitoxan given history of cardiomyopathy.
Blasts improved with MEC though persistant and she developed profound pancytopenia requiring multiple transfusions.
Course also complicated by mucositis with esophageal and rectal involvement.
Pulmonary nodule and skin nodule biopsies likely AML.
She received Acyclovir, Atovaquone for prophylaxis and neutropenic fever treated as above.
# LFTs: Has history of transfusion related hemosidersosis based on Liver biopsy in [**Month (only) **], on ursodiol.
Likely Hepatocellular toxicity reaction [**12-23**] MEC treatment.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
Doubled hydrocortisone in setting of fever to Hydrocortisone 10/20 mg PO QPM/AM but then reduced back to [**3-31**] after fever resolved .
# Cardiomyopathy: Hemodynamically stable though tachycardic during admission.
Patient became bradycardic during MEC and was receiving 24mg Zofran prior to chemo doses.
# Depression/anxiety: stable.
