Mr. [**Known lastname 84250**] recent history began in [**9-/2189**] when he was found to have a broncopleural fisutla in the RUL.
Since that time, he has been living at [**Hospital **] rehab and has been intermittently ventilator dependent.
He has had recurrent air leaks and numerous procedures to attempt to repair his fistulas.
These have been complicated by local infections requiring drainage.
:   Past Medical History: - NSCLC as above: - R thoracotomy, en bloc resection portions of RUL/RLM/RLL [**2184**] - [**Doctor Last Name **] lobectomy, LL lobe wedge resection via L thoractomy [**2189-7-28**], - hx ETOH abuse - GERD - Depression - L knee OA - h/o PE  Social History: Lives in [**State 1727**].
+ EtOH    Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.7, HR 104, RR 19, BP 109/62 on PCV with FiO2 50% / PIP 18 / RR 10 / PEEP 5 GEN: sppears comfortable SKIN: L upper chest wall bandage clean and dry HEENT: JVP not elevated CHEST: Lungs are diffusely rhonchorus with expiratory wheezes and decreased sounds in both upper lobes CARDIAC: Regular rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

# NSCLC s/p stent: OSH physician feels that recurrent infections may be reduced by removal of stent.
BP fell from baseline 120s to 100, and he remained completely asymptomatic.
Given no history of documented arrhthmia or cardiac workup at [**Hospital1 18**], he may warrant further evaluation by a cardiologist and/or echocardiogram going forward, depending on overall goals of care.
# Chronic respiratory failure: Patient remained on his ventilator via tracheostomy on PCV and appeared comfortable at current settings from [**Hospital1 **] (FiO2 50% / PIP 18 / RR 10 / PEEP 5) .
Likely secondary to chronic fistula infections.
# Anxiety and pain:  Lorazepam, morphine, and haloperidol PRN were continued.
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1)  Injection TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
