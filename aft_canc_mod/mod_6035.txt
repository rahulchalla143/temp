MRI reveald a contrast enhancing lesion in the right parietal region.
While on therapy, the patient suffered neurologic decline (unsteady gait and headache).
MRI revealed significant radiographic progression, necessitating a craniotomy for tumor resection in [**12-26**].
CT and MRI of the head revealed expansion of a cystic structure in the resection site.
The patient presented again in [**3-26**] with worsening left hemiparesis and neglect.
In this context, I am concerned that the previously thought "cyst" actually represented non-enhancing tumor and that the symptoms are the result of tumor progression.
Recurrent left spontaneous pneumothoraces with left apical blebs, s/p left upper lobe bleb resection, pleurodesis, and sclerosis in [**2105**]; had post operative air leak requiring exploratory thoracotomy 2.
Benign connective tissue nevus 5.
No stroke, hemorrhage, or aneurysm.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.

Again noted is a postoperative cavity in the right parietal lobe with nodular extensive enhancement along its margins concerning for residual/recurrent neoplasm.
Findings could also reflect some component of radiation necrosis.
There is stable surrounding edema and mass effect.
There is subependymal enhancement of the ventricular surface.
Impression:  Nodular enhancement surrounding the right parietal lobe cavity may represent some combination of neoplasm and post radiation change.
INDICATION: 51-year-old man with right parietal GBM status post reexploration and debulking.
FINDINGS: There has been a repeat right parietal craniotomy, with air seen within the cystic cavity status post debulking.
Perilesional edema appears similar, with leftward midline shift unchanged at 4 mm.
There is bilateral frontal pneumocephalus.
Hyperdense material overlying the right parietal surgical site likely represents blood products.
There is no new intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes with no new midline shift or intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
Surgical defect is seen in the right parietal lobe with marginal enhancement indicating residual lesion.
Surrounding edema is identified which is not changed.
There is no acute infarct identified.
Small bilateral extra-axial collections and pneumocephalus are seen as postoperative finding.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 y/o male s/p resectionwho presented with L sided neglect and hemiparesis.
His post-operative MRI was revealed complete evacuation of the previously seen hypo-intense material.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent GBM  Discharge Condition: Stable, still with mild residual L sided weakness  Discharge Instructions: ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
