Admission Date:  [**2187-8-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2187-8-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-12-20**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old black female with a history of benign metastasizing leiomyoma found on CT scan in the right lower lobe with some involvement of the right middle lobe.
The patient was symptomatic for baseline shortness of breath with cough, mostly exertional, after one block of ambulation or one to two flights of stairs.
CT scan also showed that the mass had increased in size occupying the entire right lower lung with significant shift of the diaphragm and mediastinum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed metastasizing benign leiomyoma of the right lung, benign left breast cyst, G6PD deficiency, history of ventricular premature beats, and status post total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and left pelvic mass resection with rising CA-125.
The chest revealed decreased breath sounds over the right lower lobe.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of right lower lobe benign metastasizing leiomyomas.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no intraoperative complications.
The patient had had no air leaks.
Of note, she had some postoperative elevation of her CKs to 1,011 which subsequently decreased.
Troponin was mildly elevated to 5.8 and decreased to 1.4.
However her EKG changes were suggestive of pericardial involvement and she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with the elevation in CKs and troponin thought to be secondary to intraoperative cardiac manipulation.
Of note, the patient had some intraoperative arrhythmias for which she was started on Amiodarone intravenous load and switched to p.o.
Of note she had some postoperative leukocytosis with white blood cell count to 27,000; however her white blood cell count continued to decrease over the next few days and was 12.6 on discharge.
