RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2181-7-6**] 4:11 PM  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  IMPRESSION:  1) No significant interval change in extensive, ill-defined, diffuse nodular and patchy opacities which are predominantly distributed within both upper lobes.
The radiographic differential diagnosis also includes other fungal infections, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 34832**] emboli, cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis, and less likely, vasculitis.

The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2181-6-25**], there is no significant change.

There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Multiple, ill-defined, irregularly marginated pulmonary nodules throughout both lungs, predominantly within both upper lobes, which have not significantly changed since the prior study.
The diffuse distribution of these lesions less likely favors [**Month/Day/Year 34832**] emboli.
Continued bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed in size since the prior study.

Note: No atypical cells or granulomatous inflammation is seen.
A single microscopic aggregate of neutrophils is focally noted in the papillary dermis.
Special stains for bacteria (Brown and Brenn) and fungi (PAS) are negative.
The infiltrate is pauci-inflammatory and nonspecific, raising the possibilities of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction or reaction to treatment.
If clinical concern for a infection disseminated to the skin persists, biopsy of another lesion may be further informative.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2181-6-25**]   Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is moderately dilated 2.The left atrium is elongated.
There is possible mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

However, no pulmonary embolism is identified within the main pulmonary arterial trunk and main branches.
Multiple diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules, predominantly within the upper lobes, which given the patient's immunocompromised state are most concerning for an infectious process such as fungal disease.
[**Month/Day/Year **] emboli, metastatic disease, and pulmonary edema are much less likely considered in the differential.
Bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
CVL placed, then removed ~2wks later secondary to persistant fevers and a concern for it as a source of infection Abx start dates:  1.
Labs showed elevated d-dimer at 2257, but also elevated haptoglobin at 396, fibrinonogen 430, suggesting generalized inflammation without DIC.
B.Multiple diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules, predominantly within the upper lobes, most concerning for an infectious process such as fungal disease, but also may be c/w GNR [**Date Range 34832**] emboli.
A TTE on [**7-3**] showed no valvular lesions.
An abdominal CT to assess for hepatic infection was normal.
Repeat chest CTs have shown no change in the pulmonary nodules, but resolving effusion and resolving lymphadenopathy.
Induced sputum with gram stain showed heavy growth of oropharyngeal flora, (-)prelim nocardia cx, (-)PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], (-)prelim fungal cx, (-)fungal KOH prep.
GRAM STAIN: no pmns, no microorgranism.
Most likely hypersensitivity to infxn c gnrs, ecthyma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, or medications.
An ultrasound exam was negative, and the regional infection was considered by the medical and infectious disease teams to be well sequested.
E. The right internal jugular central venous line was pulled, but fevers persisted, and the catheter tip yielded no significant growth.
It was felt that underlying myelodysplastic syndrome may be a source of his persistent fever.
Caspofungin was used after ambisome resulted in a conjugated bilirubinemia and voriconazole resulted in elevation of transaminase levels.
Pulm:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34835**] pulmonary infection was compounded by a component of CHF.
GI:  The initial course of ambisome resulted in an elevated direct bilirubin level.
Leg cuff BP's because L arm cellulitis, R arm midline.
Renal/F/E/N:  Small renal stone in pole of R kidney Fluids were d/c on [**6-28**] as pt looks like in pulm edema (with lower extremity edema).
Diabetes:  No abnormal FSBGs.
