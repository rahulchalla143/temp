Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with    pericardial fat.
Thoracic lymphadenectomy.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy.
[**2168-6-19**]: right chest ultrasound   History of Present Illness: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old woman with a T1 adenocarcinoma of the GE junction.
She underwent endoscopic mucosal resection with a positive deep margin and is being admitted for esophagectomy.
Past Medical History: Esophageal cancer atypical chest pain, status post cardiac catheterization; Carotid Stenosis Hypertension Diabetes Chronic low back pain, status post a significant fall in [**2162**], down a flight of stairs, treated with steroid injections without improvement Glaucoma Anxiety  Past Surgical History: hysterectomy; foot surgery; tonsils and adenoidectomy.
Family History: Mother with AAA and no other cardiovascular disease in the family.
Physical Exam: VS: T: 98.8  HR: 97 SR  BP: 134/80 Sats: 96% RA General: sitting in chair no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple.
no lymphadenopathy Card: RRR normal S1,S2 no murmur/gallop or rub Resp: faint crackles right 1/4 up, left clear GI: bowel sounds positive abdomen soft.
J-tube site clean, no erythema or discharge Incision: right chest sites clean, margins well approximated no discharge Extre: right trace edema.
bilateral lower extremities cool to mid chin Skin: multiple ecchymosis left side stable Neuro: awake, alert  Pertinent Results: [**2168-6-21**] WBC-7.2 RBC-3.43* Hgb-10.0* Hct-31.0 Plt Ct-250 [**2168-6-20**] WBC-10.4 RBC-3.46* Hgb-10.4* Hct-30.9 Plt Ct-200 [**2168-6-15**] WBC-8.9 RBC-3.76*# Hgb-11.4*# Hct-34.0 Plt Ct-157 [**2168-6-21**] Glucose-145* UreaN-16 Creat-0.5 Na-141 K-3.7 Cl-105 HCO3-26 [**2168-6-19**] Glucose-144* UreaN-14 Creat-0.5 Na-135 K-4.1 Cl-103 HCO3-22 [**2168-6-16**] Glucose-133* UreaN-22* Creat-0.6 Na-138 K-3.8 Cl-104 HCO3-25 [**2168-6-21**] Calcium-8.0* Phos-4.1 Mg-2.1  CXR: [**2168-6-21**]: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position.
No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area on either side.
Rounded vascular appearance on the right lung base with some plate atelectasis is still present, similar to the preceding findings.
The lateral view discloses small amounts of pleural effusion in both posterior pleural sinuses.
[**2168-6-20**]: Bibasilar opacification is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
Right chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Again there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that would be consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure  Esophagus: [**2168-6-21**]: Thin barium was administered.
The patient drank thin barium contrast without difficulty.
Contrast passes freely through the esophagus and esophageal anastomosis through the stomach, without hold up or obstruction.
The esophagogastric anastomosis is widely patent with no evidence of leak.
There is no definite evidence of ectopic gas, but note is made of limitation of gas evaluation in this study.
Contrast is noted in loops of small bowel.
Suboptimal evaluation for leak at the primary anastomosis due to lack of oral contrast.
No obvious fluid collection adjacent to the primary anastomosis is seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent opacities at the lung bases could be atelectasis; however, hypodensities seen at the right lung base within the area of consolidation could suggest superinfection.
Ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, could be due to infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Focal nodular opacity in the right upper lobe about a centimeter, could be infectious and attention should be paid on the next followup.
Six month follow-up CT is recommended for surveillance.
Non-specific foci of air in the mediastinum could be post-surgical.
No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
Fatty liver, with large focal area of fatty sparing in the left liver lobe.
Partial loss of vertebral body height of T12, of indeterminate age.
No evidence of reflux of oral contrast from J-tube into the esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted following her successful Laparoscopic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy with laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy placement.
She was transferred to the floor on [**2168-6-17**] but was readmitted on [**2168-6-18**] for shortness of breath and increased work of breathing.
Her chest film showed small effusion, atlectasis.
Chest CT showed no anastomic leak, possible pulmonary infection versus inflammation.
Drains and tubes: NGT tube was flushed to maintain patency and removed on POD3 Anastomose JP drain and Right chest tube were removed on [**2168-6-21**] once esophagus study was negative for leak.
Esophagus study was done on [**2168-6-21**] which showed no leak.
ID: On [**2168-6-18**] her WBC increased to 15 and was started on Cipro and Vancomycin for possible anastomic leak  or RUL infection.
Skin: multiple ecchymotic sites stable.
Pain: Epidural Bupivacaine/Dilaudid was titrate to good pain control by the acute pain service.
On [**2168-6-20**] this was removed and she was converted to Roxicet via J-tube with good pain control.
While in the SICU she became very anxious and her Ativan was slowly restarted.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**5-24**] hours as needed for anxiety.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: Three (3) mL Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor Last Name **] crest  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal cancer atypical chest pain, status post cardiac catheterization; Carotid Stenosis Hypertension Diabetes Chronic low back pain, status post a significant fall in [**2162**], down a flight of stairs, treated with steroid injections without improvement Glaucoma Anxiety  Past Surgical History: hysterectomy; foot surgery; tonsils and adenoidectomy.
