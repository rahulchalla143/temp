Admission Date:  [**2131-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-12-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**] Chief Complaint: Biliary obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with sphincterotomy and replacement of biliary stent  History of Present Illness: This is a 80 year old man with past medical history significant for biliary obstruction likely secondary to cholangiocarcinoma status post biliary stent in [**3-5**] who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital where he presented with weakness and jaundice.
Labs were remarkable for elevated LFTs, bili, and alkaline phosphatase with a normal amylase and lipase.
Patient underwent CT and MRCP at [**Hospital1 1474**], prior to transfer, which showed massive dilation of the intrahepatics, stent in the common bile duct, and gallstones in the gallbladder.
Note was made of a large diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum where the ampulla was located.
TIA 3. detached retina 4. hypercholesterolemia 5. history of biliary obstruction s/p plastic stent [**3-5**] at [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital - brushings concerning for adenocarcinoma, CA [**43**]-9 normal (10) in [**3-5**],  CEA elevated (11) in [**3-5**], CT revealed portohepatic and gallbladder masses in [**3-5**]; patient being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66200**] of gastroenterology at [**Hospital1 1474**] 6. hypercholesterolemia  Social History: former machinist, no ETOH for a few years, retired, lives alone,  multiple pets.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally (anterior exam) Cardiac: Distant.
normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No abnormal movements noted.
CXR: stable bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions, no chf or pneumonia .
A single diverticulum with large opening was found with the major papilla internally.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep using a free-hand technique.
Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was not attempted.
Biliary Tree: A single irregular stricture of malignant appearance that was 25mm long was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct.
There was severe post-obstructive dilation.
These findings are compatible with malignant biliary stricture.
Given the presnce of acute sphincterotomy bleed the plan for metal stenting was aborted due to poor duodenal visualisation and a 5cm by 10F double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully in the common bile duct.
Hemostasis appeared to be achieved although there was a large overlying clot.
Check Hct now and again in 6 hours Await cytology and plan for metal stent placement in 1 month   Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old male with suspected cholangiocarcinoma transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for obstructive jaundice for stent change.
## Obstructive jaundice: Patient admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] with complaints of weakness and jaundic.
Bili and alk phos elevated from baseline with associated elevation of his LFTs.
CT and MRCP confirmed severe biliary dilation.
Attempt was made to place a metal stent but due to bleeding following a small sphincterotomy to facilitate the stent placement, visualization was impaired and operators were forced to place a plastic stent.
## ICU course: Immediately following ERCP, patient was noted to be unresponsive with decreased respirations and O2 sats in the low 70's on nonrebreather.
WBC count was elevated at 12.5.
His post-procedure hematocrit was 23.1, down from 30.2 but remained stable without transfusion.
## Hypoxia: Patient's hypoxia following ERCP likely due to medications causing respiratory depression.
CXR showed stable bilateral pleural effusions and following narcan and flumazenil, the patient's respiratory rate improved and he was quickly weaned to room air.
He did receive a liter of NS for resuscitation but remained stable thereafter without further boluses.
No complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness on the day of discharge.
## Acute blood loss anemia: Following sphincterotomy, patient had significant bleeding requiring epinephrine injection.
Post-procedure hematocrit was 23, down from 30 but remained stable without transfusion.
Patient was instructed to monitor his stools for black color or bright red blood and to follow-up with his regular primary care doctor within 1 week to have his blood count rechecked.
He was discharged on supplemental iron and warned of potential constipation and GI upset with this medication.
