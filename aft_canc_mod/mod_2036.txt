Bronchoscopy at the outside hospital revealed a large exophytic tumor in the right mainstem.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2119-6-24**] for rigid bronchoscopy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Right upper lobe lung mass consistent with adenocarcinoma diagnosed with outside hospital thoracentesis (stage IIIb).
Prior hemothorax/hemorrhagic effusion, patient failed pleurodesis x 2.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular with a 2/5 systolic ejection murmur at the base.

Chest x-ray demonstrated a left pleural effusion and right hilar fullness.

EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90, normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, ST depression 1 mm in V2 through V6, T wave inversions in leads 1 and 2.
Echocardiogram on [**2119-5-26**] showed an ejection fraction of 35-40%, anterior hypokinesis, apical hypokinesis, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 34.
