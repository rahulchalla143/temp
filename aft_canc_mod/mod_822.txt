Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2431**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Left atrial abnormality.
[**2134-12-13**] CXR: Mild stable cardiomegaly with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Chronic infarcts of the left frontal lobe, as well as likely chronic lacunar infarcts in the left basal ganglia and pons.
[**2134-12-14**] Echo: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall;, and akinesis of the posterior wall.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-1-21**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced secondary to increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, suggesting restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent.
[**2134-12-14**] EKG: Sinus bradycardia with slowing of the rate as compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-12-13**].
Right bundle-branch block is no longer recorded.
There is left anterior fascicular block.
Prior posterolateral myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.
The Q-T interval has increased and is quite prolonged as compared with tracing of [**2134-3-19**].
In the absence of right bundle-branch block the T waves are now inverted in leads V2-V6 and may represent active anterolateral ischemic process.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a distal calcific 60% lesion.
The LAD was severely diseased, with a mid-vessel 80% stenosis into a twin LAD with a proximal 90% stenosis in the diagonal portion and an 80% stenosis in the LAD portion.
The RCA was severely calcified with a mid-vessel 80% stenosis and proximal PDA 60-90%  lesions.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 14 mm Hg, PCWP mean 17 mm Hg).
There was mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP 40 mm Hg).
Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Fracture across the proximal aspect of the left fifth metatarsal shaft with callus formation and irregularity of the fracture margins, likely representing a subacute fracture.
No specific features for osteomyelitis or subcutaneous gas.
No pulmonary embolus.
No aortic dissection.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Nodular and ground-glass opacification in both lower lobes and prominant mediatinal and hilar nodes are nonspecific for an infective/inflammatory process.
Pulmonary artery enlargement consistent with pulmonary artery  hypertension.
Vascular (Aortic, celiac axis and splenic artery) calcifications including dense three-vessel coronary artery calcifications.
Moderate ascites.
Bilateral gynecomastia.
Mediastinal lipomatosis.
This was treated with IV fluids, vasopressors (discontinued [**12-15**]), and empiric vanc/cipro/zosyn, and stress-dose corticosteroids.
Wound swab from a LLE ulcer grew MSSA and antibiotics were changed to nafcillin on [**12-17**] and changed to Unasyn on [**12-18**] for better coverage of gram negatives and anaerobes given his history of type 1 diabetes.
#Hypoxemic respiratory failure - Secondary to septic shock.
TTE [**12-14**] showed LVEF 40%, further reduced secondary to increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, suggesting restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent.
Cardiac cath [**12-14**] showed 3VD, BiV diastolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a normal cardiac index (on levophed).
No intervention was performed.
Cardiac surgery consultated was obtained but plans for surgery deferred pending resolution of acute medical issues.
Continued cyclosporine at home dose to prevent acute rejection.
#DM1: Hyperglycemia treated with insulin gtt while he was in the MICU on steroids.
#Hypokalemia: Had some hypokalemia on day of discharge which improved with po potassium supplementation.
End stage renal disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with an infection in your L foot that progressed to shock.
Increase simvastatin to 80mg daily  Please return to the ED or call your doctor if you experience fever or chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe pain, redness or swelling in your foot.
