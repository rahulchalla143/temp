A frond-like/villous 3.5 cm mass of malignant appearance was found at the cecum near ileocecal valve.
The mass was friable with superficial ulceration.

Also found to have cecal mass c/b LGIB while on heparin/coumadin.
Underwent a right hemicolectomy on [**2170-12-4**], postoperative course protracted related to anastomotic leak.
Cecal mass/LGI bleed: The patient developed lower GI bleeding after initiation of anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin.
He had several large bloody bowel movements with bright red blood.
GI was consulted and he underwent colonoscopy on [**11-30**], which revealed a frond-like/villous 3.5 cm mass of malignant appearance in the cecum.
Anastomotic leak developed with insertion of percutaneous drain on [**2170-12-14**].
Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient has a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and was originally admitted to the OSH in decompensated heart failure.
He had also had an admission for CHF exacerbation to the same OSH one month prior.
It was felt that his recent decompensation may have been secondary to his new onset atrial fibrillation vs progression of his disease.
Throughout hospitalization has has bilateral crackles in bases and bibasilar small pleural effusions.
Most recent CXR on [**2-26**] shows Mild pulmonary edema and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion that are new.
Atrial fibrillation: He has a history of sustained atrial fibrillation diagnosed on his recent OSH admission in [**10-27**].
It was felt that his atrial fibrillation may be contributing to his decompensated heart failure.
Alternatively, his worsening heart failure may have triggered atrial fibrillation.
On [**11-27**] he underwent TEE which showed no thrombus and he was successfully cardioverted with 200 joules.
However, it was held when he developed GI bleeding and he was maintained on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
CAD: He has known CAD, s/p CABG in [**2153**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to RCA), followed by MI and occlusion of his SVG-RCA graft.
Cardiac cath on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] was unchanged from his prior cath in [**2167**], showing three vessel coronary artery disease (occluded native coronaries except patent ramus intermedius) and widely patent SVG-OM and LIMA to LAD.
Thus it was felt that CAD was an unlikely etiology for his worsening CHF.
Has risk factors for CKD including DM, HTN.
UTI: Pt complained of dysuria and foul-smelling urine on the day after admission (s/p foley catheter).
On [**2171-2-24**] urine culture positive for gram negative rods, started on cipro, then sensitivities showed KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE, switched to bactrim ss po bid x 7 days, foley catheter changed on [**2-26**].
Scrotal erythema/tenderness: Pt complained of scrotal swellling and tenderness during the admission.
No significant swelling was noted.
No fluctuance or evidence for fluid collection or abscess.
Scrotal US revealed bilateral small hydroceles but no evidence of epididymitis/orchitis.
This was felt to be a candidal infection and he was treated with miconazole powder.
Developed fistula with tubefeedings so TPN restarted.
Unable to tolerate goal tubefeeds at 85cc an hour, had nausea and high residuals.
Tolerating that well with no residuals.
Abdominal Wound - looks clean and dry.
One drain on right side that goes into abscess has little drainage.
