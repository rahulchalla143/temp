No abnormal enhancement is seen in this region.
No evidence of slow diffusion is identified in these regions.
Following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement identified.
There is no evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
IMPRESSION: Multiple T2 hyperintensities in the parietal occipital region including involvement of the corpus callosum without enhancement or slow diffusion.
The appearances are suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy.
No abnormal enhancement is seen.
EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background rhythm in the [**2-25**] Hz delta frequency range.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
Other causes for encephalopathy include infection and metabolic derangements.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
ECG: Sinus tachycardia Extensive wave changes may be due to evolving anterolateral myocardial infarct.
CT Abdomen: 1) Thickening in left colon seen from the splenic flexure through the rectosigmoid.
Findings could simply be due to underdistension, but if a true finding, differential diagnosis includes infection, including C. difficile colitis, ischemia (although all major mesenteric vessels are patent), or inflammatory processes.
2) Bibasilar atelectasis.
3) No evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Successful stenting of the ostium of the RCA with a Bare Metal Stent.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia or CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: Regarding her seizures/ HA, the patient was worked up for CNS infection vs mets(though outside head CT neg) vs stroke.
An MRI was obtained and showed multiple T2 hyperintensities in the parietal occipital region including involvement of the corpus callosum without enhancement or slow diffusion.
The appearances are suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy.
Intially it was though that the patient had a stroke given L sided weakness, but later in her course her neurological exam was normal and completely without deficits.
A lumbar puncture was negative, except elevated protein, about 400 RBCs.
A subarachnoid hemorrhage would have more red blood cells on it.
She was empirically covered for meningitis with ceftaz, vanc, flagyl(?
recent abd abscesses), and ampicillin for listeria.
She was continued on acyclovir for a question of HSV until her HSV PCR results returned and showed no evidence of HSV.
This showed multifocal slowing, subjective of multifocal subcortical dysfunction.
Vascular disease is a relatively common cause of such findings though the etiology cannot be determined by the tracing.
There were no epileptiform features.
Ultimately, the cause of her seizures was unknown.
The patient's EKG showed PR depressions diffusely consistent with myopericarditis of unknown etiology.
An echo down after the procedure showed EF 20% and diffuse severe akinesis with preservation of 2 cm of basal wall motion.
PR depressions diffusely seemed consistent with myopericarditis of ?
etiology, however, her stunned myocardium is also consistent with hypoxia secondary to her respiratory arrest with the seizure.
A new cardiomyopathy work up with TSH, Fe Studies, and viral cultures was negative.
Her CK was > [**2191**] which would be consistent with a seizure and was about 1000 at discharge.
The patient had fevers and leukocytosis with baseline WBC in the 20's.
It was unclear if this was secondary to infection vs acute stress response to seizure vs acute myocardial infarction (less likely).
Per PCP notes, it was felt to be secondary to chronic infections.
The patient's nausea and vomitting was her chief complaint at the outside hospital.
It may have been related to her migraines or to a CNS process however  meningitis was ruled out by LP.
The patient may have had an upper GI bleed since coffee grounds were reported at the outside hospital.
The patient has no history of GI bleeds and cannot remember ever having hematemesis or BRBPR.
There was no further bleeding here and it was not entirely clear that she ever really had any GI bleed.
A CXR showed mild vascular congestion  but her clinical exam showed no evidence of heart failure.
The patient remained tachycardic during her stay.
This was thought secondary to pain v. withdrawal given h/o EtOH vs poor pump function requiring a rate related compensation for her low ejection fraction.
There was initially a concern for compartment syndrome.
At discharge, her pain and swelling were much better.
The patient has a history of abdominal abscesses and a chronically high white count.
The patient has DM secondary to pancreatectomy.
