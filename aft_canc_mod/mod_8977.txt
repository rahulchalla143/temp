He has a history of chronic intermittent right knee pain since age 16, when he underwent arthroscopic surgery.
In [**Month (only) 359**], he exacerbated his right knee pain while participating in physical therapy for his back.
Plan was for arthroscopic surgery in Novemeber, but this was delayed when he developed swelling in the setting of a jaw infection, requiring a 4 day hospital admission, IV antibiotics and oral surgery with teeth removal.
Plan was for knee surgery to proceed on [**2123-5-20**], however approximately one week ago he developed progressively worsening knee pain and swelling, to the point where he was unable to bear weight.
Saw his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] ordered an ultrasound that per report was negative for DVT or cyst in RLE.
However, pain worsened and he went to ED at [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-7**].
Was followed by ID consulting team, who felt this was concerning for septic arthritis despite low WBC.
Chest CT [**5-8**] showed no evidence of PE but did show some signs of evolving right sided pneumonia.
PT then spiked fever to 102.8, started  on vanc/imipenem/azithro for neutropenic fever although cultures with no growth to date.
Was seen by Heme/Onc consultants, who had concern for acute leukemia.
Reports intermittent fevers/chills, and diffuse pain most notable in right knee.
Non-productive cough and dyspnea since yesterday, as well as a dull chest pain in region of lower left ribs.
Has history of epistaxis in [**Doctor Last Name 6165**], no recent epistaxis or other bleeding.
(-) Denies night sweats, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysuria, frequency, urgency, or hematuria.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
No recent bruising.

There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax, the course of the catheter is unremarkable.
An area of retrocardiac atelectasis is seen.
In addition, entire right hemithorax is showing increased radiodensity, which is presumably caused by patient positioning.
Mild enlargement of the left atrium.
Borderline cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload.

CHEST AP [**5-15**] 1) New/worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, concerning for an area of pneumonic infiltrate.
2) Worsening opacity in the right lung diffusely could reflect worsening pneumonic infiltrate as well.
Bilateral small pleural effusion with mild increase in the amount of fluid in the left pleura.
Mild edema in the right lower abdominal wall.
Right pleural effusion is now partially loculated with fluid in the fissures.
The left pleural effusion is slightly increased.

Although this may be chronic, consider the possibility of acute infectious mastoiditis.
RIGHT LENI [**5-23**] No DVT in the right lower extremity.

Incompletely visualized multifocal opacifications in the bilateral lung bases, consistent with edema and multifocal pneumonia, better assessed on recent CTA.
Decreased size of bilateral pleural effusions, now small in size.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Resolving increased attenuation of jejunal mesentery with relative sparing of fat surrounding mesenteric vessels, is most consistent with resolving mesenteric panniculitis.

#Acute Monocytic leukemia (M5a) - Patient was admitted with an elevated WBC count with monocytic predominance.
He was diagnosed with new onset Acute Monocytic Leukemia (M5a) on bone marrow biopsy.
He was initially treated with alloprinol 300 mg PO daily to decrease uric acid production.
[**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs were monitored without evidence of acute tumor lysis syndrome.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**6-11**] showed NO DISEASE.
HiDAC therapy was complicated by a morbilliform rash, thought to be [**2-25**] ara-C, as pt had similar rash during 7+3 induction chemo, for a which a biopsy was consistent with chemotherapy-induced reaction.
# Febrile neutropenia: The patient was started on treatment for pneumonia (seen on CT) with vancomycin and imipenem at OSH prior to transfer.
Patient developed rash initially concerning for reaction to meropenem  and he was switched to cefepime prior to transfer to the floor.
Patient remained afebrile from [**Date range (1) **].
He developed new fevers on [**5-18**] and metronidazole was started after abdominal CT on [**5-20**] showed concern for panninculitis.
His fevers remained constant and LENI's of his right lower leg on [**5-20**] and [**5-23**] were negative.
CSF showed no evidence of infection.
Cefepime was switched to aztreonam given concern for worsening drug rash.
At this time, additional sources of fever included right subscapular pleural effusion, which was unable to be sampled due to need for CT guidance and patient's clinical status.
The only positive culture data was when the pt grew rhinovirus on BAL so was given IVIG.
# Delerium: Patient developed increasing disorientation starting [**5-22**].
LP on [**5-24**] showed no evidence of CNS infection or leukemic involvement.
He remained delirous at this time, as he subsequently developed hypernatremia.
Upon correction of hypernatremia with D5 and limiting use of narcotic pain medication, patient's mental status improved.
Severe illness with disturbance in sleep wake cycle was also thought to be contributing to delerium, and patient was started on trazodone qhs to attempt to normalize sleep-wake cycles.
As patient's mucocitis became severe enough to prevent po medication intake, zyprexa zydis was substituted for this purpose.
# Effusive-Constrictive Pericarditis:  Noted on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and thought likely due to leukemic infiltration.
The patient had a right heart cath on [**5-14**] which showed evidence of tamponade physiology which did not improve after drainage of approximately 250 cc fluid.
Patient continued to have pathologic pulsus paradoxus in the ICU.
Pericardial drain removed [**5-15**] due to poor output.
Repeat echo on [**5-17**] could not exclude constriction but no tamponade physiology noted, EF 65%.
Repeat CT scans and TTE on [**5-26**] showed resolution of pericardial effusion but persistent constrictive physiology due to pericarditis.
TTE prior to discharge however showed a preserved EF without pericardial effusion.
# Hypernatremia: Developed hypernatremia [**5-24**] with Na rising from 143 to 149.
# Multiple small dark stools: He had several low volume bloody movements starting on [**6-1**] and on [**6-3**].
Patient was evaluated by GI who performed an EGD and flex sig which did not show findings consistent with his symptoms.
# Right knee swelling (s/p arthroscopic washout and medial meniscal debridement and synovectomy at OSH):  Remained swollen and tender during hospital course.
Given concern for persistent septic arthritis, orthopedics attempted arthrocentesis on [**5-23**] which did not return synovial fluid.
Additionally, LENI US of right leg was negative for DVT on [**5-20**] and [**5-23**].
Suspect likely due to leukemic synovitis, which is rare, but is associated with leukemias of monocytic lineage, generally in an area with a pre-existing injury like with this patient.
Additional leg swelling likely secondary to buildup of edema in setting of knee surgery on that leg.
Pt's knee pain was well controlled with pain medications at the time of discharge.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt's Cr became persistently elevated around [**6-3**] following dye load.
# Elevated INR: Unclear etiology.
No signs of bleeding.
