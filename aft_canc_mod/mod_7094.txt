Admission Date:  [**2142-1-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-1-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2082-11-27**]     Sex:  M  Service:Neurosurgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 59 year old right handed man was initially found to have a left parasagittal frontoparietal glioma in [**2124**].
He had right leg weakness developing back in [**2120**].
By the time he was operated on he had recurrent focal seizures and was having severe right virtually no fine motor control at the ankle or foot.
He had moderate fine movement in the right hand.
He underwent surgical excision and there was malignant alteration with increased cellularity and single cell necrosis and extensive multifocal tissue necrosis with large diffusely infiltrating histologic benign component typical of required reoperation.
He did well again until [**2139**] when he was found to have a small recurrence in the posterior margin of the removal cavity.
The area of gadolinium enhancement on MR scan cleared and he did well until the summer of [**2141**] when he started having focal partial seizures involving the right hand.
Repeat MRI scan showed recurrence of a gadolinium enhanced tumor again in the posterior margin of the removal cavity in the parietal region posteriorly.
Repeat SPECT scan with thallium was consistent with tumor recurrence.
It was thought that the risks outweighed the benefits and that since the area was one which could be approached surgically without high risk to function, removal of as much active tumor as possible was the best course of treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has known esophageal reflux.
He did not use tobacco or alcohol.
He had L5-S1 lumbar fusion many years before in the [**2110**] for spondylolisthesis of L-5 on S-1.
He had the prior left parietal craniotomies in [**2124**] and [**2128**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck was supple with no adenopathy, no thyromegaly and trachea midline.
Cardiac exam showed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 with no murmurs.
Abdominal exam showed no organomegaly, no masses or tenderness and all bowel sounds to be present.
Extremities showed no joint deformities, no peripheral edema and full pulses throughout.
He had right upper extremity weakness and fairly severe fine movement deficit now in the right upper extremity which was worse than prior to the tumor recurrence.
Lower extremities showed minimal movement of the foot at the right ankle in dorsiflexion with no separate toe movement.
He walked with a limp favoring the right side.
Sensory exam showed hyperesthesia in the right ring and little fingers without splitting of the ring finger.
This was leading to a question of whether he might have some ulnar nerve entrapment syndrome at the elbow.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following admission the patient was immediately taken to the operating room where the left craniotomy was reopened utilizing the navigational assistance of the viewscope for excision of the tumor recurrence.
On the second day of his post-op course he had a syncopal episode while sitting up for half an hour and had a focal seizure involving the right side.
He had transient increased right sided weakness which cleared within several hours.
From that point on he had no further problems.
He had very little headache.
He had no drainage from the incision site.
His right upper extremity deficit remained approximately the same as it had been prior to surgery.
Recurrent left parietal oligodendroglioma.
Esophageal reflux by history.
Epilepsy secondary to diagnosis #1.
