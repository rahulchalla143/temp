Admission Date:  [**2119-3-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-8-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 65686**] Chief Complaint: new left hemianopsia with cerbral hemorrheage and edema admitted to ICU for medical management  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter  History of Present Illness: 64 year old male with metastatic renal cell to brain, spine, larynx, liver and lung, s/p avastin, recurrent pulmonary emboli on lovenox, presented to the ED with worsening right sided visual field loss.
He reports intermittant blurry vision and flashes of light accompanied by headaches x 2 1/2 weeks with worsening symptoms over the past 6 days.
Three days ago he had severe bitemporal headache which he describes as [**5-12**] and throbbing.
Around the same time, he noted right sided hemianopsia with "psychadelic" flashes of light and colors.
On the day of admission, he presented to an opthalmologist who performed a dialated exam and determined that his vision loss was not related to a primary occular lesion and recommended presentation to the ED.
CT head showed progression of known left occipital/parietal mass with worsening hemorrheage and edema (compared with MRI [**12-13**].
Neurosurgery was consulted who recommended blood pressure control and FFP but did not recommend surgery or seizure prophylaxis.
Upon arrival to ICU, patient reported [**2-9**] bifrontal headache and continued right hemianopsia.
He reported word finding difficulites and short term memory loss over the past weeks to months.
Review of sytems: (+) increased hemoptysis in last week, and increased respiratory secretions (-) Denies numbness/tingling in his extremities, denies gait instability, muscle weakness.Denies fever, chills, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied shortness of breath.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

- [**2116-5-3**], multiple new lung nodules as well as bony sclerotic lesions and liver lesion.
- [**2117-6-2**], removal of excess subglottic tissue and pathology was consistent with metastatic renal carcinoma, larynx and subglottic metastasis resection with a permanent tracheostomy.
- [**2117-11-14**], staging MRI mass in the posterior right temporal lobe.
- [**2117-10-26**], CyberKnife radiosurgery to the left posterior temporal lobe lesion.
- [**2118-3-3**], gadolinium-enhanced lumbosacral spine MRI showed left posterior vertebral body L1 metastasis.
New nodule seen on CT scan of torso.
MRI lumbar spine [**2118-11-7**] showed epidural disease at L1.

On Discharge: Vitals: 96.3 BP: 148/71, HR: 50, RR: 18, O2 93% RA General: NAD, HEENT: EOMI PEERLA, MMM, oropharynx clear, right temporal visual field hemianopsia (stable) Neck: JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  Obese soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds normoactive no hepatosplenomegaly.
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no edema Neuro: CN II-XII intact, Normal tone bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
[**3-16**] CXR: Innumerable pulmonary nodules, relatively stable compared to next preceding CT, compatible with metastases.
No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia.
[**3-16**] Admission CT Head: New intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect centered on previous left median occipital lobe metastasis.
Stable left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with stable edema and mass effect.
[**2119-3-17**]: Duplex U/S bilaterally: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
The post-contrast sequence does not demonstrate other foci of post-contrast T1 hyperintensity within the brain parenchyma to suggest other lesion.
The hemorrhage produces intrinsic T1 hyperintensity which could mask underlying enhancing lesion as seen on the prior MRI in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted with progressive headaches and right hemanopsia and found to have worsening hemorrhagic mass in the left parietal/occipital region and admitted to the ICU for medical management.
# Hemorrhagic brain metastasis: Patient with renal cell carcinoma, known brain metastasis, and currently on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
Head CT on admission was remarkable for an enlarged edematous and hemorrhagic mass extending into the occipital and parietal lobes, which explained right homonymous hemianopsia.
Head CT was repeated which showed no progression for hemorrheage/edema.
On [**2119-3-22**] he had an episode of hypertension and was otherwise asymptomatic.
# Increased intracranial pressure: Patient complained of worsening headache on admission and was bradycardic and hypertensive ([**1-5**] components of [**Location (un) **] triad).
Headache improved and experienced no change in neurologic examination to suggest herniation or increased ICP.
Bradycardia and hypertension resolved.
# Hypertension: Given concern for acute hemorrheage we aimed to maintain SBP 120-140.
He was also initially continued on his outpatient Metoprolol Tartrate 50 [**Hospital1 **], which was held in the setting of starting Nimodipine for vasospasm to prevent relative hypotension.
On [**2119-3-22**] he had an episode of hypertension and was otherwise asymptomatic.
# Pulmonary embolisms: Patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary emboli, and was previously anticoagulated with warfarin and then changed to Lovenox 3/[**2118**].
He underwent placement of an IVC filter on [**3-17**] by Interventional Radiology to prevent future clot propogation.
# Hemoptysis: Possibly related to multiple pulmonary metastasis in the setting of anitcoagulation.
New pulmonary embolism is unlikely given absence of tachycardia or hypoxia.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney disease: Baseline Cr appears to be 1.3-1.4.
# Hyponatremia: Thought to be secondary to SIADH given underlying intracranial and pulmonary disease.
Urine lytes revealed sodium avidity with a highly concentrated urine, likely a mixed picture (dehydration with underlying SIADH).
# Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Patient diagnosed with RCC after biopsy of metastatic pulmonary lesion.
He has metastatic involvment of brain, spinal cord, lungs and larynx.
Admission chest xray showed worsening of pulmonary metastatic disease.
His hemorrhagic brain mass has been well controlled with steroid therapy.
# Chronic low back pain with neuropathy: Patient is on gabapentin and oxydonone for chronic low back pain and neuropathy.
Gabapentin was initially held on admission to avoid sedating medications and pain was controled with oxycodone + oxycontin at home dose.
His pain was relatively well controlled and his gabapentin was restarted at the time of discharge.
Benadryl 25 mg Capsule Sig: [**12-4**] Capsules PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
12. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
18. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Nursing & Therapy Center - [**Location 1268**] ([**Location (un) 86**] Center for Rehabilitation and Sub-Acute Care)  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hemorrhagic lesion in the brain .
Secondary Diagnosis: metastatic Renal Cell Cancer Hypertension Bradycardia Pulmonary embolus Hemoptysis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because of increasing headache and loss of vision on the right side.
We found that the lesion in your brain was hemorrhaging and your lovenox was stopped and you were started on IV steroids and medications to control your blood pressure.
Repeat MRI on [**2119-3-20**] showed that the bleeding in the brain has remained stable and is not getting worse.
