Patient is a poor historian, and much of the history was obtained from the chart.
According to OMR, it appears that patient has had a subacute weight loss of nearly 20 pounds over the last 2 years of unclear etiology.
Additionally, she has had hoarse voiceness since approximately [**11-18**].

Unfortunately a complete laryngeal evaluation could not be performed due to stiffness and extra-pyramidal side effects from her psychiatric medication.
In [**8-19**], she was found to have purulent drainage and likely skin infection on her neck, and she was prescribed cephalexin initially and then levofloxacin with minimal improvement.
Ultimately, she had a CT neck performed on [**2153-11-8**] which demonstrated a large laryngeal mass, concerning for airway compromise.
Her mother is listed as her healthcare proxy, but her mother is elderly with many medical problems herself.
Exam was notable for marked laryngeal mass with biopsy site without erythema or drainage.
ENT was consulted in the ED, and they found patent airway without evidence of airway compromise.

Laryngeal Mass: Biopsy demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma.
PET scan was performed on [**11-14**] and showed her known neck mass as well as 2 concerning lymph nodes.
Following surgery, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for post-trach care.
She was transiently hypotensive, likely secondary to hypovolemia, but was hemodynamically stable throughout and responded well to IVF.
She was noted to diffusely rhonchous on lung exam, likely due to inability to clear secretions, and was given nebs treatment with clinical improvement.
Her pain is under good control with Fentanyl patch and Tylenol.
She had supportive care on the floor and trach and PEG site appeared to be healing well.
Dysphagia with aspiration: Secondary to laryngeal cancer.
She initially refused NGT and PEG, so was allowed to eat puree and thin liquids under direct 1:1 supervision for small quantities.
Anemia: Normocytic, decreased from recent baseline but stable in house.
No evidence of bleeding, iron studies c/w aocd.
Benign Hypertension: Stable, ACEi held given her dysphagia but metoprolol continued at 12.5 mg po bid.
She mainly got it in the morning, but evening doses were held due to relative bradycardia (HR 50's).
