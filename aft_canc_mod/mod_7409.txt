Admission Date:  [**2180-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-2-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-6-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital 47**] hospital for balloon pericardiotomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: balloon pericardiotomy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75 yo woman with PMH of Lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) diagnosed in [**2176**], on maintenance XRT and chemotherapy, history of HTN, diastolic dysfunction, and CRI who presents from [**Hospital 47**] hospital with newly noted pericardial effusion for balloon pericardiotomy.
Patient states that she was feeling in her USOH until 2 weeks prior to presentation at [**Hospital 47**] hospital, when began feeling sick with cough, described as dry cough productive of only scant amounts of yellow sputum.
Per patient, has cough at baseline productive of white, foamy sputum, from her lung ca, but this cough was different.
Over the next 2 weeks, her cough progressed, was associated with fever to around 100 on-and-off, SOB with exertion, and on day of presentation to [**Location (un) 47**], had episode of nausea and vomiting.
2 days PTA, she started on doxycycline prescribed by her outpatient physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improvement and in fact worsening of her symptoms.
She denies any orthopnea, PND, LE swelling, change in weight, palpitations, lightheadedness/dizziness, change in bowel habits, urinary symptoms during this time.
On presentation to the OSH on [**2180-2-12**], patient was found to be hypoxic, requiring oxygen through nasal cannula.
During [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at [**Location (un) 47**], she had an admission CXR demonstrating large RUL and RML consolidation, mass like lesion in R hilum c/w pneumonia, ?post-obstructive, ?recurrent ca.
Patient also had ECHO done in the ED that demonstrated small pericardial effusion of 1.1 cm, no evidence of tamponade.
Follow up ECHO 5 days after admission demonstrated increase of her pericardial effusion, still no evidence of tamponade, and therefore patient was transferred for balloon pericardiotomy.
HTN 3.)
Diastolic heart failure (cath in [**2176**] w/ elevated filling pressures - RA 19, PA 52/26, mean PCWP 26) 4.)

CXR [**2-18**]: IMPRESSION: Interval development of marked right-sided upper lung volume loss.
At least partial obstruction of the right upper and right middle lobe bronchi is not excluded.
Airspace opacity, most evident in the left mid and lower lung zones, with left-sided small pleural effusion.
The findings represent mild pulmonary edema.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo woman with PMH of lung cancer, diastolic dysfxn, CRI, who presented with pericardial effusion for pericaricentesis and pericardiotomy.
# Pericardial effusion: pt had successful balloon pericardiotomy performed, 300cc removed during procedure, 300cc additionally via drain, this was kept in place until output was < 500cc/8hr and removed on [**2-19**], repeat echo prior to removal showed trace effusion remaining.
Cytology pending at time of discharge, although most likely cause felt to be malignancy given hx of lung CA.
# Cardiac: A. Coronaries: Patient without evidence of ischemic heart disease, last cath per OSH records in [**2176**] w/ clean coronary arteries, no signs/sxs of ischemic heart disease currently.
Pump: Patient w/ hx of diastolic heart failure, on lasix 40mg PO QD as outpt.
C. Rhythm: patient initially in NSR, on [**2-19**] she developed sinus tachycardia - ?
[**1-13**] infection vs pericardial irritation.
Pt thereafter was noted to have periods of tachycardia up to 130s with underlying atrial tachycardial/multifocal atrial tachycardia.
She was additionally noted to have episodes of AVNRT with well visualized retrograde p waves.
Overnight [**2-19**] she continued having episode of tachycardia to 120s, BP stable, asymptomatic, resolving spontaneously.
# Pneumonia: Per patient, c/o cough and fever on presentation to OSH.
Per OSH records, ?
On presentation, got repeat CXR that demonstrated severe consolidation of RUL, RML, upper part of RLL.
Likely cancer recurrence as etiology of pericardial effusion as above, and w/ CXR findings from OSH and here, and references to Chest CT findings from OSH.
Plan to: - f/u cytology of pericardial effusion .
On admission, Cr=2.4, trended down to baseline of 2.2, rec'd one addition dose of 20mg lasix for period of shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**], but otherwise continued previous doses of lasix/spironolactone.
# Transaminitis: On admission, pt noted to have elevated transaminases (AST 76, ALT 123, Alk Phos 148, LDH 278).
Possible [**1-13**] congestion vs lung mets, hepatitis panel sent, pending at time of discharge.
# HTN: On atenolol 100mg qd as outpt.
Would not restart atenolol in face of renal insufficiency, would favor toprol XL.
# FEN: Cardiac diet .
