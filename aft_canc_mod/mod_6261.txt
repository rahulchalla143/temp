Procedure today went smoothly and was notable for multiple small AVMs s/p thermal ablation.
While in the recover area, he was getting ready to go home 2 hrs post procedure, when he developed productive cough and later respiratory distress.
Intubation was notable for bloody secretions at this time.
He also had a tachyarrhythmia to the epinephrine which lasted only a short time.

[**6-24**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, the retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly increased.
The extent of interstitial fluid accumulation at the right lung base seems to increase, as expressed by subtle thickening of the peribronchial interstitium.
Minimal left-sided pleural effusion, no newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.

There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**6-25**] CXR SINGLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST, BEDSIDE: There is interval worsening of the diffuse left lung airspace opacity with new areas of opacification in the right mid and lower lobes.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view however there is no gross right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of the diffuse airspace opacity indicating worsening pulmonary edema.
A small pleural effusion is stable.
Unilateral airspace disease in the left lung has started to regress.
No right pleural effusion is seen.
Multiple large sternotomy wires are noted with no complications.
Slowly regressing unilateral airspace disease in the left lung.

Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, COPD here for evaluation of GI bleed who developed respiratory distress requiring intubation along with cardiac arrest following enteroscopy.
# Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt underwent an enteroscopy and colonoscopy for recurrent GI bleeding, following the procedure the patient developed acute respiratory distress requiring intubation.
CXR consistent with pulmonary edema with possible aspiration.
The patient received one dose of vancomycin and cefepime after spiking a fever following intubation with a question of aspiration on CXR.
Antibiotics were discontined on [**6-25**] as pt became afebrile and was without evidence of infiltrate on CXR.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was felt likely to have had pulmonary edema in the setting of receiving ~1.5L IVF during the procedure.
He had no witnessed aspiration event.
PE considered as the pt had evidence of new RV dysfunction of TTE.
LENI negative for evidence of DVT.
# Cardiac Arrest - Immediately following the patient's intubation he was found to have lost a pulse and Code Blue was called.
He had a brief run of VT with pulse and stable BP which broke within seconds without intervention.
The patient has no further events on telemetry.
BB held given a history of SSS and bradycardia.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Following his arrest the patient was found to have a Cr of 1.6.
He was given a single dose of IV lasix for acute respiratory decompensation and diuresed 1L.
Further diuresis was held and Cr trended down to 2.4 prior to discharge.
Urine electrolytes were sent and Furea was 21% consistent with prerenal etiology.
# History of chronic GI bleed: The patient presented for colonoscopy and enteroscopy to evaluate GI bleeding.
He had no evidence of bleeding during his hospitalization.
# CAD s/p CABG: CE negative for new AMI.
Given unclear etiology of arrest and new RV dysfunction the patient should undergo further ischemic workup as outpatient.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt well rate controlled without intervention.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome: transfusion dependent.
Respiratory Failure 3.
Pulmonary Edema 4.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Clinically Improved, ambulating without assistance, afebrile, sating well on room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after suffering a cardiac arrest and respiratory failure following your endoscopy procedure.
You had an Echo which showed new right ventricular dysfunction.
You should follow up with your outpatient cardiologist for further workup of possible ischemic heart disease.
You should also return if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or fever.
