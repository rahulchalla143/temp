Admission Date:  [**2172-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-7-13**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Aspirin / Clindamycin / Erythromycin Base / Bactrim  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  Brief Hospital Course: Respiratory failure:  The patient was intubated and maintained on pressure support ventilation from the time of admission due to respiratory failure with blood gas consistent with hypoxia.
Respiratory failure in this patient was presumably due to impending hemodynamic collapse.
There was no clear evidence of pneumonia or other primary pulmonary process on chest x-ray or on examination.
The patient had small right pleural effusion on admission and developed left pleural effusion during her hospital stay, but these effusions were small and unlikely to contribute to respiratory distress.
Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive on admission with blood pressure as low as 60 over palpation in the emergency department.
This was most likely secondary to GI bleed; although, the patient's elevated white count on admission and continuous hemodynamic instability during her hospital stay despite stable hematocrit indicated that there were likely other contributing factors.
The patient was initially suspected of having sepsis, and was begun on empiric therapy with levofloxacin and Flagyl.
In addition, cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency.
Upper GI bleed:  The patient was admitted with hematocrit of 22 and signs of GI bleed including bright red blood per rectum.
EGD on [**2172-7-5**] demonstrated a bleeding mass in the stomach suspicious for malignancy of the linitis plastica type.
Biopsies were taken and showed adenocarcinoma of the stomach and also diffuse gastritis.
This gastritis was likely the cause of the patient's GI bleed.
The patient was also treated with Protonix IV b.i.d., sucralfate 1 gram by NG tube q.i.d., and fluid resuscitation.
No treatment was available for her diffuse gastric carcinoma and gastritis other  than the above mentioned medications.
Given the stability of her white blood cell count and hematocrit, it was unlikely that this was a dilutional phenomenon.
The possibility of consumptive coagulopathy was most concerning in this patient with gastric carcinoma.
The patient demonstrated no sequelae of thrombocytopenia during her admission.
There was no hypertension, tachycardia, or physical sign of pain.
Eventually, the patient demonstrated physical signs of discomfort, and required Fentanyl boluses in addition to her Fentanyl drip.
Fentanyl boluses were administered as required to maintain strong level of analgesia in the patient.
However, during the hospital course, it became apparent to the intensive care unit team and to the family that the patient's disease was not amenable to cure, and that the patient would likely die of her disease during this admission.
The patient was treated with Fentanyl drip and Fentanyl boluses to maintain analgesia and was observed to be comfortable during her hospital stay.
On [**2172-7-13**], the patient died of cardiovascular collapse, secondary to her diffuse hemorrhagic gastric carcinoma.
