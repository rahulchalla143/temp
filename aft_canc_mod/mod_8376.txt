UTI or PNA was thought to be the offending source and she completed two week course of Levaquin.
Had ventricular ectopy which prompted an echocardiogram which revealed severe AI, a dilated ascending aorta and severe cardiomyopathy.

The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
AV pacing for SB and poor atrial capture.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
Given Penicillin allergy, she received Vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
She arrived in the intensive care unit on Milirone, Epinephrine, and Neosynphrine for hemodynamic support.
She was transfused for anemia with packed red blood cells and hematocrit remained stable post transfusion.
