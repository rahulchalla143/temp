She had a bone marrow aspirate that showed an overwhelming cell type of dysplastic red cell maturation.
She did have a fever to 101.5 overnight.
On admission here, the patient describes a history of worsening dyspnea on exertion over a [**12-27**] week period to the point of being intolerant of five steps upstairs.
She has no shortness of breath at rest.

Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, supple.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, obese, no masses, and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No edema, clubbing, or cyanosis, 2+ distal pulses.
Chem-7 as well as renal function was unremarkable as well as LFTs, which were within normal limits with the exception of a T bilirubin, which was elevated at 1.8, albumin was 3.7.
Bone marrow biopsy at the outside hospital showed hypercellular marrow with only a rare megakaryocyte, infrequent white blood cell overwhelming cell type.
He has dysplastic red cell maturation with frequent megacaryocyte blasts with well-defined nuclei, having frequent clover leaved and binucleate appearance.
Patient had a Hickman central line placed, and subsequently a chemotherapy protocol was initiated including idarubicin and cytarabine.
Initially patient tolerated this regimen well, but did subsequently develop febrile neutropenia at which point her antibiotic regimen was changed from empiric levofloxacin and fluconazole to cefepime, Vancomycin, and then AmBisome in addition.
She received an additional unit of platelets in the setting of a fall from her bed that resulted in a large left orbit hematoma superficially.
She did develop fevers on hospital day #8 in the setting of neutropenia with an ANC of 120.
Patient did have diarrhea during this time as well.
Patient had continued to spike fevers despite this broad-spectrum coverage, and was receiving Tylenol for fever control at the time of this dictation.
Because of her concerns about her nutritional status, TPN was initiated on [**12-24**].
GI:  Patient did develop diarrhea during her hospital stay.
Status post fall:  On the morning of [**12-24**], the patient fell from her bed and sustained a left orbit hematoma.
Patient was sent for an immediate head CT noncontrast, which did rule out any intracranial hemorrhage, but did show a significant left orbit hematoma superficially.
A followup CT of the orbits was done, which revealed no bleeding behind the globe or any compression of the globe.
The patient had no associated visual symptoms.
Ice was applied to the patient's hematoma and an additional bag of platelets was transfused for bleeding control.
Urologic:  The patient did develop hematuria on [**12-21**].
