There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and anterior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion without echo evidence of tamponade.
[**2118-7-12**] Pelvic Ultrasound:  No evidence of a fluid collection.
Moderate amount of subcutaneous edema in the left labial region.
[**2118-7-13**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pulmonary edema has almost completely cleared.
On today's examination, small bilateral pleural effusions are seen.
No acute intra-abdominal process identified.
Non-specific stranding within the anterior subcutaneous tissues of the lower abdomen, compatible with given history of cellulitis.
No abscess identified.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, new from [**2118-6-28**].
Resolution of pericardial effusion.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and anterior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Small to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
There is still no clear-cut echo evidence of tamponade.
The wall motion abnormalities and ejection fraction are similar.
Interval progression of the large mediastinal mass has considerably increased in size since the previous examination of [**2118-3-21**].
Mild increase in size of pre-existing paraaortic lymph nodes.
CT Neck [**2118-7-29**]: Larynx appears obliterated on the axial scan due to adduction of left vocal cord.
Mediastinal mass continues to enlarge.
Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2118-7-24**]: Final Results Pending   Brief Hospital Course: 1)Febrile Neutropenia: Pt admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia.
Blood cultures from admission were positive for 4/4 bottles pansensitive pseudomonas, with most likely source being gut translocation versus labial eschar/cellulitis.
Patient remained afebrile from [**7-16**] to time of discharge and has remained hemodynamically stable.
At time of discharge she is no longer neutropenic, afebrile and feeling well.
2)Mantle cell lymphoma: s/p RICE (day 1 [**6-29**]).
A Chest CT scan on [**7-22**] did not show a significant change compared to her Chest CT on [**2118-6-28**] indicating that her lymphoma was resistant to the RICE she received.
However, on [**7-29**] she had an acute episode of stridor/dysphagia that resolved after steroids and benadryl.
A Neck CT on [**7-29**] showed approx 90% compression of her esophagus by her mediastinal mass.
ENT saw patient and noted right vocal cord paralysis, which has been known.
At time of discharge patient was able to eat soft solids and thin liquids without no issues.
3)NSTEMI - on [**2118-7-11**] she had 19 beat run of VT with associated dyspnea, also with bump in cardiac enzymes.
She had and echocardiogram [**7-11**] which showed moderate hypokinesis of the anterior and septal walls that was new compared with prior from [**2118-3-9**].
She was evaluated by cardiology who did not feel that diagnostic cath was indicated in the setting of her recent chemo.
4) L Labial cellulitis: She had a cellulitis extending from her lower abdomen to her left labia and peri-rectal area.
Initially patient had moderate pain to palpation of area.
A translabial U/S on [**2118-7-11**] showed no evidence of abscess or fluid collection.
Abd/Pelvic CT on [**7-15**] also did not show an evidence of abscess or fluid collection.
5) L labial and L peri-rectal ulcer: Ulcers noted upon admission at which time they were covered by black eschars.
Seem to be c/w ecthyma gangrenosum.
At time of discharge ulcers looked clean and seemed to be forming increased granulation tissue.
)(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pseudomonas bacteremia Secondary: cellulitis, mantle cell lymphoma   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with nausea/vomitting and fever and found to have an infection in your blood.
It is recommended that you have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient.
We also found that you had a skin infection on your lower abdomen and genital area.
In regards to your mantle cell lymphoma, we rescanned chest and scanned your neck and found the the mass in your neck has enlarged.
If you should have fevers, chills, night sweats, significant nausea or vomitting, chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness please go to your local emergency room.
