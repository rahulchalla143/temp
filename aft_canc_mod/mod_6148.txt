History of Present Illness:  Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is an 85yoM with a h/o CAD, HLD, and bladder cancer who is s/p cardiac cath last week showing 40% LAD and 40% DI who is now transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after an episode of substernal chest pain and EKG e/o anterior STEMI.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2191-8-4**] after an episode of substernal chest pain and elevated troponin at OSH of 0.54.
He had a cardiac cath which showed 40% LAD and 40% DI.
Today at 8am developed [**10-17**] substernal chest pain, called EMS and was brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where EKG was c/f anterior STEMI.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -S/p cath [**2191-8-4**]: mid LAD 40% lesion with an ostial D1 40% lesion, unchanged from elective cath in [**2188**] -S/p cath [**2188**]: mid LAD 40% lesion with an ostial D1 40% lesion 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - h/o bladder cancer, currently treated with chemo and radiation, in mid-cycle, s/p cystoscopic surgery - h/o herniated disc - s/p appendectomy - arthritis - s/p right rotator cuff surgery  Social History: -Tobacco history:  quit 28 y/a, smoked 1 ppd x 40 years -ETOH: used to drink about [**2-10**] drinks/day, stopped drinking one month ago when diagnosed with bladder cancer -Illicit drugs:  denies -ambulates independently, lives with wife who had a stroke three  years ago   Family History: No family history of  MI, stroke, congestive heart failure.
Father had stomach cancer  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: VS: T=95.6 BP=124/55 HR=77 RR=15 O2 sat= 94% GENERAL: NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Cath sites without hematomas or bruits bilaterally.
Right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-8-4**] there is no significant change .
Single vessel disease.
No significant stenosis.
Limited coronary angiography in this right dominant system for STEMI demonstrated total occlusion of the LAD and D1.
The LAD had proximal calcification and diffuse 50-60% disease followed by a total occlusion.
D1 also had 100% occlusion at its origin.
The LCx had mild luminal irregularities but was otherwise patent.
The RCA was not injected due to recent angiography 7 days prior.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 131 mmHg.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2191-8-12**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior, septal segments and apex.
The remaining segments exhibit compensatory hyperkinesis and the overall LVEF is only mildly reduced at 40%.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No retroperitoneal bleeding/hematoma.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon with no diverticulitis.
Trace amount of bilateral pleural effusion.
man with a h/o known CAD, HLD, and bladder cancer who presented with chest pain and was found to have an anterior STEMI with cardiac catheterization showed complete occlusion of the proximal LAD.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Anterior STEMI: Patient presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] after an episode of [**10-17**] substernal chest pain.
EKG at [**Hospital1 **] showed an anterior STEMI and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a complete occlusion of the proximal LAD.
ECHO HD # 1 showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior, septal segments and apex.
Overall LVEF is only mildly reduced at 40%.
Given apical akinesis, coumadin was considered but ultimately not given due to his high risk of bleeding complication with triple anticoagulation therapy and his recent falls.
# R femoral bruit: Of note, the patient had a right femoral bruit at the site of his catheterization from [**2191-8-4**].
Arterial doppler did not show any evidence of an AVM, fistula or aneurysm.
On physical exam on HD1, patient had ecchymosis on bilateral posterior hips without complaints of tenderness.
CT abdomen showed no retroperitoneal bleed or hematoma.
Pt receiving chemo/radiation for localized bladder cancer at OSH.
CHRONIC ISSUES # H/o herniated disc: His home dose oxycodone was continued as needed for back pain.
4. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual PRN for chest pain as needed for chest pain: if you take three and chest pain still has not resolved, please [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 37**] House Rehab & Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation myocardial infarction Bladder cancer Dyslipidemia Acute Sytolic Dysfunction   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and needed to have stents placed in your heart arteries to keep the arteries open.
Please weigh yourself every day and call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if you notice your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Start metoprolol to lower your heart rate and help prevent another heart attack 3.
Start tylenol to use for the pain in your back 5.
