The appearance of the left ventricular myocardium suggests infiltrative disease.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
-renal/abdominal ultrasound - Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration.
More serious forms of steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and/or cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Normal kidneys without any explanation for acute renal insufficiency.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Numerous anechoic ovoid lesions in the right lateral abdominal subcutaneous fat.
The location of these lesions should be correlated with history of prior subcutaneous injections that could represent incompletely absorbed injected medications.
Ideally, this would be with intravenous contrast; however, a non-contrast CT may still useful in the setting of acute renal failure.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo female with history of stage IIIA colon cancer s/p resection who is admitted for restrictive cardiomyopathy suggestive of cardiac amyloid.
Hospital course complicated with pre-renal acute renal failure.
ACUTE ISSUES:  # Restrictive Cardiomyopathy/?Cardiac Amyloid - displayed predominantly right-sided symptoms in the setting of bilateral ventricular failure.
Echocardiogram showed moderate symmetric LVH with moderately depressed systolic function, restrictive left ventricular filling, and a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, and the appearance of the left ventricular myocardium suggested infiltrative disease (likely amyloid).
ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] was not given in the setting of mildly low blood pressures (80-100s).
Her fluid status was optimized and she waill have outpatient FU with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 1708**] to monitor heart failure /cardiac amyloid along with TTR gene.
# Acute Kidney Injury/Pre-Renal - creatinine on admission was 2.2 (from baseline of 1.3 earlier in the week, per conversation with PCP).
This continued to rise during the first several days of the hospital course, elevating as high as 3.1 with anuria, but Cr began to decline and urine output began to improve with aggressive diuresis (lasix gtt).
# Cellulitis/erysepilas on L flank - on [**6-3**] patient began to complain of new pain on skin of left flank, which was found to be erythematous and tender.
# Altered mental status - CT head was negative for acute intracranial process in the emergency room.
# Elevated troponins - there did not appear to be any acute ST or T-wave changes suggestive of ischemia, and her troponins trended down quickly after admission.
She remained free of chest pain and shortness of breath, and given her [**Last Name (un) **], this was likely due to her renal dysfunction and not a cardiac cause, and so her heparin gtt and plavix were discontinued soon after admission.
#Ventricular Ectopy/Non sustained Ventricular tachycardia- Patient has had multiple episodes of asymptomatic NSVT likely secondary to her infiltrative and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
# Complicated Acute Cystitis - Urine grew proteus mirabilis sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
# Thrombocytopenia - Patient's platelets initially dropped (200->85) while on Heparin SQ (prophylaxis).
HIT antibodies were positive, but further review in the lab demonstrated low optical density and unlikely to have true HIT.
Heparin could continue to be used for the patient as prophylaxis and was used in her port a cath.
CHRONIC ISSUES:  # Anemia - per PCP baseline hematocrit is in 30??????s.
Pt was asymptomatic throughout.
# Pituitary adenoma s/p transphenoidal resection in [**2160**] - continued on home levothyroxine and prednisone.
There, she will have continued workup for her restrictive cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloid.
During hospitalization, housestaff reached out to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center to perform [**Country **]-red stain on removed colon cancer from patient's previous surgery.
# Colon cancer s/p resection in [**2179-3-7**] - stage IIIA cancer (pT2N1bM0 per [**Hospital1 3278**] pathology report).
Stoma with poor output and no erythema.
Superficial masses palpated in abdomen, possibly due to multiple heparin injections but potentially due to abdominal metastases.
# Thrombocytopenia developed during the hospital course and was initially concerning for HIT (Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia) so appropriate antibodies were sent.
PF4 antibodies came back positive so all heparin prophylaxis was stopped but hematology thought that due to the low optical density it was a false positive and that heparin could be used.
Her platelets have since decreased slightly (115) with a pending serotonin release assay that was drawn on [**6-9**].
# Patient's UTI was positive for Proteus mirabilis which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin which she was started on a 10-day course on [**6-4**].
# Patient had left flank erythema adjacent to her stoma site.
The stoma itself looked clean and without infection, but due to its proximity, her presumed cellulitis was treated with coverage for GPC's with Vancomycin and GNR's with Ciprofloxacin which had just been started as stated above.
During the nights, she would have episodes of Non sustained Ventricular tachycardia that was asymptomatic.
During her second to last night, she had her longest episode which was 25 beats and she was then increased on her Metoprolol Tartrate to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
She denies low mood, but certainly may be depressed.

She complains of no chest pain, SOB, palpitations, or abdominal pain.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You have a new heart condition, likely called Amyloidosis of the heart.
You were found to have some kidney problems.
You had a cellulitis of the skin of your stomach (skin infection) for which we gave you antibiotics.
You also had a urine infection for which we treated with antibiotics.
