Taken to [**Hospital3 **] out of concern for acute stroke.
CXR without read but to me appears volume overloaded.
Neuro was consulted who felt that his sxs were possibly recrudescence of his old infarct, but cannot r/o new process; however given his current state, was not candidate for acute intervention until medically stabilized.
He was initially on nasal cannula, but was placed on Bipap for tachypnea and was unable to be weaned off Bipap for tachypnea.

Mild L facial weakness, otherwise CNII-XII intact.
Microbiology MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2174-8-7**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Blood Culture x2, Routine (Final [**2174-8-11**]):    NO GROWTH.
Echo [**2174-8-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and basal inferolateral segments.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Narrowing of the distal sigmoid colon proximal to the rectal tube  presumably representing peristalsis, however, correlation with sigmoidoscopy or repeat scan is recommended given the clinical history.
Nonspecific perinephric stranding and renal cysts.
is a 72 year old male with a history of multifocal vascular disease including CABG, CVA x2, PVD, fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, carotid disease, SMA/celiac stenting, and CKD who presented with altered mental status and CHF exacerbation.
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: The patient was found with altered mental status at home.
He was seen by neurology, who felt it unlikely that symptoms were due to ischemia and did not recommend an MRI.
His mental status improved with diuresis for CHF exacerbation.
# GI Bleed with acute blood loss anemia: In the MICU on [**8-6**] the patient had melena and bright red blood per rectum and his hct dropped to 24 from 28 on admission.
He initially refused EGD due to discomfort with attempted NG tube placement.
The EGD showed findings compatible with gastritis and colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and proximal ascending colon as well as grade 1 internal hemorrhoids.
A follow up appointment was arranged with gastroenterology to consider capsule endoscopy and vascular surgery.
# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation: In the ED the patient was found to be fluid overloaded on exam, had a CXR showing pulmonary edema, and had a BNP of ~20,000.
An echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
After transfer to the medicine service, his volume status remained normal without intervention and he did not require supplemental oxygen.
He had no signs of fluid overload on discharge exam and was therefore not discharged on scheduled lasix.
His weights should be tracked on a daily basis with oral LAsix diuresis started if he gains more than 3 pounds from one day to the next or if his weights trend upward significantly.
# Myocardial demand ischemia: The patient's troponin trended up from 0.08-> 0.1 with decrease in CK and MB.
He denied having any chest pain, nausea, vomiting or jaw pain throughout his admission.
He had <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] changes on V3-V6 similar to other prior EKGs, except for new depression on V6.
This was likely due to demand ischemia.
Pt continued to be asymptomatic after transfer to the medicine service without complaint.
# Chronic mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia requiring celiac and SMA stents and resulting in chronic abdominal pain.
Per above, mesenteric ischemia was thought to be the most likely etiology of his GI bleed.
His pain was controlled with Oxycontin standing and oxycodone PRN.
Acute kidney injury, prerenal, due to acute blood loss anemia:  The patient came in with a creatinine of 2.4 which trended down to 1.6 after pRBCs  and continued to remain stable after transfer to the medicine service.
# Prostate Ca: Home bicalutamide was held after discussion with his PCP.
# Depression/Grief: [**Name (NI) **] wife recently died 3 weeks ago and he was very tearful often with no provocation.
