There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

He remained hypertensive and was initially maintained on Nitroglycerin and Labetalol with Hydralazine prn.
He concomitantly experienced persistent hypoxia and desaturations.
With gentle diuresis, ambulation, incentive spirometry, and aggressive pulmonary toilet there was gradual improvement of oxygen saturations.
Postoperative CT scan was notable for a stable Type B aortic dissection with all major branches arising from the true lumen, including each main renal artery.
The CT scan was also notable for bibasilar atelectasis and small to moderate pleural effusions.
The vascular service was consulted for possible aortic fenestration.
Aortic fenestration was not performed on this admission as there was no indication for same.
