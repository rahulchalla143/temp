History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]M with hx of afib, hypertension, ?dCHF, recent aspiration pneumonia, being treated with levofloxacin and flagyl, presenting from home with increasing SOB since midnight, increased secretions, decreased mental status overnight.
Unclear if patient has been having fevers at home.
EKG showed AFib rate 131 with no ischemic changes.
CXR showed increase in pleural effusions and atelectasis bibasilar.
Trop elevated at 0.13, increased past his baseline.
Patient was trialed with BiPap, which he did not tolerate well due to altered mental status.
He is able to squeeze hands to commands and answer some yes or no questions.

Mild interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and associated basal atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
EKG [**4-23**]-Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
There is a regularity which may represent atrial flutter.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
LENI [**4-23**]- IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right lower extremity.
[**4-24**] UENI-IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right upper extremity .
Bilateral pleural effusions are large.
Interstitial pulmonary edema is unchanged.
No definitive pneumothorax is noted on the current study.
TTE ([**2145-4-27**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild septal hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Note is made of bilateral pleural effusions, which appear unchanged.
These effusions as well as overlying basal subsegmental atelectasis result in partial obscuration of the cardiac silhouette which nevertheless appears minimally changed.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are also unchanged, with note again being made of  atherosclerotic calcification along the aorta.

# Respiratory Distress: Shortness of breath and hypoxemia likely [**1-27**] aspiration and flash pulmonary edema from diastolic heart failure and afib with RVR.
His O2 status rapidly improved, and it was thought that he unlikely had HAP, given that he lives at home (with 24 hour care), and did not show signs of infection.
He remained afebrile without signs of infection throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
His aspiration diet was continued without changes.
# Diastolic CHF: He was admitted with flash pulmonary edema with markedly elevated BNP, in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.
He was also total body volume overloaded with 3+ pitting edema throughout.
Although he is listed to have chronic renal insufficiency, his creatinine tolerated diuresis well with no elevation.
On discharge, he required no O2, but he should continue diuresis with daily weights and urine output monitoring .
# Altered Mental Status: Likely toxic-metabolic etiology in setting of hypoxia in the setting of underlying dementia.
He does have elevated WBC to 13, likely all secondary to aspiration pneumonitis (now less likely pneumonia).
Pt did have loose stools on arrival to floor and has been on antibiotics recently, though one of these antibiotics has been flagyl.
Leukocytosis resolved and pt remained afebrile on the regular medical floor.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.0 on presentation, actually lower than baseline, but urine output had been low since arrival to ED and ICU.
Urine electrolytes on admission c/w prerenal state.
His Cr remained normal/stable during admission .
# Atrial Fibrillation: His rate was relatively well controlled after 1-2 days with iv metoprolol, transitioned to po metoprolol (he previously was not on metoprolol as outpt).
# Elevated troponins, thought to be demand ischemia vs. NSTEMI in setting of RVR: Cardiac enzymes trended downward.
# Hyponatremia: Patient with Na 128, which is likely in setting of fluid overload.
# Right arm and Leg Swelling: He was ruled out for DVT in the setting of initially R>L extremity swelling.
His edema, later more symmetrical on turning, likely represents dependent edema along with full body anasarca.
Precautions: Aspiration .
