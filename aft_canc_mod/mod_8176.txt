#MICU Course:  Patient admitted with tachycardia in the setting of 2 episodes BRBPR.
Prior to transfer to ICU, the patient had a 3rd episode of large BRBPR.
CTA showed pooling of extravasated blood in the cecum, extensive diverticulosis, and no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.
In the evening, she once again became hemodynamically unstable with large BRBPR and returned to angiography.
The patient underwent EGD that did not show evidence of upper GIB.
Colonoscopy revealed no bleeding to cecum but could not pass the scope into the terminal ileum.
Multiple diverticuli were seen on right side of colon, no AVMs, and a 2.5cm polyp was tattooed that will need removal as an outpatient.
She was seen by the Surgery team, who felt that if she continued to bleed, she would require a total abdominal colectomy, given that her bleeding appeared to be originating in the right colon and she had a large polyp concerning for malignancy in the left colon.
The frequency of her bleeding then decreased and her hematocrit remained stable, so she was transferred from the MICU to the floor.
#[**Hospital1 139**] Wards Course:  The patient was received hemodynamically stable, without complaints.
She did not have any bleeding, and her hematocrit remained stable without transfusions.
She had an isolated drop in hematocrit that was stable at repeat without transfusion or other intervention.
The plan was for a colectomy to remove the suspected source of bleeding and the polyp concerning for malignancy.
She preferred not to stay in the hospital until her elective surgery, and there was no medical reason to keep her as she had been stable with no further bleeding or hematocrit drop, and was tolerating a regular diet well.
##Surgery: Patient was offered surgical management of GI bleeding as an outpatient, and agreed to return to the hospital next week for subtotal colectomy, colorectal anastomosis, and possible stoma.
Given her hypotension secondary to her GI bleed, her home medications were held on admission.
#AAA with recent type II endoleak: Chronic, s/p EVAR in [**7-26**] and repair of type 2 endoleak in [**8-25**].
No evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.
On admission, vascular was made aware of the patient's admission, and stated it was safe to hold aspirin given her GI bleed and the possibility of surgery.
You had a colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis which you had been diagnosed with previously, and a polyp (a small protrusion of bowel that can sometimes turn into cancer).
Everyone agrees that your bleeding was likely related to diverticulosis in your colon.
After speaking with the surgeons, it was decided to have an operation to remove your colon to prevent future bleeding and to remove the polyp.
You should stop these three medications because your blood pressure was normal without them, and we do not want to put you at risk for bleeding again before your surgery.
