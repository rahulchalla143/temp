1 week earlier pt had a low grade fever.
The patient was brought to the hospital today for an elective ERCP for elevated LFTS.
Pt had dilation and stenting of common bile duct that had become obstructed due to tumor.
Wife states that he has been in poor mental status ever since the procedure.

For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
No pneumothorax.
Cardiomegaly with patchy opacities, representing congestive heart failure and patchy pulmonary edema.
Increased opacity in left lower lobe, suggesting either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Multiple ill-defined nodular opacities in bilateral lungs, most likely representing metastatic disease.

He was given 1.5 liters of fluid and his BP imrpoved to 90/60.
The hypotension was most likely from cholangitis/procedure, but could have been exacerbated by his liver disease and meds (thorazine, ERCP sedatives).
However, on [**9-8**] a CXR showed pulmonary edema/CHF and IV fluids were discontinued.
The ERCP fellow felt that this could be due to sepsis and liver metastasis and not necessarily indicative of a re-occlusion of the stented area.
Respiratory: The patient had a difficult lung exam secondary to poor air movement.
Crackles were auscultated in the right mid lung upon transfer to the floor, and the following day a CXR was ordered to better evaluate the lungs; it showed stable nodules (mets) but also seemed c/w pulmonary edema.
The following day LENIs were ordered to rule out a DVT/PE and were negative.
Adrenal Insufficiency:  Cosyntropin stimulation test on [**9-7**] was positive for adrenal insufficiency.
Therefore the patient was empirically started on stress-dose steroids and mineralocorticoids but these were stopped on [**9-9**] as BP elevated appropriately.
Mental Status Changes: The patient presented to his ERCP appointment already having had some mental status changes from baseline.
On [**9-9**], he reported that he was in increased pain [**2-22**] his narcotics being held (he usually takes oxycontin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home).
He was started on 30mg oxycontin with morphine IV for breakthrough and tolerated this well with improved pain control.
His pain was well controlled on discharge.
Anemia: The patient had a chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the low 30s for several months.
Decreased UOP: The day of his ERCP the patient had a very poor urine output, likely secondary to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion.
He has a hx of DVT but in light of anemia and low platelets he was only placed on pneumoboots.
He was stable with no evidence of DVT/PE, and had a negative bilateral LENI on the day of discharge.
Pain medications were added back during hospitalization after being initially held, his pain was well controlled on discharge.
Additionally he had peripheral access.
IVF was discontinued when his CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema (see above).
Proph: The patient had pneumoboots, but was not given heparin SQ given his low platelets.
Code: The patient and family decided that his code status would be mechanical ventilation and pressors but no CPR.
Common bile duct obstruction 3.
Thrombocytopenia 4.
