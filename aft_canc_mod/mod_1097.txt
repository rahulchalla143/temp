Of note, she was recently admitted for CHF exacerbation with pleural effusions at the end of last month.
Per her family, she had had increasing shortness of breath for the last several days.
Labs with sodium to 118 and anemia at baseline of 29.

Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: 98 109/77 83 18 100% on 4L nc O2sat GEN: lethargic but arousable and appropriate HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no JVD RESP: wheezing throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT:1+ [**Location (un) **] B, warm, well perfused SKIN: no rashes NEURO: sleepy but arousable, oriented to person, place, year and date .
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %) with inferior and inferoseptal akinesis and hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate tricupsid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Small loculated pericardial effusion adjacent to the base of the inferolateral wall.
The severity of tricuspid regugitation has increased.
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Empty sella with calcification at sellar floor-sphenoid sinus junction unchanged; MR could be useful for further characterization.
There is severe COPD and moderately severe cardiomegaly.
Compared with [**2123-10-15**], there is more pronounced atelectasis at both lung bases.
It could be exaggerated by slight oblique positioning orcould reflect some subsegmental atelectasis or less likely a new infiltrate.
However, a similar appearance was present on a radiograph from [**2123-10-8**] and, at that time, a followup chest CT from [**2123-10-9**] showed some pericardial fluid and pericardial nodes in this location, which could contribute to the appearance of the right cardiophrenic angle on today's exam.
Selective coronary angiogrpahy in this right dominant system demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a 20% distal stenosis.
The LAD had a 30% mid-LAD lesion and a 40% stenosis in the first diagonal.
The LCx had a 30% stenosis in a branch of OM1.
The RCA had no significant disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 18 mHg and mean PCWP 26 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension PASP 51 mmHg.
Coronary arteries are free of significant coronary artery disease.
Elevated biventricular filling pressures.
PT: 13.4  PTT: 24.3  INR: 1.1    Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman with PMH s/f CHF, HTN, asthma and hypothyroid who presented with lethargy and hypoxemia, found to be hyponatremic to 118 down from 133 9 days prior to admission and a newly depressed EF of 15% from 45% in [**Month (only) 956**].
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Presumed to be due to hyponatremia after ruling out potential endocrinopathies (endocrine consulted and ruled out pan-hypopituitarism and hypothyroid), intracranial processes (CT-Head unrevealing), and acid-base abnormalities in the setting baseline COPD.
# HYPONATREMIA: Due to appropriate ADH in the setting of volume overload and decreased effective circulatory volume.
Hyponatremia normalized with diuresis as detailed below.
# DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE: Presented profoundly volume overloaded with substantial sacral edema as well as some physical examination and radiographic signs of pulmonary congestion.
EF was found to be 15% from 45% and the etiology of the precipitous drop remains unclear after ruling out ischemic etiologies with an unrevealing catheterization as detailed above.
Prior to discharge she was counseled about daily weights and a low sodium diet.
# ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Admitted with creatinine of 1.6, likely due to decreased effective circulatory volume in the setting of CHF decompensation.
# COPD: She was treated symptomatically with ipratropium nebs and started on Advair as an inpatient; albuterol nebs were held in the setting of decompensated heart failure.
She had no wheezes, cough or O2 requirement on discharge and was sent home on her home regimen of inhalers; Advair was not continued for discharge.
# GUAIAC POSITIVE DIARRHEA: Late in the hospitalization, developed cryptogenic diarrhea.
C.Dif was ruled out but diarrhea continued.
Collateral history was revealing for the patient having bouts of loose stool at baseline responsive to loperamide.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: Levothyroxine was increased to 75 mcg because of a high TSH and concern that tachycardia was contributing to her cardiomyopathy.
# ANEMIA: At baseline thought to be due to CKD.
Of note, she has received Epogen in the past for chronic anemia and may need additional doses if hct does not improve.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2* 17. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Imodium A-D 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a day as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic congestive Heart Failure Asthma Exacerbation Hypothyroidism Coronary Artery Disease Hyponatremia Anemia Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had an episode of acute congestive heart failure and required medicine to remove excess fluid from your body.
We have adjusted your medicines to help your heart function improve and to prevent fluid from accumulating again.
You had diarrhea and tests showed there was some blood in your stool.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1789**] if you notice any red blood in your stool or if the diarrhea increases.
