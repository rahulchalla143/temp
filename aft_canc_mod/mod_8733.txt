Left lower lung opacification likely reflects a combination of atelectasis, possible aspiration or pneumonia, and external soft tissues.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Small left greater than right pleural effusions are likely also present.
Low lung volumes results in crowding of the bronchovascular markings, though there is likely a degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion.
However, given kyphotic positioning and neck flexion it is likely at the lower limits of acceptable positioning it should not be advanced any further, but does not need to be withdrawn.
Asymmetric pulmonary opacities, left greater than right, likely reflect a combination of edema and atelectasis.
The costophrenic angles are not well assessed, though small right effusion is likely present.
Previously noted left basilar opacities persists.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Better seen than on the previous image are areas of bilateral atelectasis as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Need final reads on other us  Echo [**8-15**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
The RV appears mildly dilated and hypokinetic on review of the prior study images.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.
Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which appears to have progressed since [**12/2132**] and likely reflects pulmonary hypertension secondary to the patient's known obstructive sleep apnea.
No evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.
Left lower lobe, particularly posterior basal segmental, consolidation and collapse, with no definite evidence of airway obstruction; a pneumonic process is a consideration.
Cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions but no pulmonary edema.
Multiple parenchymal consolidations appear to be progressed as compared to the prior study.
The findings are worrisome for continuous progress of multifocal infection.
No pneumothorax is seen.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No changes to cardiac structures throughout the exam.
There is no mediastinal air or widening.
Previous moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved, with the most pronounced residual around the left hilus and in the right infrahilar lung.
Substantial atelectasis persists at the left lung base.
There is no pneumothorax or more than minimal pleural effusion.
Right jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
GENERAL COMMENTS: No TEE related complications.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No changes to cardiac structures throughout the exam.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo with obesity hypoventilation, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma presenting with somnolence, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, and shock.
Etiology of acute decompensation was not clear, but he has had other similar admissions for respiratory failure.
Respiratory failure: Patient had been living in a skilled nursing facility since [**2134-3-30**] for his sleep apnea and BIPAP use.
He presented with hypoxemia in the setting of somnolence.
Has longstanding history of complex breathing disorder, including components of OSA, with history of acute respiratory failure.
Additionally, there was possiblity of a health care associated pneumonia on imaging.
He was empirically started on vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Pulmonary emobolism was considered, and although the patient had negative lower extremity ultrasounds, he was empirically started on heparin for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
After his renal failure improved (see below), he was CT scanned which was negative for a PE, and his heparin drip was discontinued.
His blood cultures came back positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus, and his antibiotics were weaned down to cefazolin.
*Was started on oral lansoprazole disolving tablet for peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis while on ventilator.
Felt to be consistent with dehydration with possible component of heart failure.
Echo performed showed normal systolic function, with mild dilation and mild global free wall hypokenesis.
Acute Renal Injury ([**Doctor First Name 48**]): Unclear cause of [**Doctor First Name 48**].
No recent changes in medications or fluid intake.
Likely prerenal azotemia in setting of K+ supplementation, possible decompensated diastolic CHF, and hypovolemia.
For assitance with agitation while intubated, he was additionally placed on quetiapine for several days, which was discontinued prior to [**Doctor First Name **] from the MICU as he appeared less agitated.
Phimosis: Patient found to have a phimosis due to foreskin entrapping the glans of the penis.
Urology saw the patient and reduced phimosis.
Should evaluate genitalia as clinically indicated (and, at a minimum at least once per week) to ensure no recurrence of phimosis.
Was taking aspirin 325 mg daily presumably for coronary artery disease risk.
Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:  At nursing home, patient was receiving 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] furosemide and metolazone 2.5 mg 1 tablet po daily.
On [**Hospital1 **], his diuresis with furosemide was resumed, but his metolazone was still held.
Should be kept on low sodium diet with weights checked daily, with more acute diuresis with a 3 lbs weight gain in 24 hours.
Erythrocytosis: On admission had elevated hematocrit.
Given his chronic respiratory issues, felt to be secondary to chronic hypoxemia.
At time of [**Hospital1 **], his metoprolol was resumed for management of chronic heart failure, and his lisinopril was held given complications with [**Last Name (un) **] at time of admission.
For hypernatremia he is receiving 200 cc free water flushes through his dobhoff.
Given his complications of acute kidney injury on presentation, his lisinopril was continued to be held at time of [**Hospital **], but his metoprolol was resumed (more so for management of his chronic diastolic heart failure).
The patient has been having sips of water for comfort, however he should NOT be allowed to have PO feedings/fluids in general as he is currently at risk of aspiration.
If his tracheostomy tube should fall out, it is a medical emergency and will need emergent transfer to a facility for replacement of his tracheostomy tube.
As he had an open procedure, if his tracheostomy tube falls out attempts at reinserting his endotracheal tube SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED as there is a risk of cannulation of a false lumen and intubation of a tissue plane rather than his trachea.
