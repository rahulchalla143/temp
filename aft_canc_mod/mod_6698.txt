NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Progressive decreased size of left occipitoparietal intracranial hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
No new definite areas of hemorrhage.
Evaluation for possible intracranial infection is limited on this study and if there is clinical concern for an infection, MRI with contrast should be performed.
Dramatic interval change, characterized by new confluent foci of slow diffusion with extensive leptomeningeal enhancement in both frontal lobes with pachymeningeal enhancement in the left temporal pole in keeping with meningoencephalitis and early cerebritis, consistent with clinical course and recent CSF results.
Large left temporoparieto-occipital surgical cavity with nodular margins appears slightly more prominent since the recent studies.
The presence of blood products in the cavity makes it difficult to exclude superinfection with abscess formation at this site.
However, the overall appearance is not much changed, with no increase in associatd FLAIR-signal abnormality indicative of further edema, as might be expected with pyogenic infection.
Ependymal enhancement in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral ventricle, unchanged and likely related to persistent tumor at this site, with no finding to suggest ventriculitis, elsewhere.
No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
No evidence of infection or tumor dissemination in the entire spine.
Extensive abnormal but amorphous STIR-hyperintensity in the deep dorsal and the interspinous and supraspinous soft tissues from L2 to L4-L5 level, likely related to multiple recent attempts at lumbar puncture; correlate clinically.
Small disc-spondylotic ridges at C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels, without canal compromise.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
Left lower lobe opacities consistent with atelectasis are unchanged.
If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Right perihilar opacities have resolved.
EEG [**2149-10-14**]:  This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing with a maximum 4 Hz posterior predominant rhythm as well as bursts of generalized delta slowing, left more than right.
This represents a severe encephalopathy such as can be seen with diffuse ischemia, toxic/ metabolic changes, infections, or medication effects.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o M with Merckel's cell carcinoma s/p L craniotomy ([**8-14**]) c/b post-op Serratia meningitis tx w/ 2wk course of ceftriaxone ([**Date range (1) 79616**]) and IPH now p/w AMS.
# Recurrent Serratia Meningoencephalitis:  Complicated by associated seizure activity, altered mental status (comatose initially) and history of recent craniotomy and intracranial bleed.
He had a very high fever of 104 that was very difficult to control with antipyretics and cooling measures.
He was intubated for airway protection in anticipation of MRI/MRV and risk for aspiration when laying flat for a prolonged period.
MRI/MRV showed meningoencephalitis, slightly more prominent margins of his surgical cavity where an abscess/infection could not be ruled out, and no cavernous sinus thrombi.
He was started on antibiotics gentamicin and meropenem with vancomycin po for C. diff prophylaxis on [**10-12**].
LP was repeated on [**2149-10-14**] and showed significant decrease in WBC count indicating positive antibiotic effect.
His first CSF culture grew out pan sensitive Serratia whereas repeat CSF culture (performed after he was started on antibiotics) had no growth.
MRI showed evidence of progressive leptomeningeal disease and stable surgical cavity.
EEG showed evidence of moderate to severe encephalopathy with no evidence of seizure activity.
# Seizure.
He had a seizure while on the medical floor likely due to underlying Serratia meningoencephalitis that was responsive to Ativan.
Continuous EEG monitoring in the ICU showed no seizure activity.
He had no further episodes of seizure activity during his hospital course.
# Resp alkalosis: ABG was also notable for hypocapnea and respiratory alkalosis very likely centrally mediated in the setting of meningoencephalitis.
Patient also presented with elevated lactate and AG of 14 likely secondary to his infection.
No respiratory complaints.
# History of C. diff.
#Transient hypotension: Shortly after MRI, he had transient hypotension requiring intermittent pressor support and placement of an a-line and LIJ CVL.
Most likely this was secondary to sedation boluses of versed and fentanyl that he received during the imaging study, but sepsis secondary to meningoencephalitis was considered.
Pressors were weaned within 8 hours of onset of hypotension and there were no signs of end-organ ischemia.
BP stable for rest of hospital course  # Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma: Patient is s/p tumor recention, c/b meningitis and recent rebleed.
Further treatment for his cancer will be deferred until resolution of meningoencephalitis.
Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic inflammation.
This may be explained by hemmorrhoids or diverticulosis that were seen on previous colonoscopy.
He was given an IV PPI for ulcer prophylaxis.
He was started on oxycontin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] for pain control.
