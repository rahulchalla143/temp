Recently admitted for hypotension and anemia/thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions in the setting of her critical AS.
She was given 500cc IVF for SBP in the 80s, with good response to her baseline SBP of 90s-100s.
Since discharge, she has been feeling more dyspneic, with symptoms increasing over the last 3-4 days while at home.
She denies fevers or chills, but noted a "rising temp" and generalized weakness.
She also describes increasing difficulty swallowing and odynophagia.
Exam was notable for decreased BS on the right.
ECG was V-paced at 88 bpm with lateral ST depressions, unchanged on repeat.
CXR with increasing pleural effusion from previous.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY: Aggressive B cell lymphoma [**3-/2189**]: Presented to PCP with neck and facial swelling.
Referred to allergy and ENT with neck CT revealing SVC syndrome from extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Chest CT showed right supraclavicular mass displacing trachea and massive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
[**2189-5-11**]: Bronchoscopy with diagnostic EBUS-TBNA revealed B cell lymphoma although minimal specimen was obtained.
TREATMENT HISTORY:  *  Received two doses of emergency radiation therapy on [**2189-5-15**], a dose of Cytoxan on [**2189-5-16**] and three-fifth dose of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy starting on [**2189-5-20**] that had to be aborted secondary to failure of her vascular access.
Repeat CT chest showed a widely patent Y stent and she was discharged to home [**2189-5-26**].
* Admitted on [**2189-6-1**] with hypotension (SBP 80s) with increasing dyspnea for further evaluation.
Mediastinal biopsy on [**2189-6-3**] was nondiagnostic and the Y stent was removed.
Given her difficult access, it was decided to leave PICC in place and she continued on Lovenox twice per day.
* Required an admission on [**2189-6-19**] with pancytopenia, [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] dyspnea, and increased creatinine.
Noted for C difficile infection and treated with Flagyl which has been switched to Vancomycin.
* Required admission again on [**2189-7-9**] with weakness and increased dyspnea requiring oxygen support.
Transferred to Cardiology for [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] peripheral edema and dyspnea.
After her fluid status was optimized, transferred back to the Hematologic Malignancy service for her chemotherapy.
Developed shortness of breath given large fluid volume.
* [**2189-8-3**], admitted with acute dyspnea with a drop in her oxygen saturation.
Chest CTA without pulmonary embolus.
Noted for large pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Transferred again to Cardiology service for closer management of her fluid status.
Cardiac catheterization done which revealed full occlusion of her RCA stent and 70-80% stenosis of her LMCA that had developed since the most recent angiogram.
Right pleural effusion was again tapped.
Chemotherapy given on [**2189-8-19**] and Rituxan on [**2189-8-20**] after her pleural effusion was again tapped and her fluid status maximized with aggressive diuresis.
Repeat upper extremity ultrasound showed resolution of upper extremity thrombus and Lovenox discontinued.

Superimposed PNA cannot be excluded, but seems unlikely given lateral radiograph demonstrates no definite opacity.
No pneumothorax.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF ?35%) with septal hypokinesis (the anterior wall and apex are not fully visualized).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Bilateral effusions are unchanged, small to moderate on the right and moderate to large on the left.
There is slight interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75yo F with PMH of critical AS, systolic heart failure (EF 30%), complete heart block s/p pacemaker, hypothyroidism, aggressive B cell lymphoma s/p multiple rounds of reduced CHOP and many admissions over the past few months for dyspnea and decompensated heart failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation for chemotherapy and transfusions, who presented with [**Known lastname 9140**] dyspnea on exertion.
Patient was found to be in heart failure with an elevated BNP and signs of pulmonary edema and [**Known lastname 9140**] pleural effusions on CXR.
She had bilateral chest tubes placed and developed [**Known lastname 9140**] hypoxia following this, likely due to reexpansion pulmonary edema and required transfer to the ICU.
Her hemodynamic status was tenuous, as small fluid boluses to increase her blood pressure and improve her renal perfusion (to treat her actue renal failure) would lead to [**Known lastname 9140**] respiratory status.
Given her tenous balance between renal perfusion and her respiratory status, and difficulty diruesing her and her known preload dependence from her critical AS, discussion was had with her heme-onc providers about whether she was tolerating the chemotherapy.
It was clear that she was not tolerating her chemotherapy sessions, as they required large volumes of fluids to prevent renal toxicity and other complications, and it was unclear if there was significant improvement in her disease.
Prior to discharge she had a right sided pleurex chest tube placed for palliative diuresis of her reaccumulating pleural effusion.

You were admitted with shortness of breath, which was likely caused by increased fluid in your lungs.
The fluid built up due to your aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure.
You also received morphine, which helped treat your shortness of breath.
Stop draining for pain, chest tightness, or cough.
