Admission Date: [**2108-5-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2108-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-12-3**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old female with non-small cell lung carcinoma, obstructive-sleep apnea, COPD, and obesity, who was admitted on [**2108-5-28**] to the Medical team with report of months of chronic dyspnea, two weeks of increased shortness of breath associated with a recent medication change of decreased Lasix dose around that time.
She also reported positive bilateral lower extremity edema and a dry cough, but denied any fevers and chills.
Based on examination and chest x-ray findings of small bilateral pleural effusions, the patient was treated by the Medical team for presumed CHF exacerbation.
She was noted to have decreased symptoms with IV diuresis after being given first 60 IV and then 20 mg of IV Lasix.
The following day the patient had an echocardiogram, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion circumferential without any signs of tamponade physiology.
On examination was without jugular venous distention or pulsus paradoxus.
Patient was then taken for pericardiocentesis on [**5-30**] and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.
On pericardiocentesis, there was drained approximately 800 cc of hemorrhagic fluid.
The postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, which returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm with one dose of diltiazem and no other intervention.
On [**2108-6-2**], the patient underwent a pericardial window and bilateral chest tube placement for pleural effusions.
Postoperative course from that, the patient had a fever to 102.6.
Patient also had transient hypotension to 80/40s, treated transiently with Levophed drip.
The etiology of hypotension was questionable potentially due to medications.
Patient  then had a chest CT on [**6-2**], which demonstrated right upper lobe opacities posteriorly, bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left and a moderate pericardial effusion that was present.
The effusion on the right side appeared to be loculated and fibrotic, and on the left side, there is a small pneumothorax that was well loculated.
Lung cancer non-small cell status post chemotherapy and    radiation therapy as well as initial resection.
The    patient also had an endobronchial invasion with the tumor    and is now status post stent placement, which was then    later found to be migrated and was taken out by    Interventional Pulmonology.
Obstructive-sleep apnea on nighttime BiPAP.
Chest x-ray done postoperatively on the 16th still demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, but no change from the prior day.
As far as microbiology data, the patient had no significant organisms grow from blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, or pericardial or pleural fluid.
On examination, this patient is a pleasant elderly female, who was in mild respiratory distress, but speaking in full sentences.
There was no jugular venous distention.
There was a right internal jugular central line, and mild erythema, and mild tenderness, but no pus.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary exam: Breath sounds were audible bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases, occasional wheeze was noted.
No lower extremity edema was noted.
There was some chronic venous stasis changes.
The bilateral chest tubes    had minimal drainage and it was felt that the right chest    was unsuccessful in draining the loculated pleural    effusion that remained towards the right base on the CAT    scan done on the [**12-3**].
At the time of this dictation, the MICU team had also asked for the input of Interventional Pulmonology and Interventional Radiology to decide whether the effusion, which was thought to be a small component or possible moderate component to this patient's dyspnea would be amenable to any drainage or if we should hold off until any further worsening of the effusion should happen in the future.
It was noted by CT Surgery that no pleurodesis would be possible at this time.
A followup echocardiogram was also done two days after surgery, which demonstrated a small pericardial effusion, which was thus not thought not to be further contributing to the patient's dyspnea.
There is also consideration that this patient may have thromboembolic disease, therefore a CTA was attempted twice.
It showed no massive pulmonary embolus, but it did not show the subsegmental or segmental pulmonary arteries.
Given the fact the patient was not amenable to anticoagulation, we did get lower extremity ultrasounds done, which showed no evidence of clots.
For the possibility of CHF as a component of the dyspnea, this patient was diuresed, however, on diuresis, the patient entered atrial fibrillation, which was controlled with a dose of diltiazem and some IV fluids.
The patient was stopped with albuterol due to anxiety and tachycardia and kept on Atrovent nebulizers MDI.
For cardiovascular issues, for CHF:  The patient does have    a significantly low ejection fraction.
For atrial fibrillation,  the patient is on amiodarone.
For her oncologic issues, the patient was advised that she    does have Stage IV lung cancer signifying progression of    her original disease.
FEN:  The patient was kept on a diabetic low-sodium diet    with a fluid goal of net even.
Again at the time of this discharge dictation, the only issue that had not been completely discussed was the issue of the right pleural effusion for which we are still awaiting final interpretation from Interventional Pulmonary and Interventional Radiology.
Pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis and    pericardial window.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Question of pneumonia status post seven day course of    vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
Atrial fibrillation.
Any further events will be dictated prior to the patient's discharge from the hospital.
