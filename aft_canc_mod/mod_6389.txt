History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 39-years-old woman with metastatic NSCLC to the bone and brain who recently was taken off her Keppra who comes with multiple seizures.
She had abnormal LFTs, so her oncologist stopped Keppra 1 week ago to see if they could improve and consider further chemotherapy.
Yesterday morning, she put her kids to school and went back to bed, awoke and noticed a tremor in her right hand that rapidly spreaded proximally to the rest of her body.
She awoke in the floor with left frontal and parietal headache and called her sister.
Patient denies any aura or loss of sphincter tone.
She did not remember any more details from the event and there were no witnesses.
Of note, patient had recent MRI showed bilateral enhancing lesions with decreased edema compared to [**Month (only) 956**] [**2161**].
Patient received vancomycin and ceftriaxone (1 gram and 2 grams respecively) for a possible pneumonia or abnormal shadow on CXR.
Her CTA was negative for PE and showed clear lungs.
CT scan of the head showed attenuation of bilateral multiple foci of frontal and fronto-parietal enhancements.
Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed via biopsy in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2160**] with known metastasis to to T11.
No neurosurgery intervention deemed apporpriate and was set up for whole brain XRT by radiation oncology at [**Hospital1 18**] which she finished one week ago.
Patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 74124**]) was planning on starting another session of chemotherapy soon as recent PET scan showed presence of lesions in chest and lung.
She did not have recent travel, or  change in diet.

There is no history of premature CAD or stroke or diabetes.
SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, rashe in her back, erythematous, blanching without any other lessions.
Motor Examination:  She does not have a drift.
She does not have appendicular dysmetria or truncal ataxia.
She does not have a Romberg.

There is no evidence for herniation or hemorrhage  CTA [**2161-4-16**]: 1.
The study is nondiagnostic for pulmonary embolus beyond the level of the main, undivided pulmonary artery secondary to suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree.
As the patient subsequently had a seizure on the scanner table and became post-ictal, repeat study was postponed until patient is more able to follow breathing instructions.
Multiple spiculated pulmonary nodules measuring up to 2 cm in both the upper and lower left lobes, consistent with biopsy-proven malignancy.
Additional small 6- mm nodule is identified in the right upper lobe.
There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes identified.
Sclerotic lesion in the T10 vertebral body consistent with known metastasis.
High attenuation lesion in the liver, incompletely evaluated.
Three predominately hypoechoic masses in the liver, one in the right lobe containing heterogeneous echotexture with internal vascularity.
This is concerning for metastatic disease and should be further evaluated with MRI.
Diffuse heterogeneous echotexture to the liver, which may be due to fatty infiltration; however, hepatic fibrosis and/or cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 39-year-old woman with metastatic NSCLC to the bone and brain who recently was taken off her Keppra who comes with multiple seizures.
(1) Seizures:  Partial seizures were secondarily generalized.
This is secondarily caused by her CNS metastases of her NSCLC with recent decrease in dose of her Decadron and stopping her Keppra for abnormal LFTs.
(3) High Temperature:  Upon admission T up to 101 F.  This is most likely secondary to seizure activity.
Patient was afebrile for the rest of the hospitalization.
(4) UTI:  Patient with abnormal UA with nitrites, leukocytes and bacteria.
She was  asymptomatic, but in the setting of CNS pathology and seizures, there was concern of the risk of an infection and it was thought [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\bar puncture and start treatment  was indicated.
(5) Abnormal LFTs:  Patient with hepatocellular pattern abnormalities suggesting hepatocyte damage.
This is most likely etiology is hepatic involvement of her NSCLC.
LUQ USG shows lesions, suggesting hepatic involvement.
We will follow and use sarna lotion for now since risk of switching to other medications and having seizures or other adverse reaction outweighs benefits.
We ruled out PE with CTA.
Pt had sinus tachycardia in multiple ECGs.
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for UTI for 2 days.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Seizure secondary to non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain.
You had seizures in the ER and responded to Ativan.
You had a CT scan that showed no changes from before and no bleeding.
If you have headache, vision abnormalities, abnormal movements, any other seizure activity, headache or anything esle that bothers you please contact Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office of come to our ER.
You also had fever upon arrival that were most likely due to your seizure activity.
We worked you up for infection and found some abnormalities in your urine concerning for infection.
You have abnormal liver function tests, that you already knew, that will need to be followed by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**].
