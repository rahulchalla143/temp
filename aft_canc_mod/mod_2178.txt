The patient reported feeling weak, tired, poor appetite with little po intake.
He also reported shaking chills, night sweats and mild headaches over the top of his head.
His baseline gait is reportedly slightly unsteady, with some forgetfullness since CNS lymphoma diagnosed.
The patient was initially admitted to the general medicine floor where he was treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for a multilobar pneumonia.
He was intermittently tachypneic and tachycardic on the floor.
On HD2, the patient was felt to be in impending respiratory failure with persistent supraventricular tachycardia and was transferred to the MICU.
There he received a diltiazem drip for rate control and diuresis for volume overload had dramatic improvement in his respiratory status.

CXR ([**5-6**]): Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema, but atypical viral or mycoplasma infection should be considered.
CXR ([**5-7**]): Interval worsening of bilateral diffuse opacities consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.
However, worsening superimposed pneumonia should also be considered.
EKG ([**5-8**]): atrial fib/flutter at 125 bpm  MRI of the brain with gadolinium: Exam compared to prior study of [**4-14**].
Abnormalities in the right hemisphere previously described are not changed.
There is no evidence of abnormal diffusion.
There is no evidence of new mass effect or hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of a new focal extraaxial lesion or fluid collection.
No definte evidence of new mass effect or hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 M with CNS lymphoma with last chemo [**8-14**], Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and PMR who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a one week history of productive cough, SOB and fevers called out of MICU after being treated for rapid AF and heart failure.
Pt likely had multifocal pna which exacerbated atrial fibrillation which lead to worsening heart failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation.
Pt with continued evidence of heart failure on exam, with elevated JVP, crackles and mild edema.
Pt also with wheezing on exam, likely attributable to cardiac wheeze from volume overload but potentially related to his history of bronchiectasis- continues ipratropium nebs throughout hospitalization as these have helped him.
- Cefpodoxime day 5 on d/c - Azithro day 5 on d/c - Continued lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **], fluid goal of > -1L as mentioned above - Continued beta blocker and diltiazem for rate control as above - Continued ipratropium for bronchospasm as above .
Tachycardia: Pt appeared to have atrial fibrillation/flutter by EKGs, likely exacerbated by pulmonary process.
CNS Lymphoma: Has been asymptomatic and stable.
Initial unsteadiness on admission likely secondary to systemic illness rather than acute neurologic event.
Given PPI for prophylaxis.
