Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with AMS secondary to fronto-parietal ICH.
His course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation and eventual tracheostomy.
He underwent treatment for VAP with vanco/cefepime/[**Hospital1 9847**], then a course of vanco/zosyn for a urinary tract infection that grew a relatively [**Name2 (NI) **]-sensitive proteus and enterococcus.
He had been rehabbing at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab when he was noted to have altered mental status today.
Of note, he developed a pruritic rash over his arms and back two days ago, treated with topical steroids, antifungals, and antihistamines.
Exam was notable for R>L abd tenderness to palpation and maculopapular rash on his torso.
Labs were notable for K 5.5, mild leukocytosis and UTI.
CT head/chest(CTA)/abd revealed soft tissue lesion.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports no pain or adverse symptoms.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  He presented altered from acute rehab without clear catalyst.
In setting of recent ICH, CT head was pursued and revealed no structural abnormality or bleed.
Hypercarbia likewise possible, but his pCO2 seems to be better than reference levels at the time of his last discharge.
AMS likely due to urosepsis.
Urosepsis is possible given his concerning UA and leukocytosis- no other infectious sources seen in the lung, however abdominal CT makes note of a soft tissue density c/w neoplasm versus diverticulitis.
PE and dissection ruled out with CTA due to hypoxia and hypotension.
Holding atenolol until BP normalizes.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  UA revealing likely UTI.
# RASH:  Blanching, confluent maculopapular rash over the back and extensor surfaces of the upper arms and legs.
Appears consistent with drug rash, though he has no peripheral eosinophilia, and he was not recently challenged with new drugs.
A viral exanthem is also possible.
Fungal/candidal infection appears unlikely.
# ABDOMINAL SOFT TISSUE DENSITY: Seen on CT abdomen, of unclear etiology: neoplasm versus possible small bowel diverticulitis.
Will need repeat CT in three weeks  # RECENT INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE:  He recently underwent hemorrhagic stroke possibly from converted ischemic stroke versus amyloid process.
No further bleed seen on admission CT Head.
Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
# CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  CTA makes note of stable emphysema.
He has a substantial baseline 02 requirement of 3.5LNC, so he is likewise at his respiratory baseline.
# DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: he carries a diagnosis of CHF,  though EF shown to be preserved at 50-55% per previous hospitalization.
# HYPERTENSION: holding amlodipine and atenolol in the setting of hypotension.
Pt admitted [**4-25**] with hypotension and responsive to 2L NS with SBP in low 100's.
NCHCT showed no acute process (final read.)
No acute process of the chest.
Soft tissue lesion in the mesentery of the right mid abdomen with surrounding inflammation of the mesenteric fat is new compared to [**2173-3-5**].
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes carcinoid, or less likely atypical Meckel diverticulitis, sclerosing mesenteritis, or or other neoplasms (metastases, soft tissue sarcoma or lymphoma).
He was started on [**Year (4 digits) 9847**] for his likely urinary source and will continue this regime pending cultures.
Hypotension likely result of urosepsis and caused altered mental status.
Given h/o ICH there was concern for an acute intracranial process, but neg CT.   Pt now at baseline mental status and wbc 10.5 from 15.9.

We believe that the infection in your urine spread to your blood stream causing your low blood pressure and altered mental status.
Please take the [**Hospital6 9847**] 500mg every 12 hours for the next 13 days to treat your urinary tract infection.
On your CT scan there was a mass noted in the abdomen.
This could represent an infection or a possible cancer.
