Admission Date:  [**2151-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-8-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Fall, left hip pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ORIF left femur   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 105637**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with PMH significant for multiple malignancies and HTN who presents with L femoral fracture s/p mechanical fall.
She received nitro SL for chest pain but her blood pressure dropped to ~66/p and she was unresponsive.
She immediately received IVFs and her BP increased appropriately.
Patient describes 3-4 episodes of chest pain per week.
She describes the pain as an ache in her chest with no radiation but associated with SOB.
She has never had a stress test.
3)Colon cancer, status post colectomy 4)Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, completed two cycles of Rituxan treatment for her low grade lymphoma on [**2148-9-30**].
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Physical Exam: vitals T 97 AR 62 BP 183/65 RR 21 O2 96% RA Gen: Patient sitting up in bed, NAD HEENT: MMM Heart: RRR, +systolic murmur Lungs: CTAB anteriorly Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS Extremities: No LE edema; + swelling and tenderness from level of L hip joint to patella.
[**8-20**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**8-20**] Pelvis AP: Comminuted fracture of the left femoral diaphysis distal to and not involving the left femoral prosthesis.
[**8-20**] Femur AP and Lat: There is an acute comminuted fracture of the left femoral diaphysis distal to and not involving the left femoral prosthesis.
No other fractures are identified, although given the significant osteopenia, assessment for subtle non-displaced fracture is limited.
The patient is status post ORIF of bilateral proximal femoral fractures on the right secured by dynamic compression screw and on the left, there has been prior total hip arthroplasty.
The sacroiliac joints and pubic symphysis are preserved.
[**8-22**] Knee X-ray: Transverse fracture of the distal shaft of the left femur, with posterior apex angulation.
No obvious fracture is identified about the knee joint itself though there is associated soft tissue swelling and probable joint effusion.
No fat-fluid level is detected (making an intra-articular fracture unlikely).
There is severe diffuse osteopenia as well as moderate degenerative changes about the right knee.
Vascular calcification noted.
No immediate hardware-related complication is seen.
Displacement of the fracture fragments is noted, although alignment of the fracture is  slightly improved compared to the previous radiographs.
[**8-24**] EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia which may be sinus with a P-R interval of 0.18.
There is ST-T segment depression in the posterolateral leads.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
Left  ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function  are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal  defect.
The  ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.5 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There  is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is  seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Status post ORIF of the left distal femur, without evidence of hardware complication.
Lucency projecting over the left acetabulum likely represents bowel gas.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 105637**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with PMH as listed above presents with femur fracture s/p mechanical fall.
1)L femur fracture: Patient presented with left femur fracture in the context of mechanical fall.
2)Angina: Patient presented initially with symptoms consistent with angina.
She has had these symptoms for many years.
Per Dr. [**Name (NI) 22966**] last note, he described her pain as a "chest pain syndrome".
Question whether her pain is cardiac in nature although she is nitro responsive.
She has not had a stress test or prior work-up in the past.
Pt was chest pain free prior to surgery.
On the evening following her surgery she developed a supraventricular tachycardia and ST-segment depression with associated chest pain.
This responded quickly to po metoprolol,she converted to normal sinus rhythm, and chest pain resolved, however she did experience a rise in cardiac enzymes so was started on IV heparin.
Her cardiac enzymes trended down and she subsequently remained chest pain free.
She underwent echocardiography subsequently, and had no wall motion abnormalities with a preserved ejection fraction.
Upon discharge she was chest pain free with no further events on telemetry.
3)Hypertension/Hypotension: Per OMR, patient has history of poorly controlled hypertension and has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the cardiology clinic last in [**2148**].
Pt also with HYPOtension in the ER after administration of nitroglycerin.
Pt has taken nitroglycerin at home without episodes of dizziness.
However, association of event points towards nitro as the cause of her hypotension.
Did not receive further doses of nitroglycerin, and blood pressure was well-controlled with increased dose of beta-blocker.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, temperature > 100.4.
Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia with associated ischemia versus non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction .
Hypertension 4.)
Hypercholesterolemia 5.)
Osteoporosis   Discharge Condition: afebrile, displaying normal vital signs, tolerating po   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a fall and fracture of your left leg.
After the surgery you experience some chest pain and fast heart rate which may have represented a small heart attack.
If you experience severe leg pain, a fall, have chest pain or shortness of breath, or if you have lightheadedness or dizziness, or if your condition worsens in any way, seek immediate medical attention.
