HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45 year old female with a history of Hepatitis C, low grade lymphoma, major depression and poly-substance abuse, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 3494**] Intensive Care Unit on [**2-10**], with a heroin and benzodiazepine overdose, as well as multi-lobar pneumonia.
The patient was initially treated in [**Hospital1 3494**] Intensive Care Unit with Gatifloxacin and Ceftriaxone until the sputum came back positive for Moraxella catarrhalis.
She was in significant respiratory distress using accessory muscles, breathing 45 times per minute, with a temperature of 103.8 F., and saturation of 99% on non-rebreather mask.
Liver biopsy in [**2112**] showed chronic Hepatitis, Grade II inflammation, Stage II fibrosis.
She received Rebetron therapy for six months in [**2114-1-23**], and discontinued secondary to the depression.
Low-grade lymphoma with IgM gammopathy diagnosed in [**2112**].
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient was in respiratory distress with visible accessory muscle use.
Her mucous membranes were dry.
Lungs had diffuse wheeze and rhonchi.
Abdomen showed healed low midline scar, good bowel sounds, slight distention, no rebound or guarding.
Sputum culture positive for Moraxella catarrhalis.
Chest x-ray on admission from [**Hospital3 **] showing bilateral infiltrate and left sided small pleural effusion.
Her hypercarbic respiratory failure was felt to be likely due to the pneumonia.
Since the decompensation was somewhat rapid, it was felt to be due to new aspiration.
She was noted to have an absent gag reflex.
CT scan of her brain was obtained which revealed no stroke.
Delirium:  On admission, the patient's mental status was severely depressed and she persisted being agitated.
On admission, a head CT scan was performed and revealed no structural lesions.
An lumbar puncture was performed looking for infection or hemorrhage causing her delirium, however the cerebrospinal fluid fluids did not indicate either hemorrhage nor infection.
When attempting to transition the patient from a Fentanyl drip to a patch, significant withdrawal symptoms were observed and the patient was continued on a slow Fentanyl drip taper.
At that time, her PICC line was discontinued and peripheral access obtained.
