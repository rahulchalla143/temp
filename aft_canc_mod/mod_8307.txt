She noticed red blood in her toilet today.
Over the past week she has had intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath.
Chest pain is substernal and radiates to jaw, associated with SOB, and is exertional.
No abdominal pain.
She went to OSH ([**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **]), where Hct was found to be 13.3 (baseline 34), trop I 0.31 (thought to be due to demand ischemia).
She thought this was secondary to hemorrhoids, and therefore didn't immediately present for care.
However, given exertional chest pain in a bandlike distribution across her chest, assoc w/ nausea/SOB in addition to extreme fatigue and lightheadedness, she went to OSH ED.
Very occassional sharp pains in stomach over past month when taking ice cubes.
Some fatigue and muscle pain over past 3 days.
She denies any history of melena or BRBPR.
She does have lactose intolerance and IBS, so her bowel habits are variable, but states that she is currently having frequent stools.
She notes recent "heartburn" symptoms for the past [**12-26**] days as well, for which she has been taking Tums PRN.
GI and cardiology were consulted, large-bore IV access x 3 obtained, and blood was sent for crossmatch.
GI recommended admitting to MICU, 2 additional units of PRBCs to be given in ED, EGD/colonoscopy in the morning, and CTA and call fellow if hemodynamically unstable overnight.
No fluids or red cells given in the ED.
Past Medical History: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease HTN Osteoporosis, treated with yearly Reclast Spinal stenosis DJD Diabetes mellitus with recent HgA1c 6.4%   Social History: Retired legal secretary.

Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
No pleural effusions, no pneumonia.
Focal cecal wall thickening near the ileocecal valve, likely corresponding to primary lesion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
Multiple peripheral ground-glass nodules in the lungs may be of infectious origin although metastatic disease is not excluded.
Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes may also be re-evaluated at this time.
Thyroid nodule in the left lobe should be correlated with prior imaging or further evaluated with routine thyroid ultrasound.
8-mm focus of enhancement within segment 7 of the liver may represent an FNH or hemangioma.
Endoscopy Colonoscopy Findings:	 Protruding Lesions	A broad-based 5 cm mass with overlying exudate was found in the cecum.
Impression:	Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Diverticulum in the colon Mass in the cecum (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum EGD Findings: Esophagus:	 Lumen:	A partial, nonobstructing Schatzki's ring was found.
A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Impression:	Small hiatal hernia Schatzki's ring .
Pathology Cecal mass biopsies: Focal adenomatous mucosa with at least high grade dysplasia.
No definitive invasive carcinoma is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 66F with PMH of COPD and DM presented with GI bleed and chest pain, found to have HCT of 13 out OSH.
An EGD was performed which was unremarkable for a cause of her GI bleed.
Colonoscopy performed the next day revealed hemorrhoids and a 5cm mass in the cecum concerning for malignancy.
Surgery was consulted and she was discharged with scheduled resection of the mass on [**6-23**] after being evaluated by cardiology, pulmonology, and anesthesia.
Her HCT was stable at ~30 and she remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her stay with no evidence of GI bleed.
# NSTEMI: The patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath at the OSH, which improved with transfusion of PRBCs and IVNS  In addition, her troponin was elevated, and peaked at 0.16.
Her EKG demonstrated ST depression in the lateral leads which improved with administration of PRBCs, which were felt to be due to demand ischemia.
Her HCT was maintained at > 28 in the setting of her troponin leak and symptoms.
After EGD and colonscopy, she was evaluated by cardiology prior to discharge for OR planning.
She will need cardiology evaluation after surgery with stress testing and possible catheterization is performed.

You had become quite symptomatic from this, as evidenced by your worsened shortness of breath.
EGD showed no cause for your bleeding.
However, the colonoscopy showed a 5 centimeter mass in the right side of your colon as well as hemorrhoids, both of which were likely to have contributed to your bleeding.
It is felt that resection of this mass would be an appropriate means of treatment.
Because of the strain caused on your heart, you will also be started on three new medications, a statin for your cholesterol, aspirin, and metoprolol to control your heart rate.
