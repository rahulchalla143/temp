Admission Date:  [**2130-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: progressive shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old gentlemen with history of emphysema, SCC diagnosed in [**8-/2129**] s/p left upper lobectomy and s/p neoadjuvant chemoradiation, PE/DVT in [**11/2129**], pericardial effusion w/ tamponade requiring pericardial windown in [**1-/2130**], s/p IVC filter placement who presents from clinic with SOB and CTA showing multiple PEs and LLL pneumonia.
On note, in early [**Month (only) **] patient developed a DVT with pulmonary embolism, and he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].
He subsequently developed gradually progressive shortness of breath, which eventually became quite profound.
He presented to the ER on [**2-7**]/2 and was initially felt to have pneumonia, but at the time of admission was found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade in the setting of a supratherapetuic INR to 15.
However, then appeared to be continued loculated pericardial fluid so eventually a sub-xiphoid pericardial window was performed and an IVC filter was placed.
During the hospitalization, he had runs of afib/aflutter and was started on metoprolol 25mg tid.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have frequent runs of rapid atrial flutter mostly along with some AFib, some of which were symptomatic.
Metoprolol could not be tolerated up any further due to low blood pressure.
Patient was discharged with Aspirin 325mg qd for anticoagulation.
His O2 req increased to 3.5 L.  Even with O2, he becomes SOB after walking only 15 feet.
CTA was done and showed RML and RLL lobe pulmonary embolisms, LLL PNA, trace pericardial effusion.
A bedside TTE showed trace effusion but no RV collapse.
Has not had any brbpr, no dark stools, no nausea, no dysuria, no swelling in the legs.
Does note he went for check up and had mild infection at sternum incision for which he completed a course of keflex.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: PET CT [**2129-8-10**]: FDG-avid LUL large 49x40mm lung lesion is seen highly concerning for lung cancer.
There is a prominent lymph node in the left peritracheal area measuring 18x12mm (not FDG-avid) and non-specific.
Bronchoscopy [**2129-8-22**]: obtained tissue for pathology which revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma (stage IIIa) .
No pleural metastases were noted but there were bulky level 6 lymph nodes, which were positive for metastatic carcinoma on frozen sections; final pathology showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis histologically similar to the prior lung sample.
No other history of cancer or blood clotting disorders  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission: Vitals - T 97.5  BP 110/70 HR 68 RR 24 02 sat 94 on 3L GENERAL: NAD SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes; HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, MMM, good dentition, nontender supple neck, no LAD, no JVD appreciated CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg; incsion on sternum well healed, not erythematous LUNG: crackles in RLL, decreased breath sounds in LLL ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no obvious deformities PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: CN II-XII intact  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission:  [**2130-2-3**] 03:50PM   WBC-14.2* RBC-4.55* HGB-11.8* HCT-38.9* MCV-86 MCH-26.0* MCHC-30.4* RDW-15.6* [**2130-2-3**] 03:50PM   NEUTS-84.8* LYMPHS-7.3* MONOS-3.2 EOS-4.3* BASOS-0.4 [**2130-2-3**] 03:50PM   GLUCOSE-113* UREA N-20 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-5.4* CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-16 [**2130-2-3**] 03:58PM   LACTATE-2.9* K+-4.9 [**2130-2-3**] 04:00PM   PT-13.0* PTT-25.5 INR(PT)-1.2* .
There is borderline left ventricular hypertrophy.
Mild-moderately elevated PA systolic pressure, estimated at  47 mmHg above RA pressure.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CTA [**2130-2-3**]: -Acute pulmonary emboli in the right middle lobe, into segments of the right lower lobe.
-Status post left upper lobectomy.
-Extensive peripheral groundglass and air space disease throughout the right lungand in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, with the appearance of earlyconsolidating pneumonia.
-Unchanged pretracheal adenopathy.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2130-1-10**]: Findings: A large pericardial effusion, with attenuation characteristics of bloody or exudative fluid has developed, impinging on the right atrium and right ventricle, suggesting cardiac tamponade.
Severe consolidation in the post-operative left lung, extending from the superior segment to the upper regions of the basal segments has worsened, and extensive consolidation in the right lung is largely new, in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and the right lower lobe, most pronounced in the superior segment.
ECHO [**2130-2-10**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to rule out vegetations.
Intercurrent development of moderate pulmonary hypertension, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and right heart chamber enlargement concerning for acute right heart strain.
Consider acute pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old male with history of emphysema, SCC diagnosed in [**8-/2129**] s/p left upper lobectomy and s/p neoadjuvant chemoradiation, PE/DVT in [**11/2129**], pericardial effusion w/ tamponade requiring pericardial window in [**1-/2130**], s/p IVC filter placement who presented from clinic with SOB and CTA showing multiple PEs and multifocal right sided pneumonia.
He then became hypoxic and was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further monitoring.
He required intubation for worsening respiratory status, which was initially felt to be mostly related to pneumonia.
There was also a concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage so he underwent a bronchoscopy showing minimial bleeding.
Heparin drip was stopped as it was felt his bleeding risk was higher than PE risk given his filter.
On the evening of [**2130-2-10**], he became acutely tachycardic up to 140s, felt to be in atrial flutter.
An echo was obtained showing a severe amount of tricuspid regurg.
Unclear etiology but likely due to some systemic inflammatory process that was contributing to underlying shock.
