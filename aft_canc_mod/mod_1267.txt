CXR shows similar multifocal opacities to last admission, but also new RLL infiltrate as well as some worsening effusions/congestion.

No significant change compared to [**1-17**].
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal inferior wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema is stable since [**2-4**].
Moderate right and small left pleural effusion have increased.
Right middle lobe consolidation most likely pneumonia.
Moderate cardiomegaly stable.
Interval improvement in left suprahilar consolidation suggests that this second region of pneumonia is improving.
Brief Hospital Course: AP: 47 yo M with IDDM, recent multifocal, MRSA pneumonia, now with hypoxia at rehab  #.
Hypoxia: The patient had a recent/resolving multifocal, MRSA pneumonia, and his symptoms (cough, sputum production) have been resolving, although there does appear to be a new RLL infiltrate and he has completed > 14 days now of vanc and zosyn.
He had no crackles on exam, but there was mild bilateral ankle edema, grossly elevated BNP, and pt has history of systolic dysfunction which could point to heart failure as a cause of his hypoxia.
Also in favor of heart failure is the improvement he had with diuresis at rehab prior to transfer.
Finally, diabetic gastroparesis may predispose to aspiration as well as his impaired oropharyngeal swallow seen on recent S & S, which, with his new RLL infiltrate and acuity of event, seems most likely explanation.
CAD risks: Given the patient's acute hypoxia and cardiac risk factors such as DM and a low EF.
Serial enzymes were checked to rule out ischemia.
A TTE showed EF 50%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension.
Thrombocytosis: likely due to his recent, serious infection.
Chronic pain syndrome: The patient continued to experience low back pain.
Anemia: The patient has anemia likely secondary to CKD.
Sucralfate 1 gram Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a day as needed for heartburn.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA Multifocal Pneumonia Systolic Heart Failure, Acute Hypoxemia ARF on CKD stage 4  Discharge Condition: Vital Signs Stable  Discharge Instructions: Return to the ED if you having high fevers, difficulty breathing, hypotension, confusion, uncontrollable blood sugars not responding to medical management, severe abdominal pain.
