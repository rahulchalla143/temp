hemorrhage and cerebellar mass   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation for MRI due to severe claustrophobia [**2180-4-6**] R Suboccipital Crani for Mass Resection [**2180-4-14**]   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is 66 y/o male with HTN, CAD and PAD.
He awoke with the arrival of the EMS, he was found in the parking lot the details of what he hit are unavailable and there is discrepancy about whether the air bag deployed.
cerebellar mass versus stroke and right occiptal partieal focus of IPH.
These appear to be more concerning for masses than trauma.
The patient only complains of low back pain at this time.

No bowel or bladder incontinence  Upon discharge: SAME as above.
No evidence of acute visceral injury in the abdomen or pelvis.
Esophageal wall thickening and regional gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy.
Follow-up and further evaluation for cause of lymaphdenopathy should be obtained if endoscopy is negative and no other source identified.
Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule measure up to 6-mm.
Hypodense hepatic lesion in segment IV.
Recommend ultrasound or MRI for further characterization.
MRI Brain [**2180-4-6**]: Numerous enhancing masses throughout the supra- and infratentorial compartments, without subependymal or leptomeningeal enhancement.
The findings most likely represent multiple metastatic lesions, likely mucinous adenocarcinoma from a gastrointestinal primary site, given the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34702**], as well as the findings on the body CT scan.
Right middle lobe lung nodule.
Fatty liver with a focal lesion in the left lobe of the liver.
This can be evaluated either with physical exam or endoscopy.
Regional gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy associated with esophageal wall thickening as mentioned in prior CT should be evaluated.
No liver lesion to correlate with hypodensity seen on CT scan identified.
No worrisome lesions identified.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Multiple subacute compression fractures throughout the visualized thoracolumbar spine, corresponding to the findings on the prompting CT scan.
There is no associated soft tissue mass and there is some normal residual bone marrow within each vertebral body.
Both the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] appearance suggests that these are most likely "benign" osteoporotic fractures, without features suspicious for malignant involvement.
Chronic bilateral L5 spondylolysis with associated Grade I anterolisthesis as detailed, and resultant foraminal narrowing, more significant on the right.
Multiple enhancing lesions, in the brain and the cerebral and the cerebellar hemispheres, redemonstrated for surgical planning; the largest lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere measures 2.5 x 2.6 x 2.0 cm.
There has been interval evolution of the lesions, with increased necrosis and more conspicuous rim enhancement on the present study compared to the prior study of [**4-6**], several new lesions compared to the prior study of [**2180-4-6**].

Additional work up from the OSH included a CT of the chest/abdomen that revealed a hypodensity in the liver and a chronic L2 compression fractures.
His neurologic examination was notable only for mild dysmetria on his right upper extremity.
A brain MRI was required for the work up but the patient could not tolerate the study due to severe claustrophobia.
The MRI revealed multiple brain lesions.
It was felt that the right cerebellar lesion was of a sufficient size as to warrant resection before whole brain radation can be safely administered.
Since the patient had been on ASA, the plan was to discharge the patient to have him return as an outpatient for his surgery.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
