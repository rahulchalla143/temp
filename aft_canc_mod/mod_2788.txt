Discharge exam: ight incongruous omonymous hemianopia predominantly inferior quadrant with subtle visual symptoms, mild anisocoria with left pupils smaller than right.
Radiology: CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2194-1-3**] 2:43 PM FINDINGS: There is an about 6 x 4.6 x 4 cm posterior, medial left upper lobe mass.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Large mass in the posteromedial left upper lobe.
CT CHEST/[**Last Name (un) **]/PELVIS W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2194-1-4**] 1:55 PM CHEST: There are multiple thyroid nodules, the largest of which is within the left lobe of the thyroid gland and measures 2.0 x 2.3 cm.
There is a large left suprahilar mass, which measures 3.8 x 5.1 cm.
There are innumerable pulmonary nodules.
There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN: There are multiple too-small-to-characterize hypodensities within the liver.
There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
PELVIS: There is diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is a lytic lesion within the right supraacetabular region which measures 1.3 x 1.1 cm.
5.1 cm left suprahilar mass with innumerable pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistant with metastatic malignancy.
Lytic lesion within the right supraacetabular region consistent with metastatic disease.
The cervix is without focal lesions aside from multiple nabothian cysts.
A small posterior uterine fibroid is noted measuring 12 mm.
IMPRESSION: Small uterine fibroid with nabothian cysts but otherwise normal appearance of the cervix.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Left upper lobe lung mass and left apical opacities are again noted, better characterized in prior CT.
There are retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis.
Multiple lung nodules in the right lung are better seen in prior CT.
There is no pleural effusion.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Cell block for Left upper lobe of lung bronchial brushing (C11-40424F); cell block for left upper lobe mass EBUS-TBNA (C11-40426F).
CLINICAL DATA:	 PREVIOUS SPECIMENS: [**2194-1-9**]	 	[**-1/4060**]	 	BRONCHIAL WASHINGS [**2194-1-9**]	 	[**-1/4060**]	 	BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS [**2192-12-27**]	 	[**-1/4097**]	 	THIN LAYER PREP PAP SMEAR WITH IMAGING  DIAGNOSIS:	 EBUS-TBNA, Left upper lobe mass:  	  	 POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,  	  	 Consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Note:  	 See S11-50657F-B for cell block result.
Brief Hospital Course: 53LHF h/o HL, OSA and prior tobacco use presented with 4-6 weeks of cognitive changes including decreased concentration and inattention, difficulty with [**Location (un) 1131**] and writing, fatigue, and gait difficulty in addition to unintentional weight loss.
Her symptoms were initially mild and initially thought to be depression and treated with anti-depressants but as her symptoms progressed, she was referred for MRI-head which showed multiple brain metastases prompting admsision.
MRI showed multiple brain metastases most prominantly in left occipital lobe with significant vasogenic edema and given this, she was started on high dose dexamethasone.
CXR showed a large left suprahilar lung mass indicating the likely primary site.
On assessment by neurology, patient was found to have anisocoria with possible left Horner's syndrome, right homonymous hemianopia, right greater than left dysmetria and generalised hyperreflexia with extensor plantars bilaterally.
Patient was started on po keppra for seizure prophylaxis and had no seizures during her admission.
CT-CAP showed left suprahilar mass with innumerable pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bulky cervix (with uterine fibroids only seen on U/S) and a lytic lesion within the right supra-acetabular region indicating likely metastatic lung cancer.
IP performed a lung biopsy of her large lung mass on [**1-8**] and post procedure CXR was stable.
On discharge, her examination had improved with only a mild right homonymous hemianopia present (predominantly in the inferior right field) in addition to slowed [**Location (un) 1131**] and writing errors.
Patient has thoracic oncology and neuro-oncology follow-up and was discharged on a dexamethasone taper in addition to omeprazole 40mg qd for gastric protection.
Bronchial brushings and washing results have returned in keeping with lung adenocarcinoma and final pathology is still awaited.
Disp:*9 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Likely metastatic lung cancer brain masses now s/p cranial XRT and s/p lung biopsy with results pending   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Neurologic: Right incongruous omonymous hemianopia predominantly inferior quadrant with subtle visual symptoms, mild anisocoria with left pupils smaller than right.
You presented with problems regarding your thinking, weight loss and latterly problems with [**Location (un) 1131**], writing and walking.
You were found to have mild right sided weakness and subtle coordination problems on the right in addition to reduced vision on your right visual field.
You had an MRI of your brain that showed several masses in your [**Last Name (un) **] with associated swelling and you were started on a medication called dexamethasone to reduce this swelling and keppra an anti-seizure medication to reduce the risk of having seizures.
You had no seizures during your hospital stay.
You also had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which showed a left lung mass and enlarged glands in the lungs in addition to a likely tumor deposit in your right pelvis.
You had a much improved examination by discharge and the weakness had resolved and there was still evidence of some subtle [**Location (un) 1131**] and writing problmes in addition to a subtle decrease in vision predominantly involving the lower right portion of your right eye visual field.
