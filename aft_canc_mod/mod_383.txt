Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and was noted to have rising CKs & abn LFTs, MRI showed non-specific left lower extremity edema and u/s was negative for DVT.
Pt reported some tongue swelling and developped some mental status changes on the evening of [**2165-9-30**] thought due to Ativan.
During the day of [**10-1**], CKs were up the [**Numeric Identifier 6085**] range and pt developped worsening pain with elevated compartment pressure.
Pt was taken to the OR urgently for emergency fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome.

No evidence of colonic perforation.
Questionable thickening of the distal sigmoid and rectum which is difficult to evaluate due to underdistention.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Plasmacytoma in the right iliac bone extending into the sacrum as well as multiple lytic lesions in the pelvis and lumbar spine consistent with patient's known multiple myeloma.
No focal fluid collection, fracture, nor marrow signal abnormalities.
[**2165-9-30**] US LLE: No DVT   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment & Plan: 63 y/o M with PMHX of MM s/p autologous stem cell transplant in [**2162**] presented with foot pain and elevated CKs taken to the OR emergently for fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome, now s/p cardiac arrest and emergency tracheostomy and then subsequent fasciotomy on the other side.
# Elevated CK/Rhabdomyolysis/s/p emergent fasciotomy: Most likely etiology was compartment syndrome which was most likely secondary to hypothyroidism +/- statin use.
He was taken emergently to the OR [**2165-10-1**] for elevated compartment pressures and had a L fasciotomy followed by R sided fasciotomy on [**2165-10-2**].
In the setting of negative cultures, antibiotics were peeled off, and now patient completely off of antibiotics.
He was followed by Vascular Surgery and had closure of his wounds with a skin graft to the left leg on [**2165-10-17**].
Statin was held and was not continued due to concern for exacerbating rhabdomyolysis.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory failure: The patient had hypoxemia with respiratory distress after extubation from surgery.
He was initially intubated likely secondary to laryngeal edema associated with hypothyroidism.
Echo showed no evidency of right heart strain to suggest PE as etiology of respiratory failure.
CT chest showed bilateral pleural effusions w/associated atelectasis.
Abdominal x-ray demonstrated 8.6 cm dilated loops.
CT abd/pelvis unchanged from previous and did not show any ileus, perforation or new acute process.
Abdominal distension resolved by time of discharge.
#) Mental status changes: Patient had several nights of sundowning in the ICU which were treated with reorientation and haldol prn.
On one occasion patient had an unresponsive period in the early morning where he was not responsive to voice or tactile stimulation.
Neurology was consulted, but it was unclear what the etiology of these mental status changes were.
Most likely etiology may have been bacteremia given that blood cultures from this date grew coag negative staph bacteria sensitive to vanco.
He did not have mental stsatus changes after transfer to the floor and remained oriented x 3.
# Multiple Myeloma: Patient has been on Revlimid which may have been contributing to hypothyroidism on admission.
Anemia & thrombocytopenia on admission likely due to marrow suppression from treatment.
Revlimid was held on admission secondary to concern for contribution to presentation.
Bone marrow biopsy performed on [**2165-10-22**] for concern for worsening disease with slightly elevated creatinine and decreased WBC.
#Coag negative Staph Aureus bacteremia: Pt had Coagulase neg staph aureus + blood cx x 2 on [**10-7**] and [**10-8**].
Repeat TFTs on Monday [**10-14**] showed decreased TSH of 27 (from 54) and increased free T4 and T3 compared to prior.

Hypothyroidism 2.

Multiple Myeloma 2.
HTN 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Glaucoma- diagnosed 5 yrs ago, stable on timolol     Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, pain well controlled   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with right foot pain and elevated pressures in the muscle compartments in your legs with blood work indicating muscle damage.
Other blood work showed that you had low thyroid hormone levels which may have contributed to your symptoms.
During your admission, we did studies that showed some bacteria in your blood which we treated with an antibiotic called Vancomycin through [**10-19**].
Repeat studies showed that this infection had resolved.
On [**2165-10-22**] you had a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate the status of your multiple myeloma since your white blood cell and red blood cell counts were lower and your renal function was mildly impaired.
We stopped your calcium carbonate since it can interact with Levothyroxine and increased your Vitamin D dose since you were found to have low levels.
Please call your primary oncologist or the hematology/oncology or BMT fellow on call if you develop fever >100.4, chills, nausea, vomiting, worsening leg pain, redness or pain around the wounds.in your legs.
