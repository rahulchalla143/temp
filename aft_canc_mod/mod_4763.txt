Pt had been treated with antibiotics for recent bronchitis.
Despite abx continued to have SOB and then developed hemoptysis with frank blood.
CT showed a large mediastinal mass and adenopathy.
w/ continued hemoptysis and was taken to OR by IP who found a large mass - non differentiated non small cell cancer - s/p debridement/coagulation of bleeding.
History of Present Illness: Pt is a 54yo male w/ thalasemia minor and recent bronchitis/PNA 2 weeks ago who presented to OSH w/ massive hemoptysis on [**3-28**].

IMAGING: CXR ON DISCHARGE: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Unchanged large right hilar mass causes right middle and lower lobe post-obstructive atelectasis, slightly improved in the interval.
Persistent small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Slightly improved right basilar atelectasis status post extubation.
Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
NOTE: SEE REPORTS SECTION FOR SEQUENCE OF CXR's DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION.
No interval change in the right intermedius stent position.
Stable right lower lobe collapse, with slightly increased right-sided pleural effusion, stable right perihilar mass.
Interval improvement in left lower lobe aeration with residual small atelectasis and residual consolidation.
Although, this may represent volume averaging artifact and no free air is seen within the abdomen, clinical correlation is recommended.
Stability of right middle lobe infiltrate, right upper lobe nodule and cholelithiasis, without cholecystitis.
6 x 6 x 5 cm right parahilar mass with associated right lower lobe collapse.
Non-opacification of adjacent segmental pulmonary vessels due to slow flow or thrombosis due to tumor compression.
2.Mediatinal adenopathy bilaterally.
Left lower lobe consolidation.
Diffuse haziness in the right middle lobe which may represent an early infiltrative process.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
5 mm right upper lobe nodule of unclear significance.

Pathology showed non-small cell malignancy.
He was treated with 7 XRT treatments to prevent future hemoptysis.
The stent was removed, leaving NO HARDWARE/STENTS/NOR OTHER DEVICES in his lung and he was successfully extubated.
REGARDING CANCER:  The CT chest showed hilar enlargement bilaterally consistent with, but not diagnosic of, stage IIIb disease (the contralateral LAD could have been reactive from an infection).
The pt would also need MRI of the head to r/o metastatic disease there.
The pt described numbness and had an exam c/w decr sensation over the ventral and dorsal 5th digit and ulnar [**11-20**] of the 4th digit.
He had no weakness on exam.
He had some tenderness over the ulnar portion of the elbow and this recreated the numbness in his R hand.
