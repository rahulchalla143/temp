Blunting of the left posterior costophrenic angle, potentially due to atelectasis or Bochdalek hernia, noting at underlying consolidation cannot be completely excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly concerning for lymphoma.
4-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Lower Extremity Doppler [**2182-9-11**] No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the bilateral lower extremities.
Echo [**2182-9-12**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
No significant valvular abnormality.
Note: The nodal tissue is effaced with a dense infiltrate comprised predominantly of small lymphocytes with condensed nuclear chromatin.
Frequent large atypical cells containing one to two nuclei with vesicular chromatin, large eosinophilic nucleolus, and moderate amount of cytoplasm consistent with Hodgkin cells and [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells, are present.
The background reactive lymphoid infiltrate consists predominantly of small T-cells which are CD3 positive and TdT negative, along with scattered CD20 and PAX-5 positive B-cells.
CD23 highlights residual disrupted follicular dendritic framework but does not stain the large neoplastic cells.
BCL-2 highlights the majority of the background small reactive lymphocytes.
Pericellular fibrosis is not seen.
Overall, the features are consistent with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Immunophenotyping [**2182-9-13**] INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings show a B cell population.
However, preliminary tissue biopsy reveals features suggestive of Hodgkin lymphoma (see separate report).
RUE Doppler [**2182-9-15**] IMPRESSION:  Partially occlusive thrombus along the right PICC throughout the entirety of the right basilic vein, extending into the right axillary and likely right subclavian veins.
No other changes are seen.

Differential diagnosis includes sepsis vs hypovolemia.
Patient appeared volume depleted on exam and endorsed decreased PO intake.
# Febrile Neutropenia: Patient presented with fever in setting of neutropenia (ANC 648).
Etiology unclear, but possibly due decubitus ulcer on coccyx.
Patient endorsed no respiratory symptoms and chest x-[**Month/Day/Year **] showed no acute processes.
He also had no urinary symptoms and normal U/A.
Fever curve improved and antibiotics were discontinued [**9-14**] after a 5 day course.
# Lymphadenopathy- Patient has lymphadenopathy concerning for underlying lymphoma.
He had an inguinal biopsy the week prior to which showed benign lymph node with fatty replacement.
CT showing extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
Biopsy consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma, as was bone marrow biopsy done [**9-14**].
Patient subsequently developed right upper extremity swelling.
An ultrasound showed a partially occlusive thrombus along the right PICC throughout the entirety of the right basilic vein, extending into the right axillary and likely right subclavian veins.
Due to concern for future issues with PICC, port placement was done [**2182-9-20**] and left PICC was also removed.
Previously in hospitalization, there was concern about lower extremity DVT due asymmetric edema, but LENIs were negative.
# Pancytopenia:  WBC 0.9, HCT 23.8 and PLT 58 on presentation secondary to underlying hematological malignancy.

You were hospitalized with fever and found to have a low number of infection fighting cells.
The cause of your fever was never found.
