BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2151-6-29**], the patient underwent a purportedly uneventful right upper and middle lobectomy without complication.
By the afternoon of postoperative day #1, the patient had been extubated, however, had a persistent inotrope support requirement.
By postoperative day #3, the patient was comfortable, however, remained extremely disoriented.
There was some question of whether his disorientation was secondary to alcoholic withdrawal or was secondary to his respiratory distress.
On the morning of [**2151-7-4**], the patient was found to have increased work of breathing and deterioration in his mental status.
Again, it was unclear if this was secondary to his respiratory failure or advanced signs of delirium tremens.
Several attempts were made at weaning sedation and vent management, but the patient became increasingly agitated and had difficulty breathing during each of these events.
On [**2151-7-6**], the patient became hypotensive and dyspneic.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed, showing a high output picture consistent with sepsis.
