Emphysematous changes in the lungs are again visualized.
There is improved aeration in the left lower lung with decreased effusion; however, there continues to be some retrocardiac volume loss.
Old rib fractures on the right are again seen   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a laparoscopic esophagectomy.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled with a thoracic epidural catheter.
His epidural was removed and he was treated with oxycodone for pain via the j tube.
A barium swallow was done on post op day #6 which confirmed no anastomotic leak and he began a liquid diet which he tolerated well.
Unfortunately his J tube site started to leak some purulent material and some erythema was noted around the tube.
The j tube site had a 1 cm area of cellulitis around the insertion site and was I&D'd at the bedside with placement of a wick.
He was also placed on Keflex and the wound was monitored for another 24 hours.
He remained afebrile and his pain at the J tube site decreased.
