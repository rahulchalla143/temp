Admission Date:  [**2169-5-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-5-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2116-12-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress and right-sided weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with a history of Tourette's, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, right bundle-branch block, and a history of a myocardial infarction at 34 years of old presenting with shortness of breath and right-sided weakness.
A chest x-ray was done which was thought to be consistent with a pneumonia.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of an acute stroke.
In the Emergency Department, the patient had a computed tomography angiogram positive for a pulmonary embolus.
Head computed tomography was repeated which showed a large apical mass.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of his pulmonary embolus and acute stroke.
Over the past three prior to admission he had increased shortness of breath, left calf pain, weakness, lethargy, headache, and neck discomfort.
History of Tourette's (with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder).
Right bundle-branch block.
History of myocardial infarction at the age of 34.
History of Bell's palsy.
ALLERGIES:  .....................  FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with prostate cancer and colon cancer.
Mother with scleroderma, congestive heart failure, and history deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (on chronic Coumadin).
He was talking in 1-word to 2-word sentences with an expressive aphasia and difficulty word finding.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
Heart revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds with distant heart sounds.
The lungs had bilateral rhonchi.
Extremities had 1+ pitting edema on the left.
Right-sided facial droop.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Lower extremity Doppler studies showed a deep venous thrombosis in the left popliteal vein.
A chest x-ray showed a right apical lung mass with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with patchy left lower lobe atelectasis and increased interstitial markings diffusely, suggestive of lymphangitic spread.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Last Name (LF) 43369**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, anterior space fat pad, no wall motion abnormalities.
A computed tomography of the head with contrast showed a subacute left frontal lobe infarction.
A computed tomography angiogram of the chest showed right lower lobe thrombus in the segmental branch and a 4.4-cm X 4.9-cm mass in the right apex of the lung, positive lymphadenopathy, and patchy opacification in the right upper lobe, with atelectasis in the left lower base, and a fatty liver.
A carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis of the bilateral carotids.
An x-ray of the orbit showed no metallic foreign bodies.
An electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia at 120, with Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF.
There was a intraventricular conduction delay with a right bundle morphology with ST depressions in V3 and T wave inversions in V1.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for better monitoring of his respiratory status.
He was in acute respiratory distress on admission and was placed on noninvasive positive pressure  ventilation for a brief period of time.
His shortness of breath symptomatically improved, and he required 3 liters by nasal cannula when he was stable.
He was placed on a heparin drip for his pulmonary embolism as well as his deep venous thrombosis.
A computerized axial tomography was also positive for a right upper lobe apical mass which was nonobstructive.
This was suspicious for a cancer; either lung cancer or a lymphoma.
There was an increased risk for recurrent pulmonary emboli given the patient's deep venous thrombosis if the patient was to be taken off of his heparin drip for a bronchoscopy.
The patient will be taken for a bronchoscopy on [**2169-5-12**] for a biopsy of his right upper lobe apical mass.
The patient's partial thromboplastin time goal for his pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis is between 60 and 80.
The patient was treated empirically for a postobstructive pneumonia as the patient was febrile on admission.
All sputum cultures grew moderate oropharyngeal flora.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient sustained two ischemic events causing a right-sided paresis as well as a Broca aphasia.
A repeat head computed tomography showed normal evolution of his two ischemic strokes in the left frontal parasagittal area as well as the left occipital temporal area.
There was no sign of hemorrhagic transformation.
A transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study was performed to assess for intracardiac shunt, and was negative for atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Year (4 digits) 43369**].
Carotid ultrasounds were also performed to look for an embolic source of his strokes and were negative for stenoses.
A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography could not be performed during this hospital stay secondary to the patient's agitation and inability to lay still for a long period of time.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of demand ischemia with a peak creatine kinase of 184, MB of 20, and troponin T of 1.04.
Electrocardiogram showed old evidence of ischemia in the inferior leads.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 25% with no wall motion abnormalities.
No further anticoagulation for cardiac ischemia was given secondary to his new cerebrovascular accident and an increased risk of bleed.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient likely has a hypercoagulable state from possible cancer as well as likely a genetic predisposition to form clots.
He has a history of hypercoagulability in his mother, and his daughter has a history of multiple miscarriages.
The family was counseled and recommended to have genetic testing done.
The patient was to follow up with Hematology/Oncology to have outpatient hypercoagulability studies as well as to have follow up with his sputum cytology +/- lung biopsy.
He had an anemia consistent with a chronic disease anemia with a normal B12, folate, and thyroid-stimulating hormone.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient complained of nausea for several days after he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit.
A computed tomography of the chest showed that there was a fatty liver, and this should be followed up as an outpatient.
His nausea continued to improve and may have been secondary to his antibiotics.
