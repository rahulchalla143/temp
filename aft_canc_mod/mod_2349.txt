EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left bundle-branch block.
ST-T wave changes consistent with the left bundle-branch block.
PA/lateral CXR FINDINGS: The heart and mediastinal contours are stable with cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle secondary to small left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly and small left pleural effusion.
No evidence for CHF.
Malacic changes are noted in the right parietal region attributable to the prior surgery for meningioma.
There are small low-density zones in the anterior aspect of the right internal capsule attributable to chronic infarct.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
Specifically, there is no evidence of flow abnormality in the vertebrobasilar circuit or in the posterior cerebral arteries.
There is mild irregularity of the carotid arteries in the post-cavernous and cavernous portions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of posterior fossa circulation flow abnormality.
Enhancing nodule in operative bed consistent with recurrent meningioma.
EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due the presence of intermittent slowing in the right posterior quadrant, rasing the possiblity of a focal subcortical dysfunction in that area.
This was overshadowed by the background slowing and bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing suggestive of an encephalopathy; medications, infection and metabolic abnormalities are the most common causes.
No epileptiform discharges or seizures were noted.
CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
The aorta contains atherosclerotic calcifications with a small amount of mural thrombus but is otherwise unremarkable.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is a small nodular opacity in the left upper lung lobe.
There are minimal dependent changes and subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally.
There is tiny left pleural effusion.
There is a 3-mm nodule seen peripherally within the right upper lung lobe.
There are scattered bullae throughout the lung fields suggesting emphysematous changes.
There are small, non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes seen within the mediastinum, specifically within the right paratracheal region measuring up to 8 mm.
There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the visualized thoracic spine.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Small left upper lobe nodular opacity which may represent scarring or early focus of airspace consolidation.
3-mm right upper lung lobe nodule.
Small, 5-mm, enhancing focus in the posterior right lobe of the liver, which is incompletely characterized on this examination.
When the patient's clinical condition improves, a liver ultrasound may help for further characterization.
Possible thickening of the esophagus throughout its intrathoracic course.
Patient has undergone previously known resection of a right posterior frontoparietal convexity tumor presumably representing a meningioma.
No midline shift or mass effect is present.
There is a small area of residual enhancement noted along the periphery of the posterior frontal convexity, probably representing either residual meningioma or postoperative meningeal scarring.
No acute territorial infarcts are seen within the brain on diffusion images.
Scattered foci of magnetic susceptibility are noted within the left thalamus and right periventricular white matter, unchanged in appearance since the previous exam suggestive of possible small cavernous angiomas or changes related to amyloid angiopathy.
Scattered T2 hyperintense foci are noted along the periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic or gliotic changes.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of the previously noted vasogenic edema since the prior exam of [**2115-7-6**], along the right posterior frontal convexity.
Patient has undergone resection of an extraaxial lesion with postsurgical changes seen.
There is no underlying mass effect or edema on the current exam.
There are several scattered foci of magnetic susceptibility representing either small cavernomas or changes related to amyloid angiopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: # AMS: Patient transferred from [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where she was brought for altered mental status onset while undergoin brain xrt for recurrent meningioma with accelerated changes on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Patient was found to have a urinary tract infection, which was likely a contributing factor.
Brain MRI was without new findings.
Patient was combative on admission but soon after admission had an episode of unresponsiveness in the setting of hypotension.
EEG was without epileptic focus but did show encephalopathy.
Neurology was consulted and recommended CTA brain to rule out filling defects.
ECHO with suggestion of diastolic CHF but normal EF.
# Meningioma:  Brain xrt initially held but restarted [**2115-9-25**].
She is continued on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Please correct this for her renal failure and low albumin (3.1).
Patient was HIT antibody positive.
No indication for anticoagulation.
# Afib: Patient admitted with afib with rapid ventricular response (hr 111).
She continues to have occasional hr up to 120s also consistent with afib with RVR.
Discussed with neurooncologist who states it would not be contraindicated given low risk of bleeding with meningioma.
# PPx.
# Communication.
Full per discussion with family but no prolonged intubation.
