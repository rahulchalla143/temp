She had been in her USOH until two days ago, when her husband reports that she has been increasingly sleepy, noting that she awakes to eat and take her pain medications, but otherwise has been more somnolent than usual.
No apparent complaints about HA.
Of note, she was recently started on palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed for her metastatic lung cancer with mets to her left femur, which she has been medicating with around the clock oxycontin and oxycodone.
Noted that she had weakness on her right side, but was looking around with apparent full EOM.
Past Medical History: -- metastatic lung adenocarcinoma -- diagnosed in [**7-/2136**] after she had left thigh pain and suspicious lytic lesions of her left femur were found.
Repeat imaging of femur on [**10-8**] showed no fracture or any acute changes of femur -- Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and s/p MI x3 -- recently (first at age 58, clean cath at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital; second on [**2136-5-21**] and third on [**2136-5-23**], again admitted to [**Hospital3 417**], ultimately diagnosed with "broken heart syndrome", f/b Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**] at [**Hospital1 1474**] Cardiology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 1774**]).

Did not react to any stimulation on right side.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute large territorial infarction.
Recommend MRI for increased sensitivity for detection.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
Evolution of left MCA acute infarction with interval development of hypodense areas, with 4-mm rightward shift, but no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
Assessment for any neoplastic lesions is limited.
Chronic involutional changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 63yo woman with a complex PMHx including recently diagnosed metastatic lung adenocarnioma, takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated by MI x3, DM, HTN, COPD, and HL who presented on [**10-9**] with acute onset aphasia and and right sided weakness s/p tPa at OSH.
# NEURO: On examination, the patient had a dense right hemiparesis and left gaze deviation and was initially somnolent.
Initial CT-head at [**Hospital1 18**] showed no obvious infarct.
Repeat CT-head [**10-10**] showed a large L MCA infarct with 4mm of midline shift.
Family meeting [**10-11**] and the outcome was for CMO status after extubation  # CARDS: Patient had episodes of rapid AF on [**10-10**] and was started on IV metoprolol and briefly (2 hours) required pressor support with neosynephrine although the lowest recorded SBP was 90.
Repeat CT-head [**10-10**] showed a large L MCA infarct with 4mm o midline shift.
