MRI on admission showed: "There is a mass in the left lobe of liver (segment III) with extensive subcapsular hematoma arising from this and extension of the subcapsular hematoma out of the capsule in the midline upper abdomen.
There is an additional lesion in segment VI likely representing an adenoma.
The segment III lesion could represent an adenoma or hemangioma but is difficult to characterize because of the degree of hemorrhage."
In addition she had reported a past history for bleeding which had been worked up in the past without remarkable findings.
In summary, the patient had a markedly enlarged and fatty liver.
She had a large, relatively contained hematoma on the inferior surface of the left lateral segment.
The hematoma inferiorly was also adherent to the upper pole of the spleen.
The incision had a small area at the apex that was covered with a DSD, otherwise the incision was clean dry and intact.
