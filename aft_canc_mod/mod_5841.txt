**FINAL REPORT [**2178-6-26**]**    Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2178-6-26**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2178-6-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
if pulmonary Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis,       Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis is strongly suspected, contact the       Microbiology Laboratory (7-2306).
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2178-6-30**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
No effusion or pneumothorax is present.
Several expansile blastic metastases are again seen, most notably in the anterior left sixth rib.
Healed fractures of the lateral aspects of several right middle ribs with associated pleural thickening is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Right lung base opacity/consolidation raising concern for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
There is increasing opacification in both the right and left lungs and I suspect that most of this is due to failure rather than a diffuse spread of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Cardiac failure.
CXR [**6-28**]: HISTORY: ARDS versus severe pneumonia.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-27**], there has been a dramatic decrease in bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
Rapid clearing suggests a flash pulmonary edema in a patient with some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia at this time.
Evidence of previous right rib fractures with expansion of what appears to be the seventh or eighth ribs on the left, apparently consistent with the patient's known metastatic disease.
CXR [**6-29**]: The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral multifocal airspace opacities.
There is a confluent left lower lobe opacity.
No definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is a mild vascular congestion with stable confluent left lower lobe opacity.
There is minimal increase in left retrocardiac opacity which could be due to an atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation.
Pleural effusions if any are mild bilaterally.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**6-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

# Sepsis: The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, differential with left shift, and evidence of RML infiltrate, indicating SIRS with source of infection.
The most likely source of infection was pneumonia, given CXR on admission and his physical exam, but other causes including bacteremia and UTI were investigated.
Differential diagnosis for his pneumonia included bacterial pneumonia, PCP pneumonia and fungal pneumonia, which were investigated on a mini-BAL that did not identify a pathogen.
He was not hypotensive during this admission.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure # Bacterial pneumonia # Sepsis Most likely initial cause was pneumonia; however, differential diagnosis included PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] given history of malignancy, and pleural effusion.
He initially improved on mechanical ventilation, but developed worsening hypoxemia on [**6-27**], with a chest x-ray that was concerning for ARDS vs. diffuse alveolar hemorrhage vs. flash pulmonary edema.
He had a normocytic anemia from his pre-hospitalization baseline of 35.6.
Differential diagnosis of his anemia included diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which had been suggested on CXR, vs. dilution although not all cell lines were affected vs. GI bleed though the patient was Guaiac negative.
His anemia is suspected due to his period of critical illness, and possible splenic sequestration.
# Prostate cancer: Patient received Lupron (given every 3 months) prior to admission.
He has significant pain secondary to bony metastases, and pain was controlled during this admission.
# Prostatic urethral tear: During the admission, pt had a traumatic foley placement for which Urology was consulted.
Cystoscopy was performed with finding prostatic urethral tear and a bladder neck contracture.
