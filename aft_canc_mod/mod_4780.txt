In the MICU, he arrives intubated, sedated and with a pulse.
Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Myocardial infarction s/p PCI 3) Coronary artery disease 4) Bladder carcinoma in situ, hematuria .
Family History: unable to obtain  Physical Exam: On admission: VS: Temp: BP: / HR: RR: O2sat GEN: Intubated, sedated, thin elderly man HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g RESP: Diffuse, heavy rhonchi bilaterally ABD: distended, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly, no BS  EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: Intubated, sedated .
Small bilateral pneumothoraces with bilateral chest tubes in place.
Diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally, which may reflect pulmonary edema, but an underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI and stent, bladder carcinoma in situ, who presents from nursing home found to be unresponsive and found to be in cardiac arrest.
Most likely etiology of PEA was hypovolemic blood loss given presenting HCT of 19.7 which is 20 points down from baseline (down from 37 on [**2155-6-17**] per nsg home records).
Would consider blood loss from bladder CA/hematuria history, vs occult GI bleed.
Consider QT prolongation from recent cipro vs aspiration PNA/hypoxia as other etiologies.
Patient initially with an extremely poor prognosis, with a lactate of 14.6, pH of 6.94, on four pressors and MAPs of 50s, incompatible with life and consistent with diffuse cell death.
