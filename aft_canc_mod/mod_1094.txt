Admission Date:  [**2122-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-11-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Toprol Xl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Cough, respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with ultrasound Gastrostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 66F with complicated oncologic history, [**Last Name (un) 35473**] lymphoma s/p mantle radiation, breast ca s/p L mastectomy and recent diagnosis of squamous cell esophageal cancer.
She was discharged to follow up with GI for repeat EUS/endoscopy and possible repeat esophageal dilatation.
Other PMHx includes CAD s/p CABG and recent stent, pericarditis on chronic steroids, and recurrent L pleural effusion s/p  talc pleurodesis.
Post-procedurally the ICU team was called to evaluate the patient for hypotension and respiratory distress.
She was mostly complaining of insessant cough with secretions.
No chest pain, minimal dyspnea, no pain elsewhere.
In the PACU she was given 1 albuterol neb for her cough and wheezes on exam and she improved markedly, her initial NC 02 was able to be weaned to 1L from 6L, she was sating 97-100% on this, desatting to 88% on RA.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient reported some improvement in her symptoms, no further coughing or respiratory distress, no dyspnea, now complaining of substernal pain/pressure, worse with swallowing, "I feel like I need to belch."
Denies HA, vision change, sore throat, nausea/vomiting, abd pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena or hematochezia.
Has had b/l LE swelling since last hospitalization.
Recurrent disease treated with chemotherapy -Coronary artery disease: s/p PCI/stent and 2v CABG [**8-/2114**] -Hypothyroidism -s/p CCY, s/p appy -Chronic pericarditis on chronic prednisone.
-Left breast cancer s/p mastectomy in [**2103**] with left lymphedema  -Recurrent left pleural effusion s/p VATS, biopsy and talc pleurodesis in [**2114**] -Left diaphragmatic paralysis -Esophageal stricture s/p dilatation  Social History: Former smoker, quit 15 years ago, occasional alcohol, married, lives with husband, has 4 grown children.
Neck: supple, no elevated JVP Pulmonary: slight crackles left base, diffuse wheezes (improved after nebs).
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities:1+ pitting edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l.
Swollen left arm Skin: superficial venous prominence, left chest.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae, as well as extensive fibrocalcific thickening of the mitral annulus and the contiguous annular portion of the leaflets (however, no frank mitral stenosis).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-4-3**], multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.
Slight interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
Findings compatible with volume overload.
N stage: There were no evidence of enlarged peri-esophageal lymph nodes.
LUE U/S [**5-9**]: No deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
Hip/femur x-rays [**5-9**]: No fracture.
CXR [**5-10**]: Overall similar to [**2122-5-8**], but with relative increased opacity in both right and left mid zones compared with [**2122-5-7**].
The etiology is somewhat uncertain, but most likely relates to increase in the size of the pleural effusions and possibly due to some increase in CHF.
TTE [**5-12**]: No significant pericardial effusion.
Arterial Doppler LUE [**5-15**]: Unremarkable Doppler waveforms throughout the left extremity, signifying no significant stenosis.
Per patient and recent notes, BP runs in 80-90s at home.
The most likely etiology was felt to be anesthesia effect versus dehydration.
The pt responded well to fluid boluses and her chronic prednisone was increased from 7.5mg to 15mg then down titrated again to 7.5 mg daily.
She continued to be mildly orthostatic with PT but was asypmtomatic and became SOB with boluses.
Esophageal CA: Staged T2-3N0 by EUS criteria, with large exophytic mass in esophagus not amenable to further dilation.
She was not felt to be a current candidate for surgery or XRT, but XRT would be considered in the future once her nutritional status improves.
IR placed a G tube that was complicated by hypercapnea/hypoxia thought likely related to medication effect.
However, once this resolved, tube feeds were started and advanced to goal without difficulty.
At this point, she seemed volume overloaded on exam and CXR.
Pt noted improvement in her dyspnea with diuresis, and was weaned off supplemental O2, although diuresis was limited by borderline hypotension and orthostasis.
Hypercapnea: Suspected that this was acute decompensation in setting of G tube placement, as patient is very sensitive to sedating medications.
A final contributor may be her radiation-induced lung disease leading to impaired ventilation.
Although the elevated bicarb in this setting was largely compensatory, it was also in part from diuresis-induced contraction alkalosis.
Upper extremity ultrasounds showed no DVT or arterial stenosis.
CAD: Known CAD with stents and CABG.
The pt did have some substernal discomfort at admission, likely in setting of EGD/insufflation although she had also been stressed with tachycardia, hypoxia, so demand ischemia was possible.
She remained off her anti-platelet agents in anticipation of her upcoming procedure, although they were later restareted.
Buttock lesions: DFA was negative, viral culture pending for HSV and VZV.
X-rays were negative and pain improved greatly, although she still noted intermittent pain.
