His Foley catheter was D/Ced on POD#4, and he voided without difficulty.
The patient tolerated these well, however on POD#4 developed cloudy output from his JP drain which was found to contain elevated triglycerides and a chyle leak was suspected.
By POD#7, his drain output became serosanguinous again, and his drain and staples were removed.
