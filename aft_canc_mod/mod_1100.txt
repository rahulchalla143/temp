Some upper zone redistribution may be present, particularly when compared to the two prior chest x-rays and I suspected degree of failure is present.
RENAL U.S.-Bilateral renal cysts, as detailed above, slightly increased in size from prior exam.
There is no hydronephrosis or renal masses.
ECHO ([**2124-7-2**]):IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction.
Moderate aortic, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-9**], LV cavity is larger, and both aortic and mitral regurgitation are more prominent.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1005**] is an 80 yo lady with a significant PMH including T2DM, CKD, CHF with EF 15-20% ([**10/2123**]), chronic thrombocytopenia thought to be due to ITP/MDS who presented to the hospital for a platelet count of 8.
Her hematocrit  acutely dropped from 28->25, and she became tachycardic with EKG changes and CP,but remained normotensive.
Cardiology reviewed her EKG, presentation and prior cardiac cath results and determined that these changes were most likely due to demand ischemia not an acute MI.
She was continued on a pantoprazole drip for this GI bleed and did not have another episode of melena.
GI was consulted during this admission but deferred scoping in the setting of cardiac ischemia and thrombocytopenia.
We believe this most recent episode of severe thrombocytopenia is likely due to an ongoing auto-immune process/ITP insult on top of myelofibrosis and decreased platelet production.
Acute Renal Failure: Her hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure with a Cr of 1.8 on admission.
Previous admissions have suggested SIADH vs reset osmostat.
Since admission her Cr slowly trended down to 1.2 at the time of discharge with an elevated FeNa which is suggestive of ATN.
Initially her ACEi was held due to ARF and was restarted prior to discharge as her renal function improved.
# Asymptomatic Urinary Tract Infection- A urine culture from a specimen obtained from a foley catheter was positive for polyresistant Enterobacter Cloacae.
The patient remained afebrile and asymptomatic during this admission and the decision was made to not start antibiotic therapy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] who also is board certified in Infectious Disease was made aware of this recent finding and agreed with the decision to hold off antibiotic treatment in the setting of no symptoms.
# Chronic sCHF: Pt did not appear decompensated during this admission.
We held her daily ASA 81 given her severe thrombocytopenia and also held her ACEi due to her ARF.
Her lungs remained clear on exam and she did not have any asthma exacerbations.
We also have made a follow up appointment with GI for investigation of her recent GI bleed.

You were admitted to the hospital because your platelet count was very low and you were at a high risk for bleeding.
We would like you to follow up with a GI doctor inorder to investigate the cause of this bleed further.
