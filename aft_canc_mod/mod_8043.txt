Admission Date:  [**2176-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-3-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Taken from admission note to MICU:  85 yo male with history CAD EF 70%, PAF, CKD, ILD radiographically consistent with UIP/IPF, pHTN followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], prostate cancer, bladder cancer, diverticulitis, spinal stenosis and renal calculi presents to the ED with complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dyspnea.
He recently was hospitalized on [**2176-2-20**] for a R hip fracture and discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2176-2-20**].
His course was complicated by hemoptysis thought to be due to intubation, and hypoxia that was thought to possibly be pneumonia and the patient was discharged with Levofloxaxin for possible infection/bronchitis.
He reports that his respiratory function has declined slightly over the past [**6-12**] weeks as he's had intermittently had difficulty climbing the stairs.
He denies any lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, pleuritic pain, increased cough, rhinorrhea, PND, orthopnea, palpitations, abdominal swelling, leg swelling or weight gain.
He also reports that over the past 3 days of nausea associated with bilious nonbloody vomiting and nonbloody copius diarrhea.
The diarrhea was reported as multiple times per day associated with abdominal cramping that was relieved with defecation.
He denies any increase in size or pain of his chronic ventral hernia and also denies hematochezia or melena.
He was noted to have a CXR with a possible left sided infiltrate and a KUB with air fluid levels and unchanged chronic ventral incisional hernia, which resulted in a Surgery consult and eventual unrevealing CT Abdomen.
He was treated with IV Vancomycin and IV Levofloxacin for pneumonia, diltiazem for tachycardia and given 2L NS and transferred to the ICU as he required a NRB for hypoxia   Past Medical History: 1.

Interstitial Lung Disease   Social History: Patient is a retired neurologist, previously worked at [**Hospital1 18**].
[**Name (NI) 1139**]: None ETOH: 3oz scotch at night Illicits: None   Family History: Mother healthy Father healthy Brother CABG [**51**] Sister healthy Brother died of prostate CA   Physical Exam: On Admission:  Vitals: T:98.4 BP:144/59 P:121 R:19 O2:100 NRB General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, poor dentition Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: bilateral lower field rhonchorous sounds L>R, extending 2/3 up the L posterior lung field CV: tachycardic, irregularly irregulat, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, large nontender ventral hernia, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: KUB [**2176-3-9**]: Multiple air-fluid levels without dilated bowel.
CXR [**2176-3-9**]: Chronic lung changes, with equivocal new opacity in the left upper lung.
Followup imaging is recommended if clinical symptoms persist.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Large ventral hernia containing loops of nonobstructed bowel.
Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Severe atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and branch vessels.
Moderately large hiatal hernia.
Extensive confluent fibrosis involving the lungs, progressed since [**2172-10-16**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Innumerable hypodensities in each kidney, incompletely assessed.
The severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
([**2176-3-12**])   Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo M with CAD, CHF, ILD, 2 weeks s/p ORIF of R femoral fx who p/w acute on chronic SOB and n/v/diarrhea.
Likely progression of events: CDiff diarrhea causing N/V/D-->aspiration event-->strain on lungs and heart-->SOB, decreased O2 sats, cardiac enzyme leak.
# Hypoxia/SOB: Thought to be multifactorial, including baseline ILD, new aspiration PNA, anemia, new NSTEMI, and diastolic CHF/fluid overload.
Pt was evaluated by speech and swallow and found to have no prandial aspiration, but given ventral and hiatal hernias, and recent vomiting, aspiration remained most likely cause of new pneumonia found on CT scan.
Pt had negative nasal rapid resp viral screen and contaminated sputum cultures.
Pt suffered an NSTEMI, leading to worsening diastolic CHF and worsening his respiratory status.
Pt had no EKG changes and was pain free but TTE was thought to show new right ventricular free wall motion defect.
Plavix was stopped (stent placed 3 years ago and guaiac positive stool) and ACE inhibitor stopped (for worsening renal function).
# diastolic CHF: Pt had known diastolic CHF, with TTE on this admission again showeing EF >60%.
He remained slightly hypervolemic and responded well to gentle diuresis.
# Atrial fibrillation: Due to pt's guaiac positive stool and anemia, pt was not able to be anticoagulated.
# CDiff colitis: Pt had had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and 2 C Diff toxins from there were negative.
The 3rd stool sent here returned positive and pt was successfully treated with PO Flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
Pt had minimal abdominal pain and at time of discharge had had no BM for several days and was afebrile.
WBC had peaked at 18 (in setting of simultaneous UTI and PNA) but was trending down at discharge.
# PNA: Pt noted to have new pneumonia in left upper and lower lobes, thought to be secondary to aspiration.
Of note, he had a rash allergy to penicillin but was tolerating the Ceftazedime well.
# Ecoli UTI: Pt was initially started on Cipro but later found to be resistent.
# ARF: Pt initially had a prerenal azotemia from diarrhea, improved with hydration.
He later required diuresis for CHF and renal function fluctuated.
# Anemia: Pt was noted to have anemia, with iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
He was guaiac positive in setting of C Diff colitis and known diverticulosis.
He required 2 units pRBCs on [**3-11**] for Hct 22.5, in setting of NSTEMI and shortness of breath.
Outpt diagnostic colonoscopy could be considered if symptoms persist.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hypoxia C Diff colitis Pneumonia E Coli UTI  Secondary: Interstitial lung disease Chronic Diastolic CHF   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting well on 3L, no diarrhea  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for hypoxia and gastroenteritis.
We believe the progression of events were as follows: Recent fall and hip fracture required a stay at rehab, where you developed Clostridium difficile colitis.
This caused not only diarrhea, but also nausea and vomiting which was likely complicated by an aspiration.
You also simultaneously developed a urinary tract infection.
We made the following changes to your medications: 1) Start Ceftazedime for pneumonia and UTI 2) Start  Please call your PCP or return to the hospital if you have any worsening or concerning symptoms.
