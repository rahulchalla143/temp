[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with metastatic hepatoma who presents with worsening ascites and hypotension REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: RUQ with dopplerspatent portal system?
INDICATION: Metastatic hepatoma, worsening ascites and hypotension.
Liver is nodular and shrunken, consistent with cirrhosis, with moderate ascites.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
There are bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion consistent with CHF.
Hyperdynamic LVEF.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, probably secondary to the underfilled left ventricular with hyperdynamic wall motion and ejection fraction.
