Admission Date:  [**2146-11-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-11-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-3-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Ceftriaxone / Vancomycin / Aztreonam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76 yo male with a history of asthma, gout, BPH, CRF (baseline Cr: 1.5-2.0) with two recent hospitalizations for pan-sensitive enterococcus complicated by AV endocarditis with resultant cerebral septic infarcts and a epidural abscess.
On the day of admission, the patient had a fever of 101.1 at rehab.
Since the patient has a history of infection (currently on daptomycin), the patient was sent to the hospital.
The patient is unable to give a clear history due to altered mental status.
The patient was originally admitted [**Date range (1) 71686**] with 6 weeks of fevers and back pain.
The patient was found to have bacteremia from pan-sensitive enterococcus with complications including aortic valve endocarditis and resultant septic emboli to the brain and spinal epidural abscess.
The route of enterococcal infection remains unclear, though there was mention of a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) vs. prostate biopsy being the possible source of infection.
The patient underwent a L5 laminectomy and S1 laminectomy and epidural abscess evacuation on [**9-30**].
The patient had altered mental status and tremors.
Neurology evaluated the patient and thought his tremors were likely a result of his bacteremia and possible CNS infection (LP not recommended).
The patient was readmitted from rehab and stayed in the hospital from [**Date range (1) 71687**] with continued fevers and lethargy.
During this hospitalization, the patient had an aspiration event with a brief period of hypotension and respiratory distress that required intubation.
The severity of these reactions remains unclear.

2+ pitting edema throughout tibia bilaterally.
3+ patellar/Achilles reflexes bilaterally.
Decreased rectal tone.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition is non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2146-10-28**] there is probably no significant change but baseline artifact in the limb leads makes comparison difficult.
Persistent multifocal opacities, most severe in retrocardiac region concerning for infection.
Pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-11-8**] at 4:10:32 PM  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
There is loss of intervertebral disc height and signal throughout the cervical spine.
However, there is no evidence of abnormal increased T2 signal within the disc spaces to suggest discitis.
There is no abnormal STIR signal within the vertebral bodies to suggest an infectious process.
Multilevel degenerative changes are again noted throughout the cervical spine, as detailed on the prior report from [**2146-9-28**].
Since that time, there is a stable appearance of the large disc bulges at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7, with a stable appearance of the spinal canal and neural foraminal narrowing.
There is no definite abnormal increased T2 signal within the cord.
The bone marrow signal is mildly heterogeneous, without increased T2 STIR signal to suggest edema.
The intervertebral discs preserve their height and signal, without evidence of discitis.
Again, the lack of intravenous contrast precludes complete evaluation, but there are no findings to indicate an underlying infection.
There is linear T2 hyperintensity within the thoracic cord that likely is artifactual in nature or may represent the central canal.
Mild disc bulges are again noted at a few levels, not significantly changed since the prior study from [**2146-9-15**].
There is also persistent edema in the posterior soft tissues, not significantly changed since the prior study.
At the L5-S1 disc space, there is persistent T2 hyperintensity at the endplates as well as within the disc, not significantly changed since prior examination.
The soft tissue phlegmon that extends immediately posterior to the L5-S1 disc extends along the nerve roots and is stable in appearance since the prior study when accounting for differences in technique.
There is no definite evidence of an epidural abscess, although the lack of intravenous contrast does decrease sensitivity.
The vertebral body height and alignment is otherwise preserved, with mild retrolisthesis of L2 on L3.
There are disc bulges at several levels as detailed previously, without interval change.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
Stable appearance of the abnormal T2 and STIR signal at the L5-S1 disc, with extension into the epidural soft tissues, consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis with epidural phlegmon.
There are no findings to indicate progression, nor are there findings specific for an epidural abscess, although the lack of intravenous contrast does decrease sensitivity.
Post-surgical changes are also noted status post laminectomy, without interval change.
Degenerative changes of the cervical and throacic spine as detailed above, without findings to indicate an infectious process.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2146-11-9**]  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm.
No EEG correlate was noted associated with small jerking movements of his left arm.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
Slowing and disorganization of the background suggests a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
These images show small focus of increased tracer uptake in the right anterior fourth rib.
There is early physiologic margination of the white cells in the lungs, but no focal uptake.
No other regions of abnormal uptake.
IMPRESSION: Small focus of increased tracer uptake in the right anterior fourth rib which could represent focal marrow uptake although infection would be difficult to exclude.
No other abnormal focus identified.
Occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein as before.
A 3mm focal area of nonocclusive thrombus is seen within the lumen of the right internal jugular vein.
No DVT is seen in the right subclavian vein, right axillary vein or right brachial vein.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-11-11**] at 3:25:01 PM      FINAL   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild distal anterior, septal and inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The wall motion abnormalities seen on the current study were probably present on the prior study.
No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or aneurysm.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, increased since [**10-30**] as well as progressive consolidation involving the aerated portion of both lungs, strikingly progressed in the left lung, all progressed and new from [**10-30**].
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
Patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities are again demonstrated.
The costophrenic sulci are blunted consistent with pleural fluid as before.
1.Osseous fragment adjacent to the lateral malleolus with demineralization of the donor site in the lateral malleolus, could represent old fracture with bone loss, however if the patient has acute symptoms relating to this area, a bone scan or MRI scan is recommended to rule out an osteomyelitis.
Possible old avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus.
Degenerative changes and minimal left ankle joint effusion   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2146-11-14**]):       YEAST.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2146-11-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo M with recent VRE endocarditis, spinal abcesses s/p laminectomy, recent prolonged intubation for aspiration PNA, readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab with recurrent aspiration, was stable on the floor; being treated with meropenem, when had an acute epsiode of tachypnea and respiratory distress, then transferred to the MICU with hypoxic respiratory failure.
# Aspiration Pneumonia: Patient has a history of recurrent aspiration pneuonia.
He was on a prolonged course of Daptomycin (last day was supposed to be [**11-14**]) for the spinal epidural abscesses and was started on Meropenem for pneumonia on [**11-8**].
The patient was switched from Daptomycin/Meropenem to Linezolid/Meropenem on [**11-10**] for better lung penetration to treat the pneumonia as well as to complete the epidural abscess treatment.
CT-A showed multifocal pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions and was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Patient has had elevated BNP and may have had component of diastolic CHF decompensation.
# Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis was likely unrelated to prior VRE as antibiotic course completed or spinal process as no interval change.
Blood cultures negative to date, and urine cultures positive for yeast.
ESR and CRP elevated during hospitalization, which may be related to gout flare or another inflammatory process.
Renal ultrasound was done to rule out fungal ball and showed none.
# Epidural abscess s/p L5-S1 laminectomy: MRI was unchanged from previous.
No further antibiotic treatment will be necessary for the epidural abscess after this course of linezolid.
He does sometimes complain of bilateral leg pain associated with his lower back pain.
# Lower Extremity Pain: Lower extremity pain bilaterally appears to be neuropathic, likely secondary to nerve damage from epidural abscess.
Tagged WBC scan did not show any uptake in the lower extremities, though there may have been increased uptake in the right anterior fourth rib.
Of note, the patient appears to minimize pain frequently and was more likely to admit to pain when in the presence of his family.
# Altered mental status: Patient had presented with altered mental status, only responding "yes" and "no" to questions.
Neurology was consulted, and the patient had received an EEG which did not show any active epileptiform activity, though it did show slowing and disorganization of the background signals, which suggested a possible mild encephalopathy.
# Myoclonic jerks: Patient has occasional myoclonic movements of upper and lower extremities.
There was no EEG correlation noted of these myoclonic jerks to any epileptiform activity.
# Lower extremity weakness: The patient presents with lower extremity weakness that was similar to his last admission, per Neurosurgery.
It likely relates to neurological damage and generalized deconditioning.
# Left Ankle pain:    His left ankle appeared to have increased tenderness to palpation, both on the medial and lateral side.
Because of his increased pain in the left ankle, Xrays of his left ankle were done to rule out osteomyelitis.
Xray showed osseous fragment adjacent to the lateral malleolus with demineralization of the donor site in the lateral malleolus, which likely represents old fracture with bone loss though it does not rule out osteomyelitis.
Because the tagged WBC scan had been negative for uptake in the lower extremities, osteomyelitis is unlikely in this site.
# Anemia: Patient has stable anemia during this admission with Hct around 24 (range 20-27), likely a combination of anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia, per iron studies in [**Month (only) 359**].
He will need a good bowel regimen in the setting of iron and pain medications.
# Hypertension: Patient's hypertension has been stable during this hospitalization with just metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg daily.
# Right arm swelling: The patient was noted to have a superficial cephalic vein clot on his right arm without the presence of DVT during an ultrasound on his last admission.
He was not anticoagulated during this hospitalization because the affected vein was superficial and would not put patient at risk for pulmonary embolism.
# Transaminitis: The patient presented with mild transaminitis, which had been trending down from previous hospitalization, including elevated LDH but normal total bilirubin levels.
The atorvastatin was stopped in the setting of transaminitis and was not restarted upon discharge.
# Thrombocytosis: Platelets in the 600Ks during this hospitalization, likely reactive thrombocytosis.
# Diarrhea: The patient has persistent diarrhea on presentation and was noted to be Negative for C. difficile in the setting of long-term antibiotics.
Patient failed multiple speech and swallow evaluations.
Of note, patient does cough while eating, but coughing does not correlate to aspiration, so he needs close followup to evaluate for aspiration.
