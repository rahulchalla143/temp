He reported an increase in his abdominal pain today, the location of the pain is across the lower quadrants.
He has been taking oxycodone with minimal relief, pain is present constantly and increases intermittently.
He has also had nausea and emesis times 3 this morning.
Pt had PET yesterday that showed disease progression in lymph nodes located in the abdomen and he will need chemotherapy for this.
In the ED he had a benign abdominal exam, was seen by surgery who ordered CT abd/pelvis which confirmed LAD, cannot r/o infection in necrotic tissue as compared to PET scan done yesterday, radiology was less concerned for infection, of note this did show a RLL pneumonia.
Past Medical History: NSCLC metastatic to subclavian lymph nodes in [**Month (only) **] 2008chemo/XRT  Atrial fibrillation PVD  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Had a right hilar mass on preoperative chest x-ray performed in anticipation of peripheral bypass surgery.
He was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in pulmonology and underwent PET/CT on [**2194-1-7**] which showed a 5.5 cm x 3.7 cm right infrahilar mass with spiculated borders as well as adenopathy in the mediastinal and subclavicular right lymph nodes.
Brain MRI on [**2194-1-16**] was negative for metastases.
FNA of the right lower lobe and FNA of the R4 lymph nodes were negative.
He then underwent FNA of the right subclavicular node by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2194-1-28**] with pathology positive for malignant cells consistent with metastatic nonsmall cell carcinoma favoring adenocarcinoma.

Single supine radiograph of the abdomen again demonstrates distended loops of small bowel and colon.
Distention of the small and large bowel suggests ileus.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6892**] Approved: MON [**2194-6-30**] 10:40 AM    Imaging Lab  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 73472**] Reason: Evaluate new leukocytosis and increasing abd pain.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    68 year old man with metastatic NSCLC, afib, PVD p/w progressive abd pain, N/V.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    Evaluate new leukocytosis and increasing abd pain.
Final Report INDICATION: 68-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, atrial fibrillation and PVD, now with progressive abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Please evaluate for source of new leukocytosis and abdominal pain.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
Right hilar spiculated mass is again partially imaged, and right basilar consolidation has worsened.
There is a new small right pleural effusion.
Kidneys are unchanged, with 6 cm fatty mass along the superior aspect of the left kidney, which remains most consistent with an exophytic angiomyolipoma or perirenal lipoma.
There is no bowel obstruction.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
There is no discrete fluid collection, or abscess.
CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel, and genitourinary structures are unchanged.
Enlarged iliac chain lymphadenopathy is not significantly changed.
There is no fracture.
Degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine are stable.
Worsening right lower lobe consolidation, possibly representing worsening post-obstructive pneumonia from large right hilar spiculated mass, less likely atelectasis.
New small associated right pleural effusion.
Unchanged widespread retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of his abdominal pain and of his tachycardia secondary to Afib with RVR.
No further management or dose adjustments were required.
Abdominal pain: His abdominal pain and distension was felt to be due necrotic lymph nodes seen on CT scan, consistent with rapid progression of his malignancy.
There was some concern that the lymph nodes might be a lymphoma rather than a spread of his lung cancer, however this was felt to be less likely and biopsy was deferred.
His abdominal pain was treated with dilaudid, morphine and a fentanyl patch.
Continued abdominal distension and lack of bowel movement prompted a KUB which showed distended large and small bowel loops consistent with an ileus.
The patient was made NPO and an aggressive bowel regiment was tried which successfully decreased the patient's abdominal pain post-bowel movement.
The patient had a chronic cough which remained stable.
The patient remained afebrile for the remainder of his admission.
This was felt likely secondary to his lack of sleep while in the hospital, however causes such as pain medications and possible worsening of malignancy with metastatis were considered.
An MRI of the brain was ordered for the day after discharge, as the patient refused to have one done while in the hospital, to rule out malignant metastasis.
The patient's family was also instructed to contact his physician if any acute changes or worsening in mental status occur prior to his scheduled clinic appointment.
