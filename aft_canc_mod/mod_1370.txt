Admission Date:  [**2109-10-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-10-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-1-1**]     Sex:  F  Service:  O-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old female with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, status post excision, status post chemotherapy and radiation following local recurrence, who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] after a 3-week hospitalization in [**Location (un) 34553**], [**State 108**] where she was with mental status changes and renal failure.
As per the patient's husband, the patient presented to urologist in [**State 108**] about one month ago with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection with nausea, and vomiting, fevers, and dark urine.
On [**9-9**] she had an ultrasound that was consistent with bilateral hydronephrosis and ureteral obstruction.
On [**9-10**] the patient was admitted to [**Location (un) 34554**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 34553**], [**State 108**] with decreased functional status, fatigue, nausea, low-grade fevers, and decreased colostomy output.
The patient was found to have evidence of colonic stool impaction and ileus and bilateral hydronephrosis with a urinary tract infection.
The ileus was presumed to be secondary to urosepsis.
On [**9-11**] the patient became increasingly disoriented, incoherent, and decreasing responsive.
She had a magnetic resonance imaging of the head that was negative for metastatic disease.
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**9-11**] which showed dilated bowel loops suggestive of obstruction with bilateral ectasia of renal collecting septum.
She had a repeat abdominal CT on  [**2109-10-2**] with new 5-cm soft tissue density in the right pelvis with a question of abscess versus hematoma versus neoplasm.
On [**10-3**] a tagged red blood cell scan was negative for localization to right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant.
He does note her mental status has been poor for the last two to three weeks but has had some days that are better than others.
Squamous cell bladder carcinoma diagnosed on [**2109-1-30**]; stage IV with invasion into the paravaginal regional and left vaginal wall.
She is status post cystectomy and lymph node dissection with ileal loop diversion and pelvic exoneration.
She is also status post rectovaginal fistula secondary to radiation therapy, status post surgery.
History of urinary tract infections, positive for pseudomonas.
History of sacral decubitus ulcer.
History of recurrent infection of ureteral drainage.
History of mitral valve prolapse.
History of chronic vaginal discharge.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient was awake, responsive to some commands, had difficulty articulating her responses, in no acute distress.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed dry mucous membranes.
No erythema or exudate.
No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular was rapid, regular, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating to the axilla.
Lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally with poor air movement, but no wheezes or crackles.
Abdomen was tense, distended, question of right lower quadrant mass, positive bowel sounds, negative rebound or guarding.
Back revealed sacral decubitus ulcer with wide base.
No obvious tracking or extension, packed with gauze.
No focal weakness was appreciated.
Urinalysis with 22 red blood cells, no epithelial cells, small blood.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram with a rate of 75, regular rhythm, normal axis, no P-T, and no acute ST-T wave changes.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with an elevated white count and low-grade fever suggestive of acute infectious process, likely urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis.
This was for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia that led to some respiratory failure.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient with a high calcium likely secondary to renal failure and/or metastatic disease.
Also with hyperkalemia treated with Kayexalate and insulin.
RENAL:  The patient with acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient with known bladder cancer.
She had a right pelvic mass that was re-evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging that was thought to be recurrence of tumor.
She also had a bone scan that showed no metastatic disease to her bones.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with initially elevated INR and given vitamin K.  5.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient had respiratory decompensation on [**2109-10-10**], with desaturations into the 80s on 100% nonrebreather.
During that time the patient was tachycardic up to the 200s and with elevated blood pressure.
