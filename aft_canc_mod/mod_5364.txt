Wound re-exploration  History of Present Illness: 66 F with known metastatic renal cell carcinoma, was admitted on [**2163-11-25**] with fever and worsening abdominal pain.
Soft, non-tender, mildly distended.
A CXR showed a left pleural effusion and LLL atelectasis.
A medicine consult was obtained to help work up her bacteremia, continued tachycardia, new hypoxia on RA, and ongoing emesis.
A CTA of her chest showed no evidence of a PE but increasing bilateral pleural effusions.
Surgical consultation was obtained for abdominal distension and pain.
CT scan confirmed a colonic perforation with stool and PO contrast in the abdominal cavity.
On post-operative day #2, the patient was noted to have copious serous drainage from the inferior aspect of her wound.
The wound was locally explored and fascia was intact.
Continued drainage, however, prompted re-evaulation of the entire wound in the operating room which was found to be intact.
She tolerated jejunal tube feeds and bedside and video swallow evaluation showed some risk of aspiration which is controlled via chin tuck maneuver.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Please continue to assess need for ongoing diuresis.
