Per facility report, patient originally presented on [**2134-2-23**] after recent hospitalziation for GIB from diverticulitis and espohagitis.
Day prior to presentation, had a low grade temperature around 99.
Also of note, patient was dyspnic, SOB with "congestion" on lung auscultation saturating 78% on room air.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia, and was diagnosed with a PE based on EKG earlier in [**2133**] with EKG findings of S1, Q3, T3, TTE showing right heart strain and elevated d dimer ([**Numeric Identifier 43132**]), and treated with enoxaparin.
He was recently seen at [**Hospital1 18**] at the beginning of the month with a GIB ultimately deemed to be a diverticular bleed while on enoxaparin.
A UA was performed which was positive for LE, 124 WBCs, few bacteria and yeast, and <1 epi.
Patient is AOx3, but lethargic and having rigors.

There is no obvious consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.

# Fever and Hypotension:  Presented from rehab with fever to 102.
Noted to have hypotension on admission with systolics to the 80's.
Given evidence of hypoglycemia(see below), initial concern for adrenal insufficiency vs resolving urosepsis.
UA was cloudy but no growth in urine culture.
Supporting adrenal insufficiency was the presence of peripheral eosinophils, hypotension with hypoglycemia.
After 24 hours, was able to be weaned from pressores with restoration of mental status.
Hypoglcyemia had persisted however necessitating dextrose drip per below.
He was switch to levofloxacin 750mg daily for better lung coverage given a persistent cough (which he has had for about a month),  after a negative urine culture.
# Hypoglycemia:  Patient with known diabetes mellitus, but no history or evidence of long acting insulin administration prior to admission.
Per rehab facility, patient is "always hypoglycemic", and receives oral hypoglycemics for diabetes management.
Given these findings, decided to assess for adrenal insufficiency.
Given hypotension and potential infection, would anticipate higher cortisol levels.
History of pulmonary embolism:  per prior notes, had evidence of EKG changes suggestive of PE as well as an echo with right ventricular hypokinesis/dilatation and a D-Dimer >[**Numeric Identifier 6085**].
He had a LGIB as a consequence of this within the month, and his anticoaguatlion was stopped and an IVC filter was placed instead.
In house, initial concern for PE given admission hypoxia and hypotension, but hypoxia resolved as well as issues with hypotension and CT scan was not pursued.
Hematuria- The patient develop intermittent hematuria after removal of his foley catheter.
History of lower GIB and diverticulosis: currently off anticoagulation with baseline hematocrit.
He was given 1 unit of blood prior to discharge anticipating drop in Hematocrit.
Esophatigits:  consequence of radiation therapy.
Will follow up with primary oncologist on [**2134-3-30**] at 11:00 AM at [**Location (un) **] Oncology for further managment.
