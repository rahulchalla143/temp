History of Present Illness: This patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma in the region of the left brow and had previously been resected.
She had perineural involvement.
The patient developed a new nodule in the region of the left brow.
Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma and deeper biopsies showed extensive involvement of perineural spread along the nerve back into the orbit.
She was also seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of reconstructive potential.
She will be planning to undergo left orbital extenteration and reconstruction with a radial forearm flap  Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, DM 2, Hyperlipidemia, hx of hypothyroidism, hx pancreatitis, reflux PSH: L hip replacement, partial colectomy (after perf from colonoscopy), several facial surgeries for SCC   Physical Exam: At discharge: AVSS NAD HEENT: free flap over extenterated left orbit.
Some occassional serosanguinous drainage from previous penrose site at medial inferior suture line.
Pertinent Results: Video swallow [**4-13**]: no evidence of aspiration  Brief Hospital Course: Patient went to the OR on [**2108-4-6**] and underwent left orbital extenteration and reconstruction using a radial forearm flap and STSG from thigh to forearm.
Post-op she went to the PACU initially, she was then transferred to the ICU secondary to some hypotension and EKG changes post-op.
Immediately post-op she had some hypotension with some T wave changes.
This resolved after repletion of electrolytes and some fluid resuscitation.
Pulm: She remained intubated for several days secondary to a combination of airway edema and volume overload.
She was tolerating minimal vent support, but did not have a cuff leak.
Post-extubation she did well with no other problems.
A video swallow was done which showed that she had no aspiration, but did have some difficulty with solid foods.
She was maintained on aspirin and SQH for DVT prophylaxis and flap patency.
WOUNDS: The wound vac on the right forearm was taken down after 5 days, the STSG looked healthy and was maintained with daily xeroform and kerlex dressing changes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital Rehabilitation  Discharge Diagnosis: aggressive and recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the left brow with perineural involvement   Discharge Condition: stable tolerating a oral diet   Discharge Instructions: DIET: regular diet.
ACTIVITY: She is full weight bearing on both legs, should be encouraged to walk as much as possible with assistance and needs aggressive physical therapy to get back to her baseline.
Continue with daily aspirin to prevent flap thrombosis.
[**Month (only) 116**] lightly tape a dry dressing just under flap to catch drainage if bothersome.
Perineal rash: Recommendations:  Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines  Support surface: On Atmos Air, suggest First Step Select MRS [**Last Name (STitle) **] low air loss and moisture control.
