Progression of multifocal metastasis, including size and number of right lung nodules, lower thoracic spine vertebral metastasis now involving vertebral canal, progression of extensive left pleural and extrapleural tumor and mediastinal invasion.
Brief Hospital Course: 57yo M with non-small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, who presents with worsening back and R leg pain.
Imaging on admission demonstrated metastatic disease of T12 with spinal canal involvement, explaining the patient's pain.
Although the patient had no focal neurologic symptoms, there was concern for possible cord compression.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Metastatic lung cancer: Patient referred by PCP for evaluation by Radiation Oncology and Ortho Spine Surgery to determine the role of radiation therapy and/or spinal fusion to prevent cord compression.
Patient underwent spine MRI  which showed cord compression from tumor at T12.
Also showed metastases within the L4 verterbral body.
# Back pain: Secondary to metastatic vertebral involvement and cord compression.
Pain was well controlled with oxycontin 20 mg [**Hospital1 **], acetaminophen 650 mg q6h, and ibuprofen 600 mg tid, with oxycodone for breakthrough.
Pain continued to be well controlled.
# Nutrition: Patient is cachectic on exam secondary to metastatic disease as well as poor PO intake from nausea.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.
He returned to the operating room for a scheduled T10-L2 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 2-part procedure.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The second surgery was also without complication and the patient was transferred to the SICU in a stable condition.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
He will follow up with Heme/Onc for radiation planning and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] for xrays and a wound check.
You may have some constipation after surgery.
If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so please plan ahead.
