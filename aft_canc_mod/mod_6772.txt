The patient was unable to give the details of her recent symptoms upon admission, presumably due to her dementia, and history was obtained from her son.
Two weeks PTA, she started complaining of abdominal distension.
An abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of acute cholecystitis.
An abdominal CT was performed which showed an enhancing adrenal mass, a hepatic mass (likely a cyst), and a hypodense splenic lesion.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for malignancy and further management of the cholecystitis.
At [**Hospital1 18**] on transfer, she was afebrile with HR 98, BP 146/80, RR 18, Sat 98% on 2L NC.
Past Medical History: -Bipolar disorder h/o suicide attempt in [**4-25**] with [**Last Name (un) 68785**] hospitaliziation -prior CVA in [**2094**] (slurred speech, facial droop, L arm weakness, unsteady gait --> good recovery with some residual L arm weakness) -hypothyroidism -dementia; baseline MS reportedly poor -CAD -HTN -hypercholesterolemia -hypokalemia (documented since [**2094**], with baseline K+ 3.0-3.8) -CRI -Atrial fibrillation  Social History: Lives with her son and daughter who describe her as "an invalid at baseline".

No ST/T wave changes  IMAGING  CT Abdomen/Pelvis (from [**Location (un) 620**], [**2103-2-16**]): The left atrium is enlarged.
Mild bibasilar dependent atelectasis is noted.
Within the right middle lobe, air space consolidation with associated air bronchograms are noted.
Within segment [**1-21**] and 4, there is a 1.4 x 4.1 cm low attenuation slightly ill-defined focus visualized (image 17, series 2) with a peripheral calcification .
Within the spleen, there is a 5.5 mm indeterminate low attenuation focus seen.
Bilateral peripelvic cysts are seen.
Multiple nonpathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.
There is a Foley within the bladder.
Air is noted within the bladder likely secondary to instrumentation.
Please note there is an associated peripheral calcification along the low attenuation focus I described in the liver that measures 4.1 x 1.4 cm.
There is questionable focal thickening of the gallbladder in the region of the fundal neck junction.
No significant gallbladder wall thickening nor pericholecystic fluid is seen.
There are low lung volumes.
There is perihilar fullness, may be exaggerated secondary to underlying mild pulmonary venous congestion.
No focal airspace opacity is seen.
There is minimal left basilar streaky opacities likely secondary to underlying atelectasis.
[**2103-2-22**] CXR: New patchy opacities in the left lower lobe and inferior lingula.
Although a component of volume loss is present suggesting atelectasis, coexistent pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic stenosis is seen.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
[**2103-2-22**] MRI:  *** Limited study The examination is limited due to inability to cooperate with breath-hold imaging and absence of contrast administration.
There is a focal irregularly marginated area of intermediate-to-high signal at the liver hilum measuring 2.3 x 3.8 x 2.9 cm in diameter.
The location raises the possibility of cholangiocarcinoma, but the absence of proximal intrahepatic biliary dilatation makes cholangiocarcinoma less likely.
There are a number of low-signal filling defects, compatible with calculi, in the distal common bile duct.
There is no pancreatic duct dilatation.
* There is a 1.5-cm left adrenal mass.
There is signal drop-off on the out-of-phase sequence.
This is compatible with a left adrenal adenoma.
* There are bilateral basal small pleural effusions.
There is a 1-cm right epicardiac fat pad lymph node.
There is a small nonspecific high signal on T2-weighted sequence lesion measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter.
* There are a number of vertebral body lesions high signal on T1- and T2- weighted sequence, compatible with hemangiomas.
Gallbladder and distal common duct calculi.
Several incompletely characterized liver lesions the largest of which is at segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/II.
Left adrenal adenoma.

The surgical service was consulted and recommended a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube for drainage, and the tube was placed by interventional radiology on [**2103-2-17**] without complication.
On [**2103-2-17**], she developed hypoxia and rigors requiring a transfer to the MICU.
Lung exam revealed wheezes, and she was started on ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers with good response.
Bile cultures returned Streptococcus bovis, Clostridium perfringens and Klebsiella oxytoca susceptible to zosyn.
On [**2103-2-21**], vancomycin was discontinued; she defervesced and had improvement of her leukocytosis on zosyn (WBC from 25.2 on [**2-17**] to 6.6 on discharge).
Presumably, her cholecystitis was secondary to obstruction by stones/sludge as stones were also noted in the CBD (although there was no dilatation of the CBD on imaging).
Upon discharge, the cholecystostomy tube was left in place for ongoing drainage and will be left in place indefinitely until she has the out-patient surgery follow-up appointment.
She was discharged on a full diet, with minimal RUQ abdominal pain and nausea.
HYPOKALEMIA: Ms. [**Known lastname 36509**] has a history of hypokalemia at baseline.
MRI of the abdomen was ordered for further evaluation and showed the adrneal mass was consistent with an adenoma.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient was known to have atrial fibrillation and has had evaluations in the past.
(2) Blood pressure should be followed, as HCTZ were held in the hospital because of relatively low blood pressures.
The need for HCTZ and increasing doses of current meds should be readdressed at her primay care follow-up appointment.
(3) It is noted that she has rate-controlled atrial fibrillation, but is not on anticoagulation.
(4) The adrenal mass has been followed as an out-patient and does not seem malignant given its slow rate of growth.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**12-20**]  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Acute cholecystitis Adrenal mass Hypokalemia Urinary tract infection  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Dementia Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable-- afebrile; breathing comfortably in the mid-90's on room air; oriented to self at baseline; still with occasional abdominal pain, but significnatly improved from admission.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary care doctor if you have worsening abdominal pain or fevers.
