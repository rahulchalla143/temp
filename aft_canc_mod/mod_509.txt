Admission Date:  [**2102-4-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-4-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-2-3**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE/ACOVE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old woman with left breast cancer status post chemotherapy and radiation treatment in [**2099**] who was recently diagnosed with liver metastases, who was admitted on [**2102-4-8**] with complaints of fatigue, decreased oral intake, hypotension, and acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis and contrast-induced nephropathy.
The patient initially was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was aggressively fluid resuscitated with a return of her systolic blood pressure to a baseline of 100-110 and her creatinine improved to 1.6.
The patient became fluid overloaded in the Intensive Care Unit with net 25 liters positive fluid intake.
She demonstrated significant third spacing of her fluids with total body anasarca.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course has been complicated by leukocytosis without fever, and with an elevated total bilirubin.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient empirically was started on ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a question of biliary sepsis.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**2102-4-9**], however, showed no common bile duct dilatation, and no evidence of cholecystitis.
In addition, an MRCP was performed on [**2102-4-11**] which showed no intra or extrahepatic duct dilatation but did show diffuse metastatic disease to the liver and splenomegaly with diffuse anasarca.
The patient also has been complaining of severe back pain.
An MRI of the L spine was obtained which showed no evidence of metastatic disease to the L spine and the pain was thought to be secondary to capsular distention from her extensive hepatic metastatic disease.
The patient was also started on Xeloda for her metastatic breast cancer while in the Intensive Care Unit.
Left breast cancer in [**2099**], status post chemotherapy and radiation treatment in [**2100-10-23**], status post lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for liver cancer in her father at age 86, mother with coronary artery disease in her 80s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  On admission, the patient was a pleasant elderly woman in no acute distress.
She had difficulty speaking secondary to a dry mouth.
No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2 with a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs:  Minimal crackles at the right base, otherwise clear to auscultation.
Extremities:  There was 1+ edema bilaterally in the lower extremities below the knees.
Chest x-ray:  Enlarged heart with atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle and low lung volumes.
No pneumothorax.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary opacities.
However, on [**2102-4-16**], the patient became hypotensive with blood pressures running 70/40 without response to fluid boluses.
The patient's Foley catheter was replaced times two without any success in urine output.
It was thought that her hypotension may have been secondary to increasing dose of narcotics, as well as the patient was likely intravascularly volume depleted.
The patient's volume issues were extremely difficult to handle as the patient clearly demonstrated anasarca with third spacing issues; however, the patient likely was intravascularly volume depleted.
The patient's nutritional status was extremely poor as she was unable to eat much orally and it was decided during her Intensive Care Unit stay that TPN should not be initiated given her fluid spacing issues.
Further discussion occurred with the cross-covering medicine team and the patient's husband and at that time it was again re-emphasized that the role of pressor treatment in the Intensive Care Unit would likely be only a transient measure as the patient does have progressive metastatic breast cancer and was likely not to recover.
On [**2102-4-17**], the patient became progressively unresponsive and more hypotensive with near aneuric urine output.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic breast cancer with extensive liver metastases.
