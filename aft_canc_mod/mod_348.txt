The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.

IMPRESSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy (tachycardia mediated?)
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2148-10-31**] IMPRESSION: No left atrial/appendage thrombus.
Severely depressed left ventricular systolic function (EF 20%).
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT LEFT Study Date of [**2148-11-1**] FINDINGS: Please note, the study is somewhat limited due to patient's inability to Valsalva.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left bundle-branch block.
There is occasional atrial ectopy.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2148-11-2**] IMPRESSION: 1)Multiple subcutaneous nodules with larger necrotic masses in the right axilla and further nodules in the left perinephric region are highly suspicious for metastases, possible melanoma.
2)Loculated large left pleural effusion with atelectasis in the left lung and small right pleural effusion.
3)Moderately large pericardial effusion in the presence of moderate cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Pt was admitted with symptoms of HF for several months and was found to be in afib with RVR.
In general, the above interventions were ineffective at controlling his rate until he was fully loaded on amiodarone and went for partial AV nodal ablation and pacemaker placement, at which point he remained in sinus rhythm for several days.
The etiology of his refractory afib was unclear but likely resulting from chronic hypertension.
There was also concern for tumor mets or catecholamine surge from neuroendocrine tumor that may be contributing to his refractory afib.
He continued to have periodic atrial fibrillation that respond to metoprolol or self-resolves throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
# Cardiomyopathy: Newly found EF of 20% with globally dilated RV.
# Hypotension: Patient became significantly hypotensive during this admission and required substantial pressor support while on nodal agents to control his arrhythmia.
The etiology of his hypotension was thought to be cardiogenic vs. septic shock.
# [**Location (un) 5668**] cell tumor: Mr [**Known lastname 10113**] had multiple concerning nodules on exam and by CT which were biopsied and showed [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma.
CT scan and MRI of the head was performed and multiple intracranial metastasis were found with a possible intraparenchial bleed in the cerebellum.
# Respiratory distress: Pt was intubated early in the admission out of concern for changing mental status and inability to protect his airway.
On [**11-4**], pt had increasing oxygen requirements and was found to have white-out of the left lung by CXR.
600 ccs were drained from L pleural effusion.
He was also bronched out of concern for a mucus plug and secretions were removed from his airways with subsequent improvement of his respiratory status.
# Altered mental status: On admission to the hospital, pt was alert and oriented x3 but his mental status rapidly deteriorated and he required intubation to help protect his airway.
CT head was obtained on [**11-4**] and showed no acute intracranial proccess, no bleed, but did showed extra-axial lesions which were concerning for meningiomas vs. metastiatic cancer.
Additionally, his hypoxia/hypercarbia were likely contributing to his altered mental status, as well as his poor perfusion in the context of cardiogenic shock.
# Fever: most likely represents B sxs related to his new malignancy, however also concerning for infection in the context of sputum cxs growing gram neg rods and gram positive cocci as well as positive influenza testing.
# Influenza: pt tested positive for influenza A, which may explain the URI sxs that the patient complained of the week prior to admission.
# Anemia: No clear source of bleed during the admission however crit was lower than baseline and pt required PRBCs to stabilize his crit.
# Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last lipid panel measured in [**11-24**].
# LE edema: LE doppler performed early in the admission out of concern for DVT unequal edema of the LEs, however studies were negative and the LE edema was attributed to his heart failure and he was treated with diuresis.
No further bleeding after this intervention.
# Arthritis: Stable.
# Gout: Stable.
