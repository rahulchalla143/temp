Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted with hypoglycemia secondary to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 93504**] glycogen storage disease, not amenable to treatment at home with corn starch.
Given that his requirement of dextrose was so elevated, after discussion with Glycogen storage disease specialist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and the liver consult service, it was determined that patient's overall long-term prognosis due to progressive liver dysfunction, would remain poor without transplant.
It was then determined to focus on patient's comfort, and his pain was treated with intravenous morphine and lorazepam.
