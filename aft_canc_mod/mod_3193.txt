Yesterday he developed fevers and left flank pain.
Overnight he had nausea with a small amount of non-bloody emesis.
Of note, he had a nephrostomy tube placed [**2-9**] by interventional radiology because of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
He confirmed that he had been feeling unwell since yesterday, with left flank pain that is much worse with movement, but no pain elsewhere.

Moderate-to-severe left hydroureteronephrosis with extensive perinephric fat stranding and pararenal fascial thickening.
This could represent pyelonephritis in a closed urinary collecting system, or post-surgical changes from the recent procedure and displacement of the catheter.
Stable thickening of the soft tissues adjacent to the prostate, likely representing prostate cancer, with unchanged paraaortic mass causing left reteric malignant obstruction.
Sclerotic appearance of right posterior 10th rib and adjacent pedicle of the T10 vertebra, with increased uptake seen on bone scan in [**2201**], which may represent an old traumatic injury, however, is also concerning for metastatic disease given the patient's history of metastatic prostate cancer.
-KUB ([**2203-2-19**]): There is some overlying artifact and motion on the study.
No nasogastric tube or Foley catheter is visualized.
Calcification in the right hemipelvis is felt to most likely represent a phlebolith.
Degenerative changes are seen in the spine.
No acute bony abnormality.
There is scattered air in nondistended loops of colon.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yo male with dCHF, COPD, OSA on home CPAP and metastatic prostate cancer causing left-sided hydronephrosis who presents with displacement of his nephrostomy tube and pyelonephritis with sepsis.
# Pyelonephritis with sepsis: At admission, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn and his nephrostomy tube was replaced by IR.
A foley was placed which required a guidewire and assistance by [**Month/Day/Year **] given his prostate cancer and large prostate.
His urine culture (from the replaced nephrostomy tube) showed pansensitive Pseudomonas.
Given his sepsis and chronic steroid use at home he was given stress dose steroids which were eventually tapered back to his home dose of hydrocortisone.
At discharge, he still has a 3-way Foley in place and will follow-up with his urologist as an outpatient for a voiding trial.
# Leaking nephrostomy tube: IR was [**Month/Day/Year 653**] prior to discharge regarding leaking of urine from around the nephrostomy tube.
Also may have a component of baseline COPD.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient was found to be congested on CXR and exam, he was also significantly orthopneic.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently on ketoconazole and hydrocortisone at the time of admission.
# Depression: Continued home dose of fluoxetine  # Transitional issues: -Will follow-up with his urologist regarding removal of his Foley catheter -Will follow-up with his oncologist regarding his metastatic prostate cancer and alternative treatment options given that his PSA continued to rise on the current regimen -Amlodipine was held at discharge given SBP of 110-120, BP control should be re-evaluated as an outpatient -He will continue Cipro PO after discharge for a total 14 day course  Medications on Admission: - albuterol 90mcg 2puffs QID - albuterol nebs - amlodipine 5mg daily - finasteride 5mg daily - fluoxetine 20mg daily - fluticasone 100 mcg nasal daily - Advair 500/50mcg 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] - furosemide 80mg daily - gabapentin 300mg QHS - hydrocortisone 20mg QAM, 10mgQPM - ketoconazole 400mg [**Hospital1 **] - loratadine 10mg daily - lorazepam 0.5mg 1-2 tabs QHS - metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] - metoprolol succinate 50mg Q24hr - montelukast 10mg daily - omeprazole 40mg daily - rosuvastatin 20mg daily - tiotropium 18mcg daily - tramadolol 50mg 1-2 tabs QID - Aspirin 81mg daily - ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **] - senna 8.6mg 2 tabs daily   Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 2-4 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for left flank pain and displaced nephrostomy tube.
You were found to have sepsis from an infection in your kidney.
