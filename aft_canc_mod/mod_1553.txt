[**1-18**] catheter tip: WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2104-1-20**]):    No significant growth.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with a history of DCIS s/p XRT and tamoxifen, HTN, HLD, and diverticolosis who was initially admitted for N/V and was found to have peritoneal carcinomatosis due to serous ovarian carcinoma as well as bilateral PEs.
After receiving chemotherapy with PACLItaxel and CARBOplatin, she became acutely short of breath on the floor.
She was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where a bedside ECHO revealed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and a decreased EF of 30% most consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
She was fluid resusitated and never required pressors or inotropes.
She had a TnT leak with a peak level of 0.08.
She was on OMED from [**Date range (1) 35342**] at which point she developed neutrapenic fever and hypoxia and was transfered back the the ICU.
A TTE revealed improved systolic dysfunction with an EF 50-55%.
On [**1-14**], she was transfered back to the floor, her neutrapenia and hypoxia resolved, undergoing treatement for a pseudomonas UTI with GNR bacteremia.
On the floor, patient breathing well on room air, remained in sinus tachycardic rhythm without chest pain or cardiac event.
Advanced diet per speech & swallow.
# Pan-sensitive Pseudomonas in urine/ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS bacteremia: Likely urosepsis and contamination from PICC line which was removed when she went to the unit on [**1-11**].
# confusion: It was likely due to ICU/hospital psychosis, though possibly depression with psychotic features.
Patient had a CT head without contrast without evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift.
Could also be leptomeningeal disease but less likely.
[**Name (NI) **] husband states no hx of depression.
# Diarrhea/mucositis: Likely from epithealial sloughing due to chemotherapy.
Patient is no longer neutrapenic.
Patient with vomiting o/n and this am however KUB shows possible ileus, not SBO.
Diarrhea improved.
# Fevers: Likely from bacteremia versus diarrhea vs post-chemo fevers.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia up to 140s due to PE.
Patient without further chest pain or palpitations on the floor.
# Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy: Etiology includes stress of current diagnosis, PE, and chemotherapy effect.
Multifacotial, related to underlying PE, volume overload, and Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy.
Treating PE with lovenox continuously without end-date.
# Serous ovarian adenocarcinoma: Presented with diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis and omental caking.
- Started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PACLItaxel (330 mg, 175 mg/m2) and CARBOplatin (435 mg, 5 AUC) C1D1 [**2104-1-4**] - Plan to continue with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then proceed with optimal debulking surgery - Improve functional status as much as possible - Received neulasta for several days starting [**Date range (1) 35343**] .
# SBO: Currently partial SBO.
Likely secondary to known peritoneal carcinomatosis.
# Communication: With patient;  [**Name (NI) **] - Son - ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 35344**] (cell) [**Name (NI) **] - husband - ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 35345**] (home) .

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - ovarian cancer  Secondary - sepsis, UTI - mucositis - partial SBO   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of abdominal pain and vomiting and with a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
You also had infection in your blood which was treated with antibiotics.
You had severe damage to the lining of your gastrointestinal tract which gave you diarrhea and vomiting as well as inflammation (mucositis) of your mouth.
At one point you developed severe confusion but this resolved within 1-2 days.
This was probably due to your infection and your stay in the hospital.
