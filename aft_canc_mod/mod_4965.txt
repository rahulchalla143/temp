He went to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] strep throat culture which was negative, and was diagnosed with a tonsillar abscess.
However, he did see his dentist a few weeks ago who noted that he had some gum hypertrophy and bleeding, which he states they were concerned about.
Currently, he continues to have a sore throat and difficulty with talking and swallowing.
He has had several small, loose stools which he attributes to the antibiotics.
Otherwise, he has no complaints.

No thrills or lifts.
CTAB without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No organomegaly noted.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, rashes, or other lesions.
Markedly enlarged tonsils and nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissues, markedly narrowing the airway for a segment of several centimeters.
6-mm focal hypodensity in the left tonsil, concerning for abscess or developing abscess.
No evidence of extension in to the peritonsillar space at this time.
Extensive, pronounced cervical lymphadenopathy throughout levels II through IV, with lymph nodes measuring up to 2 cm.
Mild paranasal sinus disease.
DIAGNOSIS: ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA WITH MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION.
Erythrocytes are markedly decreased and exhibit moderate anisopoikilocytosis with rare dacrocytes and red cell fragments present.
White cells predominantly consist of large immature forms with moderate basophilic cytoplasm occasional vacuoles, [**Doctor Last Name **] chromatin and prominent nucleoli suggestive of immature monocytic precursors.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and exhibits near total replacement by blasts and promonocytes.
The overall cellularity is 90%-100% and is almost entirely comprised of immature forms with modest cytoplasm vesicular nuclei and variably prominent nucleoli.
Storage iron is markedly decreased.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD15, CD117, CD11c, CD64, CD56, CD71, lymphoid associated antigen CD7, are CD10 (cALLa) negative, and are negative for CD5, CD19, CD20, CD3, CD13, CD14, CD41, Glycophorin A.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
Please refer to case S10-27409S for morphologic evaluation.
DIAGNOSIS: MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW CONSISTENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY INDUCED ABLATION.
DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES OF INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE LEUKEMIA ARE NOT PRESENT.
Erythrocytes are decreased and show mild poikilocytosis.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and is markedly hypocellular.
Numerous background histiocytes with ingested debris are present.
Background histiocytes with ingested debris and diffuse amorphous eosinophilic deposits are seen.
There is focal bone remodeling with osteoblastic activity.
[**2147-8-17**]: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS:     Hypercellular bone marrow with maturing erythroid-dominant trilineage hematopoiesis     5% blasts highlighted by CD34, see note.
CD117 highlights a population of early myeloid cells.
Glycophorin highlights all the red cell precursors as sheets and large aggregates, including the atypical blast-like cells.
Erythrocytes are decreased and show mild poikilocytosis with occasional microcytes, dacrocytes, rare spherocytes and nucleated red cells seen.
Scant large foci hypocellular areas are present consistent with recent chemotherapy effect.
Megakaryocytes are markedly increased, include several abnormal forms in loose and tight clusters.
Scattered marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic precursors are seen, however, the morphology is suboptimal to evaluate due to preparation artifacts.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2147-7-27**] established a new diagnosis of AML, monocytic type.
# AML, monocytic type: He initially presented with leukocytosis from OSH and a 2 week history of enlarged tonsils treated with Clindamycin for possible pharyngeal abscess.
His course was complicated by further tonsilar enlargement and difficulty breathing through his mouth with voice change from the night of [**7-27**] to [**7-28**].
He continued to have persistent throat swelling, cervical area lymphadenopathy and neck pain.
CT of the neck that afternoon showed interval enlargement of a left tonsillar phlegmonous collection to 4.3 x 6.2 x 6.4 cm with ongoing severe airway narrowing, and he was returned to the ICU for airway monitoring.
He finished his 7+3 induction, and repeat bone marrow biopsy on day 14 showed a markedly hypocellular bone marrow consistent with chemotherapy induced ablation and no features of involvement by acute leukemia.
By Day 21, his CBC continued to show pancytopenia, with nucleated RBCs on peripheral smear and a slight increase in platelet count from baseline.
Concern for returning leukemia prompted a day 21 ([**2147-8-17**]) bone marrow biopsy which showed hypercellular marrow with maturing erythroid-dominant trilineage hematopoiesis and 5% blasts highlighted by CD34.
No further complications of DIC were encountered during his stay.
# Tonsillar Enlargement: The patient came in after recently completing a course of clindamycin for a possible pharyngeal infection.
With his development of worsening pharyngeal edema on [**2147-7-28**], he was started empirically on Vancomycin and Aztreonam, with later addition of Clindamycin.
CT neck demonstrated a 6 mm mass concerning for abscess.
He remained afebrile and asymptomatic as the antibiotics were stopped, and was feeling well at discharge.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute Myelogenous Lymphoma  Secondary Diagnoses: Neutropenic Fever Pharyngeal Edema   Discharge Condition: All vital signs stable.
Afebrile and asymptomatic.
Initially, you had difficulty swallowing, enlarged tonsils, and a high white blood cell count.
Prior to discharge, these antibiotics were stopped, and you did not develop any new fevers or symptoms of infection.
After discharge, you should continue taking Acyclovir for prophylaxis  Followup Instructions: A followup appointment has been scheduled with your Oncologist, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**], for [**2147-8-28**] at 10:00AM.
