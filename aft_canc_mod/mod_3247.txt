Admission Date:  [**2164-12-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-12-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-6-1**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old female with a history of asthma and abdominal mesothelioma that was diagnosed three months prior to admission.
Since last dose patient notes increased lower extremity swelling bilaterally and three days of progressive fatigue as well as decreased appetite and poor p.o.
Patient initially felt fine after transfusion, but 15 to 30 minutes later when she was on her way home, she became acutely short of breath and collapsed in the parking lot, complained of associated chest tightness and was brought to [**Hospital1 346**] by ambulance.
staff was concerned about transfusion related lung injury and anaphylaxis, thus she was initially treated with Benadryl, Solu-Medrol and epinephrine.
Patient had limited improvement in symptoms with the above treatment.
Chest x-ray was notable for a large left pleural effusion, moderate right pleural effusion, patchy opacity in the right upper lobe with questionable evidence of pulmonary edema.
staff obtained a PE protocol chest CT which revealed a small PE in one of the left upper lobe segmental branches of the pulmonary artery as well as a SVC clot.
patient's ECG was notable for poor R wave progression, LVH by voltage criteria and [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V2 and V3.
She had no history of DOE, PND or orthopnea.
She had no previous history of chest pain or chest tightness.
Patient did complain of odynophagia and a feeling of food and medications lodging in her throat over the past few weeks.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for mesothelioma as above.
Patient has a history of asthma with no history of intubation.
She had dry mucous membranes.
No notable oropharyngeal lesions.
Chest: patient had decreased breath sounds on the left to half of her lung field, decreased breath sounds on the right at base, scattered expiratory wheezing.
Cardiovascular exam was notable for tachycardia, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Abdomen was distended and firm with mild diffuse tenderness, no rebound, no guarding.
Extremities: patient had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in her lower extremities.
Neurologic exam was limited due to patient's respiratory distress, but grossly intact.
She had [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V2 and V3 and poor R wave progression in the lateral leads.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61 year old female with a history of abdominal mesothelioma presenting with acute shortness of breath after receiving two units of packed red blood cells in clinic.
Patient was found to be hypoxic in the setting of newly diagnosed PE, large pleural effusion and ECG with ST changes that were concerning for ischemia.
Patient's initial presenting complaint was shortness of breath.
She was, indeed, acutely dyspneic and required large volumes of oxygen to maintain saturation above 90% on admission.
Patient's shortness of breath was likely multifactorial due to pulmonary embolus, large pleural effusion and pulmonary edema which was most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the setting of acute MI.
Patient had an ultrasound guided tap which revealed an exudative effusion with 825 white blood cells, 49,000 red blood cells.
Gram stain and culture of her pleural fluid were negative.
Given the appearance of atypical mesothelial cells in the patient's pleural fluid analysis, it is concerning that this may be extension of her malignancy into the peritoneal cavity.
Patient continued to improve after thoracentesis with continued diuresis.
Would suggest following this over time as patient may need to undergo further drainage of this fluid for symptomatic relief and possible pleurodesis in the future.
Coronary artery disease.
Her EKG showed anteroseptal changes which evolved from ST elevation to T wave inversion in leads V2 and V3.
Patient was not started on a IIb/IIIa inhibitor due to concern of continued bleeding from her tumor into the peritoneum.
No interventional cardiac measures were undertaken given patient's likely poor prognosis from her tumor.
Patient initially showed signs of acute CHF in the setting of acute MI.
Patient was hypertensive and tachycardiac on admission.
Patient was started on a nitro drip for pain and blood pressure control as well as being started on an esmolol drip to better rate control.
On the esmolol drip patient had several episodes of bradycardia that were symptomatic into the 30s.
Bradycardia was most likely secondary to too much nodal blocking as patient was later started on amiodarone for an episode of nonsustained v-tach.
Once esmolol was discontinued, patient had no further episodes of bradycardia.
Patient had one episode of peri-MI nonsustained v-tach lasting 25 seconds which resolved with a precordial thump.
As noted above, patient had several episodes of bradycardia that were symptomatic while she was on both esmolol drip and amiodarone.
These appeared to be due to increased nodal blocking and patient had no further episodes once the esmolol drip was discontinued.
Unclear whether this was acute or a long standing embolism that was noted on admission CT.
LENIs were performed which showed no evidence of lower extremity DVT.
On admission patient had complained of extreme pain with swallowing as well as the feeling of things lodging in her throat.
She initially had trouble swallowing p.o.
Given her pressing pulmonary and cardiac issues, she was not evaluated by GI.
However, she may benefit from a barium swallow or endoscopic evaluation in the future.
Patient is likely being transferred to [**Hospital3 328**] today to pursue further treatment options for her primary mesothelioma.
Patient had a history of iron deficiency anemia which, according to her oncology team, is thought to be due to bleeding into the peritoneal tumor.
[**Name (NI) **] does have a history of reactive thrombocytosis due to her iron deficiency anemia.
Glucose control.
Patient had elevated sugars during the course of her admission and it is not clear why she had elevated sugars.
Patient became hypernatremic during the course of her stay with sodium as high as 150.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute for further care and for possible new chemotherapeutic agents on [**2164-12-26**].
Coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary embolus.
Abdominal mesothelioma.
