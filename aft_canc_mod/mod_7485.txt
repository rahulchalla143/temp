He describes the headaches as a throbbing pain over his whole head.
He also reports some nausea and decreased appetite when the pain is severe; has not vomited.
His wife also notes some cognitive changes over the last 6-9 months including increased forgetfulness, "vagueness," just not quite acting like himself.
He saw his PCP today due to the increased frequency of his headaches and was sent to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for a CT scan.
The scan showed a large R frontal mass and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Family History: Mother with [**Name (NI) 11964**] / renal cell carcinoma Father with stroke in 60's Sister with brain tumor - unknown what type, family says it is "deep" and inoperable so she is being monitored, asymptomatic and has been stable.
Diagnosed to have right frontal lesion on MRI.
Pre-surgical mapping.
FINDINGS: Again is noted an enhancing mass in the right basifrontal region measuring 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm in craniocaudad, AP and transverse dimensions.
It causes mass effect on the surrounding brain parenchyma and the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.
A prominent vessel is noted arising from right supraclinoid internal carotid artery and reaching upto the lesion suggestive of hypervascularity of the lesion.
There is no evidence of new enhancing lesion.
Brainstem and cerebellum appear normal.
IMPRESSION:  Enhancing right basifrontal mass with surrounding perilesional edema and mass effect which is unchanged since the prior study.
FINDINGS: The patient is status post frontal craniotomy with resection of a right frontal lobe lesion.
There is a small quantity of hemorrhage within the resection bed.
Mild pneumocephalus is seen overlying both frontal lobes.
There is vasogenic edema within the right frontal lobe with associated 9 mm leftward shift of the normally midline structures (2:14), not significantly changed compared to the prior MR.
There is no large volume intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Aerosolized secretions and fluid is seen within the frontal sinuses and middle and anterior ethmoidal air cells.
Expected postoperative changes in the right frontal lobe, status post resection of a right frontal lobe mass.
Persistent vasogenic edema within the right frontal lobe along with unchanged leftward shift of normally midline structures.
No large volume intracranial hemorrhage.
Minimal new pneumocephalus overlying both frontal lobes.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of right inferior frontal lobe mass.
No definite residual enhancement identified.
There is dural enhancement in the region which could be postoperative in nature.
The edema in the right frontal lobe is unchanged.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
There is no new area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right inferior frontal lobe mass with blood products in the region.
No definite residual parenchymal enhancement is seen.
No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
The edema is unchanged  LENIS [**2184-10-11**] - 1.
Superficial thrombosis of the lesser saphenous vein of the right calf, with additional deep venous thrombosis of what is likely the gastrocnemius vein on the right.
No evidence of DVT in left lower extremity.
The pt awoke from anesthesia without complication and was extubated immediately.
He was started on a 7 day course of Ancef for sinus coverage.
There were no events.
You presented for removal of a right frontal brain tumor which was discovered at your last hospital admission.
The operation was successful and was a combined procedure with both plastic surgery and neurosurgery involved and the biopsy result from this is awaited.
You were also found to have a deep vein thrombosis in your right calf revealed on ultrasound tests of your legs.
We discussed treatment options with oncology and given taht interventional radiology felt that placing a filter was unsafe due to vein involvement of your renal cancer.
You were also started on anti-seizure medication given the risk of seizures following your brain tumor removal.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo, or just wanter run over your incision.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-18**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
