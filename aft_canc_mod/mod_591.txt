# Unwitnessed Fall, Right Hip and Wrist Fractures - The patient presented with right hip and wrist fractures after an unwitnessed fall.
CT-c-spine was without fracture.
CT head was without acute process.
Hip xray showed a right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur extending to the lesser trochanter with varus angulation.
She underwent open reduction and internal fixation of right hip fracture and closed reduction or right distal radius fracture.
She tolerated the procedure well but had agitation post-operatively which was treated with IV haldol.
On POD#1 she was noted to have acute hypoxia, tachypnea and tachycardia.
While in the MICU, she had an echo which showed mild atrial stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and an EF of 75%.
# Hypoxia, respiratory distress - At approximately 2 PM on POD#1 she was noted to have acute hypoxia, tachypnea and tachycardia.
Repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no other changes compared to priors.
CTA did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Also, bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds showed no evidence of DVT.
She was also found to have a pneumonia (in addition to a previously known UTI, which was being treated with ciprofloxacin).
The patient also had some episodes of delirium / agitation upon transfer to the MICU and while she was in the MICU.
A right internal jugular CVL was also place while the patient was in the MICU.
# Anemia - On admission, the patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies notable for low iron and ferritin.
After she was called out to the floor, the patient's family requested that she receive no more blood transfusions.
# Leukocytosis / Thrombocytosis - On [**2194-11-8**], as the patient was approaching discharge, she was noted to have rising white blood cell and platelet counts.
Her mental status was noted to be improving, and she remained afebrile despite her rising white count.
A urinalysis showed bacteriuria; however, two urine cultures grew out yeast alone.
Her Foley [**Last Name (un) **] was discontinued but restarted secondary to urinary retention.
A chest x-ray did not show signs of infection.
LFT's showed elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase, which could be consistent with her underlying malignancy.
This was discussed with the heme/onc fellow, and it was felt that that the patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytosis were consistent with an inflammatory state secondary to her recent PNA and UTI as well as her mailgnancy.
It was discussed with the patient's family that the next step in the workup of her leukocytosis would include bone marrow biopsy.
# Pancreatic/[**Name (NI) **] Cancer - Pt had recently been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the [**Name (NI) 499**] on biopsy.
She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.
As explained above, the patient had leukocytosis and thrombocytosis towards the end of her hospitalization with a negative infectious work-up.
Furthermore, if any abnormalities were found on bone marrow biopsy, treatment of the patient's [**Holiday 499**] and pancreatic cancer would need to be addressed first.
# Hypertension - The patient did have some episodes of hypertension.
# Polymyalgia Rheumatica - The patient's home regimen of prednisone was not entirely clear.
