Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/CC:[**CC Contact Info 18324**] # CMV involving the small bowel - ID following, confirmed by biopsy, likely reactivation from chemotherapy/steroids.
Needs 3 weeks of therapy and monitoring for hematologic complications and to ensure renal function stability (as it is renally cleared).
any evidence of cmv retinitis.
# B-cell lymphoma - Involving the bone and lymph nodes.
Chemotherapy is stalled for now due to reactivation vs. acute infection due to immunosuppressed state.
# line infection - Tip positive for two colony types of staph epi.
Discussed with ID attending at time of discharge, no need for further vancomycin.
# Steroids - Was on it for chemotherapy and seems to have received it for 2 days for concern of adrenal insufficiency.
# DM2 controlled without complications - stable, on glipizide.
# irregular HR on exam - No h/o AF, has h/o PVCs.
Likely due to hypoalbuminemia from small bowel inflammation with malabsorption, celiac disease, and poor intake (this is supported by slightly elevated INR).
Less likely to have chronic liver disease.
No evidence of CHF.
# CAD/CABG - On lipitor, has not been on ASA or BB according to outpt med list.
# celiac sprue - On gluten free diet, stable.
# Dispo - Would continue ongoing discussions with ID and case management about eventual dispo.
