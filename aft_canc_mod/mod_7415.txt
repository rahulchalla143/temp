Found to have moderate-sized pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and ?
She had a recent hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 102876**] for pulmonary embolism and malignant pleural effusion.
She had experienced some mild substernal chest pressure during that admission that was felt to be GERD.
She had no further episodes of chest pressure until yesterday.
She has also had increased LE edema, although she states it has been progressive for a long time.
In the ED, she was afebrile with HR 110s, BP 95/53.
Her EKG was read as having possible ST elevations inferiorly.
TTE showed moderate-sized pericardial effusion without tamponade.
NSCLC: dx [**8-23**], L-sided, s/p 2 cycles cisplatin and etoposide with XRT, s/p 3 cycles taxetere [**11-23**], malignant pleural effusion s/p VATS and PleurX catheter on [**4-5**], on 4L home O2 2.

EKG: sinus tach at 139bpm, normal axis and intervals, <1mm STE in II/III, <1mm ST depression in V1 .
New moderate-amount pericardial effusion, measuring up to 20HU.
Decreased left locurated pleural fluid.
Coronary artery calcification.
Persistent collapse of the left upper lobe with narowwed airway .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
A huge pleural effusion is present.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
# Dyspnea:  Her chronic dyspnea is felt primarily secondary non-small cell lung cancer with left malignant pleural effusion.
She had a minimal amount of pleural fluid drained by IP via PleurX catheter already in place two times during the admission.
She underwent pericardiocentesis for possible symtpomatic improvent, and she experienced minor improvement in her shortness of breath afterwards.
She had some reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion after the procedure, but it was stable on repeat TTE, so it was felt to be an unlikely contributor to her symptoms.
# Pericardial effusion:  On admission, she had mild tamponade on exam.
She likely had a constrictive component as well with a Kussmaul's sign, and evidence of pericarditis on EKG.
She underwent pericardiocentesis on [**4-22**], with drainage of ~450cc of bloody fluid.
TTE after the procedure shows reaccumulation of an organizing effusion, with no tamponade.
Her Coumadin was held for several days because her INR remained therapeutic, likely secondary to poor nutritional status and antibiotics.
She was treated empirically for post-obstructive pneumonia with a 7-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl.
She was afebrile throughout her stay.
# Anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is between 28-31.
She received 1U PRBC in an attempt to improve her symptoms, but experienced no change.
# FEN:  She appeared total volume overloaded but intravascularly dry, likely due to her low oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia.
She also had hypernatremia thought secondary to intravascular depletion that improved with free water repletion.
However, her respiratory status worsened while still at the hospital.
