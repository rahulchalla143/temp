It consists of a normally shaped femoral head without a portion of femoral neck that measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm.
The cut surfaces reveal yellow-tan hemorrhagic cut surfaces.
A fragment of femoral neck is also received in the container and measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.
It is cut perpendicular to the articular surface to reveal hemorrhagic bone marrow.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for decalcification as follows:  A= representative sections of femoral head, B = representative sections of femoral neck.
[**7-23**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia.
Intraventricular conduction defect.
Left axis deviation, possibly due to left anterior fascicular block.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
a complete fracture of the left femoral neck is present with mild varus angulation.
No dislocation is identified.
No radiopaque foreign bodies.
Left femoral neck fracture with mild varus angulation.
Left femoral shaft lucencies suggestive of osteopenia in the setting of decreased weght bearing from prior stroke.
The lungs are clear of focal consolidation or effusion.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
FINDINGS:  Three views of the left knee demonstrate no evidence of acute fracture, dislocation, joint effusion, or soft tissue foreign body.
Prevertebral soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
Multilevel degenerative changes are present with small anterior osteophytes particularly at the C3 through C6 levels, as well as very minimal disc space narrowing.
Flexion and extension views demonstrate no evidence of instability.
Incidental note is made of an oval-shaped calcification posterior to the spinous processes of C4 and C5, which may represent ossification or calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described.
No acute fracture or dislocation identified, but CT of the cervical spine is much more sensitive than conventional radiographs for detecting traumatic abnormalities and would be suggested if there is persistent clinical suspicion for a cervical spine injury.
Exam is limited by absence of an odontoid view and lack of visualization of C7-T1 disc space and top of T-1.
Since there is also increased upper lobe vascular congestion, and new small left pleural effusion, appearance could be explained by either bibasilar pneumonia or a combination of atelectasis and edema.
Subsequent chest CT reported separately has findings of left lower lobe atelectasis, right lower lobe pneumonia and multifocal small regions of peribronchial opacification, probably bronchopneumonia.
It shows vascular congestion but no pulmonary edema, and a stomach severely distended with air and fluid.
CT Chest: FINDINGS:  The thyroid gland, aorta and major branches, heart and pericardium are unremarkable with the exception of changes of mitral valve annuloplasty.
No pericardial effusion is seen.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal adenopathy.
Gynecomastia is noted bilaterally.
Though this study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, imaged upper abdomen reveals distended stomach.
The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified without filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism, though evaluation of the subsegmental vessels is limited due to respiratory motion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are dependent and nonhemorrhagic.
Right greater than left basal opacities with milder opacification of the dependent segment of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe are concerning for multifocal pneumonia which likely includes the anterior subpleural opacities.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion to suggest osseous malignancy.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Multifocla pneumonia with opacities in the lower lobes and left upper lobe.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring with normal gradient and mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
AP CXR [**7-26**] FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing multifocal pneumonia.
No larger pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Mild over distention of the stomach, unchanged normal alignment of the sternal wires.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-7-23**] the heart rate has increased, ST-T wave abnormalities have improved.

There is no pneumothorax.
Multifocal pneumonia, slightly worse in the left upper lobe.
BAL [**7-31**] 	Bronchioalveolar lavage:  	  	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No viral cytopathic changes or fungi seen.
There is diffuse alveolar opacity and air bronchograms throughout the right lung, with relative sparing of the right lung apex and minimal residual lucency at the right base.
Possibility of an associated effusion cannot be excluded.
There is also prominent  focal interstitial and alveolar opacity in the left upper zone, which appears more confluent than on the earlier film.
There is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, unchanged.
The small left effusion is slightly more prominent on this exam.
There is relative lucency at the left lung apex.
Differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonic infiltrates, ARDS and CHF.
CHEST:  Imaged portions of the thyroid gland appear within normal limits.
There is a left upper extremity PICC line with its tip terminating in the SVC.
There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There are no filling defects within the central pulmonary arterial tree.
There are large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis, right greater than left.
Patchy pulmonary opacities are noted in the remainder of the inflated upper lobes with hint of appearance of crazy pavement (series 2, image 13) in the left upper lobe and also within the right upper lobe (series 2, image 17) suggestive of pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is minimal quantity of perihepatic fluid as well as a small quantity of fluid tracking into the right paracolic gutter.

There is subcutaneous soft tissue edema, most predominantly noted in the gluteal region as well as in the upper thighs.
There are flame-shaped opacities involving the retroareolar regions suggestive of gynecomastia.
There are no suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions seen to suggest tumor.
IMPRESSION:  Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Crazy pavement changes in the lungs suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Additional multifocal regions of atelectasis and consolidation, underlying pneumonia is not excluded.
No intra-abdominal abscess.
Distended gallbladder with small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
Minimal quantity of perihepatic and pelvic fluid, which could be related to third spacing.
Additional diffuse regions of subcutaneous soft tissue edema in the pelvic girdle.
Moderate cardiomegaly with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and unchanged minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o M with a history of mitral valve prolapse, atrial fibrillation s/p MAZE and mitral valvuloplasty in [**10/2171**] that was complicated by a right MCA CVA and a RLE DVT presented status post fall and fracture of his left hip on [**2173-7-23**].
His hip was repaired with a L hemiarthroplasty on [**2173-7-23**], and in the post-operative setting, he had persistent high oxygen requirements.
He progressed to respiratory failure secondary to multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, requiring re-intubation and transfer to the MICU.
Active Problems: # Respiratory Failure: Multifocal PNA (aspiration?)
Pt was evaluated for a PE; CTA showed no evidence of PE, but did show a multifocal PNA.
The patient also developed hypotension and was volume-recusitated aggressively.
His tachypnea increased, and he became hypoxic on BiPAP and required intubation on [**2173-7-31**].
Further imaging with chest CT showed large bilateral pulmonary effusions, multifocal PNA, and pulmonary edema.
He received a 10-day course of antibiotics for VAP coverage.
As his pneumonia improved, concern lingered for pulmonary edema.
His surgical wound healed well, and staples were removed on [**2173-8-6**], there was no concern for infection.
# Pain Control: Patient had post-operative pain in his left thigh and hip.
Before and during intubation and after extubation, the patient had pleuritic chest pain as well.
At different points during his hospitalization, his pain was controlled with morphine, fentanyl, ibuprofen, IV Tylenol, and/or lidocaine patch.
# Fever/Thrombocytosis: Likely reactive to pneumonia versus drug reaction.
The patient continued to spike fevers during his MICU stay.
Initially the fever was c/w PNA and sepsis.
He also developed a thrombocytosis to the 900s.
The fever and thrombocytosis are thought to be due to systemic inflammation in the setting of resolving PNA.
He has been afebrile for several days.
# Persistent sinus tachycardia in the MICU: This tachycardia was likely due to hypovolemia versus sepsis versus hypoxia.
However his dose was held on discharge due to his SBP in the ~90s.
# Hypotension: In the setting of SIRS and multifocal PNA.
# Nausea/GERD: Likely mutifactorial, with components of GERD, clinical illness, and not taking POs for several days.
# Rash: Over back, consistent with heat-induced follicullitis.
# Altered mental status: On arrival to MICU, question hypoxia precipitating versus history of previous stroke.
Per family, patient was initially off baseline, but improved with oxygen saturations, although patient still having episodes of confusion prior to intubation.
He was treated with quetiapine, and his mental status improved while he weaned off sedation when he was intubated and then improved further after extubation.
# Dropping HCT: HCT dropped from 28 on [**7-30**] to 22 on [**8-2**] without a source of bleeding.
Chronic Problems: # History of DVT: Pt has a hx of DVT and was treated previously with Coumadin.
Due to his history of being HIT antibody +, he was not treated with unfractionated heparin.
# BPH: On Flomax at home.
# History of stroke and seizures: The patient remained clinically stable on his home Lacosamide 50 mg PO/NG DAILY, Pravastatin 20 mg PO HS, and Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY.
# History of seasonal allergies: Inactive during this hospitalization.
Transitional issues: # The patient responds well to diuresis with IV furosemide 20mg if there are signs of fluid overload.
# Patulous esophagus seen on CTA Chest [**7-25**]: outpatient esophagram can be obtained if indicated # The patient will need rehab for his left hip surgery.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H pain or fever patient may refuse 2.
Metoprolol Succinate XL 75 mg PO DAILY Hold if SBP<100, HR<60   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Nursing & Therapy Center - [**Location 1268**] ([**Location (un) 86**] Center for Rehabilitation and Sub-Acute Care)  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left Hip Fracture, Respiratory Failure, Pneumonia, Pulmonary Edema Secondary: Depression, Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Your recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs), and respiratory failure, which required that we insert a breathing tube and provide mechanical ventilations in the medical ICU.
We also treated you with oxygen, antibiotics for the pneumonia and diuretic medications, which remove fluid from your body.
You should CHANGE Metoprolol to Metoprolol 75mg XL once a day for high blood pressure.
You should START the skin ointments and powders for your rashes, as needed, for 1-2 weeks until they resolve.
You may START acetaminophen and morphine for pain control, as needed.
