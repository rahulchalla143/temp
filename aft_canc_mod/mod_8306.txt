Last week, pt started feeling short of breath and it has become more severe over past few days including shortness of breath with showering and walking short disatnces.
Pt went to LGH where CTA revealed PE obstructing R main PA and LLL PA.
Pt subsequently admitted to ICU for tachycardia and RV strain.
Pt endorses 1/10 chest pain which he states is more like substernal pressure, it has improved throughout the day.
He denies pleurisy or inability to take deep breaths.
He denies palpitations or lightheadedness.
He states that his main symptoms have been dyspnea with small tasks and lots of fatigue.
Patient denies any hemoptysis, fevers, chills.
Does have chronic headache which he states is unchanged from his normal which he takes dilaudid for and states that he does have intermittent periods of weakness.
Patient has a history of seizures and takes lamictal.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
The right ventricle appears mildly dilated with hypokinesis of the basal to mid RV free wall.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Lower extremity dopplers [**8-2**]: no DVT  EKG [**2123-8-6**]- sinus 101 bpm, slightly concave ST segments in II and V6 < 1mm, low precordial voltages, otherwise no ST-T abnormalities.
# Bilateral pulmonary emboli: Likely [**3-18**] to travel in setting of malignancy and prior hypercoagulable state.
No evidence of lower extremity thrombus on ultrasound study here.
Echo did show RV dysfunction, however patient was never hemodynamically unstable (aka no hypotension).
I explained the risks of developing DVT with air travel, and importance of recommendations to reduce risk including hydration, regular leg stretches, and standing/walking every hour.
# tachycardia- persistent sinus tachy 100-110s through the admission, which did not improve despite hydration.
Unknown if he has a baseline elevated HR from his malignancy.
More likely is due to the PE with mild RV dysfunction.
Given he did not have persistent hypoxemia or hypotension, it was felt there is no indication for repeat CT angiography or further therapy of his PE aside from standard anticoagulation.
# Brain Ca, Gliosarcoma: Pt has recently undergone gamma knife and states that he is waiting to hear back from his radiation oncologist as to what further treatments will be done.
He has Stage IV disease and there is disease in the brain stem which is inoperable.
He had a CT head at OSH with no evidence of bleed.
# Mood- social work consulted in hospital, and there was concern for patient having low motivation and possibly situational depression in context of his illness.
# Gait- noted to rely heavily on use of walker, and have slight difficulty with independent transfers.
If you develop lightheadedness or palpitations, you should return to the hospital.
