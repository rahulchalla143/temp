A NG lavage was negative for active bleeding.
Type II diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal failure, baseline creatinine 2.2 to 3.3.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post pacer.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post bypass.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, single, no tobacco, or alcohol.
Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
GI bleeding:  Her GI bleeding was felt to likely be    related to her INR of 4 on Coumadin and was suspected that    it was related to her previously known colonic polyps as a    source of this bleeding.
She had a colonoscopy    on [**2185-6-28**] showing rectal polyps, ascending colonic    polyp, mid transverse polyp, which were all removed and    she had a biopsy of the distal transverse colon.
She also    had an EGD showing mild gastritis.
It was presumed that    her bleeding was related to the colonic polyps and her    Coumadin was held at the time of discharge.
Renal:  Her BUN and creatinine are slightly elevated at    the time of admission, which improved to her baseline    prior to admission.
Cardiac:  She did not have any episodes of congestive    heart failure during this admission.
Secondary diagnoses:  Diastolic CHF, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post pacer, hyperlipidemia, anemia, peripheral vascular disease, and colonic polyps.
She was told that if she develops any bloody stools, black tarry stools, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms that she should notify her PCP immediately and seek immediate medical attention.
