Admission Date:  [**2169-7-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-7-29**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Fosamax / Dilantin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: L temporal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L temporal open biopsy   History of Present Illness: 85 yo F seen on [**7-6**] at OSH for dizziness, feeling "spacy"; she was readmitted today w/ confusion.
Head CT shows large L temporal mass, contrast enhancing.
Past Medical History: - rheumatic heart disease - mitral regurg , echo in 03: EF 75%, moderate TR - PVD, on chronic anticoagulation for graft - s/p ax-bifem bypass [**2166**]  Physical Exam: Intubated, ventilated on AC 100% 500x14 peep 5 Not sedated but received vercuronium at time of intubation, then propofol and versed; Pupils small, isocore, symteric, reactive 2->1.5; corneal: head movement in response, bilat.
; Somnolent, not arousable; does not open eyes to pain; does not follow commands; semi-purposeful movements of L and R UE to pain; withdraws R and L LE to pain; DTRs [**Name (NI) **] 1+ bilaterally, Ach trace bilaterally, [**Last Name (un) **]: no movement bilat.
;   Pertinent Results: MRA Brain [**2169-7-20**]: There is a large lobulated and ill-defined enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe, which extends along the fiber tracts and cross the sylvian fissure extending into the left frontal lobe.
There is a component of T2 hyperintense signal swelling the surrounding white matter.
There is flattening of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left ventricle, however, no significant midline shift is noted.
There are prominent T2 hyperintense foci in the cerebral white matter, probably due to underlying chronic small vessel ischemia.
Head CT [**2169-7-25**]: The patient is status post interval left temporal craniotomy, with expected postoperative hemorrhage and pneumocephalus at the biopsy cavity, as well as anterior to the left frontal lobe.
There is linear high density in the left temporal lobe likely representing hemorrhage along the biopsy tract, as well as high density tracking along the sulci in this region consistent with some subarachnoid blood.
Effacement of the left perimesencephalic and widening of the left ambient cisterns, with mass effect upon the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle, are also unchanged, and relate to the extensive vasogenic edema in the left temporal and frontal lobes.
There is also bihemispheric periventricular white matter hypodensity corresponding to the chronic micro-ischemic change demonstrated previously .
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
The soft tissue structures demonstrate subcutaneous emphysema in the region of the biopsy as well as skin staples along the left scalp.
The patient is status post craniotomy for open biopsy of a large heterogeneously enhancing tumor in the left temporal lobe that is unchanged in size today measuring 3.8 x 3.8 cm.
Susceptibility imaging demonstrates minimal-to-moderate amount of postsurgical hemorrhage at the operative site.
Significant vasogenic edema is unchanged, mass effect and shift of the normally midline structures is unchanged.
She was intubated and started on decadron and valproate for seizure prophylaxis.
On HD7 patient was taken to the operating room for an open temporal biopsy which intial pathology revealed high grade glioma.
At the time of discharge, she was mildly confused but awake and alert.
She does not have any gross neurological deficits.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 11496**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: L temporal mass   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please come to the emergency room if you have fever >101.4F, shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, bleeding/swelling or persistent redness from your surgical incision.
