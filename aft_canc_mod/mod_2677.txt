Admission Date:  [**2101-10-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2026-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**] Chief Complaint: pre-chemo evaluation CAD  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left heart cath  History of Present Illness: This 75 year old woman was recently diagnosed with right breast  cancer (stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma) likely metastatic given positive CT finding.
She was found to have a positive stress test with Pt is a poor historian, and her daughter reports that her mother is short of breath all the time.
The patient also does admit to prior episodes of chest pressure.
Pt denies claudication,lightheadedness, but has + Bilateral leg edema, left > right.
Past Medical History: Newly diagnosed stage II right sided breast cancer-invasive ductal carcinoma Arthritis of lower back/Low back pain Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Depression Paranoid schizophrenia diagnosed approximately 20 years ago, not  under psychiatric care CHF Total Hysterectomy in her early 30's for heavy bleeding and pain  Bilateral knee replacements Gout   Social History: Patient is widowed and has six children.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclera anicteric, OP clear Neck: supple, no JVD (though difficult to estimate given her neck size) CV: reg rate, s1 s2, no m/r/g, nondisplaced PMI Lung: Not able to exam given pt just had cath need to lie on her back, CTA from front.
Breast: rt breast had well healed bx scar with a palpable 3x3cm non mobile mass at 6 oclock.
No palpable axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.
Abd: soft, obese, NT/ND +bs, no organmegaly.
Ext: LE slightly erythematous, +pitting edema bilat, +DP pulses.
Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Coronary angiography of this codominant circulation revealed severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 60% hazy lesion at its ostium.
The LCX had serial 90% lesions at the ostium and in the proximal vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed only mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures with an LVEDP of 12 mmHg, a mean PCW pressure of 15 mmHg, and a mean RA pressure of 9 mmHg.
No gradient across the aortic valve was detected.
Left ventriculography demonstrated preserved left ventricular  systolic wall motion with a calculated LVEF of 64%.
No significant mitral regurgitation was seen.
CAth: [**2101-10-28**] Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of LCx with mild jailing of OM1 but normal flow.
CAse complicated by failed Perclse device resulting in moderate size hematoma and hypotension (SBP 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia responive to IVF, atropine and brief infusion of dopamine.
The patient left the lab with the arteriotomy site under control, with no evidence of active bleeding, asymptomatic except for nausea and stable vital signs.
Left Foot XR - no evidence of inflammation, lytic lesion, joint effusion, or fracture.
Femoral U/S - no pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula  LABORTORY: Hct 36.3-->29.7 stable >24hrs Cr 0.8, 2.1, 2.2, 1.6 (b/l 1.2) TnT <0.01 FENa 1.7%, FeUrea 50% UA no casts   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year-old woman recently dx with breast cancer undergoing cardiac eval prior to have chemo Rx found to have abnormal ETT.
She underwent a left heart cath that found 2 vessel disease with 60% LAD and 90% LCx.
She underwent [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5303**] PCI of LCx however it was complicated by a failed Perclose device and she developed a significant groin hematoma with hypotension requiring dopamine and IVF and monitoring in the CCU.
Groin u/s showed no pseudoaneurysm or AVF.
She remained pain free with nml cardiac biomarkers.
Her hospital course was also complicated by the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with rates in the 150's and worsening of her pulmonary edema.
SHe had no prior history of atrial fibrillation and so was loaded on amiodarone without TTE or anticoagulation.
She does have relatively severe diastolic heart failure and received IV hydration for cath and BP management.
She was effectively controlled with diuresis and chemical cardioversion of her single episode of atrial fibrillation.
4 days post cath, she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.2.
FENa and FEUrea supported an intrinsic vs. obstructive pattern.
The etiology is likely secondary to contrast nephrotoxicity.
Antibiotics were initiated for her cough with a faint infiltrate in the LLL.
She remained afebrile without a leukocytosis.
Becasue she will be starting chemotherapy for her metastatic breast CA, we started levoquin 250mg qod (renal dosing) for a total of 10 days of treatment (last day [**2101-11-8**]).
