Large left upper lobe consolidation which appears to extend into the mediastinum and concurrent post-obstructive left upper lobe and lingular collapse.
Above findings, in conjunction with massive left supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, raise the concern for underlying mass.
Complete obstruction of left upper lobe and lingular bronchi could be due to a combination of compression and endobronchial tumor.
Bilateral smaller pulmonary nodules.
Overall appearance is suspicious for neoplasm, primary lung cancer versus metastasis, also consider lymphoma.
Post-obstructive pneumonia can not be excluded.
[**2177-9-23**] Mediastinal mass, biopsy/cytology: Most consistent with poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
Large mass involving the left upper lobe causing lingular and segmental collapse.
Left lower lobe and right upper, middle and lower lobe FDG avid pulmonary nodules seen.
Multiple small celiac and left gastric nodes with FDG uptake seen.
Solitary focus of increased uptake in the inferior pole of the spleen.
Relatively large 2.3-cm hemorrhagic metastatic lesion centered in the mid-right cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema, but little mass effect on the fourth ventricle and no obstructive hydrocephalus.
At least one 6.5-mm metastatic lesion at the right paramedian parietal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction with two minute lesions in the region of the right pre- and post-central gyrus, with no appreciable surrounding edema.
Numerous, predominantly punctate foci of restricted diffusion in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, in a pattern suggestive of a "shower" of acute emboli; these could represent either bland emboli from a cardiac or other central source, e.g., in a patient with an arrhythmia, or alternatively NBTE (so-called "marantic" endocarditis) in a patient with advanced malignancy and low-grade DIC.
[**2177-10-13**] CT Head: Comparison is made to head MRI with and without contrast dated [**2177-10-2**], performed to evaluated for lung cancer metastases.
The right cerebellar lesion corresponds to a known hemorrhagic metastasis, grossly unchanged allowing for differences in technique.
Smaller right frontal and parietal lesions seen on the MRI are not appreciated on the CT.  [**2177-10-13**] CXR: Left upper lung is completely airless and expanded displacing the mediastinum, particularly the trachea to the right.
Severe narrowing of the left main bronchus as well as a large subcarinal mass projecting to the right of the midline is due to adenopathy, causing obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus.
Left lower lobe is aerated but small.
Multiple nodules present throughout both lungs are manifestation of metastases, presumably due to a large central bronchogenic carcinoma.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
Interval increase in size of large LUL mass and obstructive consolidation/collapse due to increasing bronchial obstruction.
Increased size and number of hemorrhagic pulmonary metastasis and supraclavicular, and mediastinal, and possibly celiac and gastric adenopathy.
New small left pleural effusion.
[**2177-10-17**] CT T-SPINE: No evidence for thoracic spinal metastasis.
Massive left neck lymphadenopathy with laryngeal deviation to the right.
The tumor is extensive and causing complete obstruction of LUL and encasing pulmonary arteries.
He is also having severe thoracic spine area pain and CT T-spine negative for mets (MRI not done [**12-17**] claustrophobia).
Tachycardia is from tumor encasing pulmonary arteries.
Patient suffered respiratory distress in PACU and was intubated.
In discussion with family, decision was made for comfort care in setting of poor prognosis.
Patient expired on [**2177-10-22**] with primary cause of non-small cell lung cancer over a month leading to respiratory failure within days.
PROBLEM LIST:  # NSCLC with brain mets and very large LUL tumor causing obstruction of LUL and endangering LLL and causing trachea shift to the right.
- Bronchial stenting by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on Monday [**10-20**] - Keppra and dexamethasone for seizure prophylaxis  # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: In setting of significant tumor burden with airway compression, recent Y stent may have caused irritation and patient has little to no reserve.
He was covered with vancomycin/cefepime empirically in the setting of leukocytosis for any possible HCAP contributing to his distress.
# NSCLC: With brain mets and significant L lung tumor burden.
Patient was continued on levetiracetam and dexamethasone for seizure prophylaxis.
