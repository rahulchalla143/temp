There were concerns for abnormalities of fetal heart rate, prompting a Cesarean section for delivery.
There was no notation of fever and the amniotic fluid was noted to be meconium stained.
There was a foul smell noted.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory:  The infant had respiratory distress syndrome and required 2 doses of Surfactant therapy.
This was done to help with episodes of apnea and bradycardia.
He was started on caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity prior to extubation on [**2130-1-11**] and weaned off caffeine on [**2130-3-3**].
He was free of any significant apnea/bradycardia of prematurity for greater than 5 days prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular:  He had an audible murmur on [**2130-1-13**] and had an echocardiogram done at that time which showed a large PDA with left to right flow.
He was treated with Indocin and had a follow-up echocardiogram on [**2130-1-16**] which showed a very tiny PDA and a tiny, muscular VSD.
The ongoing presence of a soft intermittant murmur was thought to be secondary to PPS.
Gastrointestinal:  The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin level of 5.1 over 0.3 on day of life 3.
Mother's placental pathology culture showed acute chorioamnionitis and funisitis.
The infant also was given triple antibiotic ointment for breakdown in the nares while on CPAP which has since resolved.
On [**2040-2-22**] he was treated with Keflex for thick nasal secretions, thought to be secondary to long term nasal CPAP.
No erythema to surrounding area.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
Sepsis treated.
