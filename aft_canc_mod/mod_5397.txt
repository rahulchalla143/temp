Admission Date:  [**2161-3-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-3-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-11-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 69 y/o F with hx of NSCLC in L lung, known LLE DVT on coumadin, presents today with new onset chest pain.
Approximately 2 days ago, she started having pleuritic chest pain.
Of note, she has a hx of PE diagnosed in [**2158**] and has been on coumadin since that time.
The coumadin was restarted the day after the biopsy, and on that day she noted redness and swelling in her RLE.
She was admitted [**2-19**] and treated for RLE cellulitis with vanco/keflex.
The thought was that it likely occurred while she was off her coumadin, so it was not considered a treatment failure and she was continued on her coumdain, as she was appropriately therapeutic.
On the floor, she is complaining of SOB and L sided chest pain.
She has no other complaints.
Does have chronic productive cough.
Past Medical History: PMH: Hypertension - diagnosed 25 years ago Hyperlipidemia hearing loss chronic diastolic heart failure lung/thyroid cancer s/p resection [**2159-3-28**] CT scan --> pulmonary embolism; started coumadin Hypothyroid Pulmonary hypertension Left ventricular hypertrophy .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**11-2**] - increased SOB --> CXR with RUL opacity, CTA with 1.7 x 2.1 cm spiculated right apical lung mass was noted, also found to  have left sided thyroid mass with mass effect and tracheal narrowing.
- [**11-2**] - CT scan of the abdomen that showed innumerable low-density lesions in the liver for which MRI was recommended - [**11-2**] negative bone scan - [**11-2**] thyroid ultrasound with FNA biopsy that was nondiagnostic.
Also noted was an FDG-avid 5-mm left upper lobe nodule.
There was no evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and her thyroid lesion was not FDG avid.
- [**2158-1-10**] left total thyroidectomy and right subtotal thyroidectomy, wedge resection of a right upper lobe nodule given her poor lung function as well as mediastinal lymph node dissection.
- Pathology from lung revealed a 1.9 cm grade II adenocarcinoma staged as a T1, N0.
- Note was also made of a micropapillary 0.1 cm thyroid cancer confined to the thyroid.
- followed with frequent imaging - [**2159-3-28**] CT scan --> pulmonary embolism, and she was subsequently started on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
-[**8-5**] a right lower lobe nodule and a 3-mm right middle lobe nodule concerning for metachronous lung cancer was noted.
- PET/CT right lower lobe non-FDG avid lesion, but there was some concern for a bronchoalveolar carcinoma upon the read of that scan.
- [**12-6**] Repeat CT scan with right middle lobe nodule measuring now 8.9 mm and a right lower lobe opacity concerning for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
- [**2160-1-8**] PET/CT on [**2160-1-8**], which revealed two suspicious right lung lesions that were noted on the CT scan on [**2159-12-19**], both with increased FDG avidity that was new from prior scans and felt very suspicious for malignancy - [**5-6**] CT interval progression in the right middle lobe lesion, A slowly growing lesion in the left lower lobe suspicious for bronchoalveolar cancer with significant soft tissue component, Left axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, Equivocal findings in the adrenals.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: # Hysterectomy age 18 # [**2158-1-10**] left total thyroidectomy and right subtotal thyroidectomy, wedge resection of a right upper lobe nodule given her poor lung function as well as mediastinal lymph node dissection.
(Pathology from lung revealed a 1.9 cm grade II adenocarcinoma staged as a T1, N0.
Note was also made of a micropapillary 0.1 cm thyroid cancer confined to the thyroid.)
# [**2161-2-10**]: L axillary LN biopsy metastatic lung cancer  Social History: Exsmoker, lives alone in her ground floor apartment.
Gets SOB walking minimal distances.
Family History: No history of clotting disorders.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.2 BP: 135/63 P: 94 R: 20 O2: 98% on 3L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: CTA CHEST  FINDINGS: There are large filling defects within the right main pulmonary artery extending into the right lower lobe subsegmental arteries and right middle lobe segmental arteries.
Filling defects within the left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental arteries as well left upper lobe segmental artery are noted.
There has been interval development of patchy opacity within the left upper lobe (3, 25).
This may represent developing infection versus pulmonary infarct.
There has been interval development of small left pleural effusion.
Large right upper lobe mass measures 3.7 x 3.2 cm, increased when compared to prior exam.
There is patchy opacity in the left lung base, which also may represent atelectasis versus developing pulmonary infarct.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion.
For example, there is a 3.7 cm lymph node in short axis diameter within the left axilla.
Enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum including a subcarinal lymph node measuring 2.6 x 2.2 cm is also identified, similar in appearance.
Limited views of the upper abdomen are noncontributory, except to note a subcentimeter hypodense lesion within the liver (2, 52), better seen on prior CT scan.
Bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli which extend into the right main pulmonary artery.
Interval development of patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and left lung base, which may represent new infectious process versus developing pulmonary infarcts.
Small left pleural effusion.
Interval increase in pulmonary nodules and masses.
Extensive lymphadenopathy in the left axilla and mediastinum, similar in appearance.
However, the right popliteal vein is enlarged with echogenic material within the lumen and absence of flow or compressibility.
These findings are compatible with an occlusive thrombus.
There is a filling defect within the left popliteal vein without compressibility, however, a small amount of flow is identified.
Findings are compatible with a nonocclusive thrombus within the left popliteal vein.
Interval development of occlusive thrombus within the right popliteal vein.
Nonocclusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein, as seen on the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, deep vein thrombosis on coumadin with therapeutic INR admitted with pleuritic chest pain found to have bilateral pulmonary segmental and subsegmental emboli.
# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  She was found to have a recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.
She remained hemodynamically stable and was satting well in the mid to high 90s at her baseline oxygen requirement of 3L.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics but remained afebrile without clinical evidence of infection so her antibiotics were stopped on hospital day 2.
# NSCLC: The oncology service was consulted regarding the management of her metastatic disease.
Decadron 4mg [**Hospital1 **] was started as pre-treatment for chemo.
# DIASTOLIC CHF: She appeared euvolemic on exam and had no increased O2 requirement with mild bilateral pedal edema likely secondary to her known DVTs.
Appears to be secondary to chronic inflammation.
