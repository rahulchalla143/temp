Admission Date:  [**2149-11-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-9-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Isovue-370  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Headache, neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral angiography Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: 65 year-old right-handed man with a history of atrial fibrillation and pulmonary embolism ([**2148-4-21**]) on warfarin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, with a left MCA infarct in [**Month (only) 359**] [**2148**], and renal cell carcinoma, who presents with headache and neck pain since yesterday.
History obtained primarily from wife given aphasia and dysarthria.
The pain only worsened over the course of the day, and he wore a collar to attend a dinner last evening in an effort to gain some relief.
However, the pain became so severe that he left the dinner early.
His concerned wife spoke by phone with a physician friend in [**Name (NI) 5622**] who suggested some analgesic medication, as it sounded musculoskeletal by description.
However, when the pain persisted this morning, his wife called his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] referred him to the emergency room.
A non-contrast image of the head and neck suggested a "likely subdural spinal hematoma" extending from the cerebellopontine angle "to the C2-C3 level with cord compression and edema."
There was no fracture or malalignment.
Review of Systems: Dysarthria and aphasia prevented gathering a coherent review from the patient, though his wife reports that he complained of some chest pain in the morning yesterday.
Past Medical History: -Left MCA infarct, thought to be cardioembolic secondary to his atrial fibrillation, [**2148-10-21**].
He had a mixed aphasia with dysarthria, and right face, arm, and leg hemiplegia and sensory loss.
With extensive physical and speech rehabilitation since that time, the patient has made great progress and was fully strong and fairly independent.
-Atrial fibrillation on warfarin -Hypertension -Dyslipidemia -Left cerebellopontine mass, likely Schwannoma -Pulmonary embolism, [**2148-4-21**] -Papillary renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney.
He apparently suffered no known ill effects from the accident.
Smokes cigars and occasional cigarette.

Acute extra-axial hematoma along the lower brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord with associated mass effect and edema.
Possible etiologies include vascular malformation or aneurysm or bleeding from the patients known left CP angle schwannoma.
Hypodensity in the left cerebellopontine angle likely acoustic schwannoma previously diagnosed by MRI.
Large territory of hyperdensity and encephalomalacia in the area of the left MCA consistent with prior left MCA infarction.
Acute extra-axial hematoma (likely SDH) extending from the medulla along the cervical spinal cord to approximately the C3 vertebral level.
There is resultant mass effect on the cord with rightward and posterior cord displacment and compression, as well as probable cord edema.

Enhancing lesion within the left cerebellopontine angle consistent with previously described schwannoma on prior MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 227**] the location of the schwannoma, it is likely the source of bleeding.
CXR ([**11-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Area of acute hemorrhage seen within left cerebellopontine angle mass, the source of the patient's extra-axial hematoma compressing the cervical spinal cord.
Deviation of the cervical spinal cord to the right with severe edema within the cord.
Mild increase in the size of the left CP angle mass lesion felt to represent vestibular schwannoma, with blood products within.
Left MCA chronic infarct with hemosiderosis, related to evolution of the chronic infarct.
Patent major intracranial arteries without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram.
Short segment stenosis of M1 segment of the left Middle cerebral artery without flow limitation related to prior ischemic event.
Conventional angiogram can be considered to confirm the source of hemorrhage after discussion with the interventional neuroradiologist, if there is continued cocern.
Continued evolution of the blood products, noted in the CSF space, anterior and to the left side of the medulla and in the upper cervical canal with mild decrease in the anteroposterior extent of the blood products as seen on the sagittal images; improvemed but persistent compression on the upper cervical cord and the left side of the medulla compared to the prior study (but persistent).
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above.
Prominent venous/vascular structures in the region of the proximal V4 segment of the left vertebral artery may represent a developmental venous anomaly/venous angioma.
Hypervascular tumor cannot be excluded.
Mild narrowing of the intradural V4 segments of the vertebral arteries more on the left than on the right may represent spasm versus hypoplastic intradural V4 segment of the vertebral arteries.

Left-sided cerebellopontine angle mass consistent with vestibular schwannoma is identified which demonstrates intrinsic area of blood products as seen on the previous CT. Limited comparison with the previous MRI demonstrate no significant change in size when comparing the differences in technique.
No evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Extra-axial hematoma extending from the medulla along the cervical spinal cord, likely due to bleeding around schwannoma: The patient was admitted with new headache and neck pain, and was found to have acute extra-axial hematoma extending from the medulla along the cervical spinal cord to approximately the C3 vertebral level, with resultant mass effect on the cord with rightward and posterior cord displacment and compression, as well as probable cord edema.
CTA head showed no evidence of AVM, aneurysm formation, or other vascular abnormality.
Cerebral angiography showed prominent venous/vascular structures in the region of the proximal V4 segment of the left vertebral artery may represent a developmental venous anomaly/venous angioma, but hypervascular tumor cannot be excluded.
It was thought that the cause of his bleeding was from the schwannoma.
He was initially admitted to the NeuroICU, where he returned to his baseline aphasia and dysarthria.
Hypercoaguable work up showed Lupus AC neg, ATIII nl, Prot C nl, Prot S nl ACA IgG/IgM nl, homocysteine nl, FVL no mutation, MTHFR Heterozygous, prothrombin no mutation.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
He went into atrial fibrillation with RVR requiring a diltiazem gtt.
Given that it was too risky to put him back on Coumadin, EP was consulted for possible ablation and initiation of antiarrythmic.
WBC was 14.1 on admission with 88% neutrophils, and peaked at 18.7 Urine Cx ([**11-17**]): <10,000 organisms/ml, ([**11-21**], [**11-25**]): No growth, and ([**11-22**]): ENTEROCOCCUS >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML; STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
