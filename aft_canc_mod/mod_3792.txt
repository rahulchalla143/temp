#) Gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient has known esophageal varices in setting of portal hypertension and portal vein thrombosis.
His elevated INR, which was secondary to his liver disease, further increased his risk of a significant bleed.
The liver team discussed his poor prognosis, and patient wished to proceed with endoscopy to attempt to stop any active bleeding source.
Upon arrival to the ICU, an upper endoscopy confirmed bleeding from esophageal varices.
Attempts were made to stop the bleeding, with banding of one variceal bleed and injection of others, however patient continued to bleed and no further interventions were possible.
After an episode of respiratory distress after endoscopy, and based on discussion with patient, family, and liver team, decision was made not to pursue repeat endoscopy.
Due to significant abdominal distension and an elevated bladder pressure, and therapeutic paracentesis was completed on [**2139-9-14**] for comfort, with removal of 4 liters of fluid.
