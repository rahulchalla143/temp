1st set cardiac enzymes negative.
CT torso showed probably left renal collecting system transitional cell ca causing partial obstruction with complex fluid around the left kidney likely representing fornix rupture.
There was also focal transverse colon wall thickening concerning for neoplasm with hypodense liver lesions and cystic duct enhancing lesion concerning for mets.
On the floor, pt reports that abdominal pain is much improved and minimal currently.
He denies any early satiety or decreased appetite.

Urothelial thickening and enhancement within the left renal collecting system, concerning for transitional cell carcinoma, which results in mild left hydronephrosis.
9-mm left para-aortic lymph node is suspicious for metastatic involvement.
Complex left perinephric fluid collection demonstrates progressive enhancement, and may be secondary to forniceal rupture.
Multiple hepatic metastases.
Area of focal wall thickening and narrowing in the transverse colon may be due to peristalsis, but underlying neoplasm is not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo man with no significant PMH other than unclear and remote abdominal surgery p/w RUQ abdominal pain, found to have anemia to Hct 19 and CT torso findings suggestive of metastatic disease   .
# Metastatic colon cancer: The patient had imaging findings consistent with a primary colon or transitional renal cell carcinoma with evidence of metastasis to the liver.
He had a significantly elevated CEA level.
Arrangements were made to follow up in oncology clinic for likely initiation of capecitabine.
# Dynamic ST-depressions: The patient has no known history of CAD.
ST changes occurred in the setting of tachycardia secondary to fever or abdominal pain with normalization following improved rate control.
# RUL nodule: 3mm nodule could represent metastatic disease but nonspecific.
# COPD: Significant smoking history with CT chest findings consistent with emphysema.
