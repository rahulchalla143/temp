Impression: 79 yo male with critical aortic stenosis and adenocarcinoma of the colon admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service post aortic valvuloplasty going to colon resection in AM with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Ischemia: no critical lesions identified, but the patient does have 50% ostial LAD lesion.
No Dx of CAD in the past.

The operation went well with no complications.
Vancomycin, gentamycin and flagyl were started empirically because of his recent valvuloplasty.
On POD 1, he required 1.5 liters in fluid boluses for hypotension (SBP in the 70's to 80's).
However, that night he developed tachycardia  to the 130's-140's and hypotension to 80/55.
Consideration was given to heparinize the patient, however cardiology did not feel the need to do so given that he responded well to the amiodarone and cardioversion and did not experience any more atrial fibrillation.
He did not require any more fluid boluses.
Antibiotics were discontinued as he was afebrile with a normal WBC.
