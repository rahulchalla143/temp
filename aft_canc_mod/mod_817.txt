Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-11-3**] no significant change  Radiology [**2129-4-16**] Chest CT: Dense multifocal opacities are seen within the right lung and left lung base consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Note is made of calcified aortic valve which may suggest aortic stenosis and can correlate with echocardiography if warrented.
No filling defect is identified within the pulmonary arteries.
There are multiple prominent mediastinal nodes the largest of which is a right paratracheal node measuring 18 x 9 mm.
Enlarged lymph nodes are also seen within the left axilla, the largest measures 2.0 x 1.2 cm.
Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification is seen within the aorta and coronaries.
Visualized upper abdomen demonstrates cholelithiasis.
[**2129-4-16**] RUQ U/S: Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant demonstrates a liver with normal echogenicity without focal lesion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema to suggest cholecystitis.
[**2129-4-17**] MRI of head with and without contrast: There is opacification of the mastoid sinus air cells as well as scattered areas of mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses.
There is an air-fluid level in the nasopharynx.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There are scattered foci of increased T2 signal within the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
There is no area of slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
There are no enhancing abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute infarct or enhancing abnormalities.
Tiny amounts of chronic microvascular ischemic change.
[**2129-4-18**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Lung windows of the apices partially image patient's known multifocal opacities on the right.
Bone windows reveal no acute fractures or dislocation.
No spondylolisthesis is identified.
Tiny avulsion injuries off the posterosuperior aspect of the C4 and C5 vertebral bodies appear old.
Scattered calcifications of the anterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum are also observed.
Again seen is bilateral interstitial edema which appears to be slightly increased since the previous examination.
Patchy opacities at the right base and right midlung persists.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old male tranferred from [**Hospital6 **] intubated with pneumococcal pneumonia and resuscitated septic shock.
This is the patient's second severe pneumonia within the last 2 years, despite multiple pneumococcal vaccines; his primary care physician is planning further [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] as an outpatient to determine what, if anything, is predisposing him to recurrent pneumonias.
2) Change in mental status: Following extubation, the patient remained significantly altered in terms of mental status.
An MRI of his head did not reveal an acute abnormality (see results section).
The patient's change in mental status, which gradually improved over the course of his hospital stay, was likely due to delirium in the setting of acute illness (pneumonia, recent intubation).
[**Doctor First Name **] was mildly positive at 1:40 (outpatient follow-up).
His transaminitis, which resolved over the course of his hospital stay, may have been due to mild shock liver in the setting of sepsis.
4) Type II diabetes well-controlled: The patient was started on an insulin gtt in the ICU.
He can likely be transitioned back to his oral regimen at his rehabilitation facility  5) Iron deficiency anemia: The patient has undergone a recent extensive work-up for GI bleeding sources.
7) Lymphadenopathy: The patient's chest CT revealed prominent mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes (see results section).
These may be related to the patient's known extensive pneumonia, but outpatient follow-up is recommended once he recovers from his acute illness, particularly given the patient's history of non-hodgkins lymphoma.
A neurology consult was obtained, who felt this could be secondary to deconditioning versus ICU-related myopathy.
9) Left foot redness: The patient was noted to have a rash involving his distal left foot; this was patchy, not painful/pruritic, and not cellulitic appearing.
He was started on miconazole powder for possible fungal infection.
Iron sulfate 325 mg daily  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] northeast [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: streptococcal pneumonia Secondary: change in mental status, thrombocytopenia, Type II diabetes well-controlled, anemia, hypothyroidism  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe pneumonia 1) Please follow-up as indicated below.
