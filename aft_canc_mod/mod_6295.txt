Pertinent Results: RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2185-1-6**] 3:38 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  Reason: eval for growth of intramural hematoma  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old man with aortic intramural hematoma REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for growth of intramural hematoma CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Aortic intramural hematoma, evaluate for growth of intramural hematoma.
Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal descending aorta is unchanged.
There are numerous calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease.
Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
The heart and coronary arteries appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.
Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without evidence of new hemothorax on the left.
Bilateral emphysematous changes are again noted.
The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along with the decrease in pleural effusions.
No definite pulmonary nodules or masses are identified.
Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall is unchanged from multiple studies.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.
Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter are unchanged.
Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is consistent with atherosclerotic disease.
Three areas of focal dilation of the infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and are unchanged from the earliest study.
Again noted is high-grade narrowing at the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
Single renal arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of the left renal artery.
Bone windows show degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, bilateral L5 pars defects and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
Continued slight increase in size of an anterior mediastinal hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation.
Unchanged thoracic aortic aneurysm and marked mural irregularity consistent with penetrating ulcers and intramural hematoma.
Decreased bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Unchanged bilateral renal cysts and borderline pancreatic ductal dilation.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

Electronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2184-12-30**] 15:40       Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-12-29**] via transfer from [**Hospital6 5016**] for further management of a mediastinal hematoma.
His CT scan showed a dilated ascending aorta showed no dissection of his aorta however showed a large mediastinal hematoma consistent with a penetrating ulcer which had stopped leaking.
Serial CT scans showed a mild increase in the size of an anterior mediastinal hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation and an unchanged thoracic aortic aneurysm with marked mural irregularity consistent with penetrating ulcers and intramural hematoma.
