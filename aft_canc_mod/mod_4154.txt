Admission Date:  [**2190-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2136-2-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: planned for chemotherapy (Gemzar/cisplatin)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nasogastric tube placement and removal.
History of Present Illness: 54 yo female with hx of metastatic breast cancer who presents for cycle #4 of gemcitabine and cisplatin.
She notes abdominal pain over the past 4 months which she has taken morphine for with some relief though the pain returns and is not well controlled.
She has associated nausea, vomitting and constipation (last BM today but has required enema in the past) but no diarrhea.
She further c/o 'blurry vision' which has been present since XRT 2 months ago and has been stable over that time.
She is not able to state if the blurry vision is whole-field, peripheral or central.
This is associated with a frontal headache.
Her third complaint is low back pain which localizes to the right flank region which she states has been present for 4 months also.
This pain is not relieved by morphine, unlike her abdominal pain.
On ROS she notes occasional chills, and tingling in her fingertips since starting chemo, and 57 pound weight loss over the past 4-5 months, denies fevers, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, SOB, CP, arm or leg pain, rashes, dysuria.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx: Stage II left breast cancer (estrogen neg, progesterone low positive, her2/neu neg) s/p mastectomy (0/9 lymph nodes) in [**7-21**].
This was followed by chest wall XRT and adjuvant chemotherapy.
Has recurrent disease with mets to the brain, small bowel and extensive lymphadenopathy.
PMH: metastatic breast cancer as above HTN .
Retired since diagnosis of breast cancer two years ago.
Patient independent with ADLs, lives alone but has very supportive family.
[**3-24**] CT Head w/o contrast: CT HEAD WITH CONTRAST: Compared to [**2190-2-1**], there has been significant improvement in the degree of metastatic disease burden with most of the previously identified enhancing lesions no longer seen.
A persistent focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe (3:11) measures approximately 5 mm compared to 6 mm on [**2-1**].
An approximately 2 mm focus of enhancement adjacent to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle (3:14) is significantly smaller compared to [**2-1**] when it measured approximately 8 mm.
No new lesions are identified and there is no shift of normally midline structures or evidence of acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
A small mucus polyp is noted within the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Marked improvement in the degree of metastatic disease burden with most of the previously identified enhancing metastases no longer identified.
Small persistent foci of enhancement likely represent residual metastatic disease.
[**4-12**] Pa/Lat IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2190-3-25**]:  Small left pleural effusion or pleural scarring is unchanged since [**2190-3-10**].
Lung volumes are lower exaggerating heart size, which is mildly enlarged.
Lungs are clear, with no evidence of pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate pericardial effusion is noted.
The lungs demonstrate airspace opacity in the lateral aspect of the lingular lobe consistent with post-radiation changes.
The liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without evidence of focal lesion.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The stomach demonstrates air within the posterior wall, not seen in the prior study.
No evidence of free air within the abdomen.
No evidence of free air.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Portal venous air as well as air within the posterior gastric wall.
Cannot differentiate emphysematous gastritis from gastric emphysema.
Interval decrease in size of the left supraclavicular, mediastinal, and periaortic lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions.
Postsurgical changes in the lingular lobe.
[**3-27**] RLE U/S IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Again seen are small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate pericardial effusion, unchanged.
Within the limitations of a non-contrast exam, no focal lesion is identified within the liver.
Compared to the prior exam from [**2190-3-26**], there is a marked to complete resolution of the previously described intramural gas within the stomach wall.
Small umbilical hernia is identified.
No intra-abdominal free air is detected.
Small amount of abdominal ascites is present.
Small stable retroperitoneal lymphnodes are present, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No pelvic lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Degenerative changes are noted at L5-S1.
Compared to prior CT from [**2190-3-26**], there is a marked to almost complete resolution of the previously described intramural gas within the stomach wall.
[**4-2**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities .
[**4-7**] FINDINGS: Upright and left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph demonstrate residual contrast within the large bowel, predominantly within the descending colon.
No dilated loops of small bowel or intra-abdominal free air is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
[**4-8**] CT head w/o contrast: FINDINGS: The small focus of residual enhancement in the right frontal lobe medially (3:11) is unchanged.
No new enhancing lesions are seen.
There is no mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus noted.
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small enhancing focus in the right frontal lobe is unchanged from the prior study, and a smaller enhancing focus has resolved.
No new mass lesions, hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 54 yo woman w/ metastatic beast cancer here for cycle #4 of Gemzar/cisplatin with abdominal pain and flank pain.
# Vomiting: This has gotten worse, seems to have minimal nausea but projectile vomitting with and without PO suggesting mechanical trigger for reflexive vomitting.
She was tried on scheduled antiemetics with no relief and some lethargy so currently just scheduled compazine.
PRN zofran, ativan, zyprexa and phenergan also ordered with minimal relief.
Ultimately, it was thought to be [**12-18**] outlet obstruction from her cancer and as nothing surgical can be done for this at this point symptomatic management was continued w/ antiemetics.
Also has been on aggressive ivf with low urine output/poor po/vomitting.
# Abdominal pain: Improved, also with fever [**2-25**], now improved off abx.
No clear source, likely related to abdominal process.
CT torso done and concerning for air in stomach wall and portal vein but f/u CT showed resolution.
GI and surgery both consulted but reluctant to intervene given very high risk of any procedure.
Abdominal pain seems improved.
# Metastatic breast CA: Admitted for cycle 4 gemcitabine/cisplatin with pre-hydration and anti-emetics; s/p dexamethasone taper for brain mets.
CT head and torso demonstarte interval improvement of metastatic disease.
Not likely to tolerate further chemo currently given poor nutritional status and poor functional status.
# Luekopenia: Improved.
# Hyponatremia: Improved.
# Low-back pain: Unclear etiology, not likely related to bony mets as no point-tenderness on spine.
Possibly related to RP mets given abdominal CT [**2190-1-16**] showed enhancement adjacent to the right adrenal, which if larger could be causing this pain though no comment on this on CT [**2190-2-24**].
Likely related to XRT given time course and lack of progression but can not rule out progression of brain mets.
CT head with contrast noteable for decrease in mets from [**2190-2-1**] with no new lesions, no edema or mass effect.
# Anemia: Likely chemo-related, not significantly off recent baseline but with slow recovery, would transfuse hct<25 (s/p 2 uPRBC's on this admit).
# Code: DNR/DNI .
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every four (4) hours as needed for nausea or shortness of breath.
