Admission Date:  [**2129-3-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-3-16**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] due to hypoxia and mild hypotension secondary to newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism.
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a known history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2129-2-21**] for elective wedge resection of a right lower lobe mass.
Two days prior to admission to [**Hospital6 256**], she developed dyspnea with oxygen saturation decreasing to the 80s in room air.
She was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CT angiogram.
Since the patient had recently undergone wedge resection of the right lower lobe, she was not a candidate for systemic thrombolytic therapy.
At [**Hospital6 256**], review of chest CT disclosed segmental bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities did not disclose evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Squamous cell carcinoma.
The patient is status post  wedge resection of the right lower lobe on [**2129-2-21**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease, status post right coronary  artery stent placement in [**2126-8-13**].
Peptic ulcer disease.
Renal artery stenosis, status post bypass in [**2122**].
Esophageal stricture, status post dilation.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had a history of coronary artery disease.
No thyromegaly.
Right posterior incision healing well.
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender and non-distended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No cords and no swelling.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at 105, QRS interval 60?????
IMPRESSION:  79-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and non-metastatic squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post resection, who presents with shortness of breath, desaturation and hypotension.
She was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CT angiogram.
Review confirmed bilateral pulmonary emboli but no saddle emboli.
The cause of the pulmonary emboli was thought to be multifactorial and due to malignancy, a history of smoking, immobility and the presence of a recent internal jugular central line.
During her hospital stay, she began to feel less short of breath.
It was decided that the patient would be initiated on Lovenox for treatment of her pulmonary emboli.
Cardiovascular:  On admission, the patient was hypotensive and required fluid boluses to maintain her systolic blood pressure over 80.
On EKG, the patient has evidence of an old infarction.
Rhythm seemed consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia.
The patient remained afebrile during her hospital stay.
The patient also underwent mediastinoscopy which was negative for metastatic disease to the lymph nodes of the mediastinum.
DIC panel and Hemophilus workup were negative.
Due to difficulty maintaining the patient's INR, she will be anticoagulated with Lovenox.
Neurology/Psychiatry:  The patient was noted to have periods of delirium during her hospital stay.
Non-small cell lung cancer, status post wedge resection of right lower lobe in [**2129-2-12**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
