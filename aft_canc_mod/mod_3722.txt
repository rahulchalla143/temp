The patient recently underwent revascularization of the left lower extremity in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year and was hospitalized because of the ischemic extremity on [**2129-9-5**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses - peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2129-7-6**] with thrombectomy, history of stroke x2 - ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke with residual dysphagia and aspiration; asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm 4.3 cm in size; type 2 diabetes, controlled; history of hypertension;  ALLERGIES:  Haldol allergy new.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General appearance - is an elderly female in no acute distress.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, or rub.
Lower extremities with coolness of temperature to the distal lower left extremity, diminished capillary refill with mild mottling.
Recommendations were the patient could have thickened liquids only for comfort.
Recommendations were there were no signs of aspiration but the patient's oropharyngeal phase was discoordinated and PEG feedings were to be continued and thickened liquids for pleasure only.
The patient had an episode of agitation and confusion which resolved with Haldol IV.
They felt the delirium was secondary to multifactorial reasons and would recommend that we take her off narcotic and give her Tylenol 1 gm t.i.d.
The Haldol was discontinued and Zyprexa 2.5 mg nightly was instituted and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa for agitation as required.
Recommendations were to avoid any type of restraints and to re-orient the patient and avoid any unnecessary interruption of sleep/wake cycle.
The patient underwent on [**2129-9-18**], a left axillofemoral bypass and a left femoral-to- distal bypass.
She did require a total of four 250-fluid boluses for mild postoperative hypotension which was resolved with fluid resuscitation.
GI felt that the source was either upper or lower GI; this could not be fully evaluated given the patient's need for continuous anticoagulation but this should be evaluated on an outpatient basis when the patient has recovered from current surgery, but the patient would be monitored on a clinical basis, and if required at some point prior to discharge, would consider endoscopies to evaluate for active bleeding.
