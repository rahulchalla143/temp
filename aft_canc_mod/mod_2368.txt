At that time, he started developing high fevers up to 103.0 F, drenching night sweats and crampy left upper quadrant abdominal discomfort.
The pain in his epigastrium became progressively worse to the point where he was unable to eat or continue working in his job as a construction worker.
He was evaluated in the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital Emergency Department and discharged with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis at that time.
However his abdominal discomfort persisted and after searching the internet, he questioned his PCP as to whether he had pancreatitis.
An ultrasound on [**3-21**] confirmed pancreatitis and abdominal CT Scan demonstrated marked retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
He underwent MRI of the abdomen on [**4-4**] which raised the concern of pancreatic stricture and noted extensive peripancreatic lymphadenopathy that was thought to be consistent with lymphoma versus metastatic disease.
He continued to suffer from abdominal discomfort which was associated with rising bilirubin and fevers.
He was diagnosed with obstructive cholangitis.
Left rotator cuff repair.
History of left lung pneumonia in [**2167-7-1**].
History of left chest shingles in [**2168-1-1**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother has hypertension and his father has prostate cancer.
He was a jaundiced man in no acute distress.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The abdomen was soft and distended.
There was tenderness in the epigastric and right upper quadrant.
There is no evidence of rebound or guarding.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7710**] is admitted to this hospital for further management of his disease.
He had a successful sphincterotomy with successful extraction of small stone fragments and sludge.
Pathology of his gastric biopsy and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a monoclonal population of cells which were [**Last Name (un) **] positive, surface CD3 negative, cytoplasmic CD positive, CD56 positive, weekly CD2 positive, CD20 negative.
These biopsy findings were consistent with a NK cell lymphoma / leukemia.
Following his sphincterotomy, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management due to concerns of a rising lacticacidosis and hypoglycemia.
He tolerated the chemotherapy well without major toxicities.
He did develop some acute upper GI bleeding with melena.
An EGD was performed and demonstrated no signs of active bleeding.
Natural killer cell lymphoma / leukemia status post chemotherapy.
Obstructive cholangitis status post sphincterotomy.
Transient hypoglycemia and lacticacidemia likely secondary to hepatic dysfunction.
Acute renal failure secondary to intervascular volume depletion.
Anemia secondary to GI blood loss requiring blood transfusion.
