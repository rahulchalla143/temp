Ventricular masses were found on TTE as well as pericardial effusion which has since been drained and a pericardial window with drain has been placed.
Labs on admission were concerning for TLS given elevated uric acid in the range of [**7-27**].
His mother died in her 70s from diabetes and heart disease.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam At transfer to medicine service VS: Patient afebrile, all vital signs stable and within normal limits GEN: cachetic male, agitated in bed, pulling at pericardial drain and foley HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea,  dry MM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, flat JVP, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: tachycardic, periardial rub, radial pulses +2, pericardial drain in place draining serosanguinous fluid with dressing in place PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: Not oriented to place or time, just person.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
No jaundice, cyanosis, or petechiae.
The myocardium appeared to have heterogenous signal intensity with tumor infiltration involving the majority of the right ventricular cavity, interventricular septum, left ventricular apex, interatrial septum, right atrial free wall , region surrounding the tricuspid annulus, and left atrium near the mitral annulus.
Resting myocardial perfusion images of the mass reveal similar perfusion characteristics to normal myocardium, .
This suggests that the mass is vascular, and less likely to represent chronic thrombus 2.
Numerous pulmonary nodules are identified in both lungs.
There is a small to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion.. 4.
TTE on [**2126-7-25**]: IMPRESSION: Large tumor mass in the right ventricle with extensive mass infiltration into the right atrium, interatrial septum, and possibly the left ventricular apex.
There is large circumferential pericardial effusion most anterior to the right atrium and right ventricle with signs of early tamponade.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-5**], the current study better defines the valves with no discrete vegetation identified (does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested) CT Head w/o Contrast on [**2126-7-28**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
Left maxillary air- fluid level.
No focal liver abnormality, or other CT finding to explain sudden increase in liver function tests.
Interval improvement in intracardiac nodules, multiple pulmonary nodules, and bilateral renal and adrenal masses.
Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
<b>PATHOLOGY<b> Kidney, needle core biopsy [**2126-7-23**]: Gross: Involvement by high grade non Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma best classified as diffuse large B-cell type Cytology: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
Abnormal / lymphoma cells comprise 2% of total events.
Multiple paratrabecular and non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregates, in keeping with involvement by patient's known B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see note).
Note 1: Although a majority of the cells in the lymphoid infiltrate are large in size, and are thus in keeping with involvement by the patient's recently diagnosed high-grade lymphoma, some paratrabecular aggregates including with admixed smaller lymphocytes are also noted.
The possibility of an antecedent lower-grade lymphoma cannot be excluded.
Mildly hypercellular bone marrow with mild dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis noted.
Tumor, surface of the heart, incisional biopsy (A-B): --Markedly crushed atypical lymphoid infiltrate in keeping with involvement by patient's recently diagnosed B-cell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high grade (see note).
--Note: Sections A and B show a dense mononuclear infiltrate with extensive crush artifact.
In focal, better preserved areas, the cells appear to have scant cytoplasm, irregular nuclear outlines, hyperchromatic nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli.
Note:  In sections C through D, there is a patchy atypical lymphoid infiltrate, comprised of cells similar to those described above.
There is prominent mitotic activity and single cell apoptosis.
Due to paucicellular nature of the specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine B-cell clonality/look for residual disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year male with new diagnosis NHL involving lung, pericardium, heart, adrenals, and kidneys admitted with this new diagnosis and in hypercalcemic crisis with persistent encephalopathy status post placement of pericardial window.
1) High grade NHL likely stage 3 or 4: This was diagnosed with a CT guided renal biopsy on [**2126-7-23**].
Separate biopsies of the patient's bone marrow, pericardium and a mass on the surface of his heart also all revealed B-cell lymphoma.
Imaging also revealed pulmonary nodules that could potentially be further malignant involvement.
Pretreatment prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome was initiated with allopurinol and discontinued after several days of normal uric acid levels.
Given the patient's persistent mental status changes, an LP was performed and showed cytology indeterminate for malignancy.
Still, given lack of other sources of mental status changes he was considered high risk for CNS lymphoma and received intrathecal methotrexate and then high dose methotrexate on [**2126-8-9**].
Overall, the patient tolerated chemotherapy very well with minimal nausea and no appreciated mucositis or other toxicities.
Encephalopathy: The patient presented with encephalopathy that persisted despite correction of hypercalcemia (corrected with IVFs and pamidronate 30mg IV X1 [**7-25**], decadron 20mg IV bid and lasix 20mg X1 and IVFs) and hyponatremia.
Head CT without contrast was negative for bleeding or other acute intracranial pathology.
An LP was performed to evaluate for CNS involvement or infection but cytology was inconclusive and there were no signs of infection.
An infectious work up was initiated on [**2126-7-31**] given persistent encephalopathy despite correction of his electrolyte abnormalities and discontinuation of CNS inhibiting drugs but no signs of UTI or pneumonia.
1/2 blood cultures from a PICC site was positive for gram + cocci in pairs and chains (see management below).
This confusion continued to gradually improve and by time of discharge he was at his baseline mental status and alert and oriented times three.
Strep viridans bacteremia: The patient never had a fever but on ICU day 8 an infectious work-up was initiated due to his continued encephalopathy.
At that time, one out of two cultures drawn from his PICC site were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and chains that were eventually speciated as viridans streptococcus.
This was briefly switched to Penicillin G during the period of leucovorin rescue given a concern that the calcium in the leucovorin could precipitated with ceftriaxone.
Though there was never fever, embolic phenomena, or other high risk features for endocarditis, multiple echocardiograms were performed and none showed vegetations.
Pericardial effusion: On [**2126-7-25**] an echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion that caused some diastolic collapse of the ventricle.
This was considered a risk for hemodynamic compromise so a pericardial window was placed.
Pericardial window was chosen over pericardial drain given this was now thought most likely to be a malignant infusion and the risk of recurrence was high.
At the time of discharge he was left with only a small healing incision on his chest.
Acute Renal insufficiency: He presented with [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr elevated to 1.8 over his baseline of 1.2.
Given his hypercalcemia at the time this was considered most likely to be prerenal and secondary to dehdration.
Ultrasound was obtained and revealed a DVT at the PICC site.
Heparin gtt was held given concern for triggering pericardial hemorrhage in light of recent pericardial window.
The swelling in the right resolved by the time of discharge.
Tachycardia: The patient had a history of tachycardia that was treated with metoprolol during his hospitalization.
Anemia, Thrombocytopenia: At presentation he was noted to be thrombocytopenic and anemic that was presumed to be secondary to his lymphoma and myelopthisis.
At the time of presentation the patient was hypercalcemic, presumably secondary to his malignancy.
He received IVF, pamindronate, and furosemide and his calcium resolved to a normal value by [**2126-7-28**].
The patient intially required tube feeds in the ICU due to his mental clouding.
While he was in the ICU he was kept on H2 blocker for ulcer prophylaxis, but this was discontinued after he was transferred to the floor and his condition improved.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous daily and PRN as needed for line flush.
Ondansetron 4 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea for 2 weeks.
