The patient has been in usual state of health until two days prior to admission when he began experiencing fatigue, weakness and pain in his legs along with some shortness of breath.
The patient presented to an outside Emergency Room and was found to have an elevated white count to 374,000, 96% blasts.
He had leukopheresis which went well until just prior to the end of the procedure when he had a temperature to 104.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a tired appearing elderly male in no acute distress.
Extremities showed diffuse ecchymosis, also ecchymosis over his lumbar spine and lower extremities bilaterally.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure or focal consolidation.
He did experience an episode of hypotension during the leukopheresis, however, otherwise tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was monitored for signs of tumorlysis syndrome as he was receiving Hydrea for his blast crisis.
The patient did not experience further issues with shortness of breath.
On the morning of [**10-11**], the patient had an acute change in mental status.
A head CT was performed which showed a large right frontal stroke as well as multiple other areas of smaller hemorrhage.
Approximately 9 hours after the acute change in mental status, the patient was pronounced, likely secondary to the acute bleed which resulted in his respiratory and cardiac arrest.
