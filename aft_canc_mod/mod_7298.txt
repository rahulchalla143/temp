She also has a h/o HTN and recent MAT with hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 31835**] during which her BB was increased from daily to tid.
At home the patient reports that she has been having diarrhea while getting chemo.
Also with nausea and decreased PO.
She continues to have baseline SOB and gets daily pleural fluid drained from her pleurex catheter.
She denies fevers, chest pain or cough.
Given hypotension and tachycardia, need for CVL was discussed with patient and patient refused.
Labs were notable for ARF with Cr 3.4 and K 5.8.
She had no complaints.
L4/L5 spondylolisthesis with synovial cyst resected in 01/[**2154**].
Left piriformis syndrome.
Status post total hysterectomy in [**2147**] for leiomyomata with foci of atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium, focally involving an endometrial polyp.
Past Oncology History: - Initial symptoms: cough, supraclavicular lymph node, nodular mass lower abdomen - CXR demonstrated R hilar mass.
CT on [**2156-1-1**] showed 3.5 X 3.7 cm R hilar mass with marked narrowing of the right upper lobe bronchus and apparent obstruction of the posterior bronchus to the right upper lobe.
Bulky bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy was noted.
The dominant lymph node mass in the right paratracheal region measured 2.9 x 2.7 cm, with a dominant conglomerate nodal mass in the precarinal lesion measuring 3.3 x 2.8 cm.
Multiple lymph nodes were identified throughout the mediastinum including the prevascular space bilaterally, the posterior subcarinal space, and the right hilum.
There was a moderate dependent right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion as well as a small pericardial effusion.
Also noted was a 2.8 x 1.9 cm nodule within the periphery of the right upper lobe.
Several lucent vertebral body lesions were identified in the lower thoracic spine.
- Excisional biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node on [**2156-1-5**].
- Pathology: poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of pulmonary origin, probably best characterized as large cell type, although there is considerable variation in cell size.
No e/o lymphoproliferative disorder.
Family History: The patient's mother died at age 86 from  squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.
Her father died of congestive heart failure at age 85.
She has no siblings.
Her paternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 70s.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 95.8 BP: 84/49 HR: 127 RR: 6 O2Sat: 91% 2L GEN: Chronically ill-appearing, tired, lying in bed with eyes closed, arousable, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, MM dry, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, no lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: Regular, tachy, no M/G/R PULM: Decreased BS [**12-26**] way up on R, crackles [**12-27**] way up on L ABD: Soft, firm soft tissue mass present on anterior abdominal wall, NT, ND, hyperactive BS EXT: 1+ edema bilateral LE NEURO: oriented to person, place, and time.
Right pleural effusion is likely unchanged but pneumothorax is improved.
Left pleural effusion is unchanged, still small-to-moderate.
Left basilar opacity increased, could be aspiration or infection.
Right upper lobe and right middle lobe are still collapsed but slightly better aerated.
Left perihilar mass is hard to differentiate from adjacent consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: This was a 73 year old female with metastatic pulmonary neuro-endocrine carcinoma diagnosed approximately three months ago.
She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, tachycardia and acute renal failure.
Immediate cause of death was felt to be respiratory arrest.
He did not wish to have an autopsy.
