Admission Date:  [**2168-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-7-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-3-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bone marrow biopsy removal of Hickman PICC placement Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 70 year old male with history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p 4 cycles of R-CHOP, 4 cycles of ESHAP and one cycle of [**Hospital1 **] and Zevalin, discharged recently (2 days PTA) after elective admission for mini-MUDS.
His recent admission was c/b febrile neutropenia (no source identified, treated empirically with vanc, cefepime, flagyl and caspo, then subsequently weaned off of these agents), anorexia requiring TPN, diarrhea (c. diff negative x6) and transiently elevated LFTs of unknown etiology (negative ultrasounds).
By the time of discharge he was tolerating po's well, had been afebrile for >1week, was constipated and was ambulating.
Today he presented to clinic and was noted to have shaking chills and temp to 100.6.
He says yesteday he had loose stools (had been given stool softeners on day of admission due to constipation) and his wife feels his line "looks worse".
He was admitted for evaluation of low grade fever.
He denies any new or worsening lymphadenopathy.
Notes that he feels as though his left submandibular node as well as left inguinal node has gotten smaller.
He denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or any other cardiac or respiratory difficulties.
Denies any pain anywhere, denies any shortness of breath upon exertion.
Denies any vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
Does continue with a little bit of nausea.
He says that he has had intermittent R and L LQ abdominal pain with bloating that is relieved with BMs.
Denies any numbness or tingling in the fingers or toes.
Diffuse large cell lymphoma - Initially presented with splenomegaly [**7-2**], found to have bulky disease above and below diaphram - S/p 4 cycles of R-CHOP and then switched to ESHAP due to disease progression.
Had persistent pelvic nodes and new inguinal node after second cycle of ESHAP.
Autologous transplant planned so underwent stem cell mobilization but had poor cell collection.
Restaging PET scans revealed progressive disease both above and below diaphram.

Minimal streak of atelectasis at the left base above the slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm.
No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
CT TORSO W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-5-31**] 2:27 PM CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes have slightly increased in size and number.
Bilateral axillary lymph nodes have also increased in size.
Largest left axillary lymph node measures 12 mm, compared to 8 mm in short axis diameter previously.
Lung windows continue to demonstrate biapical scarring.
Numerous pulmonary nodules are again noted.
Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, series 2, image 18, has slightly increased in size.
Peripheral right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, series 2, image 24, has slightly increased in size, measuring 3 mm compared to 1.5 mm previously.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Numerous hypodense splenic lesions have increased in size and number.
Multiple hypodense lesions in the hepatic parenchyma also appear more prominent on today's study.
Right adrenal nodule is stable.
Extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy has significantly increased in extent when compared to the prior study.
There is no free air and no free fluid in the abdomen.
The pancreas, abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no definite evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Interval significant worsening of mediastinal, axillary, retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, as well as slight increase in size of pulmonary nodules and splenic lesions, concerning for disease progression.
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: Hypocellular bone marrow with erythroid and megakaryocytic dysplasia.
No diagnostic morphologic features of involvement by lymphoma seen.
Note 1: The dyspoiesis may be related to recent chemotherapy.
Correlation with clinical findings as well as other laboratory findings is needed to exclude the possibility of an evolving hemophagocytic process.
Slight increase in mesenteric and pelvic lymphadenopathy as well as size of hepatic lesions.
Stable appearance of axillary, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodules and splenic lesions.
5-mm calculus at the right ureterovesical junction.
Interval development of small ascites and worsening of the pericardial and small right pleural effusion.
Disease progression with increase in size of several liver lesions, splenic lesions and retroperitoneal lymph nodes as described above.
Overall, more heterogeneous appearance of the liver raises concern for significant disease progression in the liver.
Ultrasound examination is recommended to confirm the presence of multiple subcentimeter hypodense lesions as this is a new finding.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: S/p Mini-MUDS w/ cells given on [**2168-5-3**].
WBC recovered well, but with persistent low platelets concerning for slow engraftment v. autoimmune phenomena posttransplant v. disease-related issues, or GVHD (though there were no other signs of GVHD to support this).
Given CT findings of increased size and number of [**Doctor First Name **], increased LDH, and BM read, concern for recurrence of disease v. hemophagocytic syndrome.
BM bx day 30 concerning for hemophagocytic cells and hemophagocytic syndrome.
CT torso ([**6-7**]) to eval for further progression and for abdominal pain etiology noted unchanged to slightly larger LNs and liver lesions.
Started ETOPOSIDE/decadron/cyclosporin [**6-10**] as per HLH protocol to treat disease as well as hemophagocytic syndrome as patient developed mental status changes and high fevers.
Patient had significant clinical response with recurrence of neutropenia after doses.
Patient then began to develop increased back pain and mental status changes.
CT of CAP showing progression in liver and splenic disease as well as increase in size of lymphanopathy.
Patient also began to develop increasing liver function tests (voriconazole dc'd due to hepatotoxicity with no improvement).
Given increased mental status changes and fevers, concern for recurrence of HLH.
Fever: The patient had been febrile when neutropenic during his last admission and had been treated with cefepime (d/c'd [**5-19**]), flagyl, caspo, and Vanco (DC'd [**5-20**]), all of which were weaned as he defervesced.
Imaging, cultures and screens for c. diff were unrevealing and he had been transitioned to fluconazole, acyclovir and bactrim for prophylaxis.
On admission he had no localizing symptoms, but did have a line which was a potential infectious source.
He had one day of loose stools but this was in the context of taking stool softeners for constipation.
Suspected line infection v. fungal pulmonary infection v. disease recurrence v. hemophagocytic syndrome.
All infectious work up was negative including CMV, EBV, parvovirus, toxoplasma, measles, HHV-8, adenoviral PCR, salmonella stools studies and numerous blood and urine cultures.
Patient did become positive for HHV-6 both in peripheral blood and CNS.
This was thought to be due to progressive disease versus recurrence of hemophagocytosis.
EP saw patient and felt no risk of torsades now that off fluconazole.
Patient had no further episodes.
