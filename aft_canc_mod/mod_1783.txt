: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], , MD Patient: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 174**]  Assisting Nurse(s)/ Other Personnel: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Instrument: pcf180al Birth Date: [**2049-12-22**] (52 years) ASA Class: P2 ID#: [**Numeric Identifier 32714**] Medications: fentanyl 175 micrograms Midazolam 4.5 mg IV  Indications: GI Bleeding   Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the terminal ileum was reached.
There were no complications.
Protruding Lesions Small non-bleeding grade 1 internal & external hemorrhoids were noted.
Excavated Lesions Several diverticula with medium openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and ascending colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
No single bleeding diverticulum was found.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and ascending colon Grade 1 internal & external hemorrhoids Blood in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum Recommendations: Repeat HCT on arrival to the floor.
We suspect a right-sided diverticular bleed, but a sigmoid diverticular bleed is possible as well.
Hematochezia: Pt was admitted for a 2 day history of hematochezia with lightheadedness.
Upon admission to the ER pt was noted to be anemic secondary to blood loss and was transferred to the ICU where she received 5 units of packed red blood cells.
Whilst in the ICU a tagged RBC was performed and showed no active bleeding.
Prior to discharge day pt was transferred to the floor where a colonoscopy revealed showed extensive diverticular disease extending up into the ascending colon with fresh blood.
On the day of discharge pt showed a stabe Hct x 72hours and was able to tolerate a PO diet with gross rebleeding.
Lower GI bleed, presume diverticular source   Discharge Condition: Stable, Afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for bleeding from your lower digestive system.
