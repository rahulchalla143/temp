Admission Date:  [**2119-10-18**]       Discharge Date: [**2119-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-1-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Fernard Intensive Care Unit  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old female with no significant past medical history who presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with acute onset of respiratory distress.
The patient had been noticing an enlarging neck mass for the past three to four years.
As [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 882**] Hospital notes, the patient noticed increasing phlegm production two days prior to admission and increasing shortness of breath.
While in the Waiting Room the patient had an acute onset of respiratory distress requiring intubation and was admitted to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital Intensive Care Unit.
100 cc of necrotic material was aspirated from the left neck mass which by report is consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
Computerized tomography scan of the neck/chest revealed a 7 by 7 cm left-sided neck mass with deviation of the trachea to the right and compression of the trachea around the endotracheal tube.
No obvious tumor was seen in the chest computerized tomography scan.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Small 1 cm area of ecchymosis around the biopsy site.
Heart, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
RADIOGRAPHS:  Chest x-ray from outside hospital, large left neck mass with questionable mediastinal lymphadenopathy, endotracheal tube at carina.
Computerized tomography scan of chest revealed multiple anterior mediastinal lymph nodes and para-aortic tracheal compression with deviation to the right, no parenchymal lung lesions are seen, small left pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old female with left-sided neck mass consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, most likely of esophageal origin, causing airway compromise, intubated for airway protection.
Left-sided neck mass - On arrival to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was evaluated by Radiation [**Hospital 44889**] Medical Oncology and Otorhinolaryngology.
Computerized tomography scan of the head revealed no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Computerized tomography scan of the chest showed a large neck mass which tracks along the posterior wall of the trachea into the thoracic inlet, measuring 7 by 11 cm, multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and a small lower thoracic vertebral body hemangioma.
The magnetic resonance imaging scan of the neck with gadolinium showed redemonstration of an enormous neck mass with probable infiltration in the region of the left carotid sheath and other signs of spread.
In the Operating Room the procedure was noted to be very difficult and a tracheoesophageal fistula was found.
The patient's trachea was dissected to the fifth tracheal ring and an endotracheal tube was placed instead of a stable tracheostomy tube, given the difficulty of the procedure.
A panendoscopy was done at the time of her tracheostomy placement on hospital day #10 which showed diffuse tumor in both the trachea and the esophagus.
Multiple biopsies were done of the esophagus and it was felt at this time that the tumor was originating from the cervical esophagus, although this could not be definitely confirmed.
Given the fistula, it was thought that radiation and chemotherapy, while possibly able to provide some local control of tumor extension, would only worsen the fistula and cause neutropenia increasing infection risk.
BAL later grew out Staphylococcus aureus which was pansensitive.
The patient completed a ten-day course of Levaquin and Clindamycin which was later added after the tracheal esophageal fistula was found.
Currently, the patient has occasional secretions and lowgrade temperatures, however, secretions overall have decreased this admission and the patient's cough has not increased.
We will try to observe the patient off of antibiotics but anticipate that she may continue to have lowgrade fevers due to her tracheoesophageal fistula and extent of tumor burden.
Urinary tract infection - The patient had an urinary tract infection during this admission which was Escherichia coli pansensitive.
Constipation - It was noted that the patient had multiple episodes of constipation in the setting of Roxicet narcotic use for incisional pain.
The patient has been ambulating without complications.
Stage 4 cervical esophageal cancer 2.
Urinary tract infection 5.
