Admission Date:  [**2200-8-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-9-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right IJ CVL Left radial arterial line PTC ERCP  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 83290**] is a 76 year old female with a PMH significant for CHF, HTN, DVT with PE s/p IVC filter on coumadin, COPD, meningioma, dementia, seizure disorder transferred from an OSH on [**2200-8-5**] for abdominal pain.
She was initially admitted to an OSH from her nursing home for fever to 101 and a fall.
RUQ U/S demonstrated multiple gallstones, dilated CBD to 19mm.
Overnight, the patient received 2 units FFP without incident.
This afternoon, she was receiving an additional 1 unit FFP and 15 minutes into transfusion developed hypoxia 85% RA, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever to 102.6. .
The patient subsequently developed an increasing oxygen requirement requiring intubation.
A CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
Past Medical History: DVT/PE with IVC filter placed on coumadin (per daughter, occurred 4 years ago) HTN CHF HLD COPD Chronic venous insufficiency Meningioma (stable per daughter) Seizure disorder GERD Mild dementia  Social History: Lives in [**Location **].
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Gen: Age appropriate female, confused in respiratory distress HEENT: Sclerae icterus .
CV: Tachy S1+S2 Pulm: Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
No rebound or guarding.
Intra and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Please note that in the setting of fatty liver, more advanced forms of liver disease including cirrhosis and/or fibrosis cannot be excluded by ultrasound.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for acute cholecystitis.
Right pleural effusion.
CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old female with a PMH signficant for CHF, HTN, DVT with PE s/p IVC filter on coumadin, COPD, meningioma, dementia, seizure disorder admitted for choledocholithiasis versus cholangitis transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and biliary sepsis.
# Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline CHF with OSH admission CXR demonstrating pulmonary edema.
In setting of receiving 4 units FFP, likely became volume overloaded leading to hypoxia.
In addition, new onset atrial fibrillation likely contributed to development of pulmonary edema.
Initial concern by hospitalist with regard to immune-mediated transfusion reaction, although this was felt to be unlikely from transfusion medicine.
# Biliary sepsis: Sepsis secondary to cholangitis given marked hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, and RUQ U/S consistent with CBD dilatation.
OSH blood cultures positive for GNR.
Despite antimicrobial coverage, she developed sepsis requiring max dose vasopressin, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine with continued hypotension unresponsive to IVF or albumin.
She became anuric and developed an elevated lactate to 10.
She underwent two unsuccessful ERCP procedures with identification of a pancreatic mass invading into the CBD.
# Goals of care: Despite aggressive medical and interventional therapy, the patient developed refractory severe sepsis.
