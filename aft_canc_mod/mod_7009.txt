CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 69-year-old gravida 5, para 4, with a 2-month history of abdominal girth increase and pelvic and back pain.
The patient had recently had a paracentesis which revealed an ovarian carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had multiple admissions for her extensive comorbidities, and in [**Month (only) **] the patient had been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma with peritoneal fluid tapped with paracentesis on the Medicine Service.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a bowel sounds creatinine of 1.5 to 2.2.
History of tachycardia/bradycardia syndrome, status post pacemaker.
Septic arthritis.
Periodic atrial tachycardia to 150, started on amiodarone in [**2109-9-2**].
History of ventricular tachycardia.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times two; status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times four; status post coronary artery bypass graft (3-vessel disease with only 1-vessel coronary artery bypass graft); status post Persantine sestamibi in [**2110-1-3**] with left ventricular ejection fraction of 36%; moderately fixed anterior wall and apex, severely fixed perfusion defect in the basilar portion of the anterior wall.
Congestive heart failure, status post transthoracic echocardiogram showing moderate left atrial enlargement, mild right atrial enlargement, left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
History of degenerative joint disease.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, distant first heart sound and second heart sound.
Chest examination revealed rhonchorous upper airway sounds bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft and distended, significant positive tenderness bilaterally and diffusely, with no bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Skin revealed a midline abdominal dressing was clean, dry, and intact.
A chest x-ray preoperatively showed cardiomegaly with no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, status post coronary artery bypass graft and pacemaker, with an ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient's blood pressures remained stable during her initial hospital stay; however, on postoperative day seven, the patient was noted to have a decrease in blood pressure.
The patient's blood pressure was stabilized with fluid boluses, but secondary to her increased abdominal girth and rebuilding of ascites, the patient was also diuresed with 5% albumin boluses.
The patient remained afebrile, but due to the concern of sepsis and her blood pressure dropping to 70s/30s to 40s, the patient was empirically started on Unasyn intravenously, and blood and urine cultures were drawn.
The working hypothesis was that the patient was possible very volume depleted and third-spacing versus septic.
On postoperative day eight, the patient started feeling nausea and vomiting and with her abdominal pain increasing and the issue of potential sepsis, the patient had the nasogastric tube replaced.
There was concern that this was ileus versus small-bowel obstruction.
A KUB was done, and there was no evidence of bowel obstruction and notable for a gallstone in the right upper quadrant.
The patient was maintained on Zofran, Prilosec, and Tigan for nausea and vomiting episodes.
There was concern throughout that the patient was developing an ileus event though maintained that she had flatus throughout her hospital stay.
RENAL:  The patient with a history of chronic renal insufficiency.
When the patient experienced her hypotensive episodes, the Foley was replaced and kept in place until her discharge.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was placed on a regular insulin sliding-scale for her insulin-dependent diabetes as the patient had minimal oral intake (NPH was not restarted).
The patient had been on Unasyn, but secondary to the findings and the fact that the patient had a white blood cell count of 11.7 (with neutrophils of 67, 20 bands, 5 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, and 0 eosinophils), the patient's antibiotics were switched from Unasyn to Zosyn and Flagyl.
The patient also had urine cultures that were positive for enterococci.
GYNECOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient's pathology was noted to be adenocarcinoma, papillary serous, consistent with ovarian primary.
The chemotherapy had coincided on the same day that the patient had her hypotensive episode, and the decision was made to postpone chemotherapy.
Papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary; stage IIIC, status post suboptimal debulking.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
History of tachycardia/bradycardia syndrome; status post pacemaker.
Septic arthritis.
Periodic atrial tachycardia.
History of ventricular tachycardia.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction; percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft; left ventricular ejection fraction of 36%.
Congestive heart failure.
Degenerative joint disease.
