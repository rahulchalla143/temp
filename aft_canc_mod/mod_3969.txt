He has a history of a left retro- orbital hemangioma and resolved issues of prematurity including: surfactant deficiency, apnea of prematurity, and anemia of prematurity.
At home, in the evening of discharge, he was noted to have some difficulty with feeding that resulted in cyanosis, that resolved with removal of the bottle.
