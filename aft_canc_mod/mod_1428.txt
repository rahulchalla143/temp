Admission Date:  [**2105-9-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-9-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-8-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Oncology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 34355**] is a 64 year old woman with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary source (gastrointestinal versus breast).
She reported increasing lethargy and ataxia for six to seven days prior to admission.
She denied trauma or falling.
She did complain of headache and blurry vision.
A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a large subdural hematoma on the left side with positive mass effect, with a midline shift.
They recommended conservative therapy given her decreased platelet count.
Her peripheral smear showed schistocytes, however, hematology/oncology felt that it was secondary to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and not secondary to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Neurosurgery believed that the hematoma would resolve as long as her platelet count remained above 100,000.
Given resolution of her neurologic deficits, she was transferred to the hematology/oncology clinic on [**2105-9-13**].
When examined, she felt fine this morning except for some slight back pain and mild epigastric pain.
She denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or fever.
She is currently on Xeloda for her metastatic cancer.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary to bone.
Peptic ulcer disease.
PPD positive.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Her sister died of lung cancer and tuberculosis.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, minor epigastric tenderness.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three, cranial nerves II through XII intact, finger-to-nose intact, no asterixis, no pronator drift.
Repeat head CT on [**2105-9-12**] showed that the hematoma was unchanged in size.
On [**2105-9-18**], the patient had a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head, which revealed that the size of the hematoma was again unchanged in size.
PROBLEM LIST: Metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary to bone.
Recurrent anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Peptic ulcer disease.
PPD positive.
