increased degree of osseous destruction  when compared to previous study....lit ic lesion involving 6th vertebral body.
Large lesion involving ninth T vertebral body and posterior elements on right.... diffuse metastatic lesion of the Thoracic spine, increased in degree of bone loss when compared to previous study  MRI [**2196-8-14**] Destructive mass lesions are identified within T4, T5, T9 and T10 vertebrae.As seem on prior exams, the T5 vertebral body is collapsed and there isposterior extension of the soft tissue mass, displacing the spinal cord.
The spinal cord does not demonstrate signal abnormality at any imaged level.
The T9 and T10 vertebral bodies are partially absent and there is a marked kyphotic deformity centered about these two vertebral bodies, present on prior studies.
The spinal canal is not well seen at the T9 and T10 levels due to artifact from the posterior spinal hardware but is likely significantly narrowed by tumor, with its effect on the spinal cord, difficult to assess.
No evidence of acute thoracic or lumbar fracture.
