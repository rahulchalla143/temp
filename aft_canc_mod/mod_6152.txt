Over the past few days prior to admission, the pt's wife notes that he had not been sleeping well at night due to increased urinary frequency.
On the morning prior to admission, the patient developed a severe headache, associated with nausea and several episodes of bilious vomiting.
Additionally, he had increasing confusion and agitation and so was taken to [**Hospital3 12748**].
In the ED there, head CT revealed hemorrhage of some of his brain mets with 2mm midline shift and mild hydrocephalus.
Of note, pt has had 2 recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] with nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dehydration.
Patient was agitated, but not talking or answering questions.
Repeat CT head was reviewed by neurosurgery and showed no change from OSH imaging, without hydrocephalus or risk for herniation.
Additionally, it was felt there was no significant change since his last imaging 2 months ago.
Metastatic melanoma: Onc hx adapted from recent onc clinic note by [**Doctor First Name **] [**Location (un) **]: Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] wide local excision and left parotid neck node dissection for a 6 mm thick melanoma of his left parietal scalp in [**2116-7-3**], with 3 of 27 nodes being positive.
He received adjuvant interferon, but had a soft tissue recurrence in the left neck a few months into therapy.
This was resected and interferon therapy was resumed post surgery until [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2117**], when he developed contralateral neck soft tissue recurrence treated with surgical resection and parotidectomy in [**2117-4-3**].
Pathology revealed 4 of 8 nodes positive, and a large lymph node measuring 1.7 cm in the parotid.
A PET CT scan in [**Month (only) 216**] of [**2117**] revealed lung nodules and a 3.3 cm left inguinal mass.
Repeat CT scan showed evidence of disease progression, particularly in the left inguinal area.
Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] surgical resection of a mass in his left groin area in [**2118-5-4**].
Ventriculostomy [**2118-6-23**] for occlusive hydrocephalus.
Degenerative joint disease in the L5 area 4.

Large nodule in the right mid lung unchanged since [**Month (only) 547**].
No appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Cannot exclude inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Consider acute pulmonary embolism.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-8-14**] sinus bradycardia has given way to sinus tachycardia and axis is now vertical.
HEAD CT [**2118-8-14**]: No new focus of hemorrhage.
Overall unchanged picture of hemorrhagic metastases.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Most likely multifactorial but primarily from leptomeningeal involvement and hemorrhagic brain metastases with contributions from over-sedation from home benzodiazepines, PNA and UTI.
On admission to the ICU patient was quite sedated and only minimally responsive.
During his hospitalization he also developed a left sided facial droop thought likely due to evolving brain metastases and leptomeningeal involvement.
METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH HEMORRHAGIC BRAIN METS: Known mets to scalp, neck, groin, brain s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mass resection and ventriculostomy for obstructive hydrocephalus.
Dexamethasone was continued for cerebral edema and all anticoagulation was held.
FEVERS/PNA/UTI: Fever and CXR on admission with consolidation at right base concerning for aspiration pneumonia, as well as WBCs in U/A.
No elevation of WBC.
Urine Cx grew out enterococcus which was sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin.
NAUSEA/VOMITING: Likely related to leptomeningeal involvement and metastatic impingement on fourth ventricle versus recent chemo.
No evidence of increased intracranial pressure on head CT but during stay patient did develop left sided facial droop.
Could be related to vertigo in setting of additional brain edema as in recent admission.
He also has had dizziness and lighthededness with standing and sitting up, and on previous admission patient had orthostatic hypotension.
