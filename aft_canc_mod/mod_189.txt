During his first evening in the PACU following surgery ([**10-12**]) the patient grew increasingly aggitated and hypervigilant.
At first he remained AOx3, he simply acted paranoid and repeated questions with poor attention.
CIWA protocol was begun and the patient was treated with numerous doses of Ativan, which lead to a gentle resolution of his initial aggitation.
His flap remained viable without complication.
It was felt that this delerium was a combination of alcohol withdrawal and post-op delerium.
The patient slowly began to return to a normal level of consciousness and required less and less ativan for control of his aggitation.
At no time were there any noted complications from his Flap or his skin graft.
