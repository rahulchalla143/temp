HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a very pleasant 80-year-old gentleman with recurrent colon cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, status post a previous colectomy for colon cancer.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
He also has a history of premature ventricular contractions.
History of coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction of 35% but a negative stress test in [**2131-3-30**].
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history is significant for no alcohol or tobacco.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Incidentally, review of systems was significant for no respiratory or cardiac complaints.
He also had no gastrointestinal complaints at this time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  His admission physical examination revealed a well-developed 80-year-old gentleman in no apparent distress.
He was afebrile with a heart rate of 60, blood pressure was 165/42, heart rate was 20, and an oxygen saturation of 99%.
The abdomen was soft with no masses.
His extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
The patient was hypertensive in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and required a Nipride drip.
He also had ST changes on his electrocardiogram requiring a rule out protocol for a myocardial infarction.
It should also be noted that Mr. [**Known lastname 95126**] has a history of coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction of 35% but a negative stress test in [**2131-1-30**].
His hospital course was significant for postoperative pneumonia.
He developed sepsis associated with that pneumonia and secondarily went on to develop acute renal failure.
The patient also developed worsening premature ventricular contractions during his hospitalization.
However, they did not significantly change his respiratory status.
In addition, due to his failure wean off the ventilator and to be able to become fully alert and oriented, it was felt that a feeding tube should also be placed.
The patient's acute renal failure did not improve after five days, and as his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine continued to rise, it was felt that he would require hemodialysis.
This was effective in reducing the amount of edema in the patient's extremities which he had required during his septicemia.
The patient's cardiac status was evaluated by the Cardiology team, and he was felt to have multiple premature ventricular contraction with a history of a primary first-degree AV block.
Electrocardiogram also revealed a right bundle-branch block.
However, the Cardiology Service felt that the patient would not benefit from any antiarrhythmic medications.
On postoperative day 28, after constant communication with the family during the previous four weeks of hospitalization, a discussion was held with regard to permanent access for hemodialysis given the patient's failure to resolve his acute renal failure.
It was at this time that the family decided to not have a permanent access placed.
The patient developed respiratory failure on postoperative day thirty after his ventilatory support had been turned off; again, at the request of the family.
Coronary artery disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
First-degree atrioventricular block.
Acute renal failure.
