She reports that she felt weak/wobbly/unsteady but that she didn't have any numbness or strange sensation in her legs.
She denies any urinary/bowel incontinence.
She endorses 24 hours of chest pain-sharp like someone kicking her in the chest, but not pleuritic, constant but waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] in intensity and she had this pain 20+ years ago.
She reports a worsening of her SOB x ~3 weeks.
In the ED she complained of CP for 24 h and shortness of breath.
Her CXR showed no significant change per radiology; she was guaiac negative; and EKG showed sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
Studies returned and CTA to r/out PE showed a large right sided breast mass with mets to bone/ribs a/w fractures.
RUQ U/S was also performed which showed a liver mass as well.
Code discussion was initiated by the resident and Attending regarding her new diagnosis of likely cancer and the patient said she does not want to be intubated.
Given that the patient is not CMO and it is unclear what is causing her respiratory distress she is being transferred to the ICU for monitoring and further workup.
No evidence of PE or PTX.

Bibasilar atelectasis and discoid atelectasis in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe are unchanged.
There are no enlarging pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Suboptimal study for evaluation of tracheobronchial malacia due to poor airway expansion in inspiratory phase.
Right hilar and axillary adenopathy with right breast mass with lytic osseous lesions, may indicate osseous metastases from possibly a breast malignancy.
A bone scan for further evaluation of extent of osseous metastases is recommended.
Multiple low-attenuation hepatic lesions, incompletely evaluated in the non-contrast setting and may represent metastatic lesions.
There is no definite evidence of lymphangitic tumor spread; however, the evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma and interstitium is limited due to hypoventilatory changes.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2096-10-9**], a small pericardial effusion is now evident.
IMPRESSION: small, consolidating pericardial effusion; no tamponade -------- Repeat Echo [**2104-6-17**] : No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion, unchanged; small, hyperdynamic left ventricle; no shunt seen CT Head [**6-10**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial mass, infarct, hemorrhage, mass effect or edema.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of mass, intracranial hemorrhage or infarct.
-------------- Abd X-ray:Limited demonstrating small or large bowel distention which could be secondary to ileus or partial small-bowel obstruction; if further evaluation needed, consider CT. ------------- Liver U/S: The entire study was significantly limited by patient body habitus.
The liver is heterogeneous, with a dominant mass in the right hepatic lobe, measuring approximately 6 cm.
There are additional hypoechoic masses in the hepatic hilum which measure up to 5.1 cm, which may represent massively enlarged lymph nodes or additional liver lesions.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Note:  Immunostains of the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, and mammoglobin, and negative for cytokeratin 20, supporting the diagnosis of metastases from a breast primary.
In these limited samples, the tumor has mixed ductal and lobular features.
--------- LENI: no DVT -----------   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU for management of altered mental status and hypoxemia.
# Breast CA: The patient was admitted with a fall and hypoxia.
However, a right breast mass and right rib lytic lesions were noted, concerning for breast cancer with bony metastasis.
These masses were biopsied and were consistent with breast cancer.
She was started on fentanyl for chest and right upper chest pain [**2-23**] metastasis) She was also started on Ibuprofen.
#Respiratory Distress: Initial work-up was notable for tracheo-bronchial malacia (TBM) but little other acute lung pathology.
Patient was treated for COPD flare with IV steroids, nebulizers.
CT of the chest demonstrated no e/o lymphangitic spread of tumor, significant effusions, or PE.
She had an echo showing a normal EF bu small effusion w/o tamponade physiology.
She had a repeat echo a week later showing an unchanged small effusion w/o tampondade.
Her CXR showed a question of mild pulmonary edema; however, it was difficult to evaluate given her body habitus.
It was thought that hypoventilation was a significant of her underlying lung disease.
She has severe sleep apnea and desaturates to 84%, retains CO2 and becomes nearly unarousable if she does not use CPAP.
# Altered Mental Status: The patient was somnolent in the ICU.
She was pan-cultured with no evidence of infection - neg UA, neg blood cultures.
It was found that everytime she did not use CPAP, that she became drowsy and even frankly unarousable.
It was determined that her narcotics were not related to her mental status as she barely required any PNR medication and as she was doing well on fentanyl.
Oxygen Oxygen via nasal cannula Titrate to 90-93%   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] senior life  Discharge Diagnosis: Breast Cancer Severe Sleep Apnea   Discharge Condition: improved, but still requiring O2 in the day and CPAP at night   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a fall.
You were found to have metastatic breast cancer and were started on chemotherapy.
You were also found to have low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide because of sleep apnea.
If you have fevers, chills, difficulty breathing or severe pain, you should return to the emergency room.
