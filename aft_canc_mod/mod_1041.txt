The patient was transferred from her [**Hospital **] HealthCare after having one day of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
On exam she was noted to have melanotic stool.
She is on chronic warfarin for Afib and h/o prior DVT with INR 1.8 today.
On exam now she c/o abdominal pain and states that she has the flu.
She is poor historian and unccoperative with exam   Past Medical History: h/o GIB [**11/2132**], [**2-/2133**], [**12/2133**], no c-scope/EGD Schizophrenia vs Schizoaffective Disorder Atrial fibrillatin h/o DVT Hypothyroidism bilat stage IV Sacral decubitus ulcer chronic indwelling foley c/b recurrent UTIs h/o MRSA UTI h/o VRE skin Hypertension h/o Hyponatremia   Social History: Lives at [**Location **] Health, in NH x18yrs, remote tob use, no EtOH/illicits.

Extremely large amount of stool is seen within the rectum and sigmoid, likely causing compression of the small bowel, with multiple dilated loops of small bowel and air-fluid levels seen.
The small bowel obstruction is likely secondary to this tremendous fecal load.
Large, expansile lesion seen within the spinal canal, extending from L1 to L4 levels.
Given its relatively rapid increase in size since [**2130**], findings are concerning for malignancy, and further evaluation is recommended.
Allowing for this, the peripherally enhancing mass centered within the spinal canal expands the spinal canal and destroys mainly the posterior elements of L2, L3, and L4.
A portion of this mass extends superiorly, filling the spinal canal and causing smooth remodeling and expansion of the spinal canal, posterior to L1.
There is no fracture or malalignment within the lumbar spine.
No significant degenerative changes are noted.
The surrounding soft tissues demonstrate dense atherosclerosis and a stool-filled rectum consistent with patient's known history of constipation.
Small cysts are seen in both kidneys.
Mild right- sided hydronephrosis is not excluded on this study.
IMPRESSION: Large intraspinal destructive mass centered at L3 as described above.
MR may help for further characterization.
No dilated small or large bowel loops.
However, there remains a large amount of retained fecal material in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon.
Abnormal foci of air in the bladder wall as described above.
Abnormal foci of air in the right upper thigh musculature laterally.
Destructive spinal canal mass as seen on recent CT's.
Brief Hospital Course: 60yoW with h/o schizophrenia admitted with melanotic stools, found to have lumbar mass, severe colonic fecal obstruction and resultant SBO.
Patient also with Stage IV Sacral Decubitus ulcer and urinary tract infection .
Lumbar Mass - suspicious for malignancy as there is a large interval increase from prior imaging in [**11/2132**] at which point dural ectasia was called @ L2.
Patient with increase in several tumor markers adding to suspicion that this mass is malignant.
Obstipation - patient with large colonic fecal obstruction.
Could be secondary to large lumbar mass that is abutting the spinal column at L1-L3.
She had a rectal tube placed that drained large amounts of liquid stool, and by the time of discharge she was still passing large quantities of stool, however, the caliber was such that it would not pass into the tube.
Given then findings on abdominal CT, no invasive GI imaging was obtained.
UTI: chronic indwelling foley catheter.
Of note, she was found to have air within the bladder wall, which is thought to be due to her ongoing urinary tract infection.
She was seen by Plastics who reported that she was not a surgical candidate given her lack of optimal nutrition and also there was presence of necrotic tissue along the edges of the wounds.
As she remained afebrile and without a leuckocytosis, it was not thought that this was an urgent surgical need.
SBO - Patient admitted with SBO secondary to large fecal load.
Patient had an agressive bowel regimen and follow-up scans revealed no active SBO.
# FEN:  Has chronic nutritional problems as evidenced by her weight, low albumin, non-healing ulcers.
Disp:*20 ML(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Obstipation, Destructive Lumbar Mass, Infected Stage IV Decubitus Ulcerations, Polymicrobial Urinary Tract Infection .
Secondary Diagnoses: h/o GIB [**11/2132**], [**2-/2133**], [**12/2133**], no c-scope/EGD Schizophrenia vs Schizoaffective Disorder Atrial fibrillatin h/o DVT Hypothyroidism bilat stage IV Sacral decubitus ulcer chronic indwelling foley c/b recurrent UTIs h/o MRSA UTI h/o VRE skin Hypertension h/o Hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, stable vital signs, tolerating POs, nonambulatory.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with melanotic stools, and found to be obstipated, and had an incidental finding of large L1-L4 Lumbar mass.
You also have large Stage IV bilateral decubitus ulcerations that were managed with dressing changes and antibiotics.
