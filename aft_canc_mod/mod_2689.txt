There is moderately severe cardiomegaly.
Atelectasis at the left base and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are unchanged.
There is an equivocal tiny left apical pneumothorax - lucency at the left lung apex more likely represents normal paucity of vessels.
There is minimal upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
No right-sided infiltrate or gross effusion is identified.
There may be slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
Two small nodular densities are noted in the right lung, one adjacent to the right third anterior rib and the other overlying the point of intersection of the right fourth anterior rib and right sixth posterior rib, near the lateral chest wall.
These are unchanged compared with [**2189-4-2**] and may represent small noncalcified granulomas.
IMPRESSION: 1) Interval removal of the left chest tube.
I doubt, but cannot entirely exclude a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
2) Elevated left hemidiaphragm, possible small left effusion, and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation are unchanged.
3) Two tiny nodular densities in the right mid zone, which appear unchanged compared with [**2189-4-2**].
Left upper extremity swelling.
TECHNIQUE: Right upper extremity DVT study.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
There is evidence of soft tissue swelling.
