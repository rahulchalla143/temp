He also had SOB during the admission, worse with lying down, with a known R pleural effusion.

38 x 41 mm left upper lobe solid mass (2:17) compatible with known germ cell tumor.
28 x 35 mm hilar mass (2:25) compresses a left lower lobe bronchiole traversing through.
Ground glass opacities with intersitial markings in a "crazy paving" pattern in the upper zones (2:21) may reflect an inflammatory or infectious process, or lymphangenic spread of tumor.
