Pancreatic mass.
Subcapsular hepatic hematoma.
An ERCP was attempted at the outside hospital which was unsuccessful so the patient's primary care physician transferred him to [**Hospital6 1760**] where he underwent a second ERCP which was also unsuccessful due to blood and coffee grounds in the stomach and oozing at the major papilla and edema.
He denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He has an occasional beer or glass of wine.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His maternal grandmother died of pancreatic cancer in her 60s.
His mother died of lung cancer in her 70s.
HEENT:  The patient had scleral icterus.
It was nondistended, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
No rebound or guarding.
He did have petechiae secondary to itching.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2161-8-18**] to the hospital service upon which time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] was consulted for history of mass in the head of the pancreas seen on outside hospital CT scan.
On admission, the patient received a CT angiogram to demonstrate the nature of his pancreatic mass.
Upon receiving the images, it was discovered that the patient had a large subcapsular hematoma of the liver along with a liver laceration and active extravasation of contrast during the MRI.
Subsequently, the angiography showed no signs of hepatic arterial injury.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted on [**2161-8-21**] and recommended further determination of the need for radiotherapy or chemotherapy to be done after the time of surgery.
He remained stable and no other events occurred in the SICU.
On [**2161-8-26**], the patient complained of left knee pain beneath the patella so he was sent for bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds which served to rule out a DVT.
He also received plain films of the left knee which showed mild arthritic changes.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient had an ERCP done on [**2161-8-18**] which showed a moderate amount of blood and coffee grounds in the stomach and active oozing at the major papilla with unsuccessful attempts at cannulation of the biliary duct.
Common bile duct brushing taken on [**2161-8-19**] showed rare atypical single cells.
A CTA of the abdomen on [**2161-8-19**] showed a 3.5 by 3.9 cm pancreatic mass producing obstruction of the common bile duct and intrahepatic bile ducts.
No adjacent vascular involvement, local grade 1.
It also showed a 2.6 by 5 cm lesion in the caudate lobe of the liver suggestive of either metastases versus hemangioma.
The patient received an MRI of the abdomen on [**2161-8-20**] which showed the caudate lobe lesion to be consistent with hemangioma.
This also showed the known pancreatic mass as well as a large subcapsular hematoma with active bleeding.
Angiography on [**2161-8-20**] showed no subhepatic arterial injury.
The patient received another CT of the abdomen on [**2161-8-25**] which showed a large subcapsular right lobe hepatic hematoma with extension into the liver parenchyma.
There also was some compression of the right portal vein due to mass affect from the intraparenchymal hematoma.
The intrahepatic ductal dilatation resolved.
There was a development of a large right-sided pleural effusion inconsistent with simple pleural effusion.
Films of the left knee on [**2161-8-26**] showed mild degenerative changes.
No other pathology was seen.
An ultrasound of the bilateral lower extremity veins showed no evidence of DVT.
Pertinent laboratories during this admission include hematocrit on admission of 40.5, subsequent drop in hematocrit, as mentioned in the hospital course, and hematocrit on [**2161-8-25**] of 30.5.
DISCHARGE STATUS: To home with services for change of his biliary drain.
Pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas.
Subcapsular liver hematoma.
He is to go for CT angiogram on [**2161-9-14**] at 10:15 before he visits Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] and will follow the visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] with his preoperative visit with Anesthesia and for preoperative laboratories.
