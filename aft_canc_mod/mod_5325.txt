He also noted discomfort in his left eye which had been bothering him for 1 month.
CT scan revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a disseminated infection.
[**2169-8-17**]: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin complicated by persistent fevers and extensive workup ultimately revealing disseminated tuberculosis infection.
His course was also complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension and the development of a severe cardiomyopathy.
S/P one dose of high-dose ARA-C at 1.5 mg per meter squared, lowered dose due to his disseminated tuberculosis, and then he received a second course of HiDAC at 3 gram per meter squared dose and developed acute onset of gait instability.
Noted for pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for aspergillus and empirically treated with Voriconazole with improvement noted on CT. 5.
Allo course c/b increased LFTs of unclear etiology, possibly from chemotherapy, renal failure attributed to CSA, and received only 1 dose of MTX due to mucositis.
Post transplant course complicated by asymptomatic CMV viremia and viral/URI syndromes.
In [**2171-5-12**] developed diarrhea with e/o GVH on endoscopy.
He also had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus.
Therapy attempted for GVH of liver using pulse of prednisone and increase in CellCept with stabilization but no significant improvement.

There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is only trivial pericardial effusion.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
* CXR [**12-4**]: Marked short interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could  represent pericardial effusion or myocarditis.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] is a 54-yo M h/o AML, 11 months s/p allo SCT, h/o disseminated TB, who presented with pericardial effusion, which was drained.

He experienced no dyspnea, no chest pain by discharge.
The possible etiologies included post-viral pericardial effusion, GVHD, or TB reactivation.

The marrow showed no sign of active leukemia.
