Admission Date:  [**2115-5-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-3-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L thoracentesis x2  History of Present Illness: 53 y/o F h/o HIV (no HAART [**4-6**] CD4 490, VL > 100K), Stage IV NSCLC presented to the ED with SOB x10 days with progressive DOE, orthopnea and cough productive of occasional sputum.
In the ED patient had CXR and CTA that demonstrated no PE, but significant progression of disease with enlarging r-hilar mass extending to the subcarinal area with lymphadenopathy and metastases.
Small pericardial effusion.
On floor patient remained hypoxic with persistent O2 requirement of 3L.
Had transient episodes of desaturation without clear explanation.
Team felt pleural effusion likely contributing to hypoxia.
That afternoon patient became increasingly hypoxic with desat to 86%, tach to 120-130s.
Past Medical History: POncH # Stage IV NSCLC (dx [**2114-12-5**]) - s/p pigtail drainage [**3-2**] malignant pericardial effusion - s/p carboplatin, gemcitabine x 4 cycles (last in [**2115-3-5**]) c/b neutropenia, thrombocytopenia .
PMH # HIV ([**2115-3-20**]: CD4 471, VL >100,000) - No HAART - No h/o OI # Asthma # Anemia # Depression   Social History: # Personal: Lives with boyfriend # Tobacco: No current.
Gen: NAD HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM CV: RRR, S1/S2, no m/r/g.
CHEST: Significantly decreased breath sounds at L fields; mild crackles at right; globally diminished.
Abd: Soft, NTND, BS+, no HSM.
Extensive progression of disease with now large left pleural effusion, enlarging right hilar mass extending to the subcarinal region with associated lymphadenopathy and innumerable pulmonary metastases.
Small pericardial effusion.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-5-20**] 9:02 PM New large left pleural effusion, and associated left lower lobe opacity which may represent atelectasis versus underlying consolidation.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-21**] 10:55 AM Status post thoracocentesis with decrease in left pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
Scattered subcentimeter enhancing lesions predominantly at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter junction are worrisome for infection/toxoplasmosis versus metastatic disease and clinical correlation is advised.
Marrow signal from the cervical spine is unusual with loss of normal signal on T1, this is a nonspecific finding and may represent skeletal metastases and a bone scan would be helpful for further evaluation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small loculated pericardial effusion around the right atrium.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Small pericardial effusion around right atrium (largest diameter 1.0 cm) .
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-4-10**], the pericardial effusion around the right atrium is better seen.
# PLEURAL FLUID [**2115-5-21**]: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC).
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-22**] 8:53 AM: Interval reaccumulation of left pleural effusion.
# BONE SCAN  [**2115-5-22**]: No evidence of osseous metastases; bladder uptake obscurs the central pelvis.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-24**] 11:38 AM Large left pleural effusion has increased since [**5-22**], producing more rightward mediastinal shift, secondary atelectasis in both the left lower lung and the central right lung.
No pneumothorax.
Cardiac silhouette is obscured but there has been a slight increase in caliber of mediastinal veins suggesting elevated central venous pressure.
Multiple lung nodules are largely obscured by atelectasis and effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Further interval increase in size of left-sided pleural effusion.
Large right hilar mass extending into the subcarinal region and associated lymphadenopathy and innumerable pulmonary metastases.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-5-26**] 7:33 AM: Increasing left effusion with mediastinal shift.
No pneumothorax.
#LE USD: [**2115-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT.
#TTE [**2115-5-28**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate pericardial effusion anterior and posterior to the atria but very small anterior to the RV.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-5-21**], the amount of pericardial effusion has increased.
The is no clear echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
#KUB [**2115-6-26**]: IMPRESSIONS: No intra-abdominal free air.
No evidence of obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 53F h/o HIV (no HAART, [**4-6**] CD4 490, VL > 100K), Stage IV NSCLC, with L pleural effusion per CT. .
# SOB: Thought secondary to progression of her underlying disease and recurrent pleural effusions.
Hypoxia post-pleurodesis thought [**3-2**] to disease progression vs. adverse reaction to talc used on pleurodesis.
Patient was increasingly tachypneic without relief after bronchodilators or lasix.
# Brain mets: New brain mets per MRI head with gad.
- [**5-24**]: No evidence of osseous metastases; bladder uptake obscurs the central pelvis.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis # Stage IV NSCLC (dx [**2114-12-5**]) .
Secondary diagnosis # HIV # Asthma # Depression   Discharge Condition: Deceased  Discharge Instructions: None.
