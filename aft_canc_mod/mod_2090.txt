On evening of [**2134-9-5**] patient had two episodes of "shaking and gurgling," coherent but slurred speech and right mouth droop witnessed by his wife and a third witness by EMS where he received 2mg ativan with resolution of shaking.
CT head negative, LP performed and pt started on CTX and Vanco for meningitis prophylaxis.
His [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course was notable for: Neruologic issues relating to possible seziure acitivty for which he recieved an LP, started on CTX/vanc.
for broad spectrum meningitis coverage; EEG perfomred, overall not clear what this neurologic process was (stroke vs. seizures vs. infection); also treated for arachnoiditis with dexamethasone.
Pt also with F and N, prior micro grew GNR in [**12-29**] bottle during last admission with Stenatropamonas, being treated with bactrim IV tid.
On transfer, patient reports no fever or chills, headache, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomitting.
CAD s/p CABG in 82, stent - lmca-prox lcx (patent [**8-27**]), last stress [**2130**] nl w/o perfusion defects, was on ASA and Plavix until chemo due to low plt.
CHF - 67% EF, mild-mod MR, thickened aortic, but no stenosis or insufficiency on echo in [**2130**] 3.
Spinal Stenosis 6.
BPH, with known elevated PSA but nl biopsies, followed by urology 8.
Hypercholesterolemia  9.
Onc hx: Diagnosis  - late [**2134-7-26**], diffuse adenopathy (axilla,chest, abd) Bx - MIB fraction 100%, cytogenetics amp c-myc, no translocation Tx - hyper-CVAD on [**2134-8-19**], complicated by rapid ventricular response atrial fibrillation & hypotension (ICU few days) -> started amiodarone & metoprolol rate control.
His routine healthcare maintenance is significant for colonoscopies and endoscopy without findings of malignancy.
Physical Exam: VS afebrile 136/71 63 16 94%RA Gen - Alert, no acute distress HEENT - PERRL, extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous membranes moist Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV - Normal S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abd - Soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds Back - No costovertebral angle tendernes Extr - No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally  Neuro - Alert and oriented x 3, cranial nerves [**2-6**] intact, no focal deficits, motor and sensory grossly intact in UE and LE's.
Studies: [**9-6**] CXR-- Patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac area, likely due to atelectasis.
No pleural effusions.
[**9-6**] CT HEAD-- no IC bleed .
No focal abnormal areas and a increased FDG uptake.
Lytic lesions within the right ilium and superior aspect of the left  acetabulum as described above.
These are of uncertain etiology or significance, but not do not demonstrate any significant FDG uptake.
Tiny calcifications which may be present in the right iliac lesion may be related to a focus of treated lymphoma.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Bibasilar pulmonary scarring with somewhat more consolidative changes at the right lung base.
Marked coronary calcifications  Brief Hospital Course: 73 y.o male with Burkitt's lymphoma presents with new seizures after recent intrathecal [**Hospital 3454**] transferred to OMED/BMT B service to initiation of CODOX chemotherapy [**9-7**].
Plan: ## Neuro: Patient's seizure was likely secondary to intrathecal chemo causing irritation of epileptogenic foci from a prior R MCA stroke, arachnoiditis from chemo, infection or stroke.
A MRI/MRA was performed to evaluate for new stroke and carotids for evidence of source.
MRA did show moderately significant carotid stenosis bilaterally that will require resumption of Plavix once patient completes chemotherapy.
Head CT was negative for new bleed or mass.
Patient was started on ceftriazone, vancomycin and acyclovir for possible infectious meningitis.
For possible arachnoiditis secondary to intrathecal ara-C, patient was continued on dexamthasone and then gradually tapered.
From the time of transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the discharge day, patient was seizure free and complained only of improving symptoms of left hand weakness (thought to be post-ictal re-expression of stroke symptoms per neurology) and lightheadedness (orthostatics within normal limits).
CSF on [**2134-9-3**] was negative for malignancy.
PET-CT shows no additional areas of abnormal FDG uptake.
PETCT also shows lytic lesions within R illium and L acetabulum (previously known).
Patient tolerated chemo very well.
Since he was febrile and neutropenic on admission, the patient was treated for IV bactrim for a 14 day course which he completed a day after discharge.
Pt was continued on these medications until [**8-29**] when he was admitted for bradycardia.
Patient's bradycardia improved.
Patient has an extensive cardiac history including CABG in the 80's and more recent stent placement for unstable angina.
Pt was on plavix prior to chemo which was discontinued due to low platelets.
Aspirin was resumed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] however subsequently discontinued for portacath placement and in anticipation of low platelets secondary to chemotherapy.
Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and took PO lasix as needed for pedal edema.
Pt usually on new Strateva which is non-formulary so usually placed back on this regimen as an inpatient.
## BPH:   A foley was placed during the chemotherapy course since patient was having some difficulty using urinal and voiding secondary to post-ictal left hand weakness.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for constipation.
