Admission Date:  [**2188-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-7-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-6-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: "groggyness," confusion, and HA s/p gemzar infusion 1 day prior  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness:   The patinet is a 44 y/o male w/ hx of metastatic renal cell cancer currently Sutent and Gemzar C5D9 who presenting to clinic after D8 Gemzar w/ fatigue, headache, and confusion.
He then awoke at 9am confused with word finding difficulties.
His wife noticed he was confused as if "half awake, half asleep, as if he was in the middle of a dream."
He is denying any worsening or change in quality of the headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, vision changes, weakness, or recent falls.
No chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena, or brbpr.
No bloot noted in urine, no worsening of baseline edema.
Past Medical History:  Presented with low grade fevers, night sweats, and microscopic hematuria.
CT scan on [**2187-10-30**] which revealed a large L renal mass measuring 9.7 x 8.7 x 12 cm.
They also noted enlarged lymph nodes and very small bilateral pulmonary nodules reported as probable metastatic lesions.
He was started on the dendritic cell fusion vaccine on [**2-6**] but had a poor response.
No other history of gastrointestinal diseases.
Appears chronically ill. HEENT: anicteric, OP clear, moist MM NECK: supple without cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, lympadenopathy CV: reg rate, S1,S2, no MRG PULM: CTAB ABD:soft, non-tender, nondistended, No HSM EXT: 2+ pitting edema to mid-thigh Skin: pale, follicular eruption on face Neuro: Cranial nerves II-XII intact, No abnml in coordination, gait, fine motor activity, or strength.
Multiple areas of FLAIR hyperintensity in bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital white matter, predominantly in the frontal and parietal lobes, with some restricted diffusion; no mass effect or enhancement.
This could most likely represent changes associated with reversible leukoencephalopathy or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
Superimposed ischemic or infarction changes can be present given the restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted sequences.
[**2188-7-16**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Bilateral white matter hypodense areas in parietal and occipital, and in left frontal white matter.
These may represent associated metastatic lesions versus other white matter changes like reversible leukoencephalopathy.
There is no significant interval change from prior exam.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, mass effect, or large vascular territory infarction.
Again seen are hypodense areas in the left frontal, bilateral parietal, and bilateral occipital white matter.
[**2188-7-18**] Neurophysiology EEG This is an abnormal portable EEG due to intermittent right frontocentral slowing as well as intermittent generalized slowing in the setting of a slow and disorganized background.
The first finding  suggests an area of subcortical dysfunction in the right frontocentral region.
The other is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy, suggestive of diffuse or deeper midline dysfunction.
There were no clearly epileptiform features noted however.
PORT Examination was markedly limited due to patient's altered mental status.
The right kidney measures 11.7 cm, and was grossly normal in son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance, without evidence of large solid mass, stone, or hydronephrosis.
[**2188-7-21**] Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Confluent symmetric foci of T2 prolongation in the posterior brain, predominantly in the posterior brain white matter, including the posterior aspects of the frontal lobe and much of the parietal and occipital lobes, and another focus in the left frontal periventricular white matter, are unchanged.
There is no enhancement or mass effect associated with these lesions.
There is slight restricted diffusion noted, corresponding to the areas, however, not significantly changed since last examination.
No hemorrhage, edema, or infarction are identified.
No abnormal enhancement after contrast administration is seen.
Mild mucosal thickening of the left maxillary, right frontal, and scattered ethmoid air cells are seen.
IMPRESSION: Multiple areas of FLAIR and T2 prolongation in a pattern similar to the [**2188-7-16**] examination, most likely representing posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy, without significant change.
[**2188-7-18**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) A left retrocardiac opacity could represent early pneumonia.
Recommend correlation with dedicated PA and lateral films.
There are no pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Possible early pneumonia in retrocardiac region.
[**2188-7-21**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
The left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation markedly increased in the meantime interval and might represent combination of atelectasis and pneumonia.
Small left pleural effusion is noted.
IMPRESSION: Rapid development of left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation consistent with atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
Flat T waves in lead aVL.
No diagnostic abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-5-20**] no significant change.
Since previous tracing of the same date, probably no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: #) Mental status changes: At the time of admission the patient had a significant improvement of mentation compared to morning of presentation, and belief was that was neither narcotic induced confusion or secondary to metabolic derangments.
Over the course of the second day of admission, the patient showed a worsening level of mentation throughout the day, with progressive deterioration such that the patient displayed deficts with each portion of mini-mental exam.
MRI hyperintense lesions of FLAIR c/w leukoencephalopathy w/ areas of questionable stroke.
Neurology was consulted, who gave diagnosis of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy, most likely secondary to patient's hypertension (sbp of 160s) vs. chemotherapy induced.
Given findings of CT/MRI, past sutent use with known side effects, cause is likely reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy from Sutent toxicity.
Their recommendations were for tight blood pressure control.
Throughout the night, the patient showed worsened mentation and a questionable seizure.
EEG results showing moderate encephalopathy suggestive of subcortical dysfunction.
Over the first few days in the ICU the patient had waxing [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, was intermittently extremely agitated, requiring 1:1 sitter, 4-point restraints and increasing doses of zyprexa.
MRI [**7-21**] showed no significant change per official read (possible improvement per Neuro).
On the floor was switched to dilt, and was titrating up w/ decrease of sbp to 140s, but pt unable to tolerate PO medication [**1-4**] to difficulty swallowing.
Patient was discharged on metoprolol 25mg TID, and as sutent clears system, intention to titrate down as tolerated if BP decreases.
The patient had serial EKGs with no abnormalities.
Pt shows worsened renal fxn based off Cr at 2.3, which has been trending upwards for the last month.
Non-gap metabolic acidosis with urine lytes consistent with type I or IV RTA, likely secondary to ARF.
No clear insult, though may be related to medication/chemo, worsening malignancy, or possibly related to hypertension (which could explain improvement with better BP control).
Obstructive cause ruled out by renal US, cortisol normal making mets to adenals less likely cause.
No recent antibiotics and no urine eos to suggest interstitial nephritis.
FeUrea 52%, non-suggestive of prerenal etiology.
# Leukocytosis/pancytopenia: On the floor, WBC was trending upwards in setting of recent Neulasta, now trending down.
No current signs of infection, though CXR with possible retrocardiac opacity.
Likely related to inflammation and malignancy or secondary to chemo per onc.
No signs of active bleeding.
Past US without liver pathology or thrombosis.
Glucosuria: Glucosuria on U/A, and elevated serum values recently, fasting glucose in 80s.
Disp:*45 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Posterior Leukoencehalopathy Hytertensive emergency Acute Renaly Failure   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions:   You are being discharged from the hospital after admission for change in mental status.
MRI was consistent with a condition known as posterior leukoencephalopathy, which is most likely caused by the sutent chemotherapy.
You were also found to be hypertensive, which also can be a cause of this neurologic condition.
You were also noted to have electolyte abnormalities and evidence of acute renal failure on admission.
If you develop severe headache, nasua/vomiting, increased confusion, dizziness call your doctor.
