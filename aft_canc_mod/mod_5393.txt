Admission Date: [**2114-2-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2114-3-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-4-12**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 66801**] is a 37-year- old female with metastatic melanoma admitted to begin cycle 2, week 2, high-dose IL-2 therapy.
Her oncologic history began in [**2103**] when she had a right ankle melanoma resected.
She underwent right inguinal lymph node dissection in [**2113-3-20**] with 1 lymph node replaced with melanoma and evidence of extracapsular extension.
Staging revealed multiple breast lesions, an enlarged left axillary lymph node and multiple osseous metastases with impending compression fracture in L1.
Follow-up CT scan showed disease regression.
She began cycle 2, week 1, high-dose IL-2 on [**2114-2-12**], tolerating 12 of 14 doses with 2 doses held related to mild neurotoxicity.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies, but Percocet causes dizziness.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL: Well-appearing female in no acute distress.
LYMPH NODES: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral axillary or left inguinal lymphadenopathy.
ABDOMEN: Flat, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace right lower extremity edema and no edema left.
SKIN:  Right ankle wide local excision scar without nodularity or hyperpigmentation, dry desquamation present over hands and feet.
During this week, she received 3 of 14 doses with IL-2 discontinued after dose #3  due to profound hypotension.
Chest x-ray was checked and lungs were clear to rule out pneumonia.
With volume repletion, her dopamine was weaned and her Neo-Synephrine was weaned over the next 24 hours.
Given her profound shock and hypotension after 3 doses of IL- 2 attributed to capillary leak syndrome, we opted not to rechallenge her with interleukin-2 during this week.
Other side effects noted this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy.
She was anemic and transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells during this admission.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 2, week 2, high-dose IL-2 complicated by shock and hypotension related to IL-2 capillary leak.
