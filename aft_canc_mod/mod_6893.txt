This was complicated by a bile duct injury and she required an immediate operative repair in the setting of bile peritonitis.
A hepaticojejunostomy was performed due to a high bile duct injury.
I personally reviewed the operative note which was sent to me from the original surgeon from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] and realized that there was a single anastomosis created with 4-0 silk sutures on the bile duct.
Recently the patient has presented with a right upper quadrant pain.
This was worked up and it was found that she had right-sided ductal dilation.
Subsequent to this she developed a full rip roaring cholangitis, and it was in the setting of this that she was referred to me for further care.
Furthermore, it was clear from the CTA that there was no evidence of a right hepatic artery in play, and I surmised that this was injured at the original operative endeavor 17 years ago.
