Admission Date:  [**2201-1-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-5-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: extubation  History of Present Illness: Time of Code: 3:34pm Neurology Resident present: 3:35pm Last normal at ~ 11.30am Patient intubated and sedated on arrival NIHSS score of 19.
Extinction and Neglect: 0  HPI: The pt is an 72 year-old man with CAD (s/p CABG, AVR), HTN, HL, SCLC metastatic to adrenals and brain (s/p WBXRT and chemo), CVA (found on MRI on Cancer f/u [left upper convexity middle cortical infarct]) who now presents with multiple seizures this AM while in the car with wife (1st as head shaking and arm shaking, last normal at 11.30am), then two more between EMS and OSH, where he was intubated for unresponsiveness and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respirations.
CT head was notable for a large L temporal lobe hypodensity concerning for a CVA and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
afib at OSH, but no EKG is available for review.
Was in USOH until 11.30am when driving, noted to have head shaking movement and stiffening of his arms.
Upon arrival, apparently patient was confused and was trying to answer questions.
Was noted to have bleeding from mouth.
Reportedly, while in EMS [**Doctor Last Name **], he seized again, unclear whether received AEDs, and was intubated for concern of irregular breathing pattern and difficulty maintaining airway.
He had an incidental finding of a ?
cortical stroke on last MRI [**2200-10-13**] at [**Hospital3 **] notable for with microvascular disease, small infarct at left upper convexity middle cortical infarct (?
Past Medical History: - Stage IV SCLC, mets to brain (multiple lesions s/p XRT [**6-5**] - [**7-6**]) and adrenals, completed chemo [**12-3**] (carboplatin, VP16[etoposide]) - CAD, s/p CABG, AVR [**2197**] - HTN - HL - ?
CVA as above - GERD - COPD - AS - Basal cell cancer - Right parotidectomy ([**Last Name (un) 86828**] tumor)  Social History: Social Hx: Retired, lives with wife, currently staying at a house in ME where he is recovering from chemo and XRT.
HEENT: NC/AT, supple, no bruits.
Extremities: warm, dry, b/l LE edema, 1+  Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No evidence of cerebral ischemia on CT perfusion study.
Vasogenic edema in the left temporal lobe, insula, and external capsule.
Intracranial metastatic disease is much better assessed on the concurrent head MRI.
No hemodynamically significant stenoses in the intracranial circulation.
Spiculated mass at the right lung apex.
Multiple intracranial metastases, many of which could be either superficial cortical or leptomeningeal.
Small left subdural collection.
No evidence of an acute infarction  CXR  MPRESSION: 1.
Layering left pleural effusion with retrocardiac density, possibly representing atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 72 year-old man with CAD (s/p CABG, AVR), HTN, HL, SCLC metastatic to adrenals and brain (s/p WBXRT and chemo), CVA (found on MRI on Cancer f/u [left upper convexity middle cortical infarct]) who now presented with multiple seizures this AM while in the car with wife (1st as head shaking and arm shaking, last normal at 11.30am), then two more between EMS and OSH, where he was intubated for unresponsiveness and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respirations.
CT head was notable for a large L temporal lobe hypodensity concerning for a CVA and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Exam w/ 10mins off was propofol notable for being comatose, intact pupillary, corneal, VOR and gag reflexes, spontanous UE movements R < L, non-localizing to pain at supraorbital notch, flx response to nox in UEs and LEs.
Repeat HCT and CTA showing a persistent hypodensity in the left subcortial white matter in region of left temporal and parietal lobes (MCA territory) and extensive plaque at bilateral carotid bulbs, but no sigificant hemodynamic stenosis.
Given history of afib, it initially appeared unclear whether CT findings were consistent with an embolic infarction versus the more likely metastatic disease leading to seizure.
Once CTP images were available, it was notable that there was no perfusion deficit and majority of edema was vasogenic.
MRI of the brain revealed multiple metastatic lesions intraparenchymally as well as leptomenigial.
