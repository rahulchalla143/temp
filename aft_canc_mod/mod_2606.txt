Admission Date:  [**2187-12-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2187-12-19**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old male who is being sent her for management of metastatic melanoma.
He is a 46-year-old man who was initially in the [**Hospital 29684**] Clinic at the [**Hospital1 18**] Department of Oncology regarding metastatic melanoma with mets to the brain who is status post craniotomy as well as gamma knife radiosurgery.
He went to his dermatologist who performed a biopsy and amelanotic melanoma at site of vaccination on his right shoulder was found.
A local wide excision and sentinel node biopsy was performed and a lymphoscintigraphy was performed on the morning of surgery which revealed no uptake in the nodal areas other than the right axilla.
The patient did well and had no symptoms until [**2187-8-17**] when he began to develop memory lapses.
His primary care physician recommended [**Name Initial (PRE) **] head CT and MRI of the head which was performed on [**2187-9-14**] which was an MRA and revealed a 2.8 by 2.8 by 3 cm left frontal hemorrhagic mass with a large vasogenic edemic area.
A CT scan of the brain the next day confirmed a hemorrhagic mass in the left frontal region measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.
Chest CT was performed on [**2187-9-25**] which revealed suspicious nodules on the right lung, one measuring about 1 cm in diameter, the other 8 mm.
He was discharged to [**Hospital **]Hospital on [**2187-9-27**] on Decadron and Dilantin and currently has had no seizures.
A few days prior to admission, the patient's wife states that he has had significant decline with increasing abdominal pain, low-grade fevers, and generalized body pruritus.
The MRI was done the next day and was inconclusive for recurrence versus post gamma knife changes.
A few days later, he started to develop shortness of breath, intermittent periods of confusion, generalized pain and restlessness.
He was taken on [**2187-12-11**] to [**State **]Hospital where a spiral CT was performed to rule out pulmonary embolus.
On the day of admission, shortly after waking up at 5:00 a.m., he had sharp stabbing pain which seemed to originate in his abdomen and spread upwards to his chest and neck.
The patient has also noticed multiple subcutaneous lesions that have appeared over the last week and seem to be increasing in size and number every day.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient worked as an owner of a company which sells and repairs stretchers mostly of clinics or hospitals.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No melanoma or skin cancer.
Mother had a history of hypertension, thought to have recent brain aneurysm, currently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 **].
Maternal grandmother with stomach cancer and another relative on the patient's mother's side had breast cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient is a well-appearing 45-year-old male in no acute distress.
There was no scleral icterus.
No lesions or exudates were noted.
Neck:  Supple with lymphadenopathy palpated in the left cervical area.
Heart:  Regular rhythm with no murmurs, clicks, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Good bowel sounds, soft, nondistended, tender to palpation in the lower quadrants bilaterally but primarily the left lower quadrant.
Scalp and back have subcutaneous nodules that are palpated.
Given a drop of systemic progression, this was felt to be an appropriate approach.
Initially during his hospitalization, however, and while getting chemotherapy, the patient developed temperature spikes and chest radiograph was consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia.
Otherwise, the patient had an episode of chest pain as well as desaturation down to the 80s on room air and placement of 100% face mask with overnight transfer to the unit for cardiopulmonary decompensation.
The patient had a CTA of the chest which revealed the following:  Pulmonary-no intraluminal filling defects and heart great vessels were unremarkable.
A large anterior mediastinal mass is present which measures 6.2 by 3.7 cm.
Second mediastinal mass was adjacent to the aortic arch and measured 1.6 by 1.4 cm and small pericardial effusion was noted.
There are bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions and posterior dependent atelectasis.
Focal area of consolidation is present in the right lower lobe.
A nonspecific finding.
Differential considerations include congenital versus traumatic versus neoplastic.
No pulmonary embolism was found.
Additionally, during his hospitalization, the patient's mental status worsened and the patient had evidence of facial droop.
An MR of the head was performed and revealed the following:  Status post left frontal craniotomy, an irregular peripherally enhancing mass extending from craniotomy into the left frontal white matter and the superior aspect of the left basal ganglia including caudate nucleus.
There is thick irregular dural enhancement contiguous with the 5 by 5 by 4.5 cm mass.
There is extensive surrounding edema involving more than anterior half of the centrum semi ovale and extending inferiorly into the left internal and external capsules, the left thalamus and left midbrain as well.
The mass probably represents recurrent tumor given dural enhancement.
There are additional less than 1 cm enhancing lesions consistent with metastatic disease.
There is a 5 mm lesion in the anterior medial right frontal lobe with the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter junction, an punctate lesion in the right frontal operculum, 2-3 mm lesion in the right temporal lobe, and a 7 mm lesion in the right aspect of the medulla.
He completed his course of chemotherapy which he tolerated without further incidence.
It should be noted that upon read of the MRI, the patient was initially started on Mannitol given that he did have evidence of herniation.
He additionally had evidence of cellulitis and was maintained on Keflex.
He had no further deterioration of mental status.
Abdominal pain and other pain was well controlled.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Progressive metastatic melanoma with new mets to the brain and lung.
