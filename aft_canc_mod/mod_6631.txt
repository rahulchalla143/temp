In summary, the patient was reportedly attending a funeral today when she had a syncopal episode and fell.
Shortly following admission, she was found slumped over and unresponsive in a chair, and subsequently seized.

Pertinent Results: [**2104-5-19**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: There are two rim-enhancing lesions peripherally located within the right frontal lobe, as described above, with associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.
The inferior lesion demonstrates a punctate focus of hemorrhage.
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease versus abscess.
Two enhancing right frontal lesions most consistent with metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and right frontal sucal effacment.
2mm leftward shift of midline structures.
No definite evidence of malignancy.
Consolidation within the superior segment of the left lower lobe may represent infection, but there is a slightly more rounded appearance inferiorly, and consider repeat chest CT following treatment.
Prominent left-sided intrapulmonary lymph nodes may be reactive.
Findings are likely related to pressure erosion.
There is no focal fluid collection.
Slightly limited evaluation of the pelvis due to motion artifact, but no gross abnormalities are identified.
Persistent, unchanged right frontal edema and 2 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old F in her usual state of health until an episode of syncope and seizure.
OSH CT revealed a brain mass with vasogenic edema.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a Head CT was repeated- again showing a  two rim-enhancing lesions peripherally located within the right frontal lobe with associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.
A Brain MRI was done on [**2104-5-19**] which showed two enhancing right frontal lesions most consistent with metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and right frontal sulcal effacement  A CT Torso was done on [**5-19**], which was negative for any primary lesion or mets, but did show ground glass opacity in RUL.
She was consented and pre-oped, and went to the OR for resection of this mass on [**5-22**].
The procedure went well without complications.
CT head was negative for hemorrhage.
