There is prominence of the common bile duct at the aorta, measuring up to 1.4 cm, without intrahepatic ductal dilation.
The gallbladder is slightly distended, but without wall thickening, cholelithiasis, or sludge.
There is no pericholecystic fluid identified.
Multiple new hypoechoic masses are also seen involving the head and body of the pancreas.
There is prominence of the pancreatic duct, measuring up to 4 mm.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Numerous new hypoechoic masses throughout the liver and the pancreas, with associated prominence of the pancreatic duct (4 mm) and common bile duct (1.3 cm).
Given the history of melanoma, these findings are most compatible with metastatic disease, with an element of associated biliary and pancreatic ductal obstruction.
CTA ABD/PELVIS [**2127-7-22**]: CT ABDOMEN FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Bibasilar dependent atelectasis, right worse than left.
A well-circumscribed pulmonary nodule measuring 7mm is present in the right middle lobe, seen on image 209 of series 3B.
Dedicated CT of the thorax can be obtained especially given primary carcinoma with known intraabdominal metastases.
Interval development of a moderate right subcapsular hematoma with heterogeneous components, most likely mixed hemorrhage and fluid.
Small amount of heterogeneous fluid is also seen adjacent to the liver.
A larger amount of diluted hemorrhagic fluid is seen dependently within the pelvis.
Innumerable predominantly necrotic hypoattenuating metastases are scattered throughout the liver.
Particularly a large hepatic metastases in the anterior right liver measures 4.0 x 4.8 cm.
Another large metastasis in the posterior right liver measures 4.7 x 7.0 cm.
Hepatic veins are attenuated, especially the right branch, by a focus of hepatic metastasis.
Intrahepatic and proximal extrahepatic common ductal dilatation is present, now moderate in severity.
No radiopaque biliary stones are seen.
Multiple hypodense lesions are seen within the pancreas concerning for metastases.
Worsening pancreatic ductal dilatation, likely due to pancreatic metastasis.
The left adrenal gland demonstrates a large heterogeneous centrally necrotic mass measuring 2.8 x 2.9 cm, compatible with metastases.
Multiple wedge-shaped areas of hypoattenuation involving both kidneys, may represent sequela of multifocal infarcts.
A more nodular area of ill-defined hypoattenuation and heterogeneous enhancement in the upper pole of the right kidney is seen concerning for an additional site of metastases.
No hydronephrosis bilaterally.
In the superior right perirenal space, a 1.1 cm soft tissue nodule is seen and may represent a retroperitoneal focus of metastases.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Multiple soft tissue nodules are scattered throughout the small bowel mesentery and within the omentum compatible with intraperitoneal metastases.
No extraluminal air or discrete fluid collections are seen.
Large amount of mixed density fluid within the pelvis concerning for hemorrhage.
Subcentimeter bilateral inguinal, and iliac chain lymph nodes are seen.
No abnormal fluid collections.
Bones: Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
No suspicious osseous blastic or lytic lesions are seen.
Large subcapsular mixed density hematoma with hemorrhage extending in to the right lateral perihepatic space, right paracolic gutter within the right mid abdomen and settling dependently within the pelvis.
Significant interval progression of innumerable hepatic and multiple pancreatic metastases.
Enlarged left adrenal metastases.
Multiple soft tissue nodules are scattered throughout the abdomen, with a few peritoneal and omental metastasis.
Right perirenal soft tissue nodule, concerning for retroperitoneal metastasis.
Nodular heterogeneously region upper pole of the right kidney concerning for additional metastatic involvement.
2 pulmonary nodules are seen in the right middle lobe.
Given history of known primary malignancy with metastasis, consider performing a dedicated chest CT or PET/CT.
