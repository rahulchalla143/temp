Admission Date:  [**2188-8-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-9-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2120-8-28**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male with a 2-week history of nausea and vomiting with possible coffee-grounds emesis which occurred one time, history of abdominal pain after eating around his front mid epigastric area with some radiation to the back (which he described as sharp) who presented to the Emergency Room with a pulse of 60 and a blood pressure of 75/48.
He was also given Flagyl and Levaquin for a question of sepsis secondary to a bandemia on his laboratories and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because it was discovered that his hematocrit had dropped 10 points in two weeks.
At that time, it was thought that the patient had a slow gastrointestinal bleed secondary to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear or gastritis rather than an ulcer.
He had a lavage which showed red-colored fluid which cleared with 500 mL of normal saline.
The patient still complained of nausea and vomiting up to 1.5 liters of fluid without blood upon his transfer to the Medicine Service.
His had dry mucous membranes.
His neck examination revealed he had no jugular venous distention.
He had good carotid pulses without bruits, and no thyromegaly.
On cardiovascular examination he had a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His extremities showed trace edema in both lower extremities, but no clubbing or cyanosis.
His back showed no midline tenderness.
Altered sensation in the distal extremities.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray was read as normal without any infiltrates or free air.
His electrocardiogram showed no changes.
The stomach with diffuse friability, edema with nodularity and alternation of the mucosa, with contact bleeding in the prepyloric region and antrum.
There was narrowing of the pylori secondary to edema; compatible with severe gastritis and ulceration.
These biopsies showed pyloric obstruction.
Biopsies were taken which subsequently showed lymphoma, and various consultation services were called to see the patient.
Oncology had been following the patient immediately prior to the findings that there was obstruction between the stomach and the duodenum, and they did a bone marrow biopsy; the results of which were pending.
He was also continued on Zofran and pantoprazole.
He had a CT scan of the abdomen done for staging which showed small bilateral pleural effusions, thickening circumference of the gastric antrum, large lymph nodes up to 2 cm in the gastrohepatic ligament, and the peripancreatic gastrosplenic para-aortic, and autocoidal areas which were worrisome for metastatic disease.
He had no free air or fluid, and it was also found that he had bilateral adrenal masses with low attenuation; not consistent with adenoma.
His CT of the pelvis showed no free air or fluid and no bony lesions.
