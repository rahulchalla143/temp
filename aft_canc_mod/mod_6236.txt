Wedge liver biopsy--metastatic disease suspected.
Omental flap closure duodenal perforation.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old woman who has apparent metastatic breast cancer to the bone and perhaps the abdomen who has developed full malignant obstructive jaundice.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] attempted to resolve this as minimally invasively as possible by endoscopic means to provide her palliation.
Unfortunately, during that procedure an apparent duodenal perforation occurred in the tenuous duodenal tissue and was immediately recognized.

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old woman who has apparent metastatic breast cancer to the bone and perhaps the abdomen who has developed full malignant obstructive jaundice.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] attempted to resolve this as minimally invasively as possible by endoscopic means to provide her palliation.
Unfortunately, during that procedure an apparent duodenal perforation occurred in the tenuous duodenal tissue and was immediately recognized.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] noticed and identified this and immediately called me hoping for operative treatment.
This was an emergency operation in a very high risk patient with malignant obstructive jaundice, probably very poor nutrition and would have high risk but was absolutely necessary that we proceed given that she had a free intestinal perforation in her abdomen.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  Following satisfactory induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was widely prepped with Betadine and sterile drapes were placed.
There was not really a lot of soilage in the upper abdomen, although there was some free- fluid which was cultured.
I now went ahead and explored this area more to find sclerotic, most likely tumor metastasis in and around the duodenum and the head of the pancreas which were not biopsied at this location.
This combined with the degree of constriction of the duodenum would measurably decrease luminal patency and so she would need something more because of a partial gastric outlet obstruction.
The second approach was mobilizing omentum at the superior aspect of the transverse colon and then bringing this up such that it overlay on top of the duodenorrhaphy, at which point it was sutured down for additional sealing effect.
We next excised with a wedge liver biopsy a lesion near the gallbladder bed which was almost certainly a metastasis.
This was for staging and documentation of lymphatic metastatic disease.
This bled terribly unfortunately, probably requiring 200-300 cc blood loss before I could finally get this bleeding stopped with high-voltage cautery and mattress sutures of chromic.
A small amount of bile was leaking from this small 1 cm peripheral wedge biopsy site.
The mesentery of the transverse mesocolon was sutured around it to prevent internal hernia.
The final procedure now was to establish biliary bypass of some degree for palliation.
She had a distended Courvoisier gallbladder and so I thought that this would be a suitable and safe conduit for extrahepatic biliary ductal bypass.
About 50 cm below the gastrojejunostomy I brought up a lazy loop of jejunum to the fundus of the gallbladder where a two-layer hand-sewn silk and Vicryl side- to-side cholecystojejunostomy anastomosis of 1 cm wide patency was achieved.
This would provide a decompressive route for her obstructive biliary system.
The patient was generally stable during the operation, although she did suffer 500 cc of blood loss but not any significant hemodynamic trouble.
We now irrigated and washed out the upper abdomen and then placed a 19 French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain up in the right upper quadrant near the liver biopsy site and the cholecystojejunostomy anastomosis and the duodenorrhaphy to drain those three perilous areas.
As her attending operating surgeon, I was present for her entire operation and I performed all of its components.
[**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7542**], [**MD Number(1) 7543**]  _ ________________________________________________________________  Pathology  DIAGNOSIS:  Liver, wedge biopsy:  Metastatic poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with breast origin, see note.
Note:  The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 and estrogen receptor and focally positive for gross cystic disease fluid protein.
The histologic features and immunophenotype are consistent with a breast origin.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2152-12-6**]: The patient had second ERCP attempted at [**Hospital1 18**] (first was [**12-5**] at OSH) which was complicated by duodenal perforation with a CT showing free peritoneal air.
She required 3L of NS boluses for hypotension and low UOP [**12-8**]: the patient was extubated and stable with normal UOP and normal pressures [**12-9**]: she was transferred from the unit to the floor [**12-10**]: NGT discontinued, stable and minimal complaints [**12-12**]: slight nausea, self regulating on clears [**12-13**]: tolerating normal diet, JP discontinued, clear to d/c home by PT with home PT [**12-14**]: small stitch applied to JP drain site for drainage; stopped Unasyn, afebrile  Discharge Medications: 1.

* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any narcotic pain medication.
