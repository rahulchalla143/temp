Admission Date:  [**2104-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-5-25**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Epigastric discomfort  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2104-5-20**] Aortic Valve Replacement(19mm Mosaic Porcine [**Company 1543**] Valve)   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 74243**] is an 89 yo woman with severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] <0.8 cm2), global systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30-35%), diastolic dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia who presented to the ED with epigastric discomfort.
She reports that since the day prior to admission at about 3 p.m., she has had epigastric discomfort and nausea on and off.
She denied any increase in her discomfort with exertion.
She denies associated chest pain, discomfort or pressure.
She denies shortness of breath, palpitations or diaphoresis.
She has been admitted twice over the last few weeks, once for syncope and more recently for SOB.
She was mildly hypotensive to the mid-80s systolic, so she was admitted to the CCU.
Upon arrival to the CCU, she reports that her epigastric discomfort has resolved.
She denies lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope.
She denied leg swelling or calf pain.
She denied significant change in her bowel habits.
Past Medical History: # Severe AS # Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF # Iron Deficiency Anemia s/p normal EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] [**12-23**] # Hyperlipidemia # Impaired glucose tolerance (per prior A1C 6-7%) # s/p right THA  Social History: Immigrated from South [**Country 480**] to the U.S., currently lives with her daughter.
She has 2 daughters living in the U.S.   Family History: No history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Late-peaking III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the RUSB, radiates to the clavicle.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Chest X-ray ([**5-4**]):  There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions; however, the previously seen edema has decreased significantly.
There is now mild central vascular engorgement.
IMPRESSION: Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions with improvement in pulmonary edema which is now mild.
Unlateral lower extremity ultrasound ([**5-6**]): Examination is somewhat limited due to portable technique and difficulty with patient positioning.
Mild delay in oral transit time.
No evidence for aspiration or penetration.
Brief Hospital Course: # Epigastric discomfort: Patient was admitted with epigastric pain with initial concerns that this represented her anginal equivalent.
She had a mild elevation in troponin, but this in the setting of elevated creatinine.
She had had recent coronary angiography that did not demonstrate any significant coronary artery disease.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated to 3.0 from baseline of 1.0 on admission likely combination of two recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing to increased creatinine.
Her lasix and valsartan were held initially and creatinine improved with very gentle fluid resuscitation.
# Transient hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to acute renal insufficiency.
# Hypotension: Mild with systolics in 80's, resolved with minimal IVF bolus.
As below she did require lasix for diuresis after developing shortness of breath.
# Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Initially there was no evidence of volume overload on exam and valsartan and lasix were held in setting of acute renal failure.
After receiving packed RBCs she developed shortness of breath and had CXR consistent with CHF so was diuresed with IV lasix.
She subsequently developed diarrhea secondary to C Diff colitis and became volume depleted again.
# UTI: Diagnosed prior to admission, her antibiotics were changed from bactrim to ampicillin given acute renal failure on admission.
# Chronic anemia: Baseline hematocrit of 30, hematocrit decreased to 25 on admission in the setting of IV fluids.
She received 2units pRBCs for decreased BPs and Hct.
Workup consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
No evidence of GIB or hemolysis.
She was continued on iron supplementation  # ?Aspiration event: Patient had witnessed aspiration event on [**2104-5-10**] while taking pills with desaturation to 90's.
She recovered spontaneously within hours and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint.
She underwent a sppech and swallow evaluation which showed no evidence of aspiration therefore she was not coninued on aspiration precuations.
No further aspiration events.
# C. diff colitis:  The patient was noted to have diarrhea with stool studies positive for C.diff on [**5-10**].
She was started on Flagyl PO with resolution of her symtpoms.
# Aortic Stenosis: Severe, leading to heart failure, and recent admission for syncope.
CT surgery was consulted and decided to proceed with aortic valve replacement after resolution of acute renal failure and C Diff colitis.
Pt also had large skin tag removed from left thigh.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
