Admission Date:  [**2122-7-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2122-7-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-4-2**]       Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old with a history of diastolic heart failure, hypertension and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of refractory anemia with [**Last Name (un) 43256**] cytoblast type who presented initially to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on [**2122-7-19**] with several days of abdominal pain, diarrhea, poor oral intake, nausea, vomiting.
This occurred in the setting of two months of progressive shortness of breath with several admissions to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital presumably for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
He was mildly short of breath and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
He underwent one episode of leukophoresis but subsequently he transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment including possible salvage chemotherapy.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Diastolic heart failure.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 8.
General:  Elderly male in mild respiratory distress.
Telangiectasia on lip, no gingival bleeding.
Neck:  Jugular venous distention at 8 cm, no thyromegaly.
Heart:  Distant heart sounds, soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur in left upper sternal border.
Lungs: Crackles at left greater than right basis.
There are no nodes or other masses palpated.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe patchy infiltrates with minimal edema on preliminary read.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with preliminary diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with blasts crisis.
He had mild short of breath and hypoxia which were of unclear etiology.
There are no clinical features to suggest pneumonia, the primary concern had been leukotactic lung injury from elevated peripheral white blood cell count.
He had a CT angiogram that showed by reports blood flow through the pulmonary arteries.
Hematology, Oncology was consulted to review the patient's history and clinical findings.
There was some concern over whether this indeed represented MDS with blast crisis verses CML with blast crisis as he had some features supporting both of these diagnosis.
Treatment of tumorlysis and also treated with Hydroxyurea.
Pathology service was consulted to continue his leukophoresis and they did so on [**7-21**] with subsequent decline in white blood count to 88,700.
Hematology/Oncology recommended sending peripheral blood and bone marrow for studies including cytogenetics to assist with diagnosis and therapeutic options.
His hospital course is also complicated by profuse diarrhea, his stool sent for C. diff toxin returning negative.
The patient started leukophoresis at [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2122-7-23**] and bone marrow results were pending when discussions were held with the family over goals of care and treatment options.
The patient had increasing agitation and deterioration of mental status as well as increasing labored breathing throughout the day.
Additional workup for encephalopathy and diarrhea was entertained.
However, upon further discussions with the family (as patient's mental status changes prevented him from understanding/expressing his decisions about medical care) the patient's family and Intensive Care Unit/Hem/Onc teams decided that given poor prognosis and clinical circumstances the patient's goals would be more consistent with signs of further leukophoresis and further workup of medical condition were discontinued and the patient received 1 mg of Morphine for discomfort.
CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure secondary to acute leukemia.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Leukotactic lung injury.
