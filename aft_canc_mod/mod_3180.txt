Admission Date:  [**2200-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-3-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-6-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 y/o M with MDS/AML who was admitted to the SICU after spontaneous splenic rupture.
The patient was seen in clinic on the day of admission and had a syncopal episode in the waiting room.
Pt had had sharp LUQ pain while driving to his appt, which continued at the clinic.
By report, no acute abdomen on exam at that time.
CT abdomen done, after which pt c/o dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, then became unreponsive with BP 110/60, HR 60s at that time.
CT abdomen revealed probable splenic laceration/rupture although the patient could not receive IV contrast due to renal failure, so this could not be quantified; pt taken to ED.
Family History: Positive for coronary disease and diabetes mellitus.
Physical Exam: Gen: NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, OP clear CV: RRR, nl S1S2, II/VI systolic murmur at LUSB Lungs: Crackles and dullness to percussion at R base.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
Extensive high-density ascites consistent with hemoperitoneum.
The densest fluid is in the left upper quadrant, which is concerning for splenic rupture.
Multiple coarse calcifications within the liver are consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
Linear calcification along the splenic capsule could be the sequela of prior trauma.
[**3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
Marked gastric distention.
Findings again consistent with splenic rupture.
The hematoma around the spleen has increased in size.
The amount of free fluid around the liver has increased also.
Right pleural effusion.
Coronary and aortic atherosclerosis.
Right basilar atelectasis.
Interval decrease in the amount of hemorrhage in the abdomen and pelvis.
[**3-27**] Echocardiogram (TTE): Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly to moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 year old man with MDS/AML who was admitted to the SICU for spontaneous splenic rupture and is now transferred to the BMT service for further care.
# splenic rupture: The patient presented with abdominal pain and a falling hematocrit.
CT abdomen revealed a likely splenic rupture.
# O2 requirement: While in the SICU the patient developed a new oxygen requirement, although he did not complain of dyspnea or cough.
He was afebrile initially and had a normal WBC count.
The lung bases were visible on his CT abdomen and their appearance was consistent with fluid in the lungs.
He had no localizing symptoms.
CXR revealed no evidence of pneumonia.
As the patient had an elevated bilirubin at that time (likely due to blood in peritoneum being reabsorbed), levofloxacin and flagyl were started.
The patient remained afebrile thereafter.
# MDS/CMML: Stable.
# chronic renal insufficiency(baseline Cr 1.9-2.2):  On admission the patient's creatinine was elevated at 2.4, but by the time of discharge (after receiving IVF and blood products) it returned to baseline around 2.0. .
# HTN: While in the surgical ICU, the patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV metoprolol and hydralazine.
Disp:*7 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: splenic rupture Secondary Diagnoses: CMML hypertension GERD   Discharge Condition: good, hematocrit stable   Discharge Instructions: You have been hospitalized with a rupture of the spleen.
If you experience fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or any other new or concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or return to the emergency room for evaluation.
