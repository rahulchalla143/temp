ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year- old gentleman on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation who was a restrained driver involved in a motor vehicle collision at about 30-35 miles per hour.
Notably, his INR was therapeutic and there was additional concern given his significant mechanism of injury and his coagulopathy.
The patient was stabilized in the trauma bay and underwent immediate imaging, which included a CT of the head which found no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Additionally, he underwent a CT of the C spine which demonstrated no abnormality.
A CT of the torso was notable for grade 1 splenic laceration, but otherwise comminuted fractures in the posterior wall and column of the left acetabulum with complete separation of the posterior wall.
After initial stabilization he was monitored in the intensive care unit until he was able to undergo operative repair of his lower extremity fractures on [**2173-1-4**].
At the time of this repair, he also underwent insertion of an IVC filter as it was felt he would be immobile for some time and he had a relative contraindication to using heparin given the fact that he had a small splenic laceration.
The patient was extubated subsequent to operative repair of his fractures and placement of his inferior vena caval filter.
He did well, he remained afebrile with normal hemodynamics.
His diet was advanced without difficulty and we were able to wean his oxygen requirement slowly.
His chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema which was significantly improving on a daily basis with no large effusions visible.
He is discharged to rehab with touch down weightbearing status of the left lower extremity, posterior hip precautions and the patient is to wear a knee immobilizer at all times.
