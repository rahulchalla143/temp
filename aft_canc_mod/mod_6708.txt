He was seen in clinic on [**5-29**] where it was noted that he had progression of his blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm from the skin to the leukemic phase.
He was started on hydroxyurea on [**6-5**] after he and his wife were made aware of his poor prognosis with leukemic transformation.

SUMMARY OF ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: - progressed while on pralatrexate and pentostatin - currently on gemcitabine, C5D1 on [**2109-1-16**] (1) He has been a patient of dermatologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81680**] for 30 years, with prior basal cell cancers on the head treated by excision.
With a history of sun exposure during the summers and trips to Dubai to visit his daughter and her family during winter months, he first noticed a greyish pimple-like lesion on his mid-frontal scalp in [**Month (only) 359**]-[**2106-11-13**].
Biopsy of a back lesion was obtained revealing findings similar to the scalp lesion.
(3) An extensive staging evaluation was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3443**] of [**Location (un) **] Hematology/Oncology including:  -- CBC revealing mild anemia and chronic stable to somewhat improved thrombocytopenia.
Serum iron chemistries suggested borderline iron deficiency.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**2106-12-23**]) showed hypercellular marrow for age with no other specific findings, including evaluation by flow cytometry.
-- PET scanning ([**2106-12-21**]) showed no abnormal FDG uptake in the skin or scalp.
A "small area of patchy uptake in the anterior aspect of the right liver lobe" was of "uncertain significance."
-- CT scanning ([**2106-12-17**]) revealed left sphenoid sinus thickening and four low density lesions in the liver "suspicious for metastatic foci."
-- On [**2107-1-12**], he saw an ENT specialist for evaluation of the left sphenoid sinus findings.
Samplings revealed aspergillus and no evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder by flow.
There was no evidence of invasive aspergillosis, and expectant observation was recommended by an infectious disease specialist.
(4) Subsequently, he noticed a new erythematous scalp lesion, located at the right lateral hairline of his balding scalp, in association with a pigmented lesion representing seborrheic keratosis and basal cell cancer, subsequently excised.
With the exception of fading erythematous lesions on his back, he had not noticed any other cutaneous findings of concern prior to his visit with us on [**2107-1-26**].
(7) Off MTX, right palate ulcer resolved, but he noticed recurrence of his skin lesions on the back, increased redness of the scalp lesion, and appearance of several new lesions on the mid-anterior chest.
MTX was resumed on [**2108-1-28**] with stabilization or regression of lesion on the following dosing schedule, which was less than his prior dosing schedule of 3 + 3 + 2: On Sundays, 5 mg at 8 a.m. + 5 mg at 8 p.m. + 5 mg at 8 a.m. the following day.Skin lesions improved markedly.
(8) In [**2-/2108**], while visiting his family in Dubai, he developed fever and was hospitalized briefly without evidence of infection by culture.
Due to leukocytopenia and neutropenia, MTX was held and subsequently lowered to a daily dose of 2 + 2 + 1 and 2 + 1 + 1.
Due to mucositis and neutropenia after a single dose, second dose reduced by 50%.
On the reduced dose of pralatrexate, skin lesions on torso and head became worse.
D/t neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, gemcitabine was reduced [**2108-10-10**] to 500 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15.
Between [**2109-3-11**] and [**2109-3-28**], he received a total of 2800 cGy to the L and R frontal scalp lesions under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81683**] at Proter Radiation Oncology in [**Location (un) 67995**], FL.
with gradual fading of his scalp lesions.
No illicit substances.
