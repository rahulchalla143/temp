CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Obese, mildly distended.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Enlarged lesion over anterior right shin.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**1-29**], there has been some decrease in the opacification at the left base consistent with decreasing atelectasis and effusion.
The remainder of the study is unchanged and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
No MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-17**], a very small pericardial effusion is now seen.
Regional function cannot be adequately assessed due to suboptimal image quality, but overall ejection fraction remains preserved.
There was moderate dilatation of the renal collecting system and upper two-thirds of the ureter on the left side.
The lower one-third of the ureter was not opacified; no passage of contrast was noted from the left ureter into the bladder.
Moderately dilated, partially duplicated right renal collecting system and moderately dilated upper three-fourths of the right ureter.
The distal end of the right ureter was not opacified and there was no passage of contrast into the urinary bladder.
Post catheter placement nephrostograms revealed satisfactory position of both the nephrostomy catheters.
There is moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter with no passage of contrast into the urinary bladder.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male history of HTN and invasive bladder carcinoma with acute on chronic kidney failure and ischemic EKG changes + trops, found to have ureter obstruction, now s/p bilateral nephrostomy tubes, with [**Last Name (un) **] and CKD resolving.
