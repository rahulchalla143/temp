She presented to the emergency room on [**2-/2073**] am with reports of bright red blood per rectum since dinner the night prior.
She reported feeling dizzy and lightheaded at that time and called EMS, who brought her to the emergency room.
She denies any abdominal pain, chest pain, fevers, or chills.
Past Medical History: PMH: Diverticulosis with h/o multiple GI bleeds, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, MI in [**2104**], gout, Polycythemia with chronic all and elevated WBC count.
PSH: Hysterectomy for fibroids ([**2109**]), appendectomy as a child  Physical Exam: On admission: Temp 99.5  HR 95-100  BP 128/64  RR 18  O2 Sat 100%2L Gen: AA&O x 3 HEENT: PERRL, EOMI b/l Neck: supple CV: RRR Pulm: CTA b/l Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND, no rebound/gaurding Rectal: dried blood around anus, clotted blood on rectal, no BRBPR, no mass Ext: No c/c/e  Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2152-3-10**] 04:10AM   PT-14.4* PTT-29.2 INR(PT)-1.3* [**2152-3-10**] 04:10AM   WBC-95.5* RBC-5.85* HGB-10.6* HCT-41.1 MCV-70* MCH-18.1* MCHC-25.7* RDW-17.2* [**2152-3-10**] 04:10AM   GLUCOSE-198* UREA N-54* CREAT-1.8* SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-18 [**2152-3-10**] 05:56AM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-TR GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-TR BILIRUBIN-MOD UROBILNGN-1 PH-5.0 LEUK-NEG [**2152-3-10**] 08:22AM   HCT-33.9* [**2152-3-10**] 02:16PM   HCT-25.7* [**2152-3-16**] 08:41AM BLOOD Hct-31.4* [**2152-3-17**] 07:57AM BLOOD Hct-31.0* [**2152-3-18**] 06:50AM BLOOD Hct-32.5* .
IMPRESSION: Positive GI bleeding study, with tracer accumulation in the ileocolic artery distribution first seen at 75 minutes.
No point of active bleeding/contrast extravasation was identified in either the SMA or [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territories.
There was the suggestion of prominent vascularity in the region of the upper ascending colon at the hepatic flexure level, but this was felt most likely to be due to underfilling of the colon with secondary crowding of vessels in the wall of the colon.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: No active bleeding site identified.
Focal inflammatory changes or angiodysplasia are felt to be less likely.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Lower gastrointestinal bleeding from the distribution of the ileocolic vessels.
INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who has had previous admissions for GI bleeding without a source being identified.
It could not be clearly seen whether there was distal ileal disease or right colon disease.
She agreed to surgical excision of the affected area as indicated by the bleeding scan.
She had a previous hysterectomy incision that was well-healed.
A midline laparotomy scar was carried out through skin and subcutaneous tissue and fascia.
In the distribution of the ileocolic artery, there were very large mesenteric lymph nodes traveling along the path of the ileocolic artery.
There were no palpable lesions in the right colon.
There were findings of some thickening of the small bowel wall again in the distribution of the ileocolic artery.
These were small limited areas.
The small bowel was divided proximal to the most palpably abnormal section and the abnormal lymph nodes and divided with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3224**] stapler.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 102456**] was admitted to the TSICU for serial hematocrits and hemodynamic monitoring.
However the patient reports a history of leukocytosis/undefined myeloproliferative disorder for which she is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2177**] with a chronically elevated WBC count.
Given her cardiac history and active bleeding she was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30.
A tagged red blood scan was done on [**3-11**] which showed a slow bleed in the RLQ at 75 minutes.
She underwent an ileocectomy as there was a question of an inflammatory mass in the RLQ and the positive tagged scan in the RLQ.
She tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.
Heme/onc was consulted for the leukocytosis and felt no further workup was needed.
On POD3 she was having some nausea and was kept on a clear liquid diet.
A KUB was done as she continued to have nausea which was unremarkable.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed s/p R hemicolectomy   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a lower GI bleed requiring 14 units of blood.
Call your doctor for chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening pain at your incision not controlled by pain medication, persistent n/v, fevers > 101, new bloody stools or other symptoms concerning to you.
You should follow up with your hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2177**] to review your elevated WBC count.
