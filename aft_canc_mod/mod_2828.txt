Admission Date:  [**2166-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-7-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Fall down stairs  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p C3-7 posterior laminectomies and fusion  History of Present Illness: 82year old man with a past medical history significant for cervical spondylosis, a.fib, and renal cell ca who presents [**6-15**] with a fall at home and C3-4 cord contusion (with baseline exam of plegic LUE, mild finger flexion in RUE, and could bend both knees against gravity), who is now 1day postop C3-7 laminectomies/fusion and was found this am by the nurses to be "unresponsive."
Family believed there was no LOC, but there are other reports in the notes that pt had syncope prior to fall.
INR on arrival was 2.4, there was small SAH in right parietal lobe on arrival.
He was given high dose steriods for acute cord injury.
No acute process seen on head ct. Neurology called for consult.
Given exam, there was concern for nonconvulsive seizures.
Therefore, he was given total of 2mg of ativan empirically, and patient became more drowsy with eyes now rhythmically moving right and left.
EEG preliminary read with severe encephalopathy with low voltage.
Past Medical History: 1.a.fib, dilated cardiomyopathy 2.htn 3.left renal tumor found [**1-1**], likely renal cell carcinoma.
4.bph s/p turp 5.right lung nodule - stable in size for over 2yrs 6.family reports history of "tortuous" carotid with episodes of syncope in past when he turned head to right- was on dilantin/phenobarbital per family.
per family no history of seizures.
Physical Exam: Tm 99.8; BP 122-184/46-70s; HR 74-90; RR 16-22; O2 sat 95-100% on 3L gen - lying in bed, no acute distress.
no scleral icterus or injection.
no lad or carotid bruits appreciated.
lungs - somewhat coarse bilaterally anteriorly with lots of upper airway sounds heart - irreg irreg, nl s1/s2 abd - soft, nt/nd, nabs ext - warm, 2+ peripheral pulses throughout.
Sensation: minimal grimace/arousal to noxious in arms, triple flexion in legs  Coordination & Gait: unable to assess given mental status  Pertinent Results: wbc 12.6    hct 30.3   plt 158 pt 17.2   ptt 28.5   inr 2.0 Na 144  K 4.2  Cl 115  CO2 21  BUN 52  Cr 1.2  glucose 156 Ca 8.1  PO4 3.0  Mg 2.2 ALT 25 AST 29  Head CT ([**6-23**]): Remote infarcts in the mid right frontal lobe and in the right basal ganglia.
There is no evidence of acute mass effect, hemorrhage, or displacement of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid collection.
Ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with mild brain atrophy, unchanged from prior study  CT C/T/L-spine: The vertebral body heights are preserved.
There are extensive degenerative changes, especially at the C4 through C6 levels with disk space narrowing.
There is soft tissue swelling in the prevertebral soft tissues.
Compression fracture T-7, probably remote.
Healed or healing fractures of multiple right sided ribs.
Extensive Paget's disease involving the pelvis and lumbar spine.
A left renal mass is visualized, measuring 2.5 x 3.3 cm.
There is a large right renal cyst.
Extensive aortic calcification is noted.
MRI C-spine: High signal in the cord at C3-4 is suspicious for a contusion.
There is also high signal along the anterior aspect of C3 that may represent tearing of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
Also degenerative changes at multiple levels.
MRI Head: No acute stroke.
Old infarction right frontal lobe.
Periventricular white matter chronic ischemic changes.
Focus of increased susceptibility in the left temporal lobe, which, in the absence of acute blood products on the CT of the same day, represents a site of old hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
An MR head revealed new left MCA stroke.
Pt has had limited neurologic function since that time.
Injuries s/p fall: In the ED, the pt's head CT showed focal linear hypodensity in R superior parietal region c/w small subdural hematoma (MRI head negative for ischemic event).
MRI C-spine showed increased signal C3-4 c/w cord contusion/edema, given dx of central cord syndrome, Coumadin d/ced, and pt was started on steroids in ED.
Pt was ruled out for MI on admission and continued on steroids.
CVA: On [**6-23**] am, pt was found unresponsive to voice, sternal rub and only moderately responsive to noxious stimuli, eyes deviated to left per notes, right leg twitching was noted by neuro resident.
His EKG was negative for changes, cardiac enzymes negative.
Head CT without contrast was negative for bleed, though atrophy and old R frontal infarct, no acute pathology.
Neurology felt that pt may have likely had status epilepticus possibly from old R frontal infarct or alternatively, he may have suffered a new infarct related to his a.fib given his known afib and need to hold coumadin prior to surgery (although INR was 2.0 [**6-23**] AM).
EEG prelim read with severe encephalopathy, low voltage; recommended MRI r/o acute infarct, transferred to neuro service.
On [**6-26**] pt's MR revealed new left MCA infarct.
Respiratory Distress: On [**6-24**] at 9 pm, following onset of unresponsiveness, pt noted to have increased O2 requirement -ABG at that time 7.42/30/276, CXR with new RML and partial RLL collapse.
At midnight, pt found to have increased work of breathing and using accessory muscles with RR high 20s with O2 sats high 80s on NRB.
ABG 7.42/32/105, EKG with afib rate 102, new TWI V6, CXR with same changes as previous with ?RUL infiltrate, transferred to unit and intubated.
Mild amt of yellowish secretions per nursing.
Pt's distress felt most likely to be [**1-29**] aspiration PNA given pt's neurologic status/unprotected airway.
Pt was extubated with stabilization of respiratory status and tolerated spontaneous breathing well.
Medications on Admission: (at home): coumadin, atenolol (inpatient): decadron 8mg q8hrs, cefazolin, tylenol prn, lopressor, prontix, morphine 2mg q4hrs prn (had 3mg in PACU before 7:30pm none since)  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Sunny Acres  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration PNA/L MCA infarct   Discharge Condition: Pt has no functional status and is completely dependent on the care of others.
