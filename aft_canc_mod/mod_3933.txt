HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old man with a history of mild emphysema and hypertension transferred from an outside hospital after an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient was reportedly not feeling well and awoke feeling fatigued and short of breath at rest.
Over the course of the following three days the patient became more short of breath and then had decreased po intake.
At that time the patient had no cough, fever or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or congestion on the day of admission.
He was seen by his primary medical doctor and noted to be tachypneic and hypoxic.
The patient became progressively more hypoxic to 87 on 100% nonrebreather and the patient was intubated and noted to have thick yellow secretions following intubation.
He was also continued to have copious amounts of sputum and desatted occasionally, but corrected with suction.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction given some initial T wave changes.
He currently has a nonproductive cough and states that he feels like he has to cough something up.
He was slightly short of breath and describes a sick feeling, short of breath after running.
He has no chest pain, palpitations and no chills.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Myelodysplasia anemia.
Cerebrovascular accident.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No significant drinking or intravenous drug use.
He was in no acute distress and appeared somewhat comfortable.
There was no JVD noted.
No crackles or rhonchi and he had slight accessory muscle use as well.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No masses appreciated.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurological examination was no focal deficits.
His initial electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with right axis deviation and some flattening in the precordial leads with a possible right bundle branch, but no acute changes when compared.
Chest x-ray was negative except for some minor small bilateral pleural effusions.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  This is a 77 year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare likely secondary to a upper respiratory infection or pneumonia.
Given his chest x-ray at the outside hospital there was no evidence for infiltrate, but we continued Levofloxacin given plan out to ten days.
This instructions to make an appointment with a pulmonologist of his choice in three to four weeks and to have follow up pulmonary function tests in one to two months after calming of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
