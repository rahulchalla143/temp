There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
[**4-1**] RUQ US: Diffuse intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, without focal lesion found.
Findings are concerning for obstructing mass in the porta hepatis.
[**4-1**] CT abd: 1)  Three hypodense lesions in the liver involving segment VIII and VI.
The mass largest mass in segment VIII infiltrates the porta hepatis and leads to intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
While these lesions likely represent metastases from the patient's known colon cancer, the appearance of the mass in the porta hepatis is somewhat atypical and cholangiocarcinoma is included in the differential diagnosis.
2)  Status post wedge resection in segment II with postsurgical seroma or a resolving hematoma.
3)  A subcentimeter hypodense lesion in the spleen likely represents a small cyst.
There was a stricture in the hilum.
The right intrahepatic duct was cannulated and there was evidence of post obstructive dilation A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
[**4-4**] Carotid studies: complete/right ICA occlusion; 60-70% left ICA stenosis  [**4-4**] CT abd: IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple hepatic metastases, with the largest lesion in segments 8 and 1 exerting mass effect on the right and left main bile ducts, resulting in intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
3) Small lymph nodes in the porta hepatis without mass effect on the common bile duct.
4) Postsurgical seroma or resolving hematoma adjacent to the area of wedge resection in the left lateral hepatic segment, unchanged since [**2124-4-1**].
CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1) Flattened-shaped consolidation with air bronchogram in left upper lobe, corresponding to the lesion noted on chest x-ray which has been decreasing in size, probably representing resolving pneumonia; however, in this patient with colon cancer, please confirm resolution by followup chest CT. 2) Multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules as described above, measuring less than 5 mm in diameter.
3) Multiple calcified pleural plaques, probably due to prior asbestos exposure.
5) Limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates liver metastasis, dilated biliary duct, CBD stent, decreased ascites, and cystic structure in the mid abdomen described as seroma.
Head CT did not show epidural bleed as indicated for transfer to the [**Hospital1 **].
Initial stay was complicated by post extubation confusion, most likely secondary to benzodiazepines (O x1).
CT cspine with MRI showed C5-C7 disk herniation without cord compression or focal neurological deficits.
Pt completely asymptomatic on exam without cervical midline tenderness.
RUQ U/s showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
C-collar taken off for ERCP with stent placement, which showed a mass (1of 3) compressing the porta in segment 8, likely a metastasis from a primary colon CA.
Patient also had hypertension on the floor while on home [**Month/Year (2) 4982**].
[**Month/Year (2) **] were titrated to keep pressures within range for good IC perfusion knowing results of Carotid ultrasound.
His labs were notable for LFTs which are trending down post ERCP with no abd pain.
Transferred to medicine for mgmt of his post ERCP elevated amylase, lipase.
Elevated amylase/lipase: Asx and non-revealing abd exam.
No evidence of acute pancreatitis at this time.
Afebrile with no WBC.
On MRI head, no evidence of mets.
As for his mental status, he was oriented x 3 untilt he evening of trasnfer when he became mildly confused and the following morning was only oriented x 1.
There was no other explanation for this as pt was afebrile, had not recieved any [**Last Name (Titles) 4085**] which could affect his MS. After a long conversation and assurance of the family that this was sundowning, the pt was discharge.
Colon cancer: Post obstructive mets causing acute presentation over last few days as well as jaundice.
A repeat CXR per onc for better eval of superior opacity on [**4-1**] CXR was done which showed some improvement, a chest CT was done which showed some [**Month (only) **] in the size of the nodule but reccomended a 3 month follow up chest CT to look for progression.
Obstructive jaundice 3.
Colon cancer   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, pain free, mental status at baseline.
Discharge Instructions: If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, dizziness or fainting, please call your PCP or come to the ED.
