His cancer history consists of an upper lobe lobectomy in [**9-3**], carboplatin and taxol, and unfortunately thoracic recurrence of his disease seen in [**3-6**] with subsequent treatment with gemcitabine.
He started having headaches in [**2121-6-3**] at which time he was diagnosed with multiple (~7) brain metastases for which he received [**Year (4 digits) 108337**] and whole brain radiation over 10 successive treatments.
His wife notes that he has had some chronic leg weakness but she thinks this may have become worse since completing the radiation.
He was scheduled for a bone scan and by OMR notes it is clear that he does have a history of thoracic and lumbar spine metastases.
His family states that he  spends most of his days watching tv and does not really get up to walk much because of his low back pain and hip pain which is chronic.
There was no  evidence of tongue biting or urinary incontinence apparently.
Upon getting him to the ambulance they noted to some left sided extremity shaking with his eyes deviated to the left.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Social History: lives with family Habits: not known  Family History: family history of colon cancer   Physical Exam: Examination: T 99.9 BP 120/83 HR 93 RR 20 100% vented General appearance: well appearing, moving around, but intubated  Heart: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops Lungs: coarse upper airway sounds bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Mental Status: The patient is on moving around, intermittently opening his eyes spontaneously but obviously nonverbal.
The optic discs are atrophied bilaterally with no evidence of hemorrhage or papilledema.Dolls' eye maneuver results in horizontal eye movements.
There is no obvious facial droop.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT head: There is extensive edema throughout the right temporal lobe and right frontal lobe without evidence of hematoma.
There is midline shift of the frontal lobe, subfalcine herniation that is not much changed from the MRI in [**6-6**].
There is no impending tonsillar  herniation.
EKG: sinus tachy 155bpm, left axis deviation, St depressions in V4-6, St elevation III, aVF  Repeat EKG: NSR 92bpm, ST elevation in III, AVF resolved; St depression in C4-6 resolved.
No obvious infiltrate or consolidation  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
A CT scan was obtained which showed extensive edema which might have been worse from the time his brain was scanned in [**Month (only) **] [**2121**].
There were no other obvious abnormalities in his labs to have lowered the seizure threshold.
No evidence of brain herniation at this time."
Diffuse metastatic disease involving the vertebral bodies and the right iliac bone."
Most likely he needs to be on chronic steroids and seizure prophylaxis.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
-Initially he was continued on insulin sliding scale for diabetes and steroids.
He was re-evaluated on [**2121-10-6**] at which time his swallowing ability had recovered sufficiently that it was felt he would be able to have nectar thick pureed liquids.
Code status - His code status was changed on this admission to DNR/DNI/CMO based upon the poor prognosis of his metastatic lung cancer combined with mental status changes from his brain metastasis.
Pain control - He was continued on Ativan and Morphine for pain control.
Non-small cell lung cancer with metastasis to the brain 2.
HTN 2.
He should be maintained on Dexamethasone and Dilantin and have pain controlled.
