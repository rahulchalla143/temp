HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 55 year old Ukrainian male with mantle cell lymphoma status post Rituxan [**2122-12-15**] and admission on [**2122-12-10**] through [**2122-12-14**], for high dose chemotherapy who presented to the [**Hospital **] Clinic with a chief complaint of fever and generally not feeling well.
The patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, shortness of breath, rash, dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, headache or stiff neck.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
In general, very fatigued appearing middle aged male with decreased mental status.
HEENT:  No icterus, no pallor, no oropharyngeal lesions.
No rubs, gallops or murmurs.
No jugular venous distention, no peripheral edema.
Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation with dull breath sounds bilaterally at the bases as well as fine crackles in both bases.
No focal, sensory or motor deficit.
No meningeal signs.
PICC line is in place in the left upper extremity; it is clean, dry and intact and without erythema or tenderness.
There are no gross skin lesions.
Chest x-ray without evidence for acute process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to Four South/Oncology but due to hypotension which did not respond to fluid boluses and decreased mental status, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He was started on Vancomycin, Ceftazidine and Gentamicin and was started on Neupogen to increase his white blood cell count.
The patient's blood cultures from admission grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four out of four bottles and E. coli in one out of four bottles.
The E. coli was pan-sensitive and the Streptococcus pneumoniae was resistant to penicillin.
The most likely sources for the patient's septic shock were initially thought to be either the patient's indwelling PICC line or a possible infectious complication from the patient's known anal fissure.
A CT scan of the abdomen without showed no evidence for any abscess or fluid collection.
The patient had no signs or symptoms of any respiratory tract infection.
While still in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient brought our attention to the fact that he was experiencing diffuse arthralgias as well as myalgias.
The soft tissue over the second and third metacarpals and second and third metatarsophalangeal joints were noticeably swollen and erythematous.
Vascular ultrasound of the left upper extremity was negative for deep vein thrombosis.
The swelling of the arm gradually decreased, but the hand remained persistently swollen and erythematous as well as painful and tender.
Rheumatology was consulted to attempt aspiration of the metacarpal phalangeal joints, but upon evaluation, their recommendation consistent with that of Infectious Disease, was to image the hand to look for fluid collections or tenosynovitis given that the patient's examination was not consistent with metacarpal phalangeal joint involvement.
MRI of the left hand did in fact demonstrate a 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter abscess between the shafts of the second and third metacarpal bones.
Plastic surgery was consulted for drainage of this abscess, but they were unable to aspirate anything from the hand despite multiple attempts with a needle.
of bloody pus from the soft tissue space between the second and third metacarpal shafts of the left hand.
The patient next brought to our attention two focal areas of extreme tenderness in his calves.
On each lower extremity, the patient was extremely tender to palpation and a focal spot several centimeters distal to the inferior border of the gastrocnemius muscle and toward the lateral aspect of the leg.
This area was not erythematous or edematous, but it was possible to palpate a small nodular mass where the tenderness was at its most extreme.
Ultrasound results were consistent with chronic episode of superficial phlebitis.
It was also noticed around this time that the patient was having difficulty fully flexing or fully extending his left arm at the elbow joint.
The patient was next sent for MRI of both lower extremities below the knee to rule out soft tissue abscess seeded from Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis as the source of the patient's bilateral lower extremity pain.
