Admission Date:  [**2123-1-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-2-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-2-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracic ultrasound of L pleura.
Transthoracic echocardiography.
History of Present Illness: 77M with h/o COPD with home O2 qhs and lung cancer (T2Nx NSCLC) who presented to clinic today to receive his first radiation treatment with CyberKnife.
He reports increased SOB x 1wk, cough productive of white/brown sputum x few weeks, and increased swelling of lower extremities x few weeks.
Patient diagnosed with URI last week by PCP and completed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 6 day course of an antibiotic (does not know which) one day prior to admission with minimal improvement.
In clinic he was found to be tachypneic (RR40), dyspneic, and mildly hypoxic (O2sat 88-93%) and with an irregular pulse.
ROS: Denies chest pain, abd pain, dysuria, abnormal bowel habits.
Past Medical History: COPD- FEV1 0.75 (32 %pred) FVC 1.67 (46% pred),  FEV1/FVC 45 (69%pred) Lung Cancer (T2Nx NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma) Dx [**4-28**] s/p Mediastinoscopy [**9-28**]- negative paratracheal LN s/p fiducial seed placement in RML lesion [**12-28**] Atrial Fibrillation BPH status post TURP status post remote appendectomy Hard of hearing right foot drop secondary to pinched peripheral nerve.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: T98.6  BP105/67 HR130  RR34  O2sat 92% 2L Gen: elderly gentleman, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP-clear, MMM neck supple, no LAD Lungs: poor inspiratory effort, decreased breath sounds at R base.
crackles R base, diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
normoactive bowel sounds ext: 2+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally.
EKG: AFib at 127.  no acute ischemic changes.
Studies: EKG: AFib at 127. no acute ischemic changes.
CXR [**2123-1-29**]: Atelectasis and moderate sized pleural effusion seen in the area of the known right middle lobe mass.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
CTA [**2123-1-29**]: Again noted is an obstructing mass in the right middle lobe with a similar appearance.
As noted on the very recent prior CT, the mass encases the hilar vessels in the right middle lobe, and there is distal partial collapse of the right middle lobe.
There is a similar appearance of a right-sided pleural effusion, with peribronchial thickening in the right lower lobe.
Again noted are multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism, and the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is probably at least mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least trace mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of  [**2122-10-5**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.
[**2123-2-1**] Chest X-ray:  AP chest compared to [**1-29**] and [**1-5**]: Small right pleural effusion has increased since [**1-29**] collecting along the diaphragmatic and lower costal surface of the right lung adjacent to consolidation surrounding a right middle lobe mass demonstrated on plain chest films from [**1-5**].
Right middle lobe is probably collapsed.
There is no pneumothorax.
Laboratories:   [**2123-2-3**] 06:50AM BLOOD WBC-13.6* RBC-3.03* Hgb-9.7* Hct-29.5* MCV-97 MCH-32.1* MCHC-33.0 RDW-18.1* Plt Ct-523* [**2123-2-3**] 06:50AM BLOOD Glucose-78 UreaN-41* Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-4.8 Cl-96 HCO3-36* AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77 year old gentleman with COPD (on home O2), atrial fibrillation, smoking, and recently diagnosed lung cancer (T2Nx NSCLC).
The day of admission he noted this was getting worse and he required more frequent O2 requirement (all day vs qhs), along with productive cough, lethargy, and increased LE edema.
In [**Name (NI) 153**] pt was noted to be volume overloaded by exam with signifcant LE swelling and JVD.
Pt was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation by telemetry.
CXR notable for new R pleural effusion as well as for previously seen RML mass.
By this time he had continued to be mentating appropriately and had been afebrile for 48 h. His oxygen was roughly 93% on 2L.
He was somewhat tachypneic but has otherwise been hemodynamically stable.
Per pt and wife, they felt his LE edema had gone down.
A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed diastolic congestive heart failure.
Interventional Pulmonary service was consulted for possible thoracentesis and stenting given his lung cancer.
Amt of fluid was found by ultrasound to be too small for thoracentesis and prior bronchoscopy revealed no evidence he would benefit from stenting.
In summmary, this is a 77 yo gentleman with COPD on home O2 and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer who was admitted to intensive care unit with increasing SOB, cough and LE edema, elevated WBC, and a R pleural effusion on CXR.
Differential for this presentation includes diastolic CHF, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, obstruction related to his non-SCLC and oversedation from Ativan.
All of these may have factors may have contributed to his respiratory distress, but given his findings of LE edema, increased creatinine, most important factors were likely exacerbation of diastolic CHF and respiratory depression with Ativan.
He was successfully treated with diuresis for CHF, antibiotics for possible pneumonia, steroids for CHF exacerbation.
He is to follow up for radiation therapy and, possibly, chemotherapy for treatment of his non small cell lung cancer.
- Pt to continue home oxygen - Pt to continue albuterol/atrovent nebulizers - only 1 day of prednisone post discharge for possible COPD exacerbation.
- continue Levofloxacin for empiric treatment of PNA for two days, pneumonia appears less likely given hosp course and lack of CXR changes - Supplemental O2 to keep O2 sats >93% - Per IP no indication for stenting, R pleural effusion to small for thoracentesis.
- Robitussin, Tessalon pearls as needed for cough .
4.Cardiovascular issues: has evidence of diastolic CHF as seen on TTE.
A) Perfusion: possible he that has new CHF secondary to ischemic event.
No evidence of EKG changes.
Leukocytosis- most likely [**2-25**] PNA trended downward but still high.
Creatinine at 1.2, likely renal insufficiency was in part secondary to heart failure.
FEN- cardiac healthy diet.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
COPD exacerbation.
Non small cell lung cancer.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to oversedation with benzodiazepine.
Tolerating heart healthy diet.
Discharge Instructions: Please weigh yourself every morning Please limit salt in your diet (2 g daily) Please return to hospital if you develop worsening shortness of breath, increased swelling in hand and feet.
**Please do not use any benzodiazepine medications including Ativan, Librium, or Valium**  Please consult your doctor before using any type of sedative medication.
