There are no fractures identified.
Two destructive bony lesions are seen in the occipital bones which are concerning for metastatic disease.
No evidence for hemorrhage or masses.
Destructive bony lesions in the occipital bones, concerning for metastatic disease.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2197-9-11**] CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The visualized lungs are clear without nodule or masses.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is a 3.9 x 3.5 cm soft tissue mass in the right posterior chest wall causing a convex bulge along the right posterior pleura.
An enlarged lymph node is seen in the posterior mediastinal space on S2, I2, measuring 1.7 cm.
Additional prominent retrocrural nodes are noted measuring up to 13mm.
These may represent simple cysts but are incompletely characterized on this noncontrast evaluation.
There are punctate calcifications within the lower pole of the left kidney which could represent nonobstructing stones.
There is no hydronephrosis seen within either kidney.
The abdominal loops of small and large bowel are grossly unremarkable on this noncontrast study.
There is no free air.
There is no free fluid.
There is extensive bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, most prominent along the left aortic chain extending into the left hemipelvis.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a large irreguylar mass arising from the anterior bladder wall measuring approximately 8.2 (tr) x 4.6 (AP) x 9.6 (CC) cm.
There is peripheral calcification noted along the luminal (posterior) border of this mass.
There is irregularity along the bladder wall with apparent infiltration of the prevesical fat, compatible with tumor extension.
There is likely a second area of disease along the posterior wall of the urinary bladder where calcification (4.9 x 1.8 cm) is also noted though evaluation is quite limited without contrast.
There is no free air, there is no free fluid.
The rectum, sigmoid colon and pelvic small and large bowel are grossly unremarkable.
There are scattered diverticula within the sigmoid colon without evidence for diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There are multiple destructive bony lesions which are compatible with metastasis.
In particular there is a large lesion eroding the right proximal femoral shaft measuring 4.7 x 4.1 cm.
There is soft tissue density in the marrow cavity of the left proximal femur (2:88).
There is a 2.4 x 2.5 cm soft tissue density causing lytic destruction of the anterior right- sided pubic ramus.
There is a 3.3 x 2.9 cm soft tissue density with lytic destruction of the posterior inferior left sacral ala (2:60).
There is a 3.8 x 2.6 cm left sided iliac crest lytic soft tissue density and a 3.2 x 2.3 cm soft tissue mass causing lytic destruction of the posterior left-sided ischium and a 2.4 x 2.1 cm soft tissue mass causing lytic destruction of the posterior right-sided ischium.
Within the left sided posterior aspect of the L5 vertebral body (2:44), there is a 1.4 x 1.3-cm lytic soft tissue mass with cortical disruption.
This soft tissue density mass protrudes into the spinal canal and indents the thecal sac.
There are no fractures identified; however, given the burden of lytic lesions, there is a high risk of possible future pathological fractures.
Large calcified bladder mass with bulky retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy and extensive osseous metastasis.
Recommend biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
L5 vertebral body metastatic lesion indents the thecal sac.
No evidence of pathologic fracture but the lesions in the femur, especially on the right, place this patient at high risk for future complications.
MR LUMBAR SPINE [**2197-9-11**] FINDINGS: There are multiple metastatic masses throughout the imaged bones.
A mass in the left posterior elements of L1 extends into the left L1/2 neural foramen, where it may contact the left L1 nerve root.
A mass in the left posterior superior aspect of the L5 vertebral body extends into the left anterior epidural space, displacing the left L5 nerve root posteriorly.
There is an at least 3.5 cm mass in the inferior sacrum, partially imaged on the sagittal images only, which extends into the presacral soft tissues, as seen on the concurrent abdominal/pelvic CT scan.
There is no evidence of cauda equina compression in the lumbar spine.
There is a partially visualized mass in the right lower ribs, which is better seen on the concurrent CT scan.
At L4/5, there is a disc bulge and a central disc protrusion, which does not contact any nerve roots.
At L5/S1, there is a disc bulge and facet joint arthropathy, resulting in mild narrowing of the neural foramina without evidence of nerve root impingement.
There is a partially imaged mass in the bladder.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is present.
Cystic lesions are noted in the kidneys.
A mass in the left posterior elements of L1 extends into the left L1/2 neural foramen, where it may contact to the left L1 nerve root.
A mass in the posterior left vertebral body of L5 extend into the left anterior epidural space, displacing the left L5 nerve root posteriorly.
Partially imaged mass in the inferior sacrum, which extends into the presacral soft tissues.
Partially visualized bladder mass, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, cystic renal lesions, and right lower rib mass, which are better evaluated on the concurrent abdominal/pelvic CT scan.
MR CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE [**2197-9-11**]: CERVICAL SPINE: Multifocal cervical spine metastases are identified including involvement of the dens and left aspect of the C2 vertebral body with involvement of the right pedicle and facet of C2 also observed.
There is also evidence of involvement of the spinous process and right facet at C4 as well as involvement of the left pedicle and facet at C6.
Vertebral body height and alignment is maintained and there is no evidence for spinal canal narrowing or cord compression.
Cervical spinal cord signal intensity is normal.
THORACIC SPINE: There is vertebral height loss secondary to diffuse metastasis at T2 with mild retropulsion of T2 into the spinal canal, which appears to contact the anterior aspect of the thoracic cord.
There is also evidence for metastasis to T3, though Tvertebral height appears maintained at this level.
Signal intensity changes and enhancement involving the inferior aspect of T12 is noted without significant height loss and metastasis here cannot be excluded.
At T7/T8 a moderate-to-severe posterior disc protrusion appears to cause narrowing of the spinal canal and cord compression.
Smaller disc protrusions from T8/9 through T11/12 cause only mild spinal canal narrowing without compression.
Multiple rib metastases are identified including the right 7th and 12th and left 8th ribs.
Multiple prominent posterior mediastinal lymph nodes are partially imaged, though evaluation of the chest is incomplete on this study.
Multilevel cervicothoracic metastatic disease, with the most significant height loss and posterior retropulsion noted at T2 which produces moderate canal narrowing and contacts the anterior thoracic cord.
Rib metastases as described.
Multilevel thoracic degenerative disc changes, most severe at T7/8 where disc protrusion compresses the anterior thoracic spinal cord.
Prominent posterior mediastinal nodes incompletely evaluated.
LUNG SCAN [**2197-9-14**]: INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate central clumping of the tracer, consistent with diffuse airway disease.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show heterogeneity in a sub-segmental distibution, also most likely due to airways disease.
Chest x-ray shows hyperinflation without evidence of pneumonia.
There is no ventilation- perfusion mismatch to suggest a pulmonary embolus.
IMPRESSION: Low probability of pulmonary embolus.
Diffuse airway disease.
There are no focal consolidations in the left lung.
There are no large pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Increasing opacity in the right lower lung, concerning for possible infection.
BILAT FEMUR (AP AND LAT) [**2197-9-15**]:  FINDINGS: RIGHT FEMUR: There is a lytic expansile lesion in the proximal right femur located immediately inferior to the greater trochanter.
In addition, note is made of a lytic lesion in the right pubic symphysis.
There is no evidence of fracture at this time, however, these lesions are consistent with metastates and the right proximal femur lesion in particular is concerning for an impending pathologic fracture.
LEFT FEMUR: There are multiple lytic lesions in the proximal left femur, some of which are causing endosteal scalloping.
There is no evidence of acute fracture at this time, but these lesions which are consistent with metastases place the patient at risk for pathologic fracture.
There is a tiny lytic lesion along the distal left femoral cortex which may also represent metastasis.
There are multiple calvarial metastases including lesions in the left temporal bones, left occipital bone and the right parietal bone.
The lesion in the left occipital bone just to the left of midline has a dural component to it.
There is no extension into the venous sinuses at this timw.
No evidence for parenchymal metastases is seen.
There is no mass, mass effect or midline shift.
IMPRESSION: Multiple calvarial metastases, no evidence for intraparenchymal metastasis in the brain.
Bilateral lower lung opacities projecting at the level of inferior hila, and might represent worsening foci of infection.
There is an area of rib destruction surrounding by soft tissue component, seventh and fifth on the right that most likely represent metastasis, unchanged.
There is small amount of bilateral pleural effusion most likely unchanged since the prior study.
Multiple nodular opacities are seen in the lungs that might represent pulmonary nodules.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar focal opacities, progressing over the period of last couple of days, dating back to [**2197-9-11**] and may represent worsening pneumonia.
Rib metastasis.
Multiple pulmonary nodules that might represent metastatic spread as well.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a sixty two year old male presenting with confusion, urinary retention, hypernatremia and hypercalcemia found to have a large calcified bladder mass and likely metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.
1)Metastatic Cancer: Patient has evidence of significant metastatic disease.
CT and MRI demonstrate diffuse lytic lesions of the calvarium, all levels of the spine, bilateral femurs and ribs.
There is also evidence of pulmonary nodules, significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bulky pelvic lymphadenopathy (details in reports section).
CT of the pelvis demonstrates a 8.2 x 4.6x 9.6 cm bladder mass, as well as, bulky pelvic lymphadenopathy highly suggestive for a bladder cancer.
This is further supported by urine cytology demonstrating  atypical keratinizing squamous cells.
Patient was seen by the hematology/oncology consult team who felt that patient likely has terminal metastatic bladder cancer.
The urology consult team felt that bladder biopsy should be obtained by interventional radiology rather than via cystoscopy due to the risk of bleeding with cystoscopy.
The spine team was concerned about the patient's T2 compression fx with epidural extension and T7/8 disc protrusion w/ effacement of anterior cord.
The team suggested vertebroplasty for the T2 fracture rather than surgery given the widespread nature of disease.
We feel that this confusion is due to a combination of his hypercalcemuia, hypernatremia, multiple infections and his metastatic cancer.
Patient continues to be treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin and intravenous fluids, though free calcium continues to be high.
The patient's continued disorientation is likely secondary to his calcium which has been difficult to control.
3)Pneumonia:A CXR on [**9-14**] showed possible right sided infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.
In addition, the patient had an elevated white count that was trending up at the time these symptoms developed.
That patient was initially treated for community acquired pneumonia with Levaquin,however, white count continued to increase and patient's oxygen requirment became greater so his antibiotic coverage was switched to vancomycin and zosyn on [**9-15**].
At time of discharge patient is afebrile and oxygen saturation is stable on room air -mid 90's.
His WBC count remains elevated though it is unclear whether this represents persistent infection or presence of his malignancy.
4)Urinary Tract Infection: Urine positive for pansensitive E.Coli.
Patient was initially treated with Levaquin which was switched to Zosyn for empiric treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia as noted above.
Calcium has trended down following this treatment though free calcium remains elevated at 1.35 and total calcium of 11.1.
As patient's mental status cleared his PO intake also improved and he was more conscious of his thirst.
This was likely secondary to both urinary obstruction and hypovolemia.
Cr normalized with fluid resuscitation.
8)Anemia: This is likely an anemia of chronic disease secondary to the patient's malignancy.
Iron studies demonstrated normal iron level and ferritin with low TIBC and transferrin.
Patient seen by nutrition who felt that PEG placement for tube feeds would be necessary given poor caloric intake.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection TID (3 times a day) as needed for ppx.
Ibuprofen 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, headache.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Metastatic malignancy, Pneumonia, Urinary Tract Infection Secondary:Hypercalcemia, Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted becuase you had a significant change in your mental status and were not urinating.
On admission you were found to have many abnormalities in your electrolytes.
Further testing and imaging revealed that you have a metastatic cancer, which we believe to be bladder cancer.
You have a large mass in your bladder and evidence of metastatic disease throughout your spine, leg bones, and possibly your lungs.
You were seen by our oncology team who agreed that you likely have a terminal bladder cancer.
They felt that it was important for you to have a biopsy of the mass in your bladder so as it appropriately guide palliative treatment.
We have also been treating you for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection.
You have also recieived treatment for elevated calcium.
