There is mass effect and effacement of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and regional sulci.
Linear region of enhancement persists in the left precentral gyrus (3:21).
Finding is not completely evaluated on this study, but could represent cavitating infarct or gliomatosis.

In the am of [**4-29**] he had a new occurance of Afib with rate of 145.
He received a PICC line due to his poor vascular access which was confirmed by CXR.
LENIS were negative for DVTs.
