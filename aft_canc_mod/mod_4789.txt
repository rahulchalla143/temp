History of Present Illness: Pt is a 42 yo female with recent diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis now admitted for an allogenic stem cell transplant from a matched unrelated donor (her siblings were not a match) per TBI and Cytoxan protocol.
She was recently started on Danazol for her myelofibrosis ([**2118-12-23**]), which was briefly held from [**Date range (1) **] due to periorbital swelling.
Past Medical History: Past Onc History: Patient first presented with profound fatigue, nausea, and heavy vaginal bleeding [**10-10**], six weeks after arriving from [**Country 651**].
She was found to be pancytopenic and had peripheral blood smear showing extensive teardrop forms and leukoerythroblastic smear (teardrop cells, nucleated RBCs, immature WBCs) prompted bone marrow biopsy, which revealed myelofibrosis.
Unclear etiology, but may be secondary to post-polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]/essential thrombocytosis myeloid metaplasia, and JAK-2 test was negative.
CT showed splenomegaly without lymphadenopathy.
echo was performed and did not suggest any pulmonary artery hypertension of systolic/diastolic dysfunction.
Hepatosplenomegaly, which was noted upon admission but became less clinically obvious upon transfer to the BMT inpatient floor, may have been due to extramedullary hematopoeisis.
PNH Pneumonia Difficult crossmatch due to antibodies  Social History: She lives in [**Location 86**] with her husband and 13-year-old son.
Family History: She has no history of hematologic malignancies.
Denies any family history of leukemia, lymphoma, or cancers.

Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 42 yo female with recent diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis now admitted for an allogenic SCT per TBI and Cytoxan protocol.
# Myelofibrosis for allo SCT:  TBI/Cytoxan protocol was followed.
Pt also had diarrhea (C diff was neg x 3).
Patient developed significant side effects from chemotherapy, including severe mucositis requiring fentanyl PCA, and cardiomyopathy likely from cytoxan (see below for details).
Resultant pancytopenia from myelosuppression requiring multiple transfusions to kept Hct > 21 and platelets > 10.
The patient had multiple documented alloantibodies to blood products, in particular high platelet reactive antibodies.
On [**3-3**], patient developed significant consumptive reactions to platelet transfusions which were later determined to be due to antibodies.
HLA C type platelets were ordered.
# Cardiopulmonary Collapse: Patient was acutely diaphoretic on [**3-5**] with abdominal pain.
Stat upright film revealed no free air.
Patient became unresponsive, hypotensive to 50's, and desaturated.
# Fever: Pt had fevers during the conditioning phase prior to receiving SCT.
IR evaluated pt's central lines and dental eval was done as pt had recent dental procedures and complained of a toothache.
On [**3-2**], patient again developed fever during platelet transfusion and fluconazole was changed to micafungin.
Patient subsequently complained of abdominal pain with intermittent vomiting.
Complete abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly but did not reveal any acute pathology.
Intermittent fevers continued, and the patient was started on flagyl due to concern for an intrabdominal source.
Given severe mucositis, there was concern for typhlitis, CT abdoman without contrast could not be completed before patient had passed .
# Anemia: Pt has persistent anemia from her disease.
Pt has multiple documented alloantibodies which are clinically significant and may lead to hemolytic transfusion reactions.
On [**3-1**], patient was noted to have symptoms of acute congestive heart failure, complaining of new orthopnea.
On exam, she was noted to have elevated JVP, hyperdynamic PMI with S3 and evidence of pulmonary edema.
Repeat ECHO, showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global hypokinesis of left ventricle.
EKG showed no evidence of acute ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative, and cardiomyopathy was attributed to high dose cytoxan.
# Mucositis: Following Cytoxan and TBI, patient developed severe mucositis with significant diarrhea and odynophagia.
Later in hospital course, when patient developed neutropenic fever, she was fluconazole was switch to micafungin.
Also started on protonix, given risk of stress ulcer prophylaxis.
On [**3-4**], patient developed severe abdominal pain despite PCA.
