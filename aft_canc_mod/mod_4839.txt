A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed on the right due to outflow obstruction from the bladder mass.
Imaging revealed right sided hydroureteronephorsis for which a percutaneous nephostomy tube was placed.
Of note, the patient was also found to have a duplicated right ureter.
He was readmitted to the CVICU on POD #2 for rapid atrial fibrillatoion that resulted in hypotension as well as a tender abdomen.
