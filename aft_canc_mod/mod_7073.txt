Immunostains of the tumor  are positive for HepPar 1, unabsorbed CEA, and CAM 5.2; and negative for cytokeratins AE1:AE3, CK7 and CK20, with satisfactory controls.
This is likely due to spontaneous rupture of a mass in the dome of the liver where active extravasation of contrast is noted.
Multiple masses throughout the liver as described above with tumor thrombus and bland thrombus in the left portal vein.
Extensive esophageal and retroperitoneal varices and splenomegaly consistent with portal hypertension.
CXR [**2133-2-4**] Markedly reduced pleural effusion with persistent small bilateral pleural effusion.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis slightly more prominent.
There is no pneumothorax.
No focal consolidation.
This procedure carried no complication, but on hospital day 3, the patient complained of increasing abdominal pain.
Stat CT showed active bleeding from a ruptured HCC in the dome of the liver.
Pathology showed multiple foci of hepatocellular carcinoma.
SPONTANEOUS RUPTURE OF HCC AND HEMOPERITONEUM On [**2133-1-29**], the patient noted worsening abdominal and right shoulder pain.
An emergent CT was obtained which showed ruptured HCC with active extravasation of contrast into the peritoneal cavity.
MICU COURSE: The patient was admitted to the medical ICU after a CT scan performed due to abdominal pain following a transcutatneous liver biopsy shoed active bleeding from his liver.
His MICU course was notable for hypoxia, which was felt secondary to splinting nad lower lobe collapse in setting of diaphragmatic irritation.
ASCITES and PLEURAL EFFUSION: The patient had increasing abdominal distention from the bleed.
CHRONIC PAIN CONTROL: The patient received his MS Contin and PO dilaudid as per his home regimen.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for encephalopathy.
Disp:*qs ML(s)* Refills:*3*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hemophilia A Hepatocellular Carcinoma  Secondary diagnoses: Hepatitis C HIV   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You had a spontaneous bleed from another section of your liver that required embolization and monitoring in the intensive care unit.
It is felt that your shoulder pain is likely due to referred pain from the site of your liver biopsy and diaphragmatic irritation.
