Was seen at OSH ([**Hospital3 2568**]) where a head CT and MRI showed a left sided brain mass with midline shift so pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment  Past Medical History: denies   Social History: does not smoke, drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.
currently unemployed   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: PE: VS 99.2 76 140/91 98% RA NAD A&Ox2 PERRL EOMI CN's [**3-22**] intact Right sided pronator drift No deficit on finger-nose-finger Significant expressive aphasia Motor: [**6-13**] throughout both UE's and LE's Sensation intact throughout both UE's and LE's  On Discharge: Alert and attentive Right hemiparesis significant aphasia, unable to follow commands  Pertinent Results: CT head [**2201-6-20**]: Large L temporal lesion with vasogenic edema and cytic or necrotic regions within lesion  MRI head [**2201-6-23**]: Large left frontal temporoparietal complex enhancing lesion causing mass effect over the left lateral ventricle, midline shift to the right, and dilatation of the right lateral ventricle due to obstruction at foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Differential diagnosis may represent glioblastoma multiforme or other high-grade glioma.
Metastatic disease is less likely but also in the differential diagnosis.
CT Head [**2201-6-23**]: IMPRESSION:  Expected post-surgical changes status post left frontal craniotomy, with subcutaneous emphysema, small amount of pneumocephalus, and possible small hemorrhage in the biopsy bed.
The presence of hemorrhage is difficult to assess, given the intrinsically hyperattenuating character of large portions of the tumor, as seen on the OSH CT.
Otherwise, there is little change in comparison to the recent MRI, which demonstrated a large, complex left frontotemporoparietal enhancing lesion and two satellite nodules.
There is unchanged mass effect with 13 mm rightward shift of midline structures, dilatation of the right lateral ventricle due to obstruction at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**], and left uncal and transtentorial herniation.
No evidence of new large hemorrhage or infarction.
Lungs are essentially clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o M with 6 months or worsening headaches, change in MS, presents from OSH with large L temporal lesion.
He was placed on 20mg of decadon and admitted to the neurosurgery service for monitoring and treatment.
On exam, patient had expressive aphasia and R pronator drift, but was otherwise stable.
[**Date range (1) 102374**] Patient's mental status declined marked by increased lethargy and confusion.
A CT of the head was obtained that showed increased cerebral edema and midline shift.
His mental status did not improve and on [**6-26**] a discussion was undertaken with the family who did not want to pursue further aggressive care given patient's clinical status and diagnosis of malignant glioma.
He was without complaints of pain on the weekend [**6-27**] to [**2201-6-28**].
On [**7-2**] he developed a mild fever that was managed with acetaminophen.
