#RADIOLOGY CXR ([**2127-6-16**]): ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The left lung is well expanded and shows a left perihilar opacity..
The right lung shows right lower lobe collapse associated with a large right effusion.
IMPRESSION: Large right effusion with associated atelectasis.
Left upper lobe peri-hilar opacity could represent pneumonia.
Increased size of subcapsular hepatic collection containing both low-density and high-density material, most consistent with a hematoma.
There is no evidence of intravenous contrast material extravasation into this collection to suggest active hemorrhage.
Unchanged small left adrenal nodule.
Moderate-to-large volume ascites.
Unchanged large right and decreased small left pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, right greater than left.
[**6-18**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen  [**6-18**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Bilateral areas of atelectasis, small right pleural effusion.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
No appreciable change or may be potential slight increase in the right pleural effusion is demonstrated.
[**6-20**] Abd U/S: IMPRESSION:   No hydronephrosis.
Overall, there has been no change from the most recent CT scan.
[**6-22**] KUB:   One limited supine portable AP view of the abdomen demonstrates multiple dilated bowel loops, most likely of the small bowel up to 7 cm in diameter with no evidence of rectosigmoid air, concerning for obstruction.
[**6-22**] CXR: There is no change in right partially loculated pleural effusion and left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
[**6-23**] CT abd/pelvis w/ oral contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Increasing ascites compared to the previous examination, now large in volume.
Liver masses better seen on [**2127-6-16**] CT, as are changes from Whipple's.
Brief Hospital Course: **Patient was made comfort measures only during hospitalization  []BRIEF CLINICAL COURSE: Pt is a 69 yo pancreatic cancer (on paclitaxel, last dose 6/25) s/p Whipple ([**3-/2125**]) originally presented with jaundice and biliary obsruction on [**6-16**].
Despite apparently good drainage and multiple IR repositionings, his course has been complicated with persistent hyperbilirubinemia.
He also developed MSSA bacteremia on [**6-16**] currently on nafcillin (TTE negative).
Coudet was placed given history of prostate cancer and previous radiation therapy, again without return.
Patient then became acutely hypotensive from SBP's 90's to SBP's low 70's this morning.
Urology was consulted given concern for acute obstruction causing IVC obstruction, however after evaluation, urology was confident the patient was actually anuric and bladder scan was eroneous given large abdomen.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for presumed sepsis on [**6-21**].
Patient complained of persistent fatigue, relatively unchanged over the last several weeks, but otherwise was without complaint.
He denies abdominal pain or nausea.
No diarrhea or obstipation.
He does endorse mild cough during this hospitalization.
Nephrology thought the etiology of his renal failure was either AIN from Nafcillin vs. ATN from hypotension.
His hospital course was also complicated by an ileus which caused significant nausea and relieved by an NG tube.
On the morning of [**6-24**], he experienced significant nausea with movement which was relieved with the NG tube.
He otherwise had no complaints.
[]ISSUES: # Hypotension: Patient with profound acute hypotension but relatively asymptomatic.
Presumed due to sepsis given mulitple possible sources.
# Anuria/[**Last Name (un) **]: Patient with acute onset anuria.
Known urinary incontinence following radiation prostate cancer.
Biliary obstruction: Likely due to hepatic mets.
S/p IR guided PTBD [**2127-6-6**] and multiple revisions.
# Elevated INR: Elevated to 2.1 on transfer to MICU, this reversed with Vitamin K and therefore was thought to be nutritional.
Pt's coumadin was held due to bleeding risk.
# Cough: Significant R sided pleural effusion s/p diagnostic thoracentesis on [**2127-6-18**].
Prostate Cancer: s/p radiation, on dutasteride at home (not on formulary, so held)  #.

You were found to have a complicated blockage within your biliary system and a revision of the drain placement was attempted.
You were also found to have fluid in your lungs which was therapeutically removed to improve your breathing.
You were transferred to the ICU for low blood pressure and poor oxygenation of your blood.
