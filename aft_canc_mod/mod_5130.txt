Admission Date:  [**2197-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-12-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-9-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: liver biopsy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 woman with no past medical history who was in her usual state of good health until the weekend before [**Holiday **] when she developed nausea and bilious vomitting x 6.
There was no hematemesis.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] she was seen, she was sent to the [**Location (un) **] emergency room for dehydration and further workup.
She was admitted to their ICU for control of her hypertension and was diagnosed with a troponin leak and an e.coli urinary tract infection.
At that time, a CT abdomen showed a liver with a hyperechoic foci.
She was then sent out to the floor with a plan for a liver biopsy but she developed acute change in mental status.
An MRI was performed that showed multiple acute and subacute embolic lesions.
At that time, she was started on decadron, enalapril, and metoprolol and transferred to this facility for diagnosis of her presumed metastatic process.
ROS: + sweats/fevers/epigastric pain.
10 lb weight loss over last 4 weeks but prior to that 10 lb weight gain in association with stressful job.
No rashes or chest pain.
No smoking, illicits.
Mother died of CHF 12 days later.
Physical Exam: T 98.8 BP 163/88 HR 87 O2 sat 96% on shovel mask wt 117.7 Gen: NAD obese woman in bed, appears alert HEENT: cannot assess MM, NCAT, diaphoretic, PERRLA, no scleral icteris or conjunctival injection Neck: no LAD, supple Cor: RRR no M/R/G Pulm: CTAB anteriorly Breast: fibronodular tissue noted, no axilllary LAD, peau d'orange, nipple discharge, or discrete masses Abd: obese, soft NT ND decreased BS Ext: WWP, left great toenail with ecchymosis, feet with multiple hyperpigmented irregular macules.
OSH chest CT: multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules OSH abdominal U/S: multiple gallstones up to 1 cm, borderline thickening of gallbladder wall 3mm, multiple round hypoechoic foci in both lobes of liver, omental nodularity suspicious of intraperitoneal metastasis, 14 cm fundal fibroid Transthoracic Echo: EF 70% no focal wall motion abnormalities .
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Multiple chronic infarctions in diffuse vascular territories.
This appearance is most consistent with an embolic phenomenon versus venous infarct.
MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging would be more sensitive for the detection of an acute infarction.
MRI/MRA Brain [**12-26**]: There are multiple small-to-moderate sized infarcts throughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres as well as the punctate left midbrain infarct.
The distribution is consistent with a history of embolic disease.
No major arterial total occlusion is seen.
No major venous occlusion is seen.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**12-26**]: No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
EEG [**12-26**]: This is an abnormal EEG due to the disorganized and slow background with bursts of generalized delta slowing.
This EEG suggests an encephalopathic pattern, which may occur with infections, ischemia, toxic metabolic abnormalities or medications.
Echo [**12-26**]: Asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Liver cytology [**12-28**]: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CSF [**12-28**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 woman who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital with acute changes in mental status in association with emesis and NSTEMI.
# Altered Mental Status: Differential diagnosis includes posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) vs. ischemic vs. metastatic vs. embolic.
LFTs elevated but not likely enough to cause this level of alteration.
CA 125 very high and consistent with metastatic process.
No evidence of active seizure on continuous EEG.
# Metastatic disease: Liver, omental, and lung nodules in setting of elevated Ca [**10**]-9 and CEA are consistent with probable cancer of unknown etiology.
A liver biopsy was consistent with signet ring adenocarcinoma.
Oncologic process could have been associated with possible non-infectious endocarditis leading to cerebral embolic infarcts.
# Fever, tachypnea: The patient developed a fever on [**12-27**], which continued throughout the rest of the admission.
Possible etiologies considered were infection/sepsis (especially given one episode of hypotension), vasculitis (but no elevated vasculitis markers), known metastatic adenocarcinoma, PRES (see above) and dysregulation from neurologic insult.
STEMI vs NSTEMI, evidence of old IMI on EKG.
ECHO on [**12-26**] demonstrated wall motion abnormality in LAD territory, new compared to ECHO at OSH.
Cardiology was consulted, and they indicated that she was not a candidate for cath, thus was medically managed without heparin given neurologic condition and risk of bleed.
Her hypertension was particularly labile, which was thought to be secondary to autonomic dysfunction.
# Rash: She developed a rash on her back, arms, and belly, thought to be consistent with contact dermatitis but other etiologies include vasculitis vs. PRES vs. drug rash were considered.
Given her extremely poor prognosis from stage IV metastatic adenocarcinoma, unrelenting fevers, and unresolving altered mental status, the husband wished to pursue hospice.
