She was found to be hypertensive and intubated at the scene and resuscitated with IV fluid boluses.
Prior to this, the patient had neck swelling for 2 days which occurred in conjunction with administration of Actos for newly diagnosed diabetes.
A CT scan of the chest and neck revealed a goiter with airway compression.
TSH was elevated at 7.13.
She was transferred here for a planned sternotomy with mass resection.
Endocrine was consulted given the patient's diabetes and hypothyroid state.
On [**2173-4-12**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy and partial sternotomy with right total and left subtotal thyroidectomy.
However, attempts to re-intubate her at the end with assistance of  tube changer were unsuccessful using 8.0, 7.5, 7.0 and even a 6.5 endotracheal tube and it was presumed that the patient had an extrinsic mass or perhaps extrinsic pathology to the trachea.
At this time, it was noted that she had diffusely abnormal mucosa of her subglottic space and significantly narrow tracheal lumen down to the distal trachea.
The pathology showed the patient to have papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with extrathyroidal invasion and nodal involvement.
At this time, the patient was found to have nosocomial pneumonia with sputum cultures positive for Acinetobacter, pan-resistant, as well as Enterobacter cloacae, pansensitive.
The patient remained stable and on [**2173-4-16**], returned to the OR for bronchoscopy with tracheal dilation (balloon and rigid) with tracheostomy.
Postoperatively, chest x-ray showed that the patient had developed a right pneumothorax, displacing the right hemidiaphragm and the mediastinum, collapsing the right lung secondary to barotrauma versus the tracheal dilation procedure.
A right chest tube was placed as well as her central line was changed over wire and post chest tube chest x-ray showed marked improvement of the large right pneumothorax.
On [**4-17**], chest x-ray showed near resolution of her right pneumothorax.
Given her high grade of bacteremia, a CT sinus was recommended by Infectious Disease.
This showed mucosal thickening of both maxillary sinuses and opacification of the ethmoid and sphenoid air cells.
No fluid levels were noted.
Additionally, there is opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Multifocal opacities in the left lower lobe, right lower lobe and right upper lobe were concerning for pneumonia.
A small right-sided pneumothorax persisted with the right chest tube in place.
Her chest tube was removed and post pull chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
Over the next few days, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was uneventful save for a fever spike in which blood cultures were negative, sputum cultures showed persistent Acinetobacter infection and urine cultures showed yeast.
ENT was consulted for evaluation of possible vocal cord paralysis.
On fiberoptic exam, it was noted that the patient had significant edema and pooling of secretions above her vocal cords.
Over the next few days, the patient was stable and remained afebrile on Unasyn and amikacin.
Of note, I had no interaction with this patient's care.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Papillary cancer with positive nodes status post sternotomy and partial right and total left thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**], status post rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement on [**2173-4-14**], status post open tracheostomy on [**2173-4-16**], status post bronchoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2173-5-3**].
Later, she will be contact[**Name (NI) **] to arrange for overnight admission for placement.
