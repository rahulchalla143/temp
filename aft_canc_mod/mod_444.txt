Pt without no acute complaints this evening.
With review of systems negative for fevers, chills, dizziness, headaches, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, dysuria, but mild LE swelling but less than prior per pt.
Pt states no changes in baseline roscea sx.
At this point, he was noticed to have an increase in his IgG level and was started on Thalidimide and Decadron.
The patient continued on this regimen until [**2151-9-13**], at which point he was started on Revlimid daily due to disease progression.
It was decided that the patient should pursue an allogenic SCT, and a donor was found who had a [**8-23**] HLA match.
[**2148-6-26**]- High-dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization.
[**7-17**]- High-dose Melphalan followed by an autologous stem cell tranplant.
[**6-18**]- Due to relapsed disease initiated Thalidomide with periodic Decadron pulses.
[**5-21**]- Revlimid was added with 4th and 5th cycle of chemotherapy with Velcade/Decadron/Cytoxan  [**7-21**]- Day 12 Velcade was held with 5th cycle d/t worsening neuropathy.
2)GERD 3)Bilateral cataracts 4)Seasonal allergies 5)History of asymptomatcic non-sustained PVC's 6)Rosacea of the face with ophthalmologic inflammation.
No scleral icterus.
No conjunctival injection.
mild erythema on tip of eyelids.
No oral ulcers.
Neck:  Supple, no LAD, no JVP elevation.
Abdomen:  soft, NT, ND, NABS Extremities:  +[**12-15**] pitting LE edema bilat Neurological:  alert and oriented X 3, CN II-XII intact.
EKG on admission reviewed - sinus in 90s with occac pac, no st/tw changes .
CT head [**2-28**]: No acute intracranial pathology, specifically evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CT head [**3-12**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or acute major territorial infarct.
CT head [**4-1**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CT chest [**2-18**]:There is no pneumonia or pleural effusion.
New moderate ascites, anasarca, small left pleural effusion, small pericardial effusion and increasing right pleural effusion.
New dependent opacity in right lower lobe, immediately adjacent to pleural fluid, favoring atelectasis over acute infection.
Dependent high density within the gallbladder, probably due to gallbladder sludge as reported on prior abdominal ultrasound.
If there are symptoms referable to the right upper quadrant, consider ultrasound examination.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, right more than left with slight interval worsening of adjacent consolidation most likely representing atelectasis with the remote possibility of infectious process.
Interval almost complete resolution of pericardial effusion.
Multiple rib fractures and small lytic lesions within the spine that most likely are consistent with known multiple myeloma.
Interval improvement in the degree of chest wall soft tissue edema.
CT chest [**4-1**]: Interval development of widespread patchy consolidation throughout the lung parenchyma is suggestive of pneumonia-possibly atypical given the clinical presentation.
Pulmonary edema is considered less likely.
Within the limitations of a non- contrast examination, there is no focal abnormality seen.
There is no intra-or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Extensive ascites is identified throughout the abdomen.
The small bowel is also decompressed but again appears relatively featureless, but subtle disease within the bowel would be difficult to ascertain given the absence of oral and intravenous contrast.
Extensive ground- glass and airspace opacities within the lung bases, likely infectious or inflammatory.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No focal liver masses.
Mild-to-moderate abdominal fluid.
Small right pleural effusion.
Persistent splenomegaly.
Mild decrease in the amount of ascites compared to prior study.
This area was injected by 15cc of 1: 10,000 epinephrine injection for hemostasis.This is suggestive of hemorrhagic gastritis from possible CMV infection.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus Abnormal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
MRI w and w/o contrast [**2153-4-19**]: There is no evidence of acute infarction.
There is no evidence of edema.
There is no shift of normally placed midline structures.
There are bilateral tiny hyperintensities in FLAIR and T2 subcortical in the white matter, periventricular, suggesting mild chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is no abnormal enhancement.
There is no hemorrhage.
There is a tiny 5 mm round lesion, series 9, image 20, suggesting a tiny meningioma in the left frontal lobe.
There is bilateral mastoid air cell opacification.
[**2153-4-9**]: 1,090 copies/ml [**2153-4-15**]: negative [**2153-4-16**]: negative [**2153-4-20**]: negative   Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo man with multiple myeloma admitted for allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with Antigen A mismatch to receive Bulsulfan (dose adjusted for goal of 900) and Cytoxan for conditioning with a complicated hospital course.
On [**4-28**], he was transferred to the ICU for worsening hypoxia.
There was evidence of engraftment with a return of WBC counts to normal starting in mid [**Month (only) **].
Immunosuppression was mantained with cyclosporine until [**3-2**] when it was stopped due to concern that it's vasoconstricting effects led to acute tubular necrosis.
Steroids were then added back 8 weeks after transplant in addition to cyclosporine due to concern for the development of acute graft versus host disease manifested by increasing bilirubin, diarrhea and a very mild rash.
His diarrhea eventually resolved and his total bilirubin, while elevated, remained stable rangin 2.8-3.1 and he was continued on low dose steroids.
As noted above, he later developed worsening hyperbilirubinemia which was then attributed to GVHD.
Ultrasound revealed a complete occulsion of the left internal jugular vein.
On [**3-25**], the patient was found to have a large amount of bright red blood from his rectum as well as a hematocrit drop of >6 points with a limited submaximal response to transfusion.
While in the ICU, the patient continued to bleed with hypotension requiring pressor support and intubation.
EGD was done on multiple occasions and revealed large clots resting on a highly friable mucosa.
Repeat CMV VL were negative twice (separated by 5 days), however, patient was continued on treatment level dosing given LP suggestive of viral meningitis.
# Acute Tubular Necrosis requiring Hemodialysis:.
Muddy brown casts were noted on UA consistent with ATN from a unclear etiology.
The differential for his ATN included cylosporine vs micafungin (started for febrile neutropenia) vs vancomycin (started for febrile neutropenia).
Cyclosporine was held starting [**2-20**] but remained theraputic for nearly a week after discontinuation and was eventually restarted as described above.
The patient remained on HD three times weekly for several weeks until the third week in [**Month (only) 547**] during which he demonstrated an overwhelming post-ATN diuresis with rapid decrease in his creatinine towards normal.
The BUN elevation was felt to be secondary to TPN and steroids, and was not felt to be indicative of renal dysfunction.
# Supraventricular tachycardia: Asymptomatic.
After he was transferred to the MICU a second time on [**4-10**] for respiratory distress, he developed atrial fibrillation/flutter with ventricular rates in the 140-150s.
With this treatment, his rate was well-controlled, although he continued to have runs of irregular narrow complex tachycardia, most frequently in the setting of bladder spasm/pain which eventually resolved with oxybutynin and patient remained rate controlled on oral diltiazem.
# Febrile neutropenia, Fevers post-engraftment, Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Prior to engraftment, the patient was covered broadly with antibiotics and antifungals for febrile neutropenia of unknown source.
No source was identified but coverage remained broad and all lines were removed and later replaced.
As above, he was eventually found to have CMV viremia which may have been the source of his post-engraftment fever.
In addition, after initial extubation during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, he was noted to be hypoxic and in respiratory distress requiring re-intubation.
Once back on the floors, he was noted to have diffuse ground glass infiltrate and underwent bronchoscopy with broncheoalveolar lavage.
The desaturation was felt to be due to volume overload versus worsening pulmonary infection (no microbe isolated).
Meropenem was discontinued with goal of stopping antibiotics but patient spike a fever again and it was restarted.
# Altered Mental Status: Throughout his hospitalization, Mr [**Known lastname 13039**] had a fluctuating mental status in the setting of severe liver and renal malfunction as well as a large quantity of medications.
Given his delirium, dilaudid and acyclovir were held with improvement in his mental status.
While some aspects of his exam such as attention and orientation were consistent with delirium (again, related to meds, uremia, long hospitalization), neuro exam was notable for left-sided neglect and peripheral visual field cuts.
Head CT was negative for acute process and MRI, although limited study due to motion artifact, did not show acute abnormality.
A repeat MRI after transfer back to the floor again was difficult to read given motion artifact but showed no diffusion abnormality or abnormal enhancement.
A tiny left frontal lobe meningioma was seen.
# GERD: Continued Pantoprazole until the second week in [**Month (only) 547**] at which time he was switched to ranitidine for concern that PPI was the etiology of his persistent thrombocytopenia.
# Bladder Spasm and Pain: During his second MICU course ([**Date range (1) 13043**]), he complained intermittently of suprapubic pain, and was noted during these periods to become extremely uncomfortable, often tachycardic to the 130-150s; the pain was felt to trigger SVT, as described above.
Ultrasound showed moderate ascites but no bladder pathology.
His pain improved with anticholinergic tx, and eventually the foley was removed.
