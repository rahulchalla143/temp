Pre-operative work-up, including whole body PET-CT and brain MRI showed 2 lesions, a left adrenal and left lower lobe mass.
Pre-operative assesment confirmed non-small cell cancer with lung primary and given recent literature supporting surgical intervention in oligometastatic patients, the decision to proceed with a left lower lobe resection was elected.
Pre-operative PFTs and cardiac risk stratification revealed the patient to be an adequate candidate for the procedure and on [**2106-12-20**], the patient had an uncomplicated L-thoracotomy, left lower lobe lobectomy with a mediastinal lymph node dissection.

On POD#1, the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation (Afib) with a rapid ventricular response (RVR).
She was symptomatic with dizziness and lightheadedness as well as palpatations.
While in the [**Last Name (LF) 58879**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MI protocol with cardiac markers was unrevealing and she was aggressively diuresed secondary to possible volume overload.
Re-bolus of IV amiodarone and continuation of her beta-blockade was successful in keeping her rate controlled initially, but, she remained in atrial fibrillation.
Follow-up CXR after tube thoracostomy removal revealed no PTX and adequate re-expansion of her left lung.
Lastly, she is to be discharged with home oxygen, keflex for superficial phlebitis of her IV site x7 days, lovenox injections to be administered by VNA with daily blood draws for INR also drawn by VNA.
