Patient also has history of renal artery stenosis diagnosed approximately one year ago, although ultrasound done in [**Month (only) **] did not show any evidence of stenosis.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patient does have baseline level of edema on her lower extremities R>L, and there has been no change recently.

**FINAL REPORT [**2169-9-28**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2169-9-28**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific QRS widening and diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is mild residual, right greater than left.
Retrocardiac consolidation is either atelectasis or pneumonia.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Marked kyphoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine and related DJD is noted.
There is a moderate-sized cardiac enlargement with dense atherosclerotic aortic calcifications.
Improving parenchymal aeration with mild residual pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: #Hypertensive Urgency: Patient had similar episode in [**Month (only) **] or [**Month (only) 205**] with hypertensive urgency and flash pulmonary edema, but little support for RAS.
Likely similar etiology to current shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.
No change in mental status, no vision changes or neurologic deficits, creatinine close to baseline.
Patient has history of hypertension with evidence of LVH.
Likely etiology of exacerbation of essential hypertension appears to be transition from clonidine patch to po.
Possible rebound hypertension in setting of inappropriate clonidine dosing.
No recent change in diet.
Pt has a questionable history of renal artery stenosis per OSH records, however ultrasound in [**Month (only) **] was negative and per nephrologist, he does not believe she has RAS.
BPs well controlled morning after admission with home medication regimen, no longer requiring nitro gtt.
#Pulmonary Edema: Acute elevation of BP decreasing forward flow, likely caused flash pulmonary edema; similar to previous episode in [**Month (only) **].
Denies chest pain, cardiac enzymes negative (troponin minimally elevated in setting of CRI), perfusion scan on [**2169-8-7**] was normal.
Does have some EKG changes possibly suggestive of ischemia, although more likely related to LV strain.
Symptoms of SOB have improved and patient appears less volume overloaded than on admission after over 2L negative.
CXR questioned possible pneumonia in right lobe on [**2169-9-25**], but afebrile and no history of cough, leukocytosis has resolved.
Clinical picture appears to coincide with pulmonary edema secondary CHF and proBNP elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 19353**]; however, will monitor for signs of infection.
# CRI - Baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.7.
Mildly elevated to 1.8 upon admission and up to 2.1 today.
Also has proteinuria on UA.
Could be secondary to hypertensive nephropathy, HbA1c at 6.3%.
# Anemia - Patient has baseline Hct in high 20s, however did decrease to 23.8 this AM.
No obvious source of bleeding, guiac negative, no abdominal complaints, no hematuria.
[**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to dilution as increase mobilization of fluid into vasculature.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia can be seen with hypertensive urgency, however less likely.
Anemia will be followed as outpatient by heme.
#Hypothyroidism: If over treated with medication, could cause hypertensive urgency.
# Thrombocytosis - has been treated with anagrelide.
#Diabetes Mellitus: questioned history of DM with previous HbA1c at 7, it is 6.5% here.
