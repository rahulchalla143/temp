Imaging: [**2200-3-12**] EGD: Large hiatal hernia Dieulafoy lesion in the fundus (endoclip) Normal mucosa in the duodenum Angioectasia in the second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**2200-3-14**] Colonoscopy: Polyp in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the rectum (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  [**2200-3-18**] Colonoscopy: Ulcer in the colon (endoclip) Polyp in the colon Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon  Pathology: A.
(Sigmoid colon polypectomy): Hyperplastic polyp.
Brief Hospital Course: 80yo male w/ CAD s/p DES to the LAD [**2200-1-16**], Afib s/p CVA in [**2197**] and distant h/o PUD, who presented with 5 days of worsening weakness, dark bloody stools.
# Gastrointestinal bleeding and acute blood loss anemia: The patient presented with melena and was found to have a Hct of 20.8 when he came into the ED.
The patient underwent EGD on [**3-12**] that showed a Dieulafoy lesion that was clipped.
He had no further bloody bowel movements in the intensive care unit and was transferred to medicine [**Hospital1 **].
Per the gastroenterology team, the patient underwent a colonoscpy to rule out a lower cause of GIB, as he had been off warfarin and had a subtherapeutic INR.
He underwent a colonoscopy on [**3-14**] which showed a polyp in the sigmoid colon (s/p piecemeal polypectomy) and a polyp in the rectum (which was biopsied).
After 24 hrs post-biopsy without any bloody bowel movements, he was restarted back on the warfarin with a heparin bridge.
Heparin gtt was switched to lovenox after 24 hours without bleed in anticipation of discharge.
The patient began to have multiple bloody bowel movements (30-40cc at a time) with down-trending hct.
He was monitored off anticoagulation, but continued to have BRBPR and underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**3-18**].
The sigmoidoscopy showed the previously biposed friable polyp with a pinpoint ulcer with no stigmata of bleeding at the area of prior biopsy.
A post-biopsy ulcer was also seen at the site of the prior piecemeal polypectomy in the sigmoid colon and one endoclip was successfully applied.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient remained in Afib with good rate control.
Patient has a CHADS2 score of 4 and ischemic stroke in [**2197**].
Given his recent bleeding after colonoscopy, his cardiologist (Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]) suggested holding the warfarin for 2 weeks, and that the patient would then follow up with him 2 weeks after discharge to re-evaluate starting warfarin again.
# Coronary artery disease s/p anterior MI in [**2187**]:  The patient had a recent intervention w/ DES to mid-LAD [**2200-1-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# BPH: The patient's tamusolin was held initially in the setting of GI bleed but was subsequently restarted while in the ICU.
Given his blood pressures remained well controlled off Lisinopril, he was discharged off lisinopril with instructions to follow up with his PCP to discuss further blood pressure management.
Transitional Issues: - GI f/u for rectal biopsy results ([**Last Name (LF) 25402**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely need removal after off anti-coagulation) - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], cardiologist, regarding reinitiation of anticoagulation for afib in 2 weeks (appointment in place) - f/u with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: re-initiation of Lisinopril which was stopped in the setting of GI bleed  Medications on Admission: - Plavix 75mg daily - lisinopril 10mg daily - nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL PRN - pantoprazole 20mg daily - propranolol - PRN symptomatic - rosuvastatin 10mg daily - tamsulosin 0.4mg daily - trazodone 150mg QHS - vernicline 1mg [**Hospital1 **] (started recently) - warfarin - 5mg one day a week, rest of week (6 days) 3.75mg daily.
7. trazodone 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
10. propranolol 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for palpitations.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to dieulafoy lesion Colonic and rectal polyp Lower gastrointestinal bleed secondary to polyp biopsy  Secondary Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
On endoscopy, you were found to have a lesion believed to have caused your bleeding which was clipped to prevent further bleeding.
On colonoscopy, you were found to have a polyp in your colon that was removed, and a polyp in your rectum that was biopsied.
You had a repeat colonoscopy which showed a small ulcer near the prior biopsy site, presumably where the bleeding was coming from.
This small ulcer was clipped and you stopped having bloody bowel movements.
