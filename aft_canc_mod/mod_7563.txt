Of note he has a skin graft in the leg after that is somewhat discolored so he was seen by dermatology, who biopsed the lesion.
The biopsy showed some evidence of a recent ecchymosis but no evidence of active infection (special stains for microorganisms were negative) and felt that the patient could go forward with transplant at this point.
He also had a recent eye stye which was treated by I and D then a 40 day course of tobradex.
ROS [+] per HPI [-] fevers, sweats, chills, recent infection, sore throat, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

As this was thought to be some progression towards leukemia in the interim before transplant it was decided to give him a cycle of Dacogen.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
TTE [**2191-7-4**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation directed anteriorly.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-6-6**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Liver Ultrasound [**2191-7-6**] for elevated LFTs IMPRESSION: 1.
6 mm angiomyolipoma in the left kidney.
CT abd [**2191-7-9**] for elevated LFTs & neutropenic fever IMPRESSION: 1.
No CT explanation for patient's symptoms.
CT chest [**2191-7-10**] for hypotension & neutropenic fever FINDINGS:  The thyroid gland is homogeneous.
There is no consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy.
There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
The keratinocyte apoptosis may be the result of recent cytotoxic therapy.
Possible diagnostic considerations include early evolving drug eruption, viral exanthem, and graft versus host disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with history of myelodysplasia with refractory anemia and excess blasts admitted for allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Course was complicated by neutropenic fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, drug rash, and blepharitis.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome: 47M with transfusion dependent MDS (RAEB-2) diagnosed in [**2190-12-29**].
As this was thought to be some progression towards leukemia in the interim before transplant it was decided to give him a cycle of Dacogen which was started on [**2191-5-2**].
Transplant was delayed for question of right shin skin graft infection (evaluated by dermatology) and left eye stye.
Overnight following transfusion of graft, patient became febrile and developed atrial fibrillation with RVR as discussed below, as well as on a second occasion (D+12) just prior to engraftment.
Tacrolimus levels were monitored closely, patient received prophylaxis with acyclovir and micafungin, and neupogen was stopped upon engraftment.
Antibiotics for neutropenic fever were stopped following engraftment as discussed below.
- Continue Acyclovir and antifungal prophylaxis - Continue 2mg [**Hospital1 **] Tacrolimus, goal level [**4-7**] - Follow up in hematology/oncology clinic  # Neutropenic fever: No source identified on CT of chest ([**2191-7-10**]) or CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2191-7-9**]).
Antibiotics were stopped following engraftment and patient was stable and afebrile thereafter.
# Afib with RVR: Transfusion reaction vs. infection vs. volume depletion vs. nicotine bolus.
On the night following graft infusion patient was tachycardic and febrile to 103F, with pressures 80s/50s, responsive to fluids.
Several hours later, and EKG for persistent tachycardia showed Afib with RVR.
Patient was noted to have nicotine patch was was noted to be in place on arm, with likely increased absorption during fevers, which would predispose to this rhythm.
- Discharged on 25mg PO metoprolol tartrate Q8H - Will follow up as outpatient with [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology clinic [**2191-8-4**]  #Rash: Likely drug rash vs. associated with high fevers.
Erythematous blanchable rash on abdomen and back, petechial rash over anterior thighs.
Biopsy showed early changes with keratinocyte apoptosis (possible result of recent chemotherapy), possible evolving drug eruption, viral exanthem, and graft versus host disease.
- If the eruption progresses, rebiopsy of a more developed lesion may be further revealing - Will need suture removal [**2191-7-28**]  # Blepharitis: likely due to recent immune reconstitution, possible reaction to normal flora, vs conjunctival GVHD.
- Erythromycin ointment, fluorometholone drops for one week following discharge - Artificial tears for symptom relief has changes in vision  Chronic Issues: # Skin graft right shin: Concern for infection on admission.
Cultures were negative and pathology showed scar tissue with red cell extravasation and abundant hemosiderin deposits, no signs of infection to delay transplant.
#Hypercholesterolemia: Fish oil was held during this admission for risk of myelosuppression.
#Left eye chalazion:  Small hyperpigmented lesion was noted on left eye lower lid.
Ophthalmology was consulted when patient complained of increased tenderness around the area during neutropenic nadir, and had five day course of erythromycin ointment.

When your white blood cell counts were very low, you had fevers and were treated with antibiotics, though no infection was found.
During those fevers you experienced a rapid irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation which resolved after going to the intensive care unit for a medicine called diltiazem to slow your heart down.
