Admission Date:  [**2144-9-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-2-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 44522**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 74 y/o male with a h/o right RCC s/p nephrectomy ([**2121**]) with subsequent mets to lung s/p xrt and left mainstem bronchus stenting ([**2141**]-[**2143**]) on study chemotx who presents with three days of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, and fever.
In the ED, he was in significant respiratory distress and persistently hypoxic, so he was intubated.
Vanco/levo/flagly were initiated for presumed pneumonia with sepsis.
A chest x-ray showed a left mid-lung zone infiltrate and right mid-lung zone increased interstitial markings, no pleural effusions, felt to be consistent with his metastatic disease with a post-obstructive pneumonia.
)Right renal cell carcinoma: diagnosed [**2121**] with nephrectomy in [**2121**], no recurrence until [**2141**] when found to have metastatic disease to lung, underwent xrt then left mainstem bronchial stent with subsequent argon plasma coagulation distal to sent for bleeding friable mucosa.
)Peptic ulcer disease 5.
)Squamous cell cancer 6.
)Rheumatic fever as a child 7.

CXR [**9-7**] IMPRESSION: Area of consolidation in the left mid lung zone with prominent interstitial markings in the right mid lung zone.
The lung findings are consistent with the given history of metastatic disease within the chest with post-obstructive consolidation.
............ EKG [**9-7**] Sinus tachycardia Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia Repolarization changes may be partly due to rate Low QRS voltages in limb leads Since previous tracing, lateral ST-T wave changes - consider ischemia ............... Renal U/S IMPRESSION: 1.
Status post right nephrectomy with no definite mass or fluid collection identified in the nephrectomy bed.
Left-sided extra renal pelvis without hydronephrosis or mass.
Incidental note is made of gallstones and sludge with questionable gallbladder wall edema.
Right pleural effusion.
.............. [**2144-9-14**] CT Chest IMPRESSION:  Significant interval progression of both metastatic renal cell carcinoma and widespread intrathoracic infection as follows:  1.
New large cavitary abscess involving the left lower paraspinal pleural space, probably due to lower lobe bronchopleural fistula.
Despite interval decrease in size of a large subcarinal mass (that nevertheless infiltrates and probably occludes the esophagus) and preserved patency of the stented, tumor-encased left main bronchus, increasing right hilar adenopathy and multiple new lung nodules represent increased metastatic burden.
Right upper lobe cavity and new multifocal consolidation represents widespread infection.
There was noticed to be significant tumor burden, which was occluding right main stem bronchus.
The tumor was partially occluding the left main stem bronchus orifice as well.
Bronchoscope was then carefully navigated around the tumor into the right main stem bronchus, which showed distal patency distal to the proximal tumor occlusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma s/p left mainstem stenting admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis and respiratory failure.
#Respiratory failure - Initially the respiratory failure was thought to be d/t either a CAP or postobstructive PNA, and the patient was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl for possible aspiration PNA.
Addidionally, the patient was wheezy on physical exam and was given albuterol and atrobent nebulizers, as well as steroids in the setting of hypotension and an inadequate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.
A CT scan was done to assess progression of metastatic RCC, and found cancer had progressed while on sorafenil study drug.
A bronchoscopy was performed which showed 80% stenosis of right main and 40-50% stenosis of left main.
The patient slowly become hypoxic with hypertension and tachycardia.
Over the course of four hours his respirations slowed, he became progressively hypoxia and hypotension ensued.
However, he had sustained Aflutter causing hypotension and levophed was needed until the Aflutter was controlled/resolved (see below).
The white count trended down, he became afebrile, and gram stain of blood cultures was negative and there was no growth on blood cultures.
#Metastatic RCC - Interval progression on CT of [**2144-9-14**] with new pulmonary nodules and cavitary lesions.
Bronchoscopy showed evidence of right bronchus stenosis of 80% and left bronchus stenosis of 40-50%.
With the known progression of disease while on study drug, the decision was made to make the patient CMO.
#ARF - Initially renal failure was thought to be due to prerenal etiology, and FENA was consistent with this.
Renogel was started for an elevated phosphorous, and renal followed the patient daily.
No indication for HD and no further intervention.
#FEN - Patient had an OGT in place and he received TF's with little residuals.
