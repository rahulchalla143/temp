[**2156-11-6**] 4:42 PM IMPRESSION: Technically successful CT-guided presacral and peripancreatic abscess drainages with 8 French pigtail drain insertion.
Stable appearance of fluid collection in the splenectomy bed surrounding the tail of pancreas which appears edematous.
Basilar atelectasis and small to moderate left pleural effusion, stable.
Stable presacral fluid collection with foci of gas, which could be post-surgical fluid collection or phlegmon.
Stable appearance of a fluid collection within the splenectomy bed.
The fluid collection is seen surrounding the tail of the pancreas which appears edematous.
There is associated thickening of the Gerota's and left lateroconal fascia.
Stable appearance of bibasilar atelectasis and small-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic left pleural effusion.
A presacral fluid collection with tiny foci of gas is essentially unchanged from prior study.
This finding may represent postsurgical fluid collection or phlegmon formation.
No discrete abscess formation in this region.
Partial small bowel obstruction seen on [**2156-10-26**] exam appears resolved.
Probably stable bilateral moderate pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis.
The patient is after recent abdominal surgery.
Several borderline bowel loops are noted in the right abdomen, not necessarily concerning for obstruction but close monitoring is recommended.
Moderate left pleural effusion.
Bibasilar consolidation.
No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolus allowing for phase of contrast.
This may represent postoperative change.
No drainable collection identified.
Diffuse dilation of the small bowel with multiple air-fluid levels down to the level of the distal ileum where there is a transition to more normal caliber bowel.
This may represent a partial small bowel obstruction.
Fluid and air present within the presacral space within pelvis.
No drainable collection identified.
This may represent postoperative change.
Fourteen regional lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/14).
Diverticular disease.
Omentum (AR-AT):  Unremarkable fibroadipose tissue with no carcinoma seen.
Spleen, splenectomy ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]):  Splenic parenchyma with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized; no carcinoma seen.
Distal pancreas, partial pancreatectomy (AW-AX):  Pancreatic parenchyma with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized; no carcinoma seen.
Three lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/3).
V.  Colon, segmental resection (AY-BD):  Colonic segment with diverticular disease and a rare prominent lymphoid aggregate; no carcinoma seen.
One lymph node, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1); additional adipose tissue blocks to evaluate for more potential lymph nodes will be submitted and results reported in an addendum.
Anastomotic donuts (BE):  One colonic/rectal segment with ischemic features, consistent with adjuvant therapy effect; no carcinoma seen.
Second colonic segment with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized; no carcinoma seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Post-operatively the patient was admitted to the MICU for close monitoring after his initial procedure which included a splenectomy.
[**2156-10-21**] Respiratory acidosis on ABG.
He had persistent sinus tachycardia.
He was given 1L LR and dilaudid for pain control.
He became somnolent and apneic with Dilaudid and was given Narcan on the evening of [**10-21**].
Sinus tachycardia was managed with beta blockade.
[**2156-10-23**] Orientation waxed & waned, hesistancy with speach.
No focal neurologic deficit, symptoms improved with time.
On [**2156-10-23**] ostomy was noted to have some gas and moderate stool abd tge patient was advanced to sips and matinance intravenous fluids.
Also [**2156-10-25**] JP amylases: LUQ 16,195; LLQ: [**2109**] and this was attributed to be a small pancreatic leak.
The patient was noted to be tachycardic to the, EKG showed sinus tachycardia and was treated with intravenous Lopressor.
Chest Xray showed bibasilar atelectasis which was unchanged from [**2156-10-22**].
[**2156-10-25**] the patient triggered for tachycardia above 130 treated with 5mg IV Lopressor and responded well.
[**2156-10-26**] CT torso showed bilateral atelectasis, mod L pl effusion, no e/o pancreatitis/pancreatic fluid collection and small collection in the pelvis as well as a dilated stomach.
The patient reported improved pain control and less nausea with morphine INJ and abdominal binder.
A chest xray was obtained which showed decreasing atelectasis and pleural effusions as well as a large gastric bubble.
The patient had been tachycardic and intermittently nauseated although continued to pass a stable amount of output through the ileostomy.
An nasogastric tube was placed which immediately had 1500 cc of bilious output.
On [**2156-10-28**] ABG showed metabolic alkalosis, and his EKG was unchanged.
The patient continued to have an elevated white blood cell count, the cause of this was unknown and possibly attributed to the splenectomy.
On [**2156-10-29**] NGT output continued to be high at 2000L, a KUB was done to check if NGT in duodenum and this was stable.
On [**2156-11-1**] the patient did not have any nausea or vomiting or abdominal distension, drain output was down.
Elevated amylase/lipase; pancreatic edema on CT [**2156-11-3**] started on Zosyn, Flomax and flow max for some urinary incontinence.
[**2156-11-4**] the patient complained of urinary incontinence upon standing a urinalysis was sent and was clean, the patient was consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and reassured that this would improved.
Because of continued leukocytosis a serial CT scans were preformed which showed peripancreatic and perirectal collections.
The WBC was monitored and continued to be elevated it was decided that on [**2156-11-6**] radiology would preform CT-guided drainage of peripanc and perirectal collections.
Vancomycin troughs were monitored closely, and prior to discontinuation, the Vancomycin Trough was elevated and caused a slight increase in the patient's creatinine which improved with hydration.

During this procedure, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] [**Name (STitle) 88577**] some bleeding near your spleen and because of this bleeding, the spleen was removed and during the removal of the spleen a very small area of your pancreas was affected.
You continued to have some elevation in enzymes and this required leaving the surgical drains in place near the spleen bed/pancreas.
You also had a small amount of fluid collect in the area where the spleen was and in your pelvis.
You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth.
If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonges loose stool, or constipation.
If you find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office for advice.
The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output.
Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue.
If you notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe.
The stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched and this should subside with time.
The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact.
Monitor the skin around the stoma for buldging or signs of infection listed above.
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed with steri-strips.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a fever.
Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication oxycodone.
Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol.
