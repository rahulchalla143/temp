Brief Hospital Course: 79yF with history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, DLBCL in remission, and bronchial stent in left mainstem bronchus (for compressive lymphadenopathy), recent Pseudomonal pneumonia, c-Dif and admission for FUO, who presented for acute shortness of breath and required 3 day course in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation/bronch times 2, and currently being treated for pseudomonal infection of airways with ceftaz and tobra.
The following outlines the care delivered and continuing care that she should receive for her health problems:  #) Shortness of breath/hypoxia/pseudomonal pneumonia.
Patient's exam, O2 requirement and very concerning radiography caused her to be admitted to intensive care unit, at where she underwent intubation and bronchoscopy (twice) to remove mucous plugging of left mainstem bronchus.
Because of her history of pseudomonal pneumonia, she was empirically treated with ceftaz and when her sputum cultures grew pseudomonas, inhaled tobramycin was added to her antibiotic regimen.
She was also treated with a brief steroid course given concern for a reactive airway disease component to her presentation.
She was treated with nebulizers, chest PT, acapella treatment, and antibiotics with decrease in her decreas in her productive cough and decreased rhoncerous breath sounds.
Given reinitiation of antibiotics during this hospitalization, she was restarted on PO vancomycin with plans to continue for five days after completion of this new antibiotic course.
Patient was found to be mildly tachycardic to 120s in ICU.
Her tachycardia was not fluid responsive and she remained mildly tachycardiac on the regular floor to 110s.
Her respiratory dysfunction could be causing this mild tachycardia so would reccommend to monitor this condition and look for improvement as her respiratory function improves.
#)Prophylaxis:  Patient was placed on prescribed bowel regimen and had solid stools while on regular floor.
Patient did not report any pain while on regular floor and did not use PRNs for pain.
