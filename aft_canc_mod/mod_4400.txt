[**2124-1-24**] Jejunal mass mucosal biopsy:  Fragments of adenoma with cytological features suggestive of high grade dysplasia and focally prominent cautery artifact, see note.
IR performed angiography but no embolization as site as they did not see did not see extravasation of contrast even at the area of the clip so they are hesitant to do an embolization.
Consulted vascular surgery who did not think they would operate on him unless he has active bleeding with hemodynamic compromise.
On [**1-24**], GI again took the patient for endoscopy, at which point he was also transferred to the floor.
