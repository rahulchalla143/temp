Admission Date:  [**2144-8-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-8-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2084-4-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old, right handed female who started experiencing nausea and vomiting one week ago.
She felt dizzy and had diplopia.
She was brought to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital where a CT of her head showed left frontal hemorrhage and right occipital hemorrhage.
Lungs were clear, left lung slightly coarse breath sounds.
Extremities had no edema.
Right eye had slightly decreased adduction, slight decreased elevation of the right eye.
Moderate dysarthria.
No obvious drift.
No Hoffmann, no clonus.
She did have a slight right drift.
She had an MRI which showed a large right cerebellar T2 hypointense and T1 hyperintense mass which measured about 5 cm in maximal dimension.
A DWI scan [**Month (only) 3780**] loss of signal in the right cerebellum and left frontal lobe.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and in the anterior middle cerebral artery.
The impression was cerebellar and cerebral hemorrhagic masses consistent with metastasis.
The cerebellar mass is large and there is superior herniation into the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.
Given the patient's exam and MRI findings, it was felt that the patient should have an emergent craniotomy for removal of this tumor and the hemorrhagic lesion.
They saw her and felt she had a left upper lobe mass infiltrate with the diagnosis that included possible pneumonia versus lung mass versus combination.
on [**2144-8-13**] where she underwent craniotomy and removal of the right cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion.
Patient did well intraoperatively and had no complications.
She had abduction depression of the right eye.
She had a question of bilateral slight pronator drift, greater on the right than the left.
Also on the 1st she had repeat MRI which showed status post resection of right cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion without residual enhancement.
Left frontal hemorrhagic lesion with enhancement was suggestive of metastatic disease.
She did have periods of agitation at times.
No rebound, no drift.
Finger to nose showed slight right dysmetria.
She did see physical therapy when moved to the floor who recommended that she receive visitations every day by them to assist with her impaired mobility and help with her impaired mental status.
Her dysarthria was noted to be improved.
She had a slight right drift noted.
Her dysmetria was also improved.
Occupational therapy also saw her and assisted her with safety awareness and helped her with her upper extremities.
Patient's special stains for melanoma were found to be negative on [**8-19**].
Patient will need to go to a rehab facility for further assistance with her gait and rehabilitation needs.
The patient was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia that was diagnosed prior to admission.
