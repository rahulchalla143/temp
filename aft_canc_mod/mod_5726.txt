He complained of increased cough, SOB, at least one episode of small amount of hemoptysis and chest pain, and per ER note subjectove fevers.
Pt was transferred to the ER at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was found to have a new oxygen requirement.
CT of the chest was negative for PE but did show progression of disease with increased LUL perihilar mass, satellite lesions, endobronchial involvement of LUL and LLL small pleural effusion.
The patient received Cefepime, Vanco and Levofloxacin in the ER due to concern for pneumonia.
Currently, he reports cough, no fevers, chills, no SOB (on Oxygen).
ROS was positive for pain when urinating, but other systems were negative as below.
No dry motuh, oral ulcers, bleeding nose or [**Male First Name (un) **], tinnitus, sinus pain.
Cardiac:  No chest pain, No palpitations, LE edema, + DOE.
Lymph:  No lymphadenopathy.
Endocrine:  No change in skin or hair.
Neuro:  No numbness, weakness or parasthesias.
No dizziness, lightheadedness.
Past Medical History: Metastatic NSCLC diagnosed [**9-/2138**] with mets to brain s/p resection and WBRT HTN Prostate CA s/p seed treatment and chemotherapy in [**2134**] with a urologist at [**Hospital3 **] GERD  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**2138-10-6**] in the setting of acute confusion, the patient presents, found to have a large left frontal cystic lesion, associated edema, given Decadron and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
[**2138-10-7**] CT torso revealed a 4 x 4 x 3.5 cm left perihilar mass with associated lymphadenopathy in the left hilum and mediastinum with a large left hilar lymph node measuring 2.2 cm, suspicious pretracheal lymph nodes, left hilar and satellite lesions, renal calculus.
[**2138-10-7**] MRI head revealed peripherally enhancing mass 3.9 x 2.8 x 3.4 cm with edema, left cerebellar 8 x 10 x 8 peripherally enhancing lesion, also 7-mm focus in the medial temporal lobe and small right caudate lesion.
[**2138-10-10**] left-sided craniotomy of large left-sided high parietal lesion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Pathology revealed metastatic carcinoma consistent with lung primary.
Postoperative MRI consistent with surgical site changes.
[**2138-12-8**], bone scan negative for metastatic disease.
Brain MRI reveals reduction in size of left cerebellar metastatic lesion and likely the right caudate, may be related to treatment, although his neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] was concerned for a small lesion in the right frontal lobe.
No scleral icterus.
No conjunctival injection.
No oral ulcers.
Neck:  Supple, no LAD, no JVP elevation.
Abdomen:  soft, NT, ND, NABS, no HSM.
Skin:  No rashes or ulcers.
[**2138-12-20**] pCXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-17**] and 8: Pulmonary edema seen best in the right lung has progressed to moderately severe.
Large left hilar mass and moderate left pleural effusion have increased since [**12-16**].
Distention of the azygos vein could be due to biventricular heart failure, but possibility of new concurrent pericardial effusion should be kept in mind.
No pneumothorax.
Subtotal opacification of the left hemithorax.
On the right, pre-existing areas of mild opacities are minimally progressive.
[**2138-12-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Progression of left lung white-out likely total lung collapse, underlying known lung and hilar pathology is obscured .
[**2138-12-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Increased size of left upper lobe/perihilar mass compatible with known malignancy.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with left basilar opacity likely reflecting atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2138-12-16**] Head CT w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes, stable in appearance, without acute intracranial abnormality.
Known left cerebellar metastasis is not clearly visualized, though the right inferior frontal lobe metastasis appears unchanged.
No new mass lesions are seen, though MRI is more sensitive for the evaluation of intracranial metastatic disease.
No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Significant interval progression of a left upper lobe hilar mass with new bronchial obstruction and likely endobronchial involvement with post obstructive left lower lobe collapse and/or infection.
New small left effusion.
Increased extent of satellite metastases within bilateral lungs and mediastinal adenopathy.
New sclerotic lesion in T9 vertebral body, concerning for metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/o male (Haitan creole only speaking) nursing home patient oriented only to his name at baseline admitted with hypoxemia and hemoptysis due to progression of his primary NSCLC with concomittant progression of brain metastases.
His course was notable for overnight transfer on [**2138-12-17**] to the intensive care unit for transient worsening of his hypoxemia and white out of his left lung.
He was treated with broadening of his antibiotis and made an overnight recovery consistant with mucous plugging.
In the ICU, he was noted to nonsustained runs up to 20 beats of ventricular tachycardia.
After long discussions with the patient's son, [**Name (NI) **], who is also his health care proxy, the patient was made DNR/DNI on [**2138-12-20**] with the plan to continue to treat any reversible medical problems but to focus on the patient's symptoms and forgo any further ICU transfers.
In this setting, The patient developed recurrent episodes of tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension with transient evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) that were treated symptomatically with IV metoprolol, morhpine, lasix, +/- nebulizers.
He continued to have hemoptysis but did not require blood transfusions and respiratory status had stabilized.
# Tachycardia and Tachypnea/hypoxia/CHF: No findings of PE on CTA on admisttion.
Likely component of postobstructive pneumonia, CHF and progressive lung ca.
# HTN: HCTZ held on admission due to hypovolemia at presentation.
Added po metoprolol as scheduled since this has relieved his episodes of tachycardia and his tachypnea and hypertension.
# Progressive metastatic NSCLC: He was not a candidate for systemic therapy due to his poor performance status.
In the setting of pulmonary progression with resulting hemoptysis and assymptomatic brain metastases, there was no clear utility to further XRT to the small assymptomatic brain met was discontinued.
Since he is clinically stable, radiation to his primary lung tumor to control hemoptysis and possibly relieve post obstructive symptoms offered the greater palliation than interventional pulmonary procedure.
# Hemoptysis: Due to progression of primary lung cancer.He remained hemodynamically stable and was treated with palliative radiation.Pt may develop radiation esophagitis and will need supportive care ( pain meds, sucralfate, oncology magic mix) .
# Post obstructive pneumonia: Supplemental oxygen.
# Brain metastases: Continued Keppra 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].No evidence of increased edeam on head CT this admission.
# Encephalopathy/Delirium: Baseline confusion due to his underlying neurologic compromise following his neurosurgery.
# Hyponatremia and dehydration: Present on admission due to hypovolemia due to poor po intake.
#Hypercalcemia: Mild, likely due to volume depletion.
