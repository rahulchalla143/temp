History of Present Illness: 47 YO M w hypertension, hypothyroidism and renal cell carcinoma on sutent presenting after likely seizure earlier on the date of admission.
He was feeling fine until the morning of admission when he felt he was having a violent dream and started screaming.
He scratched his left upper arm but does not think he sustained any other injuries upon falling.
EMS arrived and he was taken to [**Hospital 5583**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital where he underwent CT head which showed left frontal edema.
He was given zofran and dexamethasone 10mg IV and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he gets his usual oncologic care.
He underwent repeat CT head which showed left frontal edema c/f underlying mets given clinical history with recommendation for MRI.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports essentially feeling himself.
He endorses recent intertriginous groin irritation which resolved but no other s/s infection.
He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation, melena or hematochezia.
Past Medical History: Hypertension hypothyroid .
CT scan demonstrated a left renal mass.
There was a single pulmonary nodule noted, which was PET-negative.
- [**3-/2102**]:  CT scan demonstrated multiple small pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe, left upper lobe, right lower lobe.
- [**6-/2102**]:  Subsequent CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule.
Subsequent CT scans demonstrated slow disease progression.
- [**2105-6-15**] CT showed disease progression - [**7-/2105**] resume sutent - [**2106-8-16**]: sunitinib dose changed from 37.5 to 50 daily (2 weeks on, 1 week off dosing schedule) - [**2106-10-15**] VATS with LUL and LLL wedge resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17109**] - [**2106-10-25**] resumed sunitinib 37.5 two weeks on, one week off with some treatment interruption due to wound healing, restarted [**2106-12-20**] - [**2107-12-26**]: CT showed increasing right upper lobe nodule - [**2108-2-23**]: underwent right VATS with RUL wedge resection x3 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; pathology consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, including multiple lymph nodes; resumed sunitinib [**2108-3-19**] - [**2108-10-9**]: re-staging CT scan: Interval increase in size of abnormal soft tissue in the azygoesophageal recess.
A paraesophageal lymph node is also markedly increased in size.
- [**2108-12-3**]: re-staging CT scan: Interval decrease in size of soft tissue lesion in the right paraesophageal region.
No new lesions identified  - [**2109-11-26**]: re-staging CT scan: Slight increase in right paraesophageal mass and left lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
No new lesions.
- [**2109-6-4**]: re-staging CT scan: Mild interval increase in the right paraesophageal lymph node mass.
No new metastatic lesions detected in the chest, abdomen and pelvis - [**2109-7-29**]: re-staging CT scan: Unchanged size and appearance of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule and right paraesophageal mass.
No new metastatic lesions are identified.
- [**2109-11-4**]: re-staging CT scan: Interval decrease in size of a necrotic-appearing azygoesophageal nodal conglomerate and left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
No new metastatic foci identified.
- [**2110-2-12**] re-staging CT scan shows disease progression in the chest as well as a new left adrenal lesion.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vital Signs: 96.6  130/80  80  20  97% RA GENERAL:  Well-developed, obese man in no acute distress.
No scleral icterus or conjunctival erythema.
Dried blood in left nares.
NECK:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, supple.
No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused with no peripheral edema, but no hair growth on calves.
SKIN:  No rashes.
[**2110-4-5**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: Vasogenic edema in the left superior frontal lobe.
Findings are concerning for underlying mass lesion, likely a metastasis given the patient's history of malignancy.
Again this may represent a metachronous renal cell carcinoma.
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
Previously seen intramuscular mass within the right infraspinatus/teres minor muscle is barely visible on today's study which may be due to slight differences in contrast bolus timing.
[**2110-4-8**] MRI Brain: IMPRESSION: 12 mm x 11 mm enhancing mass at the left posterior frontal lobe cortex and associated vasogenic edema and a punctate focus of enhancing lesion in the right frontal subcortical region consistent with metastatic disease.
No other abnormal enhancing areas are demonstrated.
[**2110-4-9**] MRI Brain: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy for excision of a left frontal enhancing lesion with residual postoperative changes.
No evidence of acute infarction.

CT and MRI confirmed a left posterior frontal region metastasis.
He then went for neurosurgical resection and had no complications.
# Brain mets: CT and MRI confirmed a left posterior frontal region metastasis.
He then went for neurosurgical resection and had no complications.
# Metastatic renal cell CA: Sunitinib was stopped given progression of disease.
He will follow-up with his primary oncologist to discuss alternate therapy such as everolimus or bevacizumab.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Heparin SC.
# Precautions: Seizure.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a seizure that was caused by a new brain metastasis from the kidney cancer.
You were started on dexamethasone to decrease the swelling and levetiracetam (Keppra) to prevent additional seizures.
You were also started on vitamin B12 injections because of a significant deficiency in B12.
