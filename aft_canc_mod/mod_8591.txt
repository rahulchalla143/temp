HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old man who was found to have a cecal lesion during colonoscopy for anemia.
Given the lesion which was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the colon, he was scheduled for a right colectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
However, this patient does have a significant coronary artery disease history, so his main issue preoperatively was evaluation and cardiac clearance.
His cardiac history is significant for a myocardial infarction in [**2131**] for which he subsequently underwent bypass surgery.
Echocardiograms in the past revealed an ejection fraction of 50% with an inferior posterior wall motion abnormality.
The patient did have significant dyspnea on exertion preoperatively and is only able to walk up one flight of stairs, sometimes not even able to achieve this.
He had a Holter monitor examination which revealed ventricular ectopy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, episodes of AV nodal Wenckebach for which he underwent an exercise echocardiogram which demonstrated that the patient could only exercise for two minutes and again had premature ventricular contractions, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and sinus bradycardia with Wenckebach.
Given all of this, it was felt that the patient had a sick sinus syndrome and AV nodal disease with significant chronotropic incompetence, for which he underwent Electrophysiology evaluation for pacemaker placement.
However, given the fact that he needed a colon resection in the near future, Electrophysiology did not want to place a pacemaker in him prior to the resection because of concerns related to infection with the pacemaker.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2141**] (saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal), status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stent.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Carotid artery stenosis of 80% to 90% bilaterally.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No smoking or alcohol.
His abdomen revealed no masses, tenderness, hernias, or ascites.
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed postoperatively in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring given concerns over his cardiac status, as well as the fact that intraoperatively the patient had bradycardia to the 30s.
He was also ruled out for acute myocardial infarction.
He received a Cardiology consultation while in the Intensive Care Unit for assistance of evaluation of his cardiac status.
Cardiology recommendations were for beta blockers and conversion to nitroglycerin paste from nitroglycerin, as well as the addition of aspirin and Accupril for control of his blood pressure.
By postoperative day eight, given the fact that he was tolerating a regular diet, hemodynamically stable with good urine output with an abdomen that was soft, with an incision that was clean, dry, and intact without any erythema, edema, or induration, it was felt that he was stable for discharge.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and multiple stents.
Sick sinus syndrome with tachy arrhythmias including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Carotid artery disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
