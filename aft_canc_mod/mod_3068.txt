Patient reports that the chest pain is a "dull" pain that does not radiate.
It is associated with dizziness and diaphoresis.
He reports that these symptoms are differnt from his presentation for PE in that that presentation was associated only with chest pressure and no shortness of breath.

STUDIES: ======== CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-9-30**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Since tracing of [**2143-5-2**] there is no significant change.
LUNG SCAN  [**2143-10-1**] IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio of acute pulmonary embolus.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2143-10-1**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had 50% stenosis in its mid portion.
The LCX and RCA were without significant disease.
The left sided filling pressures were moderately elevated (mean PCW pressure was 24mmHg and LVEDP was 18mmHg).
There was no significant gradient acorss the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta.
The cardiac index was measured at 2.6 l/min/m2  using an assumed cardiac consumption rate.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
Elevated pulmonary artery pressure.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-10-3**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Specifically, there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2143-10-3**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities.
New multiple bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Compared to the most recent chest CT dated [**2143-5-1**] all of these pulmonary emboli are new.
Multiple pulmonary opacities are also noted.
Given that some of these have a nodular appearance, a followup scan when the patient's symptoms resolve in approximately 3-6 months is recommended to ensure resolution and to exclude underlying pulmonary lesions.
2.7-cm hemi-circumferential sigmoid colonic mass highly suspicious for malignancy.
No CT evidence for lymphadenopathy or metastatic foci.
Additional 6 mm and 5 mm ascending colonic polyps and possible tiny rectal polyp.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli again demonstrated.
COLONSCOPY [**2143-10-11**] Polyps in the ascending colon Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Mass in the sigmoid colon at 35cm (biopsy, injection) Stool in the solid stool in right colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
EGD [**2143-10-11**] Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus Erosions in the antrum Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with gastritis Erythema and congestion in the first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 1274**] is a 69 yo male with HTN, DM, Hyperlipidemia, former smoker, and history of recent PE who recently stopped anticoagulation admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion.
Initial presentation was concerning for PE versus unstable angina, however, patient was found to have new bilateral pulmonary embolisms.
After further workup of her iron deficiency anemia, he was found to have a sigmoid mass that was adenocarcinoma.
Patient has a history of being heterozygous for Factor 5 Leiden and had a pulmonary embolism 7 months prior to admission and stopped anticoagulation 1 month prior to admission.
Patient presented with shortness of breath and chest pain on exertion.
Initial presentation was concerning for unstable angina versus PE.
He initially underwent V/Q scan (because of elevated Cr) which was low probability for PE.
His echo showed evidence of right heart strain and pulmonary hypertension.
On hospital day 2, given the low probability V/Q scan, he underwent cardiac cath which showed single vessel disease, but did not explain his symptoms.
On hospital day 3, he had a CTA which showed multiple bilateral PEs.
He developed worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia so he was sent to the ICU for closer monitoring.
During his ICU stay, no invasive interventions were needed.
Patient reported chest pain and chest pressure with minimal exertion.
He denied ever having chest pain with exertion in past.
He had an exercise MIBI in [**2143-1-31**] showed a mild, reversible defect of the inferior wall, new compared to [**2139-10-2**].
His EKG showed dynamic changes with variable TWI in V1-V3.
Patient was started on heparin drip in the ED and was started on Integrillin drip on hospital day 2 due to dynamic EKG changes.
Cardiac cath showed [**10-2**] showed 50 % mid LAD lesion that was not intervened upon.
Fe deficiency anemia [**12-28**] colorectal cancer.
Patient was found to have guaiac positive stool before starting heparin drip.
Anemia studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
Patient denied recent colonoscopy.
However, due to his guiaic positive stool and his persistent iron deficiency anemia, a GI consult was obtained.
A virtual colonography was completed that showed an ulcerative 3 cm lesion in the sigmoid.
Surgery felt that the patient must have a colonoscopy/EGD for tattooing of the lesion as well as a biopsy.
Colonoscopy showed the ulcerative mass and biopsies were taken that later were identified as adenocarcinoma.
Acute on Chronic renal failure.
Patient has history of CRI, likely due to HTN and DM.
Pulmonary Hypertension.
He will be scheduled with sleep study for possible evaluation of CPAP or BiPAP use in hopes of improving his pulmonary hypertension for his impending surgery for colorectal cancer.
He is to be scheduled for an outpatient echo in [**3-1**] weeks to reevaluate the extent of his pulmonary hypertension.
Imdur was started due to chest pain with exertion.
His Imdur was held for a short time for his renal failure but was restarted on discharge.
Pulmonary nodules.
Pt had h/o wedge resection of RUL.
CTA showed multiple nodules.
To stage colon cancer, it would be ideal to get CT lungs with contrast as outpatient.
A CT chest was not performed with contrast as inpatient due to acute on chronic renal failure.
# PPx.
The patient was kept on a heparin drip for treatment of his pulmonary embolism and this was bridged to coumadin at discharge.
Colon cancer 3.
Iron deficiency anemia 2.
Coronary artery disease 3.
Acute on chronic renal failure 5.
Hypertension 6.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest pain and shortness of breath.
You also had a CT of the lungs which showed that you had multiple clots called pulmonary emboli.
You were then found to have bleeding from your colon.

If you have any of the following symptoms, please call your doctor or go to the nearest ER: fever>101, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum, black stools or any other concerning symptoms.
You will also be contact[**Name (NI) **] for a sleep study.
