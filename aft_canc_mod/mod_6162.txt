The day of admission, he developed rigors and mid abd pain shortly after eating.
Pt was hypotensive with SBPs 70s-80s, responsive to IVF, on HD#2 as well.
Cardiac enzymes showed a troponin peak of 0.2 with negative CPK.
DNR/DNI was confirmed with HCP and pt's brother, but risks and benefits of transfer were discussed and pt and family decided to proceed with palliative ERCP for stent change.
Past Medical History: # Pancreatic Ca dx'd at [**Hospital1 112**] after presenting with fever and jaundice; staging CT scan apparently demonstrated 2 pulmonary nodules, which were not biopsy proven.
Presenting cholangitis was palliated with ERCP and metal stent x2 in [**2115-2-15**] # MRSA pna rx'd with linezolid, [**1-/2115**] # CKD # BPH # GERD # PPM for sick sinus; afib # liver abscess in [**2111**] complicated by GNR sepsis and ARDS # recurrent pancreatitis # DM # NSTEMI in [**12/2113**]; ischemic myopathy with EF 40%   Social History: SocHx: pt has developmental delay, lives with brother [**Name (NI) **].
Studies: ======== TTE ([**5-30**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations or significant valvular regurgitation seen.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
ECG ([**5-27**]): Atrially paced rhythm and occasional intrinsic atrial activation with A-V conduction and A-V conduction delay.
Low limb lead voltage.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-5-26**] no diagnostic interim change.
Cholangiogram showed a high grade distal CBD stricture measuring 3 cm.
A 60 mm by 10mm Covered biliary wall stent (Lot No [**Serial Number 78585**]) biliary stent was placed successfully across the distal biliary stricture with flow of pus and obstructed bile.
Micro: ------ Blood Cx ([**5-27**], [**5-28**], [**5-30**] x 2) - No growth to date Blood Cx ([**5-25**], [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital) - E. Coli, ESBL (sensitive to Amikacin, Ertapenem, Nitrofurantoin, Imipenem, Bactrim, Zosyn)  Brief Hospital Course: A/P 79M with non-operable pancreatic cancer s/p biliary stenting, now with cholangitis.
# cholangitis/#septicemia/#Pancreatic Cancer Initially covered with meropenem and ciprofloxacin.
The patient underwent ERCP that showed CBD stricture.
On [**5-29**], culture data was obtained from [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital which showed ESBL E. Coli.
A TTE was performed and did not show any evidence of endocarditis (however image quality was somewhat suboptimal).
His pancreatic cancer is reportd to be inoperable given his overall risk factors (per surgeons at [**Hospital1 112**]).
# Atrial Fibrillatin The patient's B-blocker was held during this hospitalization.
Plan to restart B-blocker, however there was some reports of dizzy spells prior to initial admit.
# BPH Tamsulosin was initially held, however subsequently was restarted.
# CKD, Stage III Cr remained relatively stable during this hospitalization .
# Access Midline (placed [**5-30**]) .
# Code - DNR/DNI   Medications on Admission: colace 100 qhs omeprazole 20 daily flomax 0.4mg daily simethicone tid aspirin 81mg coumadin 2.5mg daily mvi HISS Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 6978**] House of [**Location (un) 5871**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cholangitis Septicemia (ESBL E. Coli) Pancreatic Cancer Atrial Fibrillation Type II Diabetes Mellitus Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage III  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, tolerating PO  Discharge Instructions: You will need to take antibiotics (Meropenem) for 10 more days (last dose on [**6-8**]) since you had bacteria in your blood.
Your B-blocker (metoprolol) was held while you were here due to your low initial blood pressures.
If you feel dizzy or lightheaded or your heart rate is slow, it should be stopped.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you should have increased abdominal pain, high fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptom.
