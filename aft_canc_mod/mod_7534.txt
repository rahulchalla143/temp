He was givien ativan with good  effect and brought to OSH where he became combative.
He was subsequently intubated for combativeness and airway protection and taken for a head CT  that showed right parietal lesion.
Past Medical History: PMH: Hyperlipidemia, Hx prostate CA s/p rsxn ([**2188**])  PSH: prostatectomy for early stage prostate cancer at [**Hospital1 2025**] ([**9-/2189**]), B/L inguinal hernia repair ([**2191-1-5**])   Social History: Married, lives with wife.
Spontaneous breaths over vent, Gagging occasionally on ET tube  On discharge: slight left pronator drift, otherwise neurologically intact   Pertinent Results: [**6-14**] CT head noncontrast: Right parietal lesion 2cm x 2cm with surrounding edema and 3-4mm midline shift.
Enhancing hemorrhagic 2.2-cm intra-axial mass centered within the right parietal lobe with associated vasogenic edema that in the current clinical setting, most likely represents a metastasis.
Multiple small foci of signal loss scattered throughout the brain on gradient recalled echo sequences.
[**6-16**] CT Torso: CHEST FINDINGS: Post-surgical changes consistent with left pneumonectomy and resection of left pulmonary artery sarcoma are redemonstrated.
There is no nodularity of the pleural surface which is minimally enhancing.
Pericardial fluid or thickening along the left lateral margin is unchanged.
There is soft tissue density in the mediastinum at the level of the left main bronchus resection, stable from the prior examination.
A right paratracheal lymph node measuring 8 mm is slightly smaller from the prior examination (11m) (3:20).
A few prominent paraesophageal lymph nodes near the diaphragmatic hiatus measure up to 7 mm, also essentially unchanged from the prior examination.
Left pericardial lymph nodes measuring up to 6 mm are stable.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
In the right upper lobe, there is an enlarging pulmonary nodule measuring 7 mm (previously 5 mm) (3:13).
A second right upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 5 mm was present on preoperative examination and is essentially unchanged in size (3:22).
No additional pulmonary nodules are present.
There is no pleural effusion on the right.
Diffuse coronary artery calcifications are visualized.
In addition, there is a 2.9 x 2.4 cm cyst in the right mid kidney with layering dependent milk of calcium.
There is a nonobstructing 2-mm renal calculus in the right mid kidney.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications are present within the normal caliber abdominal aorta.
Bowel loops are normal in appearance without evidence of inflammation, mass or obstruction.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no destructive osseous lesions.
A vertebral body hemangioma is present within L1 and L5 vertebral bodies.
Post-surgical changes consistent with left pneumonectomy and resection of left pulmonary artery sarcoma.
Pneumonectomy space is fluid filled with smooth pleural mild enhancement.
Enlarging right upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 7 mm, concerning for metastatic disease.
Stable subcentimeter lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular, right lower paraesophageal and left pericardial regions.
Ill-defined 5-mm hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe was not definitely present on the prior examinations.
Again, metastatic lesion is possible and continued followup is recommended.
There is persistent vasogenic edema with mild right convexity sulcal and lateral ventricular effacement, as well as 5 mm leftward shift of midline structures, unchanged since the pre-operative examinations.
Post-surgical changes in the right parietal lobe, with blood products in the surgical resection site and moderate surrounding vasogenic edema.
A very tiny focus of enhancement may relate to post-surgical changes.
Persistent mild leftward shift of midline structures and right-sided frontal and parietal edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the ICU under the neurosurgery team for further care and workup of his new right parietal lesion.
He remained intubated and was started on dilantin for seizure treatment.
He underwent and MRI Head to further evaluate this mass which showed a lesion in the right posterior parietal region with surrounding vascogenic edema.
He was evalauted by neuro and radiation oncology pre-operatively and had a speech and swallow evaluation.
A CT of his torso showed an increase of a right apical pulmonary nodule 7 mm R increased from 4 mm on [**2191-5-25**] ct - size increase concerning for met.
On the afternoon of [**6-20**] he was discharged to home with instructions for follow-up.
