No intra-axial hemorrhage.
Underlying neoplastic disease is poorly assessed on current study.
CXR [**2-9**]: Heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lung could represent early effect of aspiration.
Right hilar adenopathy has increased.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
A bulging mediastinal contour in the region of the ascending aorta could be due to adenopathy or a tortuous or dilated aorta.
Status post evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas, with small residual bilateral hemispheric subdural collections, and interval decrease in mass effect upon the cerebral hemispheres.
Enlargement of the left subdural collection with mild mass effect, but no evidence of herniation.
Stable size of small right subdural hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 70 year old man with a PMH of HTN, DM, Burkitt's lymphoma with progressive disease, who was receiving IVAC chemo C2D12 (on admission) with pancytopenia who presented with headache.
# SDH: Monitored in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and then BMT service.
It was felt that some component of his headache may have been related to post-LP given positional nature (patient had LP 1 week prior to admission), however given his clinical deterioration, it became apparent that this was unlikely.
Chronic lower lip numbness and b/l ankle weakness (chronic) were his only apparent neurological deficits noted.
He had persistent headaches and nausea, patient received multiple head CTs, which were stable until [**2-9**] when midline shift increased, and patient became more lethargic.
He also had persistent emesis.
Post-op CT showed pneumocephalus as expected.
He had some dizziness and nausea when elevated with PT.
#Leukocytosis: An infectious work-up was initiated given his somnolence and leukocytosis (persistent elevation after neupogen was discontinued on [**2-7**]).
CXR from [**2-9**] showed a left lung consolidation and CXR was repeated showing.... .
# Burkitts Lymphoma: Patient initially diagnosed in [**8-28**].
Recent PET showed disease progression.
US guided biopsy of a right cervical lymph node on [**1-8**] showed malignant cells.
# Hypertension: Continued home metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine 5mg Qday, quinapril was decreased to 20mg qday.
# Sarcoid: stable, not being actively managed as an outpatient.
16. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Have a friend or family member check the wound for signs of infection such as redness or drainage daily.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting >10lbs, straining, or excessive bending.
