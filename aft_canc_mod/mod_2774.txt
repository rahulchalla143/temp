[**2181-2-9**] LE US: "BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Reason: LE SWELLING [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with lower extremity swelling and bilateral thrombophlebitis per osh report.
COMPARISON: No studies available for comparison.
No evidence of right-sided DVT is seen.
LEFT SIDE: Left common femoral vein is clearly identified and demonstrates normal compressibility, augmentation, and respiratory variation.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of above-knee DVT on either side."
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with bibasilar atelectasis.
A small pneumothorax is seen on the left, with a chest tube in place.
Abdominal aorta is normal in size and caliber, without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
Superior mesenteric artery, celiac artery and inferior mesenteric artery are widely patent.
There is a segment of circumferential thickening involving the sigmoid colon, covering an approximately 5 cm length of the colon.
Extensive diverticuli are seen within the sigmoid colon.
Dense linear tracts within the lateral wall of the sigmoid colon near the areas of maximal thickness may represent sinus tracts.
There is trace inflammatory change surrounding the areas of wall thickening.
No free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bony lesions.
Bone islands are noted within the left iliac bone, of no significance.
Degenerative changes are noted within the spine.
No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Circumferential thickening within the sigmoid colon, with suggestion of intramural sinus tracts.
Differential considerations include colon carcinoma or acute diverticulitis.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**Name (NI) **] FOR PTX INDICATION: COPD status post extubation.
[**Month/Year (2) **] for pneumothorax.
Upright AP chest: The left internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged from the prior study.
No pneumothorax.
Since the exam of [**2-19**], there has been probable interval development of a subpulmonic effusion on the right and associated compression atelectasis at the base.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumatothorax.
There may be a developing subpulmonic effusion on the right, with associated atelectasis of the right base."

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5-mm axial images were obtained from the vertex to the base of the skull in bone and soft tissue windows.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There is a likely small cyst within the hippocampal region of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] posteriorly.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality visualized."
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57 M COPD admitted to OSH with H Flu PNA c/b NSTEMI(peak trop I 2.52), and large left PTX now s/p left chest tube placement transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for "difficulties oxygenating."
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Imaging revealed sinusitis, infiltrate suspicisou for PNA vs. atelectasis and spiculated LUL nodule.
Treatment was initiated with antibiotics (CTX, levoquin) for PNA, and steroids for COPD flare.
Respiratory status showed improving acidemia, worsening hypercarbia and worsening hypoxia prompting a chest CT which showed left lung collapse without midline shift.
A chest tube was placed urgently by CT surgery for a pneumothorax and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient was placed on ASA and statin for her NSTEMI, however b-blockers and ACE inhibitors were held due to hypotension.
-[**Hospital1 18**] MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 58796**]):   Patient was found to have coffee-ground emesis/melena and hypotension and was therefore re-transferred to unit following several boluses of fluid to maintain perfusion pressure.
There, patient underwent EGD, which revealed only non-bleeding erosions of stomach and duodenum.
However, patient was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with vancomycin IV 1.75g q12hours to attain a therapeutic trough level.
Due to active bacteremia, patient also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of endocarditis.
Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress complicated by pneumothorax and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for difficult oxygenation.
At OSH, CTA neg for PE but positive for infiltrate suggestive of PNA vs. atelectasis in addition to a spiculated lung mass in LUL.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt finished course of abx and pneumothorax resolved with chest tube.
Pt was successfully extubated, and chest tube removed without complication following resolution of air leak.
PNA:  Pt tested positive for H.Flu at OSH and received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
Pt finished 14 day course of antibiotics and had minimal sputum following completion of course.
Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
This was felt to be secondary to H flu pneumonia as above.
COPD: Given patient's emphysematous bullae on radiographic studies, it was felt that pneumothorax was most likely secondary to positive pressure ventilation in the presence of chronic emphysema.
Patient was managed with stress dose steroids and nebs as needed without acute issues, and had no evidence of respiratory distress resulting from obstructive physiology.
PTX: Patient had chest tube placed at outside hospital with successful reduction in size of pneumothorax from 75%-20% of lung and did not have any evidence of tension pneumothorax despite question of difficulty oxygenating.
Over the course of hospitalization, left apical pneumothorax continued to improve significantly.
Nonetheless, patient had persistent air leak through hospital day 9.
On hospital day 11, however, patient underwent a water seal trial with continued resolution of pneumothorax.
However, it was noted at the time of removal that patient still had persistent leak of air from thoracic cavity from the chest tube site, and sutures were placed at the chest tube site to aid in closure.
Believes mass is malignant appearing and concerning for primary lung CA.
NSTEMI: Pt with reported NSTEMI on transfer from OSH, however given clinical history, most likely due to demand ischemia.
Indeed, patient had upper GI bleed while on heparin, and therefore no further anticoagulation was administered.
Furthermore, given initial hypotension, beta blockade was held, and patient was only given aspirin and statin for treatment of coronary artery disease.
UGIB/ANEMIA: Pt with ?hx of esophageal varices and UGIB, had coffee grounds on [**2-7**].
Pt did not receive an EGD or colonoscopy.
Given pt's spiculated lung mass very concerning for CA.
AFIB: Pt had episode of rapid afib on [**2-18**], which was treated with iv lopressor, unsuccessfully and ultimately requiring diltiazem gtt to return to sinus bradycardia.
Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive on admission and started on DA gtt which was switched to levophed.
Pt weaned off dopamine but still unable to be started on bb and ACEI due to hypotension.
ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL: On transfer, patient required benzodiazepine gtt for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and it was noted that patient became intermittently tachycardic (while still intubated) when versed gtt was tapered.
Likewise, patient became tachycardic when fentanyl was tapered, and as such both sedative medications were successfully tapered slowly over MICU course.
Pt with episode of disorientation and dyspnea post extubation.
Suspect most likely due to above alcohol/BDZ withdrawal.
Weakness: Pt with moderate amounts of weakness since transfer from ICU.
However it is slightly concerning that the weakness is more pronounced on the right than the left.
As the pt suffered an NSTEMI during his hospitalization at the OSH prior to intubation, but no radiographic evidence of stroke.
dvt at osh but bilat lower extremity u/s [**2-8**] neg for above-the-knee deep venous thrombosis.
Furthermore, given history of GI bleed on anticoagulation, it was felt that risk did not outweigh benefit, and patient was kept on subcutaneous heparin only.
