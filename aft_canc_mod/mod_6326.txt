Admission Date:  [**2125-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-12-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-1-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pains  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD with biosy Colonoscopy with polypectomy ERCP with FNA of pancreatic mass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 487**] is a 54yo M with PMH s/f cocaine abuse, ETOH-ism, and tobacco use who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pains.
He describes his abdominal pain as being worse with eating and his pain is worse around epigastric region with radiatiion towards back and lower left chest at times.
He reports 1 week of "black-ish" and dark stools and a few drops of BRB in toilet 2 days ago after BM.
No recent diarrhea, no hematemesis or overt melena.
Minimal intermittent nausea but no emesis.
He explains that he has been seen at [**Hospital1 2025**] multiple times in past for similar abdominal pains over last year but only given Maalox with limited workup.
Never had an EGD or colonscopy.
Prelim read of abdominal CT showed pancreatitic duct dilitation/stranding and multiple liver lesions.
On arrival to medical floor he appeared to be in no apparent distress but complaining of poor appetite and limited PO over last 2 days which has left him feeling "empty".
Past Medical History: -ETOH abuse (states last drink 3 months ago) -chronic abdominal pains -crack cocaine use /last used yesturday (using 2x week) -s/p CCY -s/p appendectomy -told his liver was "enlarged" in past -smoking tobacco .
Family History: Mother died of lung CA, no GI cancers in family and no other GI diseases per patient.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
ABDOMEN: + TTP at umbilical area/epigastic region, NABS, Soft, ND, liver edge right at lower costal margin.
No overt splenomegaly noted.
2 well healed scars from appy and CCY.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast in a symmetric fashion and are also notable for bilateral hypodensities, the largest of which is in the left upper pole and consistent with a simple cyst, others of which are too small to characterize.
The pancreas is notable for diffuse ductal dilation, measuring approximately 6 mm on this single phase of contrast, there is no definite pancreatic mass and equivocal stranding adjacent to the pancreatic head.
A similar right lobe lesion (2:29) also is likely a hemangioma.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation noted.
Regional vascular structures are notable for scattered atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta, in the absence of aneurysmal dilation.
Scattered prominent nodes are visualized including a node interposed between the aorta and IVC measuring 9 mm in shortest cross-sectional diameter.
There is no free gas or fluid in the abdomen.
There is no free gas or fluid in the pelvis and there is no pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.
There is bilateral spondylolysis with spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1, measuring approximately 8 mm.
Pancreatic ductal dilation and minimal peripancreatic stranding.
In addition there are numerous hypodense hepatic lesions and borderline adjacent lymph nodes.
Considerations include focal pancreatic head pancreatitis, in which the case the hepatic lesions are incidental.
Alternatively a pancreatic head mass may be occult with metastatic hepatic lesions.
Correlation to history and laboratory values is recommended and an MRI would best evaluate the hepatic lesions and the etiology of the pancreatic ductal dilation.
Bilateral spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis of L5.
Diffuse distal pancreatic ductal dilatation with segmental stricture in the pancreatic head, surrounded by abnormal pancreatic tissue, could represent focal mass-like changes from prior pancreatitis or neoplasm such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Tiny intraluminal air pocket, unchanged from prior CT, of unclear etiology, possibly from prior ERCP, though none is documented in OMR.
Recommend ERCP to evaluate this focal pancreatic ductal stricture and to obtain brush samples.
Two subcentimeter pancreatic cystic lesions, one in the head and the other in the tail.
Hepatic hemangiomas and cysts as described above.
No suspicious hepatic lesions.
Mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
9-mm left adrenal nodule, incompletely assessed, but possibly an adrenal adenoma.
Sigmoid colon, thickened fold, biopsy (C):      Colonic mucosa with no diagnostic abnormality (see note).
Gastroesophageal junction, biopsy (D):      - Cardia-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia, consistent with Barrett's esophagus; no dysplasia identified.
- No squamous epithelium present.
Duodenum, second part, biopsy (E):      Scant superficial fragments of small intestinal mucosa with no diagnostic abnormality (see note).
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2125-12-13**]: Pancreatic Tumor Table: I: Pancreatic tumor present: Possible yes.
e) Remaining pancreas: Atrophic with a dilated duct.
a) Size and location of largest lymph node: Portocaval measuring 17 x 23 mm b) Necrosis in lymph nodes: Yes.
Metastatic disease, definitely present: Possibly although an ultrasound is recommended to evaluate possible metastasis within the liver.
Pancreatic Vascular Table I: Vascular Tumor Involvement: No.
The visualized small and large bowel appears minimally distended although no obvious areas of obstruction are seen.
Multiple small lymph nodes within the retroperitoneal area, which are not enlarged by CT criteria.
The left adrenal again appears thickened measuring 11 Hounsfield units on the non-contrast study consistent with an adrenal adenoma.
Pancreatic head mass is separated from vessels as above.
Liver hemangioma and multiple peripherally enhancing hypodense hepatic lesions which might represent metastases versus hepatic cysts.
An ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation of these lesions.
Enhancing portion of the duodenum wall concerning for malignancy.
EGD [**2125-12-11**]: Impression: Small hiatal hernia Salmon colored in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Deformity of the second part of the duodenum (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Please follow with biopsy Please consult ERCP team for EUS Please proceed with surgery consult .
Colonoscopy [**2125-12-11**]: Impression: Polyps at a distance between 15 cm and 20 cm in the sigmoid colon (biopsy, biopsy) Thickened fold with induration on top in the sigmoid colon (biopsy) Biopsy taken for polyps, polypectomy NOT performed due to recent GI bleed.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Please follow biopsy results Biopsy taken for polyps, polypectomy NOT performed due to recent GI bleed.
Pt needs to have colonoscopy repeated for polypectomy.
ERCP [**2125-12-13**]: Impression: Limited examination of the esophagus and stomach were normal Due to the presence of an ulcer in the duodeum, the scope was not advanced beyond the duodenal bulb A 2.6 cm X 1.8 cm ill-defined mass was noted in the head of the pancreas - FNA was performed.
Discharge Labs: HCT 34.8   Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o with PMH significant for heavy ETOH abuse, cocaine use, who presents now with acute on chronic abdominal pain alongside low Hct and positive guaiac concerning for GIB.
Now has pancreatic head mass concerning for malignancy.
Pancreatic head mass/liver mass:  He was found to have pancreatic head mass during the workup for his anemia.
This mass is concerning for malignancy esp with CA [**35**]-9 at 1314.
FNA by ERCP prelim results show atypical changes.
However they were not able to differentiate between malignancy vs. severe pancreastitis.
Liver mass found in CT were identified as hemangiomas on MRCP.
#.Anemia / GI bleed: Patient's history and exam were consistent with chronic GI bleed.
His blood pressure usually runs as low as SBP in mid 80s with heart rate in 70s without symptoms.
EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on [**12-11**] showed mass with stricture in second part of the duodenum, biopsy shows small intestinal mucusa.
ERCP on [**12-13**] showed duodenal ulcer.
He also has polyps and thickened fold in sigmoid colon and biopsy showed adenoma/hyperplasia.
#.Abdominal Pain: Chronic pancreatitis with acute component.
Also has duodenal ulcers.
