Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.9 cm.
Multiple pleural-based mass lesion in the posterior right pleura measuring up to 2.8 cm in maximal dimension.
Small right pleural effusion.
Small pleural air anterior to the right middle lobe.
Lytic lesion in the L1 vertebral body suspicious for metastatic disease.
[**3-8**] CXR:  Dense opacification at the right lung apex, possibly with mild volume loss.
No pneumothorax detected.
There is a moderate right pleural effusion.
There are postoperative changes with right shifting of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and widening of the mediastinum and right hilum.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
[**3-10**] CXR: Postoperative widening of the upper mediastinum and right hilus are essentially unchanged due in part to fluid loculation.
Pleural fluid is also collected at the apex where there is partially resected right lung.
I see no definite pleural air collection although I would assume some is present.
Skinfold should not be mistaken for a left pneumothorax.
Post-operative widening of the upper mediastinum and right hilus are unchanged, likely due to fluid loculations.
A band of pleural fluid crosses the right upper hemithorax, with a more lucent area superiorly that could be overexpanded lung or pleural air.
A true upright chest radiograph should be obtained to differentiate between the possibilities, looking for a fluid level.
Small, dependent right- sided effusion is stable.
[**3-12**] CXR: The two right chest tubes have been removed in the meantime interval with subsequent marked increase in right predominantly apical but also basal pneumothorax.
The pleural effusion is grossly unchanged.
On the next previous study, the right-sided chest tubes had been removed and a pneumothorax occupying the upper third of the hemithorax was identified.
A smaller apical air-fluid level remains but the pneumothorax seen earlier has markedly improved.
There is persistent shift of the trachea and mediastinum towards the right.
There is a large air-fluid level in the right apex, with smaller air-fluid levels within the right apex.
There may also be a basilar component of this right pneumothorax.
There is increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature within the left lung and probably a small left pleural effusion.
[**3-13**] CT Chest: Status post right upper lobe resection.
Large right apical hydropneumothorax.
Ill-defined soft tissue and fluid density is seen within the mediastinum tracking subcarinally likely post-operative, residual tumor cannot be excluded.
Mucus plugging of right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with complete right middle lobe and near complete right lower lobe atelectasis.
Atypical filling defect within left upper lobar pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus.
Large splenic infarct.
[**3-14**] CXR: Right apical pneumothorax, right middle lobe collapse.
There appears to be increasing opacification in the right upper chest which is consistent with accumulating fluid.
Increased density in the right mid lung fields due to right middle lobe collapse may be improving with better aeration.
There appears to be patchy atelectasis or airspace disease of the right base which is unchanged.
The left lung is unchanged in appearance  [**3-16**] CXR: No change in right apical hydropneumothorax.
Persistent right middle lobe atelectasis but improving aeration in right lower lobe.
[**3-18**] CT Head/neck: Acute left posterior cerebral aratery distribution infarct, with posterior occipital- temporal edema.
Filling defect within proximal left posterior cerebrla artery (likely P2 branch) and blood volume- blood flow mismatch on perfusion images suggest ischemic penumbra.
Old right posterior cerebral artery territory infarct.
Right apical hydropneumothorax and right sided atelectasis.
[**3-19**] CT Head: No evidence of hemorrhage s/p IV TPA.
She was cared for in the CSRU, intubated secondary to postoperative acidosis.
Her pain was well controlled with an epidural with IV dilaudid supplementation.
On POD4, she was readmitted to the CSRU due to respiratory distress.
She underwent a bronchoscopy which found copious heavy secretions in both lungs, most marked in the right lower lobe.
Her antibiotic coverage was changed from Clindamycin (which she had been on since admission) to Vancomycin due to Gram positive cocci in her sputum.
Her sputum cultures grew Aspergillus, but all subsequent evaluation was negative for infection.
On POD9, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] suffered a left PCA stroke.
She was briefly transferred to the stroke service for acute stroke management.
On POD10, a repeat head CT demonstated no hemorrhage after receiving TPA.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever/ pain.
