Admission Date:  [**2158-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-4-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfamethoxazole / Dapsone / Nevirapine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress, abdominal distention, facial swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thrombolysis  History of Present Illness: HPI: 42 year old woman with AIDS (By CD4 criteria, CD4 of 42), and a high-grade AIDS-related lymphoma (plasmablastic lymphoma with the initial site of disease in the left maxillary sinus).
She was recently hospitalized here for progressive odynophagia and possible "pill esophagitis" and/or acid reflux.
by EGD (biopsy results pending), and comes back to the ED with dyspnea, pain in the extremities (legs > arms), swelling of the right jaw, and abdominal distension.
Per PCP note patient describes symptoms prior to arriving to Ed and after recent discharge as: "she started to notice swelling of the right lower jaw that, after being recumbent for a while (such as over night) extends up the right side of her face to close the right eye.
The swelling tends to go down if she is upright for a while, but she still has painful swelling over the right side of the mandible.
She has had increasing dyspnea over the past 24 hours, and she is not sure if this is because of the abdominal distension making it difficult to expand her lungs.
However, with short walks, even across a room, she feels very dyspneic and "weak" and has to sit down to rest."
She also reports having increasing pain in the extremities, more the legs (thighs and knees) and the upper extremities.
When patient arrived to the ED was found to have temp of 101.2, have a distended abdomen that was diffusely tender.
She also was hypotensive with SBP 80-90s and tachycardic with HR 120s.
She then went into SVT that terminated with vagal maneuvers.
She was given vanc/levo/flagyl in the ED for concern of infection although no clear source identified.
Patient then underwent CT torso which revealed multiple pulmonary emboli including left main artery, right atrium extending into SVC, cannot exclude extension into IVC, focal clot within pulmonary veins as well;  abdominal and pelvic ascites, moderate large right pleural effusion.
Cardiac surgery evaluated patient who recommended patient get echo to assess for RV collapse, which will be done in am.
Vascular also consulted in ED and recommend LENI to rule out DVT and possible IVC filter placement.
Hx of highly resistant viral strains.
2. high-grade AIDS-related lymphoma diagnosed in [**4-14**](plasmablastic lymphoma with the initial site of disease in the left maxillary sinus s/p chemotherapy in [**8-14**] infusional with a regimen of [**Hospital1 **], complicated by a severe pneumonia in the left lung requiring intubation, and then a left-sided empyema requiring several weeks of a chest tube.
She had a recurrence of the lymphoma in the sinus, and has had radiation therapy to the tumor.
She had a CT scan of the chest in [**3-/2157**] that revealed a 13-mm cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe that had remained stable, and stable nodule in the other lung fields: 3-4 mm noncalcified nodules in the right upper lobe, lingula and right middle lobe remain stable.

Multiple filling defects that could be consistent with either primary cardiac tumor versus tumor thrombus versus de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] bland embolus located within the left pulmonary artery, the right atrium extending into the superior vena cava, possibly within the inferior vena cava, and within the left atrium.
The differential includes a possible primary cardiac tumor centered in the left atrium and further assessment could be performed by cardiac MRI.
No pulmonary emboli is present within the right lung.
Incompletely imaged left groin hematoma versus enhancing mass measuring 5.4 x 2.5 cm.
Left upper lobe lesion as described above.
Abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Thickening of the bladder wall which could be consistent with cystitis.
Lenis: IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within the proximal right superficial femoral vein that does not extend either superiorly or inferiorly.
A large (at least 2 cm x 2 cm) mass is seen in the right atrium, prolapsing into the right ventricle during diastole.
The mass is partially obstructing the RV inflow, creating severe functional tricuspid stenosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Large right atrial mass with partial right ventricular inflow obstruction.
Severe functional tricuspid stenosis.
Small pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) R heart/pulm lymphoma vs clot: Chest CT in ED showed extensive obstruction of IVC/SVC, RA/RV by tumor or clot.
On admission to MICU, she was started on Heparin IV, and thrombolytics were not immediately given until her respiratory distress increased.
TEE revealed 2x2 cm mass in RA prolapsing into the RV during diastole, creating severe functional TS.
LENIs showed non-occlusive clot/mass in R superior femoral vein.
IVC filter not placed given the respiratory distress and unstable hemodynamics.
Twelve hours after admission to the ICU, she received thrombolytics (Alteplase 100 mg) but dyspnea did not improve and SBP continued to hover in the 90s, which supports the malignant nature of the mass rather than thrombosis.
She received a morphine drip, titrated to minimize her pain and discomfort.
Deceased: Patient expired from heart failure in the early morning hours of [**5-18**].
2) Respiratory Distress: Given the R heart outflow obstruction, she had poor pulmonary perfusion.
3)Tachycardia - Patient appears to be sinus tachy from R heart outflow obstruction (tumor vs clot).
She was not rate controlled since this is normal compensation and she did not experience chest pain or palpitations.
4) Oliguria: She received continuous IV fluids (3amps HCO3 in D5W) to maintain max effective arterial volume in setting of preload dependence and organ hypoperfusion, .
Her Cr rose to 1.6 from a baseline of 0.9, likely prerenal with iscehmic ATN.
6) LE Mass/Hematoma - Patient found to have hematoma/?
This was felt to be either tumor or clot and further eval was not undertaken on this admission.
7) Fever/Leukocytosis - Low grade temp on arrival with mild leukocytosis, but shortly defervesed.
Question of dental abscess from dental work that had been drained once by her dentist.
No other obvious source of infection based on history/phys, and exam.
Leukocytosis most likely from stress and recent steroid taper.
9) Abdominal discomfort: Abdomen did not show any acute process, but diffuse abd discomfort, likely from ascites.
She was not tapped given low suspicion for SBP and high risk of bleeding on heparin.
Sucralfate 1 gram 4x/day   Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Deceased from heart failure induced by R heart/pulmonary tumor from AIDS related lymphoma.
