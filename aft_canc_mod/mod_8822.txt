No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Small left basal ganglia lacune.
Age-related involution and small vessel ischemic disease.
Findings suspicious for pituitary adenoma with erosion of sellar floor.
Complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus with extension of disease into posterior ethmoidal air cells.
[**2145-12-11**] CT Cspine: No acute cervical spine injury.
[**2145-12-11**] CXR: Possible aspiration in the bases.
HISTORY: 79-year-old female with history of "pituitary mass" presents with fall; "stroke protocol" for subacute stroke and evaluate pituitary lesion.
Given the patient's severe renal insufficiency (BUN 124, creatinine 3.0 with eGFR 13 mL/min), no intravenous gadolinium contrast material was administered.
As on that study, there is a markedly abnormal appearance to the sella turcica, which is markedly expanded with much of the cortex of its floor, completely eroded.
Though its precise borders are difficult to delineate, this process measures at least 17 (AP) x 22 (TRV) x 18 mm (CC) and likely represents a large macroadenoma, occupying much of the sella and transgressing its floor and possibly anterior wall.
The sphenoid air cells contain foci of relative [**Name (NI) **] and more marked T2-hypointensity, with "blooming" susceptibility artifact, which likely represent secretions with various degrees of inspissation.
The extent of intrasphenoidal extension of the sellar mass is very difficult to assess.
Though there is effacement of the suprasellar cistern, there is no contact with or mass effect upon the optic chiasm or the hypothalamus.
Based on the coronal T2-weighted sequence, there is no evidence of cavernous sinus invasion, and the normal cavernous carotid arterial flow voids are preserved.
The limited whole brain imaging is notable for moderate global atrophy.
There is relatively mild [**Name (NI) **]/FLAIR-hyperintensity, largely limited to bifrontal periventricular white matter, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event and the principal intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, including in the sella, itself.
Incidentally noted is a likely Tornwaldt cyst in the midline nasopharynx, as well as relatively mild chronic-appearing inflammatory changes in the maxillary sinuses and anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, as on the recent CT.
Limited study, in the absence of intravenous contrast (which could not be given, due to the patient's profound renal insufficiency), redemonstrates a markedly abnormal appearance to the sella turcica.
Markedly abnormal appearance to the sphenoid air cell, which, as on the CT, is virtually-completely opacified with heterogeneous-signal contents, most suggestive of differing degrees of inspissation.
However, the full extent of transgression of sphenoid by the sellar mass is impossible to assess without contrast enhancement.
Though there is effacement of the suprasellar cistern, there is no definite mass effect upon the optic chiasm or invasion of the cavernous sinuses.
No finding to suggest an acute ischemic event, with no evidence of previous territorial infarction.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional/hyperdynamic global systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.Borderline pulmonary artery hypertension.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 39602**] is a 79 yo F with h/o hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and pituitary macroadenoma presenting found down.
# Found down: Differential includes acute illness (h/o cold symptopms and ?infiltrate on cxr), vs stroke, vs encephalopathy [**2-24**] renal failure vs cardiogenic syncope.
Given constellation of bradycardia, hypothermia, and known pituitary mass, possible endocrinopathy as well.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient who was very deconditioned--a simple mechanical fall may have been the culprit as no other etiology was identified.
Urinary Legionella was negative.
# Acute kidney injury: improved with hydration, creatinine 1.1 upon discharge.
# Diabetes: on insulin sliding scale  # Elevated inr: INR 1.4 on admission, possibly [**2-24**] poor nutrition.
# Pituitary mass: No evidence of endocrine abnormality on labs, but imaging demonstrated possibility of slightly larger mass versus prior images.
# Follow-up imaging on pituitary macroadenoma.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Renal failure Mechanical fall Domestic violence   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to be weak and to have failure of your kidneys.
