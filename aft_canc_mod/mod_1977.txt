Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed blood in the stomach and three units of red blood cells were transfused, and he was placed on octreotide with no further bleeding.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy during that hospitalization revealed several grade III esophageal varices on [**2122-7-28**].
On [**2122-7-31**] the patient woke up with chills and diaphoresis, and had another episode of hematemesis.
Colonoscopy was performed, which offered a limited view due to large amount of bright red blood in the colon.
A colonoscopy was performed, which revealed a polyp in the ascending colon, grade II internal hemorrhoids, with an otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1193**] was transferred to the medicine unit at the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2122-8-6**] due to his stable condition in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with no evidence of active bleeding.
He [**Date Range 15797**] any epigastric pain or nausea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is significant for thrombocytopenia documented in [**2120-8-7**] (possible alcohol induced), status post video endoscopic right inguinal hernia repair, status post neck surgery in [**2110**], status post bone spur surgery on ankles bilaterally in the [**2100**], tuberculosis exposure with positive PPD, and hemorrhoids.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a family history of stomach cancer and myocardial infarction.
His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 48.
The patient denies a family history of GI-related disorders and alcohol abuse.
He worked as the director of engineering for a corporation, and has been retired for several years.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His review of systems is notable for a 20-pound weight loss over the past two years, which the patient feels is due to increased exercise and diet.
The patient denies loss of appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea during this time period.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1193**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any cardiac, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, or neurological problems.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission his general appearance was that of a well-nourished man in no apparent distress.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  His head was atraumatic with a 6 mm nodule, slightly erythematous, on top of his head, which the patient said was evaluated by his primary care physician and determined to be benign.
There was no icterus noted.
There was no nystagmus observed, no lid lag.
Throat examination revealed clear posterior pharynx with no exudate; poor dentition.
NECK:  Supple, trachea midline, no carotid bruits, 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally, no cervical lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distension appreciated.
LYMPH NODES:  There was no adenopathy.
RESPIRATORY/THORAX:  There were no scars observed; multiple spider angiomas on the trunk.
Crackles were heard at the based bilaterally, louder on the left, no wheezing or rubs.
ABDOMEN:  His abdomen was distended diffusely, nontender, no visible veins, no hernias observed, hyperactive bowel sounds, hyperresonant on percussion, no renal bruits.
There was no splenomegaly appreciated and no masses.
No masses were palpated in the rectum; guaiac positive.
There was positive shifting dullness approximately 7 cm up.
There was a negative fluid wave test.
VASCULAR:  Radial, femoral, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibialis were 2+ bilaterally; no femoral bruits.
EXTREMITIES/SKIN:  The extremities were slightly edematous, nonpitting, no erythema.
There was no cyanosis.
Hepatitis C antibody negative.
STUDIES:  Electrocardiogram done on [**2122-8-5**] revealed normal sinus rhythm, limb lead voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, early R wave progression with prominent R waves in leads V2 through V3; cannot rule out posterior myocardial infarction, however no previous tracing available for comparison.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**2122-8-6**] revealed a slightly nodular course in liver with associated ascites, splenomegaly, and dampening of the portal venous waveform, suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
Colonoscopy done during his stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital6 1760**] revealed a polyp in the ascending colon and grade II internal hemorrhoids, with an otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum, thereby ruling out lower gastrointestinal bleed.
Melena was most likely due to his upper gastrointestinal bleed.
He was advised to restrict activity to a moderate level with no heavy lifting.
It was explained to Mr. [**Known lastname 1193**] that it is possible that his second episode of hematemesis was caused by a dislodging of one of the bands due to heavy solid ingestion.
Cirrhosis/portal hypertension/ascites/varices:  Abdominal ultrasound on [**2122-8-6**] revealed a slightly nodular course in liver with associated ascites, splenomegaly, and dampening of the portal venous waveform suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
In the medicine unit, resting bradycardia precluded the use of beta blockers at this time to reduce risk of recurrent bleed.
Hepatoma screening protocol is advised.
A chest x-ray was performed on [**2122-8-6**], which revealed a left lower lobe consolidation with possible left lower lobe effusion that could not be ruled out.
There was no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid as per radiologist's report.
In addition, no pneumothorax was noted, and x-ray was unchanged from the x-ray of [**2122-8-5**].
Due to Mr. [**Known lastname 35297**] absence of symptoms for pneumonia, consolidation is likely not due to an infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Another possible cause of lung symptoms includes atelectasis.
The patient's lung symptoms were much improved on the day of discharge with very few crackles heard at the bases bilaterally.
