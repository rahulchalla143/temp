A workup ensued and found her to have biliary obstruction on account of a mass in the head of her pancreas.
Past Medical History: Her medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, sleep apnea, asthma, overactive bladder, arthritis, gout, HTN, borderline hypothyroidism, obesity, and mild GERD.
Her surgical history is significant for hysterectomy in [**2178**] as well as a left knee arthroscopy in [**2183**].
No tobacco or illicits.
COR: RRR ABD: Subcostal and umbilical incisions with steri-strips OTA c/d/i.
A horizontal line of surgical staples is seen extending across the abdomen.
Horizontal linear density in the left upper quadrant is felt to most likely be artifactual.
Otherwise, no definite evidence of a radiopaque needle or other surgical foreign body.
[**2187-8-22**] CXR: Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be due to right lower lobe atelectasis, common postoperative finding.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any.
No pneumothorax.
Lymph node, "Whipple," (B-C): One lymph node with no carcinoma seen.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN1b:  Metastasis in multiple regional lymph nodes.
Comments:  Adenocarcinoma extends into peripancreatic fat and into the duodenal mucosa.
It consists of a gallbladder measuring 12.0 x 2.7 x 2.3 cm.
There are no stones and approximately 10 cc of residual, green sludgy bile.
It consists of a segment of jejunum measuring 14.5 cm in length and 5.8 cm in circumference.
It is oriented by the surgeon with a black silk suture indicating bile duct, a blue suture indicating the pancreatic neck margin and a green suture indicating the superior mesenteric artery.
A segment of the cystic duct is present and joins the common bile duct.
The pancreas is serially sliced to reveal a tumor that measures 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm and that lies 0.5 cm from the posterior retroperitoneal margin.
The peripancreatic adipose tissue is dissected to reveal several potential lymph nodes.
It is represented as follows: E = common bile duct margin and cystic duct, F = pancreatic parenchymal margin, G = uncinate/SMA margin, H = distal duodenal resection margin, I = proximal duodenal resection margin, J = duodenum with prominent fold,  K = ampulla, L = chronic pancreatitis, M = tumor, N = tumor in relation to posterior retroperitoneal margin, O-P = tumor, Q-R = lymph nodes submitted whole, S-T = remainder of peri-pancreatic fat.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2187-8-22**] for treatment of a pancreatic mass causing obstructive jaundice.
In the PACU, the patient was noted to be tachycardic with a SBP in the 90's and a urine output averaging 10-15mL/Hr.
She remained hypotensive and oliguric.
She also became progressively acidemic, with her pH going from 7.2 to 7.13, with a base defecit of -12 and lactate of 9.
At this point, given that she did not responded to transfusions, and remained hypotensive with a significant concern for postoperative bleeding, the patient was taken back to the OR for exploratory laparotomy that revealed a clot by the SMA, which was successfully evacuated and post-operative bleeding controlled (reader referred to the Operative Notes for details).
She arrived on the floor NPO except medications, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with the Dilaudid PCA, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
At the time of discharge on [**2187-8-30**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
