# PE: The patient presented with a large R main pulmonary artery PE despite lovenox therapy.
She was started on a heparin gtt and transfered to the ICU for monitoring given her large clot burden.
# UTI: The pt was started on cipro on [**5-22**] for UTI, but urine culture reveals e. coli resistant to cipro.
