Admission Date:  [**2125-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-9-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, weight loss, mechanical fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Head CT  History of Present Illness: 72 yo F with a distant history of throat cancer as well as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presents after a mechanical fall found to have widely metastatic disease of unknown primary.
She was unable to get up from the floor due to generalized weakness.
She denies head trauma or loss of consciousness.
She was brought to [**Hospital6 **] where she was found to have multiple lab abnormalities including renal failure, Ca >13, CK elevation, WBC 19 with bandemia, LFT abnormalities and coagulopathy.
CT abdomen at the OSH revealed a large lung mass 5cm in RLL as well as liver mets.
Head CT also revealed a possible intracranial met vs. bleed.
The patient was evaluated by neurosurgery in the ED for her intracranial findings and they recommended dilantin load.
Past Medical History: - Throat cancer diagnosed in [**2100**], resected in [**2101**].
- Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Vertigo - Appendectomy in childhood - Cholecystectomy [**2099**] - Reportedly up to date on mammogram and colonscopy screening.
No cervical or clavicular lymphadenopathy.
Pulm: Poor air movement.
Abd: Soft, mild diffuse tenderness.
Strength 5/5 in the deltoids, triceps, wrists and fingers as well as bilateral lower extremities.
No free air, or acute intrabdominal process.
Right lower lobe mass with extensive hepatic metastases, possibly from patient's known throat CA.
Contrast within the esophagus could reflect esophageal dysmotility or reflux.
Bulky left adrenal without discrete lesions in non-contrast setting.
TBNA: Consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma.
1.1 cm enhancing lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere, in close proximity to the central sulcus, possibly, post-central in location, the accurate assessment of location, is somewhat limited due to motion artifacts.
This most likely represents a metastatic lesion given the history of metastatic lung cancer.
Small enhancing lesion in the left occipital bone, seen only on MPRAGE sequences, may represent focal area of enhancement in the bone marrow or a lesion.
Patent major intracranial arteries, within the limitations of significant motion artifacts.
Atherosclerotic disease noted involving the cavernous carotid arteries, without flow limiting stenosis.
12 x 10 mm focus of high attenuation at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction of the posterior left frontal lobe.
Given the history of metastatic cancer, this is highly concerning for a metastatic lesion.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo F w/history of throat cancer now admitted after falling at home, with associated rhabdomyolysis and renal failure.
On CT scan, patient was found to have diffusely metastatic disease to the liver and brain, with a RLL lung mass.
Her lung mass was biopsied by interventional pulmonary with pathology consistent with NSCLC.
Her skeletal survey did not show evidence of bony lesions.
Her CA27.29 and CA125 were elevated, and she had a transaminitis thought to be secondary to liver metastases.
Oncology felt that due to her poor performance status, she would not be a candidate currently for treatment until her performance status improved.
She also had some nausea and abdominal discomfort, with no evidence of perforation on KUB, and a negative urinalysis.
She was given an aggressive bowel regimen.
She was also noted to have an oxygen requirement, thought to be secondary to tumor burden in her lungs as well as likely underlying COPD.
Initially, patient had a CT scan and MRI of the brain which showed a likely intracranial metastasis.
For the patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, his initial CK and LDH were elevated, with blood on UA, without RBCs.
Patient was initially noted to have hypercalcemia, and was given IVF.
She was also noted to have positive blood cultures on initial set draw on [**6-23**], which eventually grew out coagulase negative staph aureus.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing or dyspnea.
Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 2.
Acute renal failure 4.
Respiratory distress and hypoxia 6.
Metastatic brain lesions 7.
Metastatic liver lesions 8.
Abdominal pain 9.
Depression 10.
You were found to have metastatic lung cancer with spread to the liver and brain.
If you develop headache, nausea, vomiting, fevers, weakness or numbness in your legs, chills, you should call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room for evaluation.
