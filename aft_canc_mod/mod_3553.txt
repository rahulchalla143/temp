Pneumonia: CXR findings suggestive of left lower lobe consolidation with mild alveolar edema and small left pleural effusion; however these findings appear only marginally changed from prior.
Received IV vancomycin, levaquin, and meropenem empirically (patient is allergic to penecillins).
Electrolyte abnormalities were corrected.
Acute Kidney Injury: Likely related to sepsis and decompensated heart failure.
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: on [**7-17**] she decompensated with IVF given for [**Last Name (un) **], but responded to lasix.
Since then her heart failure symptoms have improved.
TTE demonstrated a globally depressed LVEF consistent with cardiomyopathy of sepsis (discussed with interpreting cardiologist, multivessel CAD also a possibility, but felt to be less likely given clinical scenario).
She was changed to PO prednisone 60 mg on [**7-17**], then slowly weaned to 20mg on [**2172-7-28**] with no decompensation in her respiratory status.
Acute pancreatitis - on [**7-18**] she developed significant tenderness to palpation in RUQ of the abdomen.
Abdominal ultrasound showed:  "Cholelithiasis (a single 2 cm gallstone) without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
LFTs were normal with the exception of a slightly elevated alk phos, which was unchanged.
It showed stranding consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Leukocytosis/diarrhea: After most of her abdominal pain had begun to resolve, she developed a rapid rise in her WBC to 25 accompanied by voluminous diarrhea.
That said, they felt that the resolving pancreatitis was more likely the cause of her leukocytosis.
Leukocytosis: The pt had persistent leukocytosis (ranging from WBC of 15-19) during the last week of the hospitalization without any localizing signs or symptoms.
12. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 2251**] Nursing rehab center  Discharge Diagnosis: Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy Urinary tract infection Acute pancreatitis Acute of chronic systolic heart failure Hypercalcemia, symptomatic Clostridium difficile colitis   Discharge Condition:  Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
While you were here, you were also treated for heart failure and acute pancreatitis.
