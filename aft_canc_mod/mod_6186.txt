No observed myoclonus or tremor Moves LUE and LLE spontaneously anti-gravity.
Subtle findings suggestive of left MCA infarct, including loss with insular ribbon and vanishing basal ganglia.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Large left MCA territory acute infarction.
There is no significant midline shift.
There is no hemorrhagic transformation.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal anterior wall, mid to distal anterior wall and anterior septum.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Sub-optimal image quality due to tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and poor echo windows.
No cardiac source of embolism seen.
No ASD or PFO seen but cannot exclude on the basis of this study.
Mild to moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 78 F with  hx AF, recently stopped coumadin 7 days ago for a R-mastectomy and was supposed to re-start it tomorrow, hx prior stroke in mid-90's (daugher unclear how it manifested, possibly as R-weakness, but remembers that it was mild and resolved completely), HTN, and COPD, was found this morning slumped to R and unable to produce speech with NCHCT c/w a possible L-MCA infarct.
Most likely source of the infarct is cardio-embolic in light of her recent Coumadin holiday.
She was admitted to the ICU and MRI/A showed a large L MCA distribution stroke and given large infarct, she was not bridged with heparin drip for risk of hemorrhagic transformation.
She was extubated on HD#2 but within several hours, developed increased sputum with respiratory distress hence re-intubated and sputum culture initially grew 3+ GNR and 1+ GPCs plus leukocytosis with WBC up to 16K hence broad antibiotics of Vancomycin and Zosyn were started which was switched to ampicillin-sulbactam once H.influenzae was isolated on [**3-15**].
Patient was successfully extubated on [**3-15**] afternoon but patient required frequent suctioning for poor handling of secretions.
She also failed speech and swallow evaluation on [**3-16**] which was repeated on [**3-20**] given that patient was only recently extubated.
Also, on HD #3, patient was found to have tachycardia hence EKG was obtained which showed no acute change but cardiac enzymes were elevated hence most consistent with NSTEMI.
She was planned for PEG on [**3-21**] but her coag panel showed elevated INR of 5.8.
There were no signs of DIC and hematology felt that it was most likely combination of poor nutrition, antibiotics (she was on Unasyn for H.flu pneumonia) and vitamin K deficiency.
Surgery and GI were also consulted given concern for leak and perforation.
