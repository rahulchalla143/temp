Admission Date:  [**2168-2-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-3-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2102-5-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  O-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a history of metastatic rectal cancer to her spine and liver status post chemotherapy, most recently with FOLFOX last received six weeks ago, status post colostomy in [**2167-11-23**] who presents with increasing right greater than left lower extremity weakness over the period of two weeks.
She denies any fall or back pain worse that her baseline pain.
No urinary incontinence.
No fevers or chills.
She does report intermittent and variable pain in her legs with movement that changes location as well as intensity.
Additionally, she does report some electrical tingling in her bilateral insteps with head flexion.
Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2167-11-23**].
(d)  Additionally, she has pleural effusions.
She has had occasional recurrent bleeding from the ostomy site.
In general, this was a partially bald, pleasant, elderly woman in no acute distress.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A magnetic resonance imaging of the spine essentially showed diffuse but unchanged metastatic disease to the spine as well as severe spinal stenosis at L4-L5 that was compressing nerve roots.
No cord compression.
A chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or effusions and a Port-A-Cath in place.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic rectal cancer to the spine and liver, status post chemotherapy six weeks ago, with two weeks of progressive lower extremity weakness.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse metastases, L4-L5 spinal stenosis squeezing on the nerve roots, but no change since the [**2167-10-24**] magnetic resonance imaging.
LOWER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS ISSUES:  The etiology of this remains unclear.
Possibilities include myopathy (perineoplastic versus steroid-induced) versus additive effects of spinal stenosis and metastases versus leptomeningeal spread.
A lumbar puncture was done by Interventional Radiology on [**2-29**] that showed no infection, and the cytology was negative for malignant cells, making leptomeningeal spread less likely despite the increased CEA.
Her muscular pain was treated with OxyContin and oxycodone titrated to control her pain.
After this evaluation, it was felt that the weakness was likely related to her cancer or some sort of perineoplastic syndrome.
METASTATIC RECTAL CANCER ISSUES:  CEA had nearly doubled in the last month, so there was an increasing concern that the weakness was secondary to perineoplastic syndrome or to central nervous system and meningeal involvement.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  Initially, the patient had only low-grade fevers and an elevated white count on admission.
However, several days into her hospital course, blood cultures drawn on [**2-29**] showed 4/4 bottles positive for Escherichia coli, and ceftriaxone was begun on [**3-1**].
However, on the night of [**3-2**], the patient spiked a temperature to 104.9.
The fever resolved, but she started to have a decrease in her blood pressure.
It was felt that the Escherichia coli was likely secondary to gut translocation from the site of her rectal cancer.
However, several days later, she began spiking fevers again to 102.
This was felt to either be likely from continued gut macroperforation from her cancer or possibly due to a noninfectious etiology.
Her temperature came down with the continued antibiotic therapy, and chemotherapy was started on [**3-10**] in an effort to decrease her tumor and therefore decrease the likelihood of macroperforation.
Blood cultures since the 4/4 bottles positive for Escherichia coli on [**Month (only) 958**] have been negative to date.
Her anemia is felt to likely be secondary to chronic disease, although she also has had some intermittent bleeding for her ostomy site.
She showed no evidence of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation when she had sepsis.
Due to the small oozing and bleeding from her ostomy site, her low-dose Coumadin has been held and she received 10 mg of vitamin K subcutaneously times one dose.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  Acute renal failure resolved after receiving intravenous fluids.
However, currently, we are continuing to treat her infection with antibiotics and continuing chemotherapy in the hopes that it will improve her lower extremity weakness.
