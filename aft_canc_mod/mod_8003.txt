Admission Date:  [**2178-5-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-5-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-5-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old with known coronary artery disease about to undergo surgery for a pituitary adenoma for which he is being evaluated to undergo scheduled cardiac catheterization prior to his adenoma surgery.
Significant only for ureteral stones.
Coronary artery disease.
Known pituitary adenoma, which will require surgery in the future.
ALLERGIES:  He claims no known allergies.
In general, in no acute distress.
Chest: Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or bruits.
In summary, the catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 55%, normal left main, left anterior descending artery with a mid segment total occlusion, distal filling from right to left collaterals, circumflex 60-70% tubular lesion with 99% distal OM-2 lesion, right coronary artery total occlusion except mid segment.
Additionally, the patient went for STAT head CT scan which showed no acute bleed.
At that time, the patient was not noted to have any other neurologic deficits.
It was noted that the patient had complete left third nerve palsy.
No findings to explain left eye changes.
No evidence of aneurysm or vascular malformation.
Over the next two days, the patient was weaned from all cardioactive IV medications, and on postoperative day five, the patient was brought for a MRI which showed no acute vascular territorial infarction, a large intracellular, supracellular mass with a small focus of susceptibility of infarct consistent with hemorrhage and unchanged air fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
During this period, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and continued to progress from a cardiac standpoint with no further neurologic deficits other than his third cranial nerve palsy.
On postoperative day five, Neuro-Ophthalmology was in to see the patient regarding the acute onset of his left third cranial nerve palsy.
Left cranial nerve III paralysis with impaired extraocular movements, otherwise cranial nerves intact.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2 with no murmurs.
Incision is clean and dry, open to air with no erythema.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x4.
Left cranial nerve III palsy.
