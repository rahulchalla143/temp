History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53 y/o woman with AML who is s/p 7+3 and HiDAC consolidation on [**2143-1-3**], who presents today to clinic with a low platelet count (6) and petechiae on her chest, abdomen, arms, which has developed over the past 2 days.
She still reports persistent cough and some labored breathing (baseline).
She has also developed mucositis in her right buccal mucosa, which is improving.
Her chronic cough is at baseline.
Past Medical History: AML - In [**8-/2142**], she noted fatigue, cough and dyspnea on exertion.
Initially, she thought this was consistent with a flare of her sarcoid versus a question of COPD.
A CBC showed thrombocytopenia and blasts.
On [**2142-9-26**], a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration revealed acute myelogenous leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
Her post induction course was only notable for intermittent thrombocytopenia not responsive to plateletes.
She was transfused type-specific platelets with no bump.
She eventually required IVIG and crossmatched platelets in order to have a bump in platelets with transfusion.
- Pulmonary sarcoid diagnosed in [**2122**] by mediastinal biopsy, and resolved with 1-2 years of prednisone therapy - Hx of bilateral thrombosis in the greater saphenous veins in the groin, thigh and calf, with IVC filter placement in [**12-3**] - Bilateral hip replacements in [**2134**] and [**2137**] secondary to osteoarthritis - Spinal fusion at age 14 - Appendectomy as a child   Social History: She works as a librarian at [**Hospital1 8**] Public Library.

No evidence of new PE.
Interval development of bilateral airspace opacities in the lower lobes Left [**Last Name (un) 69579**] than right that could represent aspiration pneumonia.
Worsening left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Chronic partial collapse of the left upper lobe and of the lateral right middle lobe.
New small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 69580**] is a 53 y/o woman with AML who is s/p 7+3 and 2nd cycle of HiDAC consolidation on a [**1-3**] admission, who presents w/ platelets of 6 and petechiae.
# Hypoxia/Cough: Initially the patient presented with mild chronic cough.
Then, on 2nd day of admission, had episode of hypoxia (88% RA), increased O2 requirement and tachypneia (RR 40's).
However, given very labored breathing and sudden onset hypoxia, she was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.
A CTA was done which was negative for PE, but suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
On return to the floor, antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin, Caspofungin, Zosyn for good anaerobic coverage, considering possible aspiration PNA.
CXR was done the following day and on [**1-26**], vanco and meropenem were started in light of a worsening CXR and increased O2 requirement.
A CT chest was performed on [**1-27**] which showed worsening left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia, chronic partial collapse of the left upper lobe and of the lateral right middle lobe, new small left pleural effusion and stable right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
However, if she continued to have fevers through broad spectrum antibiotics, bronch would be necessary as the concern would be post-obstructive PNA.
She was afebrile and was satting well on 1L.
# Low platelet count: On admission, the patient's platelet count was 6.
She had evidence of petechiae and reported easy bruising.
On [**1-26**], she had nose bleed with pink tinged sputum, however her platelets at the time were 75.
The bleeding stopped quickly and no other bleeding occurred during the hospitalization.
# Sarcoid: No active issues during this admission.
# Diarrhea: Patient developed loose stool on [**1-26**].
