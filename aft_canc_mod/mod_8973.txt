Given her shortness of breath and tachycardia, a CT chest was obained on admission which showed no PE, but right middle and lower lobe air space opacities suggestive of multifocal consolidation, as well as multiple nodular densities in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe with associated central cavitation concerning for septic emboli.
There was also evidence of mediastinal and axillary adenopathy.
Due to her IVDU history and CT findings there was concern for endocarditis and was started on vanco/ceftriaxone.
Of note, she has had history of MRSA cellulitis in the past.
Echo was obtained showing 2 cm vegetation on the tricuspid valve, with potential concern for fungal vegetation.
She remained tachycardic throughout admission presumed secondary to fevers, pain, and anxiety.
She complains of significant chest pain that inhibits her taking a deep breath.
She endorses night sweats and weight loss over the past several days .

Preserved biventricular regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
New basilar consolidations concerning for septic emboli.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions since the reference study from [**2182-4-18**].
New moderate ascites and body wall edema.
TEE: [**2182-4-23**] IMPRESSION: There is a large vegatation on the tricuspid valve.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Very small pericardial effusion.
RUQ u/s: [**2182-4-23**] IMPRESSION: -> No portal vein thrombosis identified.
-> Trace of ascites in the pelvis.
There are right and left pleural effusions noted.
-> No focal collection is seen in either the spleen or liver.
Increasing bilateral pleural effusions and new moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
Cavitating pulmonary nodules c/w septic emboli.
No evidence of septic emboli within the abdomen.
Moderate amount of free fluid in the dependent portion of the pelvis.
Worsening right upper and right middle lobe pneumonia with multiple bilateral septic emboli, many of which have cavitated, the most prominent of which appears to communicate with a branch of the right middle lobe bronchus and extends to the periphery, but given the lack of gas within the pleural space, bronchopleural fistula is not favored at this time.
Right upper lobe noncavitary consolidation has improved since the recent study, and a few nodules show new cavitation.
However, dominant wedge-shaped areas of cavitary consolidation in the right middle lobe and lingula are not appreciably changed.
Resolved left pleural effusion, decreased right pleural effusion, and persistent moderate pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 24 yof with history of IVDU, past MRSA cellulitis, presenting to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital with breathing difficulty and tachycardia.
CT torso showed cavitary lesions suggestive of septic emboli, and echo with large tricuspid vegitation suggestive of endocarditis.
# Right-sided Endocarditis with septic pulmonary emboli: transferred from an OSH with know tricuspid valve endocarditis, cultures eventually speciated to MSSA.
CT scan at the OSH with cavitary lung lesions, consistent with septic emboli from her known endocarditis.
She was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service and the cardiac surgery service, she underwent a TEE which showed a 1.7cm x 1cm tricuspid valve vegetation, no abscess formation, and no involvement of any other valves.
She remained on vancomycin with a goal trough of over 20, when the cultures from the OSH returned MSSA it was decided to continue her on vancomycin given her history of throat closing with amoxicillin.
However, the patient later developed a new LE rash, which initially was thought could be related to vanc.
On the floor, the patient was hemodynamically stable, though she continued to be tachypneic to 30-40s and tachycardic to 120-130s.
Her daily EKG's did not show any evidence of conduction system disease.
The patient was found to have an increasing white count and repeat CT chest was done on [**2182-5-1**].
# Fevers/weight loss: Prior to transfer given the septic emboli on her chest CT and fevers and weight loss there was concern for possible TB.
# Tachycardia:  CTA negative for PE prior to transfer, thought to be related to pain, fever and withdrawal symptoms, she was monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus tachycardia throughout her stay.
The patient was also given clonidine PRN for any withdrawal symptoms.
# abdominal pain:  The patient had an episode of abdominal pain, with exam notable for rebound tenderness.
KUB was negative for free air or any evidence of obstruction; lactate was normal.
Surgery recommended NPO until abdominal pain resolves.
The patient's diet was advanced slowly, and her abdominal pain resolved.
Given her recent diagnosis of HSP (see below), it is possible that this acute episode of abdominal pain was intussuception that had self resolved.
# diarrhea: The patient reported having some intermittent diarrhea while in patient; was found to be Cdiff negative x2.
#  Anemia: The patient was found to be iron deficiency on studies, with no evidence of hemolysis, and she was started on ferrous sulfate.
# new BLE pupura:  The patient was found to have new LE rash, which was initially thought to be secondary to Vanc.
Path was consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, with IgA deposits in vessel walls, consistent with Henoch-Schonlein Purpura.
This was thought to be most likely secondary to her underlying bacterial endocarditis.
# thrombocytosis:  The patient had a persistent thrombocytosis during this admission, likely reactive in the setting of her endocarditis.
Transitional Issues: # new Hep C: The patient should follow up as an outpatient in liver clinic once treatment for endocarditis is finished.
# bacterial endocarditis:  The patient will need to complete six weeks total of antibiotics starting from 1st negative culture; end date will be [**2182-6-4**].
# LE purpura s/p punch biopsy:  The patient had punch biopsy done on [**2182-5-7**].
# HSP: Please get urinalysis once weekly to monitor for hematuria for two months.
