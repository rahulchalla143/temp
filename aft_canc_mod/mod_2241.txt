Admission Date:  [**2112-3-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-3-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2045-7-26**]     Sex:  F  Service:  ICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status, leukocytosis and abdominal pain.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old white female with a history of biliary colic, status post ERCP and cholecystectomy, possible cholangiocarcinoma, hypertension, and [**Hospital **] transferred to the Intensive Care Unit status post an emergent ERCP.
The patient developed biliary colic approximately one year ago and was found to have gallstones and a common bile duct stone, for which she underwent ERCP with papillotomy and subsequently a cholecystectomy.
In [**2111-11-27**], the patient developed recurrent abdominal pain, the workup for on an abdominal CT revealed a left hepatic lobe abnormality with ductal dilatation concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
The patient underwent ERCP at an outside hospital on [**2112-2-18**], which showed intrahepatic and common bile duct stricturing.
Cholangiogram at that time revealed common bile duct strictures as well.
Brushings sent for cytology were positive for atypical cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 6138**] Hospital with increasing abdominal pain on [**2112-2-28**] with a total bilirubin of 4.6, alkaline phosphatase 751, and a white blood cell count of 10.5 which later increased to 15.9.
The patient's pain was somewhat controlled with MS Contin and Oxycontin IR, but this was complicated by altered mental status.
The patient developed a sinus tachycardia on [**2112-3-2**] with report of anterolateral ST changes on EKG and positive troponin by report.
Because of confusion, increasing white blood cell count, the patient was begun on Tequin and gentamicin for empiric coverage for cholangitis.
Because of the severe pain and altered mental status, the patient was electively intubated for the procedure and a right internal jugular central venous line was placed.
Biliary colic and common bile duct stone, as per history of the present illness.
Status post umbilical hernia repair.
No valvular disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to sulfa and penicillin.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother died of a myocardial infarction in her 60s.
The patient was physically active until her recent illness.
General: She was an intubated, sedated, jaundiced female in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Right anterior basilar crackles.
Abdomen:  Soft and nontender with moderate to severe distention.
Abdominal CT from an outside study on [**2112-3-2**] revealed ductal dilation extending from the porta hepatis to intraductal areas.
There was a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid.
Distal, transverse, and descending colon with localized ileus, right peripheral consolidation with effusion.
The EKG on [**2112-3-2**] revealed sinus tachycardia at 128, normal axis, intervals, T wave inversions in V3 through V6, I, III, and aVF without prior EKGs for comparison.
The chest x-ray revealed bilateral hilar congestion.
Bilateral interstitial infiltrates with a focal right lower lobe infiltrate with effusion.
Because of her altered mental state, she continued to be mechanically ventilated until care was later withdrawn (see below).
The patient did have a troponin leak consistent with a non-ST segment myocardial infarction with a peak troponin I of about 6.0.
Given the absence of ST depressions or elevations in the EKGs from the outside hospital or [**Hospital6 256**], this was felt to be highly unlikely to be a primary cardiac event, rather a demand-related myocardial infarction.
GASTROINTESTINAL/HEPATOBILIARY:  The patient's ERCP was very concerning for cholangiocarcinoma given the diffuse stricturing.
The patient underwent an abdominal CT.  An abdominal CT was performed on [**2112-3-6**] which revealed bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, intact common bile duct stents, bilateral renal stones.
There was liver contrast-enhancement consistent with cholangiocarcinoma and multiple mesenteric lymph nodes.
Given the probable metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, the patient was evaluated by General Surgery and the Biliary Service and felt to have a very dismal overall prognosis for treatment or recovery.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient remained afebrile throughout her stay.
