He acknowledges a history of arrythmia, but has not had a feeling like this before.
He reports intermittent cramping abdominal pain with loose stools since increased feeding with via NG tube (replaced [**7-20**]) in the last 5 days since paracentesis and discharge.
Cards and EP reviewed his EKGs and tele strips and diagnosed him with atrial flutter, recommending low dose 2.5mg of metoprolol followed by 5mg with control to the 120s and 2L NS, morphine & dilaudid.
He was intermittently hypotensive to the 80s independent of rate.
On the floor, the patient was initially comfortable, but developed a repeat of his chest discomfort corresponding to a rate at 130.
He also reports dyspnea which he attributes to fluid in his lung (known R effusion), and abdominal distention that is not as bad as prior to his recent therapeutic paracentesis.
He also endorses weakness and edema; intermittent dysuria and urinary infrequency with great effort.

CXR: Worsening R sided effusion compared to prior .
EKG: Multiple EKGs include: NSR at 74, atrial flutter at 121, and sinus arrythmia with PVCs  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Atrial Flutter with rapid rate: The patient's rate was initially tachycardic with a rate in the 130s associated with continued discomfort that did not initially respond to 10mg of Metoprolol IV.
Tachycardia was intermittent but improved with stepwise escalation of his metoprolol to a final dose of 100mg tid as well as the addition of daily Diltiazem.
2) Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain improved slightly with therapeutic paracentesis but eventually required high doses of dilaudid for pain control.
Once comfort care was initiated he was transitioned to a morphine PCA with great improvement.
3) Dyspnea with pleural effusion: Dyspnea improved initially with therapeutic paracentesis but returned with recurrence of his tachycardia.
Some component of anxiety as well.
4) HCV Cirrhosis/HCC complicated by ascites, PVT(and smv thrombosis) with hyperbilirubinemia:  Initially therapeutic paracentesis was performed, with ascites negative for SBP.
7) Chronic Pain: Initially managed on dilaudid, then transitioned to morphine PCA followed by morphine drip.
