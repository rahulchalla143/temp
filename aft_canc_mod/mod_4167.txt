Bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left, similar in size to the recent CT examination approximately three hours prior.
Stable leftward midline shift, accounting for differences in technique, measuring approximately 6 mm.
Bilateral supratentorial acute subdural hematomas as described.
The degree of mass effect is stable from the study earlier the same day.
Chronic bilateral posterior fossa subdural collections.
Mild narrowing of the cervical right vertebral artery at the level of C4 due a facet osteophyte.
Otherwise, no evidence of flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm of vessels in the head or neck.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Bilateral fronto temporoparietal and tentorial subdural hematomas witha cute component, right larger than left and similar in appearance from [**2166-7-7**].
Slightly decrease of leftward midline shift.
Bilateral nasal bone fractures with mild soft tissue swelling on the right.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is a slight increase in extent of the bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate increase in extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis.
Otherwise, there is no relevant change.
CT head w/ contrast: Slight increase in size of right subdural collection (7mm, previously 5 mm) and material layering along tentorium, with interval evolution of blood products and no new hemorrhage.
Slight increase in leftward midline shift and compression of right lateral ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 13257**] is an 85 y.o woman with past medical history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG x4, non-hodgkin's lymphoma most recently treated with Zevalin in [**Month (only) 116**], radiation therapy who presented to an outside hospital after a syncopal event and was found to have a subdural hematoma.
A subsequent ECHO showed 20% dilated cardiomyopathy.
Cardiology was consulted in the ICU and recommended that the patient be kept euvolemic and started on lisinopril at 5 mg. Due to the patient's ongoing oncologic problems and thrombocytopenia, ICD placement was not recommended.
# Subdural hematoma, stable The patient was placed on neurological checks every 4 hours.
Her physical exams consistently demonstrated no neurological deficits.
The patient's last dilantin level prior to discharge on [**2166-7-16**] was 2.6, and the patient was discharged on 100mg of dilantin tid for seizure prophylaxis.
The patient underwent repeat CT scan on [**2166-7-16**] to evaluate for interval change of her subdural hematoma, and this showed no interval worsening of her subdural hematoma.
The initial read showed that the subdural had increased from 5mm to 7mm; however, there was no evidence of new bleeding with interval evolution of blood products.
# Dilated cardiomyopathy The patient consistently appeared euvolemic to physical exam and had, at most, minimal crackles on lung exam.
The patient was discharged without addition of a loop diuretic on discharge given her euvolemic status.
#  Alkalosis, resolved Within a day of patient arriving on medicine floor, her alkalosis resolved.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain and temp > 100.4.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] northeast - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Subdural hematoma Non-Hodgkins lymphoma Heart failure  Secondary: Coronary artery disease Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We treated you for a fall you sustained that resulted in a subdural hematoma, which is bleeding that occurs inside your head.
You were carefully monitored to make sure that you did not have any signs of excessive pressure in your brain, and you did not.
You have been started on a medication called phenytoin as prevention against possible seizures from this bleeding.
It is unclear whether your fall was caused by a bad heart rhythm that caused you to pass out and then hit your head or if you had bleeding in your brain first that then caused you to fall.
We did notice that your blood counts were very low, probably because of the chemotherapy you received for your lymphoma.
We also montiored your heart to try to stop any dangerous rhythms.
*Your Cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11850**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] contact you with an appointment.
