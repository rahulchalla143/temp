developing right mid lung infiltrate.
Exam notable for decreased BS on right lung, otherwise CTAB.
Labs drawn in ED (pending at time of transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2), were notable for leukocytosis to 23K (96% lymphocytes), potassium of 5.8, blood gas of 7.30/23/99/12, with anion gap of 19 on metabolic panel.
Past Medical History: CLL Adult onset diabetes c/b peripheral neuropathy chronic renal failure coronary artery disease cataracts anemia  Social History: He is a retired [**Location (un) 86**] police officer, lives with his family in [**Location (un) 86**].
Sister had fatal ovarian cancer.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp: BP:154/69 HR:87 (regular) RR:27 O2sat:100% RA GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD though mildly tremulous HEENT: +Bulky bilateral submandibular and submental lymphadenopathy.
PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions.
No jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTAB.
No wheezes rales or rhonchi.
Good air movement throughout CV: RRR, Normal S1 and S2, no m/r/g ABD: Soft, NT/ND, NABS x4, No masses or HSM.
No renal bruits.
[**9-14**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
STUDIES: [**9-15**] CXR: Left lower hemithorax is uniformly opacified, probably by a combination of consolidation and pleural effusion.
Small right pleural effusion may be present.
Findings are most consistent with bilateral pneumonia.
Asymmetric edema could be present as well or concurrently given distention of mediastinal and hilar vessels.
[**9-16**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion has decreased.
The pre-existing right parenchymal opacity is also smaller than on the previous image.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacity.
Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old M with CLL, CKD, DMII presents with dyspnea and weakness found to have elevated lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis with electrolyte abnormalities, likely secondary to leukemoid reaction to CAP and acute on chronic kidney injury, s/p short MICU course where he received emergent dialysis to correct metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities .
# Pneumonia: The patient presented with dyspnea and weakness, and had an infiltrate on his CXR.
His fever curve trended down and his leukocytosis improved.
His cough resolved and his fatigue/weakness dramatically improved.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD, not on HD, still producing urine.
He presented with hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia and acute on chronic kidney injury, initially concerning for Tumor Lysis Syndrome, despite no history of chemotherapy or glucocorticoid use.
After discussion with Hematology/Oncology, Tumor Lysis Syndrome was thought unlikely (see below).
It is possible that his acute kidney injury was due to urate nephropathy, and the other electrolyte abnormalities were secondary to the acutely worsened renal function.
For his hypocalcemia he was treated with IV calcium gluconate.
# Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (indolent): The patient has not required treatment for his CLL.
He presented with cervical lymphadenopathy, a lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, elevated LDH, and electrolyte abnormalities, which were concerning for [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation to lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome.
The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted and felt that there was no evidence for this on his peripheral smear (no blasts or prolymphocytes), and that the elevated white count was a leukemoid rection to the pneumonia.
The patient was found to be hypogammaglobulinemic and was treated with IVIG at a dose of 400mg/kg once.
# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had elevated CK & Troponin T on admission, flat CKMB, likely related to increased demand and decreased clearance of enzymes in setting of ESRD.
No acute ischemic changes were seen on ECG.
His primary care physician may wish to consider starting a daily aspirin once his acute kidney injury resolves.
# Hypertension: The patient was mildly hypertensive on arrival to the MICU.
# Diabetes Mellitus II: complicated by nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy.

You were recently transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] for management of your pneumonia and acute worsening of kidney function.
You were treated with antibiotics, and given sessions of hemodialysis, and you improved.
