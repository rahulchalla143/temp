admits to melanotic stools of soft consistency.
Past Medical History: Aortic Stenosis s/p bovine valve repair in [**3-7**] Hypertension Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] Myelodysplastic Syndrome Pneumonia [**1-6**] s/p Bunion removal s/p T&A s/p Laser eye surgery  Social History: Widow, live alone.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T: 96.9  HR: 86  BP: 131/86  RR: 20 Gen: NAD HEENT:EOMI, PERRL CV: RRR III/VI early systolic murmur with radiation to clavicles Lungs: CTA bilat.
Images: admission EKG: Irregular supraventricular rhythm, borderline for multifocal atrial tachycardia, and then probable sinus tachycardia .
This reflects increased resistance within the portal vein, likely from diffuse liver disease, though the hepatic echotexture is normal.
Gallbladder wall edema also likely reflects sequelae of liver dysfunction.
[**2196-12-2**]: ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The leaflets appear thin/mobile, but the transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis (?related to the dynamic left ventricle).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Increased gradient across the aortic bioprosthesis (?related to dynamic left ventricle).
Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No additional evidence of superficial or deep venous thrombosis.
[**2196-12-7**]: CXR: Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature with upper zone redistribution and infrahilar hazy opacity _____ moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Micro: Guaiac negative x3 C Diff neg x3 Urine Cx: klebsiella pansensitive Blood cx: NGTD as of [**2196-12-7**]  Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 64 yo female with polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], myelodysplastic syndrome, and myeloid metaplasia who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-12-1**] with two weeks of fatigue, melena, and decreased Hct.
She had EGD [**2196-12-2**] which only showed friable mucosa but no evidence of bleeding site.
Hct drop was thought to be [**2-4**] cold agglutin hemolytic anemia from mycoplasma infection and pt was always guaiac negative per review of notes.
CXR showed pulmonary edema.
She was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was thought to have flash pulmonary edema.
She was given allopurinol, bicitra, sodium bicarb, D51/2 for lysis with elevated uric acid to 14.
She denied CP but was noted to have altered mental status and was only oriented x 1.
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BIPAP and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Cardiac catheterization showed a 70% left circumflex lesion, not thought to be the culprit and not intervened upon.
It also showed LVEP of 40 mm hg, mod MR, minimal wall motion abnormality of inferior wall, and EF 50%.
BP decreased to 80s systolic with ventricular ectopy and run of SVTS.
Ms [**Known lastname 48658**] was found to be anuric with a lactacte of 15.  she was also found to have focal neurologic signs with deviation of the right eye and lack of corneal reflex.
THe family was contact[**Name (NI) **] because of her extremely poor prognosis; the decision was made to not escalate care.
