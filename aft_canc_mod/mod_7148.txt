She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
ECG obtained revealed ~1mm ST elevation on V1-V2 and aVR, code STEMI was called and cardiology fellow contact[**Name (NI) **].
After reviewing the above history and ECG from [**5-/2155**] changes, emergent cath was deferred and patient admitted to CCU for ongoing high oxygen requirement, bradycardia and monitoring.

# ANGINA: Given patients severely limited functional status, it was difficult to assess whether her symptoms were caued by unstable angina vs stable angina.
ST elevations were not significantly different from baseline.
However there were new ST segment depressions compared to prior.
Per cardiology, pt was considered to be a high risk candidate for catheterization and unlikely to benefit from intervention, presently and in the future.
Pt had no further episodes of chest pain or acute dyspnea.
Metoprolol decreased due to bradycardia.
Her nifedipine was held initially due to concern about renal toxicity and low blood pressures.
BRADYCARDIA: Bradycardia was thought to be due to medication effect.
ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient was grossly volume overloaded on admission.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Given volume overload suspect poor forward flow from CHF is most likely etiology.
Her valsartan was held in the acute setting, but restarted prior to discharge.
# HYPOXIA: Multifactorial in setting of pulm hypertension, volume overload with pulmonary edema, and emphysema.
There was some question of RLL on Xray with no clinical correlation.
She was intially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin which was discontinued given improvement in CXR and O2 requirement with diuresis.
She was continued on levoquin for treatment of her lacrimal duct abscess.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Well rate controlled.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 108981**],  You were admitted for evaluation of your chest pain and difficulty breathing.
You were found to have worsening heart failure.
Your chest pain resolved and may have been due to your heart failure or the breast cancer in your breast bone.
You did not have any evidence of a heart attack.
