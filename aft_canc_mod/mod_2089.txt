Initially, his symptoms were attributed to parkinsonism and medication adjustments were made.
However, on [**2134-8-11**], he became progressively weak and was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency room with chief complaint of syncope x 2 at home, where he was found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.6 and hypercalcemia with a calcium of 13.
He was treated with aggressive hydration and was noted to have peripheral lymphadenopathy.
The 1.5 cm in the right axilla pretracheal and prevascular lymph nodes as well as precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes.
There is also bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and a markedly enlarged spleen with multiple lymph nodes in the splenic hilum.
Bone windows demonstrated a 3.5 x 3.3 cm lytic lesion in the right ileum extending to the sacroiliac joint and 3.0 x 2.2 cm lytic lesion in the left superior posterior acetabulum.
There are additional smaller lytic lesions present in both iliac bones and there is a right hip prosthesis.

Hypercholesterolemia 9.
His routine healthcare maintenance is significant for colonoscopies and endoscopy without findings of malignancy.
Physical Exam: ROS: (+) weight loss 40 lbs in 2 years, 8 lbs in 2 weeks.
No PND, orthopnea.
No abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia.
He also reports back pain at the area of his known spinal stenosis which is worse, but is planning on seeing his neurosurgeon for possible surgery.
No other f/c/cough/SOB/dysuria or other changes.
There is no spinal or paraspinal tenderness in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine.
EXTREMITIES:  Well perfused without edema.
There are no skin changes or petechiae.
SPEP shows no specific abnormalities.
UPEP shows no specific abnormalities.
EKG: NSR at 67bpm, nl axis and intervals, small q's inferiorly with TWI in III  MRI of the brain shows no evidence of malignancy.
Ultrasound confirms bilateral renal cysts and infiltrating lesions of the spleen.

Lymphoma:  As mentioned, axillary LN biopsy results were c/w Burkitt's Lymphoma which correlates with the constellation of symptoms that the pt presented with.
Hypercalcemia resolved with adequate hydration.
Given elevated uric acid, allopurinol 300mg qd was continued, and patient was administered chemotherapy per protocol.
However, he did develop some loose stools prior to discharge, which postponed his discharge as there was concern for patient having to rush to bathroom, resulting in a fall which would be extremely traumatic given his lytic bone lesions.
New-onset Atrial Fibrillation:  On morning of [**8-18**], pt experienced episode of chest pain and was found to be in atrial fibrillation w/ rapid ventricular response.
Given NTG SL x 2 with resolution of chest pain, then became hypotensive w/ BP in 80's/50's.
Etiology of this new onset AFib is unclear - likely idiopathic vs. [**1-27**] ischemia (without infarct) as ST depressions anterolaterally seen on EKG during acute episode.
CAD s/p CABG/stents: Patient failed to show evidence of acute MI as source of AFib (cardiac enzymes negative) but the question of cardiac ischemia given EKG findings remained.
Pt was without chest pain after that initial episode which resolved with SL NTG x 2.
Fluid status:  Patient developed significant lower extremity edema once IVF started for chemo, and it was discovered that patient had been on lasix 20mg daily at home.
Edema was tried to be minimized as much as possible given that patient was already at a non-weight bearing status secondary to his lytic hip lesions.
Patient was instructed to strictly adhere to use of walker for ambulation as his balance may be even more disrupted with edematous legs.
DM:  No history of DM but given that patient was to be started on steroids and receive chemotherapy, he was covered with a RISS, which was discontinued on day prior to discharge.
BPH - No evidence of hydronephrosis on renal u/s.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Caregroup  Discharge Diagnosis: hypercalcemia/ARF lymphoma CAD s/p CABG CHF Spinal Stenosis BPH Parkinson's Disease  Discharge Condition: Pt feeling well, afebrile, hemodynamically stable, eating food, OOB with ambulation, with normal renal function and calcium levels.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have any further episodes of dizziness or fainting, chest pain, nausea & vomiting, increasing abdominal pain, or fever >101 F. We have started you on two new medications 1.Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation 2.Metoprolol for blood pressure control.
