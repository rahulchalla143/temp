Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Admission labs consistent with progressive hepatic dysfunction that is irreversible.
He was given Ativan X2 for anxiety, which sedated him for several hours.
This was subsequently discontinued and his mental status cleared.
They requested no transfusions, no blood draws.
Sepsis: Etiology unclear, but given extremely poor prognosis as noted above, no role for further work-up of fever source.
Undetectable haptoglobin suggests DIC, which is consistent with septic picture.
GI Bleeding: Likely from esophageal or gastric varices, exacerbated by severe coagulopathy.
Anemia also exacerbated by GI bleeding and hemolysis.
- Empiric antibiotics as above were given for neutropenia and sepsis.
Renal Failure: Likely due to pre-renal azotemia.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: [**11-28**]  PO Q1-2H () as needed for pain, respiratory distress.
