No definite pulmonary nodule or mass identified.
New vasogenic edema involving the right frontal lobe, with hypodense parenchymal lesion concerning for primary malignancy.
Encephalomalacia in the left temporal lobe and right temporo-occipital lobes likely reflects chronic infarction  MR HEAD [**2134-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: New mass lesions in the right frontal, periventricular and temporal regions with some adjacent dural enhancement.
The appearances are  suggestive of primary brain neoplasm with appearances concerning for lymphoma or less likely glioma.
The nature of enhancement in the right parietal area of encephalomalacia is unclear.
Multiple chronic infarcts are identified.
No definite evidence for primary or metastatic neoplasm.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (33 mm) and iliac aneurysm, both increased somewhat since [**2127**].
Mild small bowel prominence suggestive of a mild ileus.
Prior coronary bypass surgery.
Mild esophageal wall thickening, probably inflammatory in nature.
Redemonstration of necrotic lesions in the right frontal lobe, right periventricular and right temporal lobe and right-sided dural enhancement.
Stable ventricular dimensions since the recent MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**5-27**],[**2133**]  CT HEAD [**2134-5-31**]: IMPRESSION: Expected small amount of bleeding and pneumocephalus in the right frontal region related to a right-sided biopsy.
In comparison to [**2134-2-28**] exam, there is no significant change in right frontal hemorrhage and small pneumocephalus related to recent biopsy.
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normal midline structures or hydrocephalus.
A 3.6 x 3 cm right frontal hypodense lesion, presumably a malignant focus, is unchanged in appearance with surrounding vasogenic edema and effacement of sulci.
Confluent hypodensities of left temporal and right temporal/occipital region, represents encephalomalacia, most likely due to remote infarction.
Sinus disease, as detailed above.
MR HEAD [**2134-6-3**]: IMPRESSION: Enhancing right hemispheric brain lesions are identified for surgical planning.
Status post biopsy from right frontal approach with a small amount of subarachnoid blood; stable appearance of intraparenchymal blood from a prior biopsy site.
VIDEO SWALLOW [**2134-6-9**]: IMPRESSION: Penetration and likely aspiration of nectar-thick barium with definite aspiration of thin barium   Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo M with hx traumatic fall in [**2127**] resulting in skull base fracture, bilateral IPH and SDH, partial R MCA infarct, prolonged ICU stay and PEG tube at that time, also hx afib, CAD, HLD, HTN, and [**Hospital 8466**] transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after he was found to have an abnormal CT head concerning for malignancy, now w/ frozen tissue pathology c/w GBM.
Although he had poorly-localizing "frontal" findings on his mental status exam, these were apparently not new (per family and patient), and overall his exam was not suggestive of a new brain lesion; this was more or less incidentally discovered on OSH ED NCHCT.
MRI here did not make a definitive diagnosis (high-grade glioma versus lymphoma versus other), and the dexamethasone he had been started on was stopped due to the possibility of lymphoma.
As pt is demented at baseline and his wife has some mild dementia, pt's brother [**Name (NI) 3979**] is the main decision-maker.
7. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
9. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
NEURO EXAM: notable for L-sided neglect, L facial droop, some L deltoid weakness and inability to cooperate with LE exam.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to our [**Hospital1 18**] Neurology service due to the finding at [**Hospital3 4107**] of a large mass lesion on the right side of your brain (beneath your forehead).
This lesion was biopsied with a needle, but the results were not diagnostic, so a larger biopsy was obtained on [**6-4**] and the final pathology showed glioblastoma multiforme (brain tumor).
3) We STARTED you on DOCUSATE 100mg twice a day as needed for constipation.
4) We STARTED you on SENNA 8.6mg twice a day as needed for constipation.
5) We STARTED you on BISACODYL 10mg per rectum at night as needed for constipation.
6) We STARTED you on TYLENOL 650mg every 6 hours as needed for pain or fever.
