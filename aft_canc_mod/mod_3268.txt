Near resolution of right lower and middle lobe ground glass opacities that were new in [**2147-12-17**], consistent with resolving infectious process.
Other bilateral lung and airway findings (including mild bronchial dilation and wall thickening) are similar to baseline CT study in [**2147-4-16**], and are accompanied by moderate expiratory air trapping.
Although non-specific, they may be related to history of chronic GVHD.
Multiple stable compression fractures and rib fractures.
There are also several compression fractures identified along with severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, all previously identified.
No new fractures are seen.
There is subcutaneous edema in the calf 2.
Subcutaneous edema in the calf  Pulmonary Report SPIROMETRY, LUNG VOLUMES, DLCO Study Date of [**2148-2-16**]  1:48 PM Impression: Mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a coexsting  obstructive ventilatory defect and a moderate gas exchange defect.

Large osteochondral fracture with articular collapse involving the lateral femoral condyle.
Subtle changes were seen in this area on the prior radiograph from [**2146-12-7**]; however, findings have worsened.
Prominent amount of subcutaneous soft tissue swelling and skin thickening compatible with known diagnosis of cellulitis.
Focal 2-mm nodular area of soft tissue attenuation within the posterior medial calf, unable to fully characterize.
Extensive subcutaneous soft tissue edema throughout the right lower extremity consistent with cellulitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
Incompletely characterized ovoid area measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm in the distal right lower extremity posteromedial subcutaneous soft tissues corresponding to an area of soft tissue density on recent prior CT examination and calf MRI from [**2147-5-25**] may represent complex fluid or small area of hemorrhage.
Fascial fluid and edema between the medial head gastrocnemius and soleus musculature, slightly more than seen on the most recent prior MRI.
No associated areas of magnetic susceptibility artifact to suggest foci of gas, nor are any foci of gas seen on recent prior CT. No other fascial fluid or edema identified between muscles.
Please correlate clinically to exclude the possibility of necrotizing fasciitis.
Muscle edema involving the soleus musculature and medial aspect of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius, which could reflect mild myositis.
Incompletely seen osteochondral fracture involving the lateral tibial plateau, better assessed on CT examination from [**2148-2-16**].
Bone infarcts in the distal tibia and proximal femur.
Continued resolution of previously seen bilateral ground-glass and nodular opacities consistent with infection.
No new consolidation.
Stable chronic changes including bibasilar scarring and bronchiectasis.
Mild centrilobular emphysema.
Hepatic steatosis.
No rib fractures evident.
New T5 inferior endplate fracture with retropulsion of its dorsal cortex, narrowing the ventral spinal canal, with no spinal cord signal abnormality.
Likely endplate fracture of T7; however, a mild wedge deformity was present on CT chest four days ago making if difficult to determine whether there is an acute component.
Previously-seen sites of spinal canal stenosis at C3/C4 and C6 with indentation and remodeling of the spinal cord have progressed slightly, compared to [**2144-10-2**].
The associated focal abnormality of cord intrinsic signal from C4/5 to C5, is unchanged compared to [**2144-10-2**], and likely represents established myelomalacia.
T12 kyphosis with retropulsion and cord compression is unchanged in degree, compared to [**2146-8-24**].
Remaining old lumbar vertebral compression fractures and multilevel degenerative changes are unchanged.
Erosive change with sclerotic margin at the base of the ulnar aspect distal ring finger phalanx with adjacent small calcifications suggestive of tophi, which may represent gout in the appropriate clinical setting.
Old ununited right ulnar styloid fracture or accessory ossicle, grossly stable.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Anterior space likely represents a prominent fat pad (patient on high dose steroids; recent CT of chest/abdomen also confirms significant visceral fat around heart and organs).
Probable right mid lung atelectasis but followup is recommended.
Low lung volumes and increased bibasilar atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2148-3-1**] 8:46 AM IMPRESSION: Mildly limited examination secondary to habitus/subcutaneous edema without left or right lower extremity DVT.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
Cervical fixation devices.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2148-3-6**] 1:58 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-2**], there is no interval change.
Low lung volumes may account for the mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette.
No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion or acute pneumonia.
Left retroperitoneal hematoma in the pararenal spaces, with extension inferiorly into the pelvis.
Old healing bilateral rib fractures.
Possible bilateral femoral head AVN.
Bibasilar lung opacities concerning for infection.
[**3-7**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI of [**2148-2-28**] there is slightly increased compression and signal changes within the T5 vertebra identified with signal changes in the inferior endplate which could be related to previous compression and fluid adjacent to the endplate.
The slightly increased retropulsion together with epidural lipomatosis results in some deformity of the spinal cord at this level, but the evaluation for increased signal within the cord is limited secondary to motion but such possibility cannot be completely excluded.
Postoperative changes are seen in the cervical region as before.
The appearance of lower thoracic spine has remained unchanged compared to the previous MRI.
Multifocal widespread ground glass opacities with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities along the periphery, most compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
Atypical infections such as mycobacterial can also be considered.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions with worsening adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Hepatic steatosis.
Unchanged multiple chronic rib fractures and severe thoracolumbar vertebral wedge compression deformities.
No evidence of post-septal mass.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Persistent right and left upper lobe opacities, consistent with pneumonia.
Right central bronchial secretions.

He has a h/o thoracic spine compression fractures, and during this hospitalization received a T3-T7 laminectomy/spinal fusion in [**2-26**] for acute cord compression in the setting of a code blue and one chest compression.
He had a [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission for respiratory depression thought [**1-18**] medication sedation effect, and was called out to BMT on [**3-21**] after his pain Rx were adjusted and his sedation had improved.
On [**3-28**], he had several episodes of SBP 70's, and later became unresponsive with ABG's showing hypoxemia and acidemia, and the pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His AMS and hypercarbia improved with CPAP, and he was called out to the BMT floor again on [**3-30**].
He was continued on azithromycin for infection prophylaxis, and plan was made to continue this at the discretion of the outpatient physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] can decided when or whether or not to stop.
# Graft vs Host Disease- Involving his lungs, GI tract, eyes and skin.
On admission, the pt was complaining of persistent SOB.
He was empirically treated with Vanc/Aztreonam during that admission for a prolonged course, and his cultures were all unremarkable.
Pulmonary felt that his lung symptoms were the result of GVHD c/w a bronchiolitis obliterans picture.
PFTs were obtained during this admission and showed a mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a coexisting obstructive ventilatory defect and a moderate gas exchange defect.
# HCAP in setting of pulmonary GVHD: In an effort to elucidate an etiology for his hypoxia, a repeat chest CT was performed.
It was negative for pulmonary embolism, but showed areas of consolidation concerning for new PNA.
#Osteopenia, s/p laminectomy - Pt has had multiple fractures in the past due to chronic steroid use.
During this hospitalization, he fractured his distal ulnar after bumping it on a table.
He fractured his R tibial plateau after bumping into a door while ambulating to the bathroom.
Ortho was consulted and for each fracture determined that no surgical intervention was warranted.
While bending over to pull up his bed sheets, he experienced significant pain originating in his thoracic spine and radiating to his anterior chest.
He had no neuro deficits on exam.
An MRI of his spine was obtained which showed new fractures at T5 and T7.
He continued to have significant burning pain occassionally with movement.
Ortho was again consulted and we were planning on performing a vertebroplasty / kyphoplasty of both T5 and T7 for pain relief.
Pt was then noted to have acute sensorimotor loss below the level of T5-6 with complete loss of movement in the lower extremities, loss of rectal tone, fecal incontinence, and complete loss of sensation to the level of the T5-T6 dermatome on [**3-7**].
He was sent for STAT MRI which showed a new epidural compression on T4/T5 with hyperdensity in that area, and new spinal cord signal change with edema.
It is unclear what caused this acute cord compression, report from ortho that there may have been a "fat pad" in the epidural space, or trauma from one chest compression during his preceding code blue.
Endocrine was consulted for assistance with management of severe osteopenia and recommended that we continue to give high dose vitamin D and calcium supplementation daily.
He did not have any motor function in his LE, although he did have some remaining sensation in b/l LE.
# Retroperitoneal Bleed - In preparation for vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty, the pt's warfarin was discontinued and he was started on a Heparin gtt.
The morning after initiation of the drip the pt was noted to be tachycardic on vitals and pale in appearance.
The heparin gtt was turned off and a stat CBC showed a 7 point Hct drop.
He subsequently became hypotensive to the 70s.
He was transfered to the ICU for further management and hemodynamic stablization.
On arrival to the ICU, patient had an acute episode of LOC with BP drop to 40/doppler.
A CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis was obtained which showed left perinephric retroperitoneal hematoma.
Given that he was no longer a candidate for anticoagulation, in conjunction with a h/o multiple pulmonary embolisms, he was taken to IR for placement of an IVC filter which was placed on [**3-8**].
# Chronic Pain - pt has chronic neuropathic pain in LE and also back pain from old compression fractures and hip / shoulder pain from avascular necrosis as complication of chronic steroid use.
We initially continued his home doses of PO Dilaudid, Oxycotin and Gabapentin, but due to oversedation and respiratory compromise, his Rx were adjusted.
Ultimately, the Pain service was consulted and recommended celebrex, ritalin [**Hospital1 **] for synergy, APAP, cymbalta, oxycontin, and small PO doses of dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
# Intermittent binocular diplopia: Pt first noticed this while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in early [**3-28**].
The pt had anisocoria observed in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in setting of nebulizers, and had head CT which was negative.
Also has intermittent blurry vision; has no h/o corrective eyewear.
Ophthalmology felt that the pt had significantly dry eyes and a decompensating exophoria - they recommended aggressive lub with artificial tear ointment [**Hospital1 **] and preservative free artificial tears q1h.
His blurry vision and diplopia improved thereafter .
# RLE cellulitis - On presentation, his RLE was significantly swollen and erythematous.
He had a puncture wound in his RLE and from hitting his leg while walking at home.
It was felt that he had a cellulitis of the RLE.
He completed a two week course of IV antibiotics with significant improvement in erythema and swelling.
Chronic Issues: .
#[**Name (NI) 10952**] Pt was on chronic warfarin for mult PE in past.
# HTN- continued metoprolol.
# GVHD [**Name (NI) 2701**] Pt has been suffering from severe GVHD since his allo transplant in [**2142**].
