Admission Date:  [**2163-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-7-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ceftriaxone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: multiple paracentesis   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 59 yo man w/ h/o Hep C cirrhosis s/p Liver xplant in [**11-8**], w/ chronic rejection (demonstrated on biopsy in [**9-9**]), recurrent Hep C on INF and ribavirin, B cell lymphoma, who p/w fevers, abdominal pain, SBP.
3 days PTA, pt began to have severe abdominal pain.
Over past 3 days, pt also c/o cough with some sputum production, although difficult to bring up 2/2 abd pain.
He also c/o laryngitis starting 3 days ago.
On [**9-21**], the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in clinic, the complained of severe abdomninal pain, was noted to have a fever to 101, and therefore was sent to the ED for further evaluation.
CT scan report demonstrated no free air, no bowel obstruction, increased ascites, and ?LLL pna vs clot in lung vs hepatic vein clot.
Post-op complications have been recurrent hepatitis C viremia and development of cholestatic jaundice of uncertain etiology, both occurring four months after liver transplant.
B cell lymphoma: nodal marginal zone CD5 positive B-cell lymphoma noted at the time of transplant; bone marrow biopsy performed during hospitalization for pancytopenia and PNA in [**2-7**] revealed approx.
Decision was for no chemo at that time.
3. h/o PNA in [**2-7**]: Pseudomonas and Staph.
Responds well to cold compress; refractory to pain medications.
Arthritis s/p long hospitalization in the 70's.
Chronic neck pain s/p cervical procedure [**4-4**].
R inguinal hernia; unable to operate given recent liver transplant.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency - this diagnosis appeared in a prior discharge summary but was denied by the patient.
[**Country 3992**] veteran and describes PTSD following 13 months of combat, which he received some counseling for but no formal treatment.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 100.9/100.9, 102 on [**9-22**] at 2PM , HR107 , BP102/58 , RR 14, O2 97% room air General - cachectic, non-toxic, alert, oriented x3 HEENT - scleral icterus CVS - tachycardic, regular, no noted M/R/G Lungs - Decreased BS at bases b/l, ?crackles at left base Abd - distended, incisional and umbilical hernia noted, reducible, diffuse tenderness, no reboudn or guarding, tap site without focal tenderness, erythema Ext - [**12-6**]+ LE edema b/l, R>L--this was noted on admit as well Skin - jaundiced Neuro - No noted asterixis, oriented x 3 .
Abdomen distended, but soft w/o TTP, rebound, or guarding.
Imaging: [**9-22**] CXR: There is consolidation in the left lower lobe with marked leftward displacement of the mediastinum and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting complete or almost complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
There are no other consolidations or masses.
There is no sizeable pleural effusion.
Revision of the recent PET/CT and CT abdomen demonstrates intermittent obstruction of the left lower lobe segmental bronchi with subsequent atelectasis.
Given this intermittent nature of the radiological findings and absence of any endobronchial obstructing lesion on the PET/CT from [**8-31**], [**2162**], recurrent aspirations are the most likely diagnosis.
Left lower lobe consolidation is likely pneumonia, but pulmonary infarct is a consideration given presence of possible left lower lobe pulmonary embolus.
Left lower lobe thrombus that is either within the pulmonary arteries or veins.
Brief Hospital Course: This is 59 year-old man with hep C cirrhosis s/p liver transplant 10 months ago complicated by recurrent Hep C and chronic rejection who presented with abdmonial pain and was found to have severe spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
While in the MICU the patient was started on aztreonam, linezolid, flagyl and levoquin to cover sbp and a possible pneumonia.
His antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl when he was found to have group B Streptococci growing from peritoneal culture.
Mr [**Known lastname 13149**] abdominal pain improved rapidly with antibiotic therapy as well as a therapeutic paracentesis.
CT scan revealed a question of LLL pneumonia versus pulmonary embolus versus atelectasis.
The radiologists subsuquent discussions with the primary team indicated that the CT appearance was more consistent with atelectasis and Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 13150**] hypoxia resolved without heparin therapy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 2379**] is 10 months s/p liver transplant and has both chronic rejection as well as reactivation of his hepatitis C.  He was on treatment with interferon and ribavirin for his hepatitis C on admission in addition to his immunosuppressive regimen.
He was admitted with an acute rise in his LFTs over baseline most likely secondary to his rejection and HCV.
His hepatitis C treatment had to be discontinued due to his acute illness, and it was difficult to increase his immunosuppressants to treat rejection due to his reactivation of hepatitis C.  He was continued on his home regimen of rapamune, prednisone, and ursidiol.
Mr [**Known lastname 2379**] also suffered from portal hypertension with resultant chronic ascites and lower extremity edema that were quite symptomatic.
His diuretics were originally held in house due to his illness and concern for potentially initiating renal failure in his infected state.
When he clinically improved from an infectious standpoint; lasix 40 and spironolactone 100 were reintroduced without significant renal dysfunction.
Ultimately with regards to his chronic liver failure and difficult to manage ascites the patient initiated conversations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] and the hepatology team about his overall prognosis and therapeutic options.
Because of his ill health and particularly because he was found to have lymphoma in his explanted liver he is not a candidate for a second liver transplant.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.  hepatitis C s/p liver transplant 3.
Chronic liver rejection 4.  lymphoma   Discharge Condition: fair.
You should seek medical attention if you develop fevers, chills, or worsening abdominal pain because this may be a sign that your infection has returned.
To treat your ascites and leg swelling we have started you on lasix 40mg daily and spironolactone 100mg daily.
