Admission Date:  [**2155-4-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-4-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Ultracet / Codeine / Flagyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**] Chief Complaint: Fever, Chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  History of Present Illness: The pt is an 84M with stage two metastastic pancreatic cancer with palliative CBD stent placement who presents with fevers and chills for 1 day.
He does not endorse feeling particularly short of breath although he admits now that he feels better with oxygen.
He also notes continued abdominal bloating that he has had for months, although he feels it is actually slightly better now.
He does not have any focal abdominal tenderness.
He states he had dysuria about 1-2 weeks ago but this stopped a few days ago.
His LFTs were found to be markedly abnormal, and he was sent for RUQ US that showed air in the gallbladder, indicating patency of the CBD stent; sludge and stones in the GB; and thickening of the CBD wall that may represent infiltration of tumor.
Past Medical History: Past Onc Hx: He was Diagnosed with pancreatic ca in [**7-27**] after an episode of cholangitis and sepsis.
His postchemo course was c/b prolonged periods of neutropenia fevers and infections such as klebsiella bacteremia.
PET [**1-29**] was notable for a FDG-avid infiltrating mass originating in pancreatic head that extends to porta hepatitis and which abuts, but does not appear to extend beyond, the site of fiducial markers.
No evidence of remote FDG-avid metastatic disease.
Other PMH: CRI (1.6-2) GERD Lumbar stenosis s/p repair COPD Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease Prostatectomy for early stage prostate CA Hernia repair Hypertension CVA- TIA [**2146**] years ago, no residual deficits chronic constipation rheumatic fever as a child   Social History: Lives in [**Location 3307**] with wife of 12 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**].
Sludge and stones in the gallbladder, with focus of air in the gallbladder also suggesting patency with the biliary system.
Unchanged appearance since [**2155-3-14**] CT scan of thickening of the common bile duct, which itself is normal caliber.
[**2155-4-6**] CXR: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2155-4-6**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Low limb lead voltage.
Delayed precordial R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-7-28**] the rate has slowed and there is variation in precordial lead placement.
[**2155-4-9**] CXR: No evidence of lung consolidation.
[**2155-4-12**] ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT): Non-specific bowel gas pattern which includes dilated loops of small bowel.
If there is persistent pain, followup radiographs or cross-sectional imaging is recommended.
[**2155-4-15**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
[**2155-4-15**] ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT): Mildly distended gas-filled loops of large bowel with multiple air-fluid levels, which likely represents ileus.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome through the metal stent seen in good position at the ampulla.
Filling defects in the stent within the CBD were noted.
Occlusion cholangiogram performed at the end of the procedure revealed no overgrowth or ingrowth of tumor into the stent.
