Admission Date:  [**2186-4-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-11-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness and headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement with endoscopic assistance   History of Present Illness: 42y woman with metastatic breast cancer (HER-2 positive) with hepatic involvement, C-spine/L-spine and hip involvement (s/p lumpectomy in [**2180**]; radiation treatment to bony mets; ongoing chemotherapy).
She now presents with mild frontal headache of 2 weeks duration, then 3 days of dizzyness with nausea and vomiting.
MRI brain today showed multiple intracranial lesions including the largest in the right cerebellar hemisphere measuring 2cm in diameter with brain stem compression.
Nausea developed 3d ago with single vomit 3d ago and nil since.
She has been feeling slightly unsteady on her feet without falling or clearly veering to either the right or the left.
She has now had 2 doses and symptoms have resolved.
She has had no other symptoms of weakness, paraesthesias, visual including diplopia or hearing problems, speech or swallowing difficulties or facial droop.
She has otherwise been well without fever, chills, respiratory symptoms or diarrhoea.
Breast cancer 2.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: She had been diagnosed metastatic disease in [**7-/2184**]; primary Her2+, ER+.
At that time, she had had severe icterus and hyperbilirubinemia due to metastatic disease.
She had also been immobile because of the widely metastatic disease to the skeleton.
No cancer history.
Kyphosis with short appearing neck.
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation Back: No point tenderness CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
No dysarthria.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
No observed myoclonus or tremor No pronator drift   [**Doctor First Name **] Tri [**Hospital1 **]  WF WE FE FF  IP  H  Q DF PF TE TF R  5   5   5  5  5  5-  5   5   5  5  5  5  5  5 L  5   5   5  5  5  5-  5   5   5  5  5  5  5  5  Sensation: Intact to light touch, vibration and proprioception throughout.

Romberg: Negative   Pertinent Results: MRI BRAIN [**2186-4-27**]: There are innumerable enhancing lesions throughout the brain and cerebellum.
All of these lesions are associated with areas of vasogenic edema.
The largest of these lesions is in the anterior right cerebellar hemisphere measuring 2.3 x 3.4 cm.
A large amount of vasogenic edema is present with mass effect upon the fourth ventricle as well as the medulla and pons.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus at this time.
There is a well-circumscribed 2-cm cystic structure in the region of the pineal, most consistent with a pineal cyst.
There is also mass effect upon the cerebellar tonsils.
The largest supratentorial metastasis lies within the left frontal lobe and measures 1.2 cm.
There is diffusely low signal throughout the skull which would be most consistent with diffuse osseous metastases from breast cancer.
IMPRESSION:  Innumerable intracranial supra and infratentorial metastases.
The largest lesion is in the right cerebellar hemisphere with a large amount of vasogenic edema.
There is mild mass effect upon the fourth ventricle with no hydrocephalus at this time.
There is mild displacement of the brainstem to the left.
There is also mass effect in the posterior fossa causing inferior tonsillar migration.
No evidence of tonsillar herniation at this time.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Please create o Contrast: OPTIRAY     [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 42 year old female patient with met breast cancer    REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: baseline eval prior to starting new therapy.
Please create oncology table including all measurable disease as TARGET lesions with these as BASELINE MEASUREMENTS.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  No axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is seen.
The heart, great vessels, and pericardium appear unremarkable.
No pleural or pericardial effusion.
The remainder of the lungs appear clear and there is no evidence of mass.
The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Two small round subcentimeter hypodensities within the right lobe of the liver are unchanged from prior studies (4:26, and 4:7).
Linear hyperdense bands compatible with scarring are unchanged and there is no definite evidence of metastatic disease.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, free fluid, or free air is identified.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Diverticulosis is again appreciated.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes or free fluid is seen.
BONE WINDOWS:  The appearance of diffuse sclerotic and lytic metastasis throughout the visualized osseous structures is unchanged.
Healing fracture deformity of the left ilium is again noted.
Lower cervical and upper thoracic compression deformities also appear unchanged.
Multiple bilateral healed rib fractures appear unchanged.
No evidence of disease progression with diffuse osseous metastasis again seen.
Again, metastatic disease in the femur increases the risk of hip fracture.
Unchanged appearance of the liver with persistent treatment effect from prior metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2152**] is a 42 yo woman with known metastatic breast cancer involving liver and bone, now with multiple intracranial mets including right cerebellar mass 2.3x3.4cm with brain stem compression, midline shift and inferior migration of cerebellar tonsils.
You can also keep your head incision open to air without dressings.
You should seek immediate medical attention if you experience fevers, headaches, vomiting, loss of balance, confusion, or dizziness.
