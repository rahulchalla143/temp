_____________________________________________________  CT Orbits IMPRESSION [[**4-24**]]: 1) A large defect within the left orbit from prior enucleation.
There has been interval increase in packing.
Post-surgical changes, including soft tissue and osseous changes appear similar to the prior exam.
2) Increased mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells.
3) There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells on the right, including the middle ear cavity, raising the question of mastoiditis  CT Head IMPRESSION [[**4-24**]]: 1.
The soft tissue and osseous changes within that area appear similar to those seen on the prior study from [**2111-10-30**].
No intracranial extension of infection is definitely identified on this exam.
There is new evidence of right mastoiditis.
Extensive sinus disease within the remaining paranasal sinuses.
2) Abnormal meningeal enhancement, a finding that suggests inflammation versus CSF leak.
3) Additional finding of debris within the lateral ventricles bilaterally raises the question of possible ventriculitis.
4) Abnormally prominent T2 signal about the right optic nerve, a finding that can be associated with increased intracranial pressure.
EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background rhythm and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and  subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
1) Multiple cerebral and cerebellar infarctions as described above probably secondary to underlying inflammatory disease.
2) Extensive sinus inflammatory disease as described above.
4) Persistent debris within the lateral ventricles bilaterally- the possibility of ventriculitis cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%); focused views only so  regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a probably small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade in limited views.
___________________________________________________    Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 50M with L ethmoid adenocarcinoma s/p multiple surgeries including L exenteration with chronic osteomyelitis of L orbit presents with MS change, found to have frank pus on LP with meningitis likely from contiguous spread from otitis media.
# Meningitis: LP in the ED significant for WBC 7200 with 97 polys, consistent with bacterial meningitis.
Given patient's extensive history of sinus and orbital infection, in addition to proven otitis media, highly concerning for contiguous spread of infection or spread from a strep pharyngitis since his blood cultures at [**Hospital **] Hospital gre out Strep pyogenes.
Recent wound cultures show resistant pseudomonas and MRSA; will cover broadly with meropenem 1 g IV Q8h (only initially, was d/ced), gentamicin 2 mg/kg IV Q8h, fluconazole 400 mg IV QD (only initially, was d/ced) and vancomycin 1 g IV Q12h.
His MRI did not show any fluid collection that Neurosurgey would drain.
Steroids were started for concern of the inflammatory reaction in the mengieal space; and were continued for a total of 6 day.
Therefore he was extubated on [**4-26**] without difficulty.
Repeat LP showed marked improvement with WBC 71 and GS without PMNs or MICROORGANISMS seen.
# MS Changes:  Pt with continued mental status changes post extubation.
Pt with very slow improvement and symtpoms suggesting possible expressive aphasia.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
MRI with evidence of subacute CVA with distribution consistent with septic emboli.
However follow-up TTE without evidence of PFO or endocarditis.
#  Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in setting of mental status changes.
He was extubated on [**4-26**] without complication and remained respiratory wise stable for remaining of hospitalization.
# Left Ethmoid Adenocarcinoma: Pt with rx with resection/radiation in past; recent recurrence rx'ed with resection.
During admision no acute changes.
# Pain management- Per the patient's family, he takes a great deal of pain perscription medications, some of which the fmaily feels he hides from them.
He was placed on a fentanly patech of 50 mcg/hour and recieved Percocet for breakthrough pain.
Fentanyl patch decreased and breakthrough pain controlled with percocet on PRN basis.
Pt discharged home on Fentanyl patch and percocets for breakthrough.
# Abnl LFTs- Last recorded LFTs in computer from [**2109**] were WNL but was found to have elevated LFT's.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia for 4 weeks.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 6438**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ethmoid adenocystic cancer meningitis osteomyelitis delerium CVA GERD Chronic pain   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: please take all medications as prescribed.
For your pain you are being sent home with Perscocet and Fentanyl Patch; you will need to follow up with your PCP to continue managing your pain.
please make all follow-up appointments; if unable reschedule as soon as possible.
Call your PCP or return to ED if you have: confusion, headache, neck stiffness, fever greater than 101.4, inability to tolerate food or drinks, persistent nausea or vomitting.
