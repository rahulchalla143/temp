Increasing opacities in the left mid and left lower lung, as well as a persistent area of confluent opacity at the right lung base.
In combination with findings on recent CTA of the chest of [**2105-8-8**], these findings may represent multifocal aspiration and/or aspiration pneumonia.
Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, right greater than left.
Left upper lobe opacity, likely consistent with pneumonia.
Bibasilar opacities might represent atelectasis and possible superimposed pnemonia (aspiration).
Fatcontaining soft tissue density inferior to the left liver lobe, likely represents fatnecrosis, less likely poorly organized collection.
