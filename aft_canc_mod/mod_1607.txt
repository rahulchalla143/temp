Pt initially presented to OSH for depression as has been at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33012**] unit since [**5-11**].
She was initially started on avelox for RLL infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis to 13.
EKG showed sinus brady, no acute ischmemic changes.
Pt was acutely agitated and required 2 mg IV haldol.
Pt also missed 2 doses of metoprolol, went into afib with RVR, which responded to dilt 10 mg IV x2.
Past Medical History: CAD (cath on [**2197-2-17**] showed 3VD, PCI to LCX and OM in [**2197-3-13**]) PAF (not anticoagulated) CVA Major depression with psychosis Dementia Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism DM2 CRI (baseline Cre 2.1-2.5) Seizure disorder (unclear if ever had seizure per family) PVD s/p femoral bypass and s/p bilateral CEA h/o erosive gastritis on omeprazole s/p cholecystectomy s/p hysterectomy Lung lesions suspicious for lung Ca Recent strep bovis infection, colon biopsies showed adenoma.

EKG: Afib, no ST changes since prior.
[**5-22**] cxr ap: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-28**], there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Areas of increased opacification at the right base and possibly behind the heart could merely represent a combination of vascular congestion and atelectasis, though possible aspiration must be considered.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with pleural fluid.
The apparent hiatal hernia seen on the previous image is not definitely appreciated on the current study.
Haziness at the right base is less prominent, though some of this may reflect a more upright position.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists as does opacification of the left base most likely representing pleural effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis.
TTE [**2197-5-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo woman with CAD s/p DES [**3-13**] on plavix, who was transfered from OSH due to respiratory distress.
# Pneumonia: During this admission the patient was treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics for suspected hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn with resolution of the symptoms.
# NSTEMI:  Most likely secondary to demand ischemia from increased metabolic demand of pneumonia.
ECHO on [**5-23**] could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality.
In the MICU, the pt was originally on heparin IV for presumed NSTEMI; however, this was discontinued afted 24 hours as the pt's troponin trended down once the pt's heart rate and hypoxia were treated.
The pt never endorsed chest pain and besides atrial fibrillation with rapid rate on telemetry during the first 24 hours of the admission, the pt had no other abnormalities on telemetry.
# Acute CHF exacerbation: Diastolic heart failure LVEF>55%.
The acute exacerbation was likely caused by NSTEMI and a fib with RVR.
# COPD flare: During the pt's MICU course the pt was given nebulizers as well as a 5-day prednisone burst that she responded well to.
# Acute MS changes:  Most likely secondary to multiple medical problems including hypoxia on admission.
Zyprexa was used as needed for symptom management, but not required many days prior to discharge.
# [**Last Name (un) **] on chronic renal failure:  Most likely caused by relative hypotension from poor forward flow.
Her renal failure improved prior to discharge.
# Anemia: Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT was stable without transfusion during admission.
Stools remained guaiac negative.
# HTN/relative hypotension: On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib.
Early sepsis/cardiogenic were less likely causes however considered.
# H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some concern re: colon ca.
# Psych: Continue outpt psych meds.

Discharge Condition: The patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile prior to discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of respiratory distress.
You were found to have a pneumonia which you were treated with antibiotics for.
You were also thought to have worsening of your COPD which you were treated with steroids for.
You also had a mild heart attack likely from the stress of the pneumonia.
If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, bright red blood per rectum, vomiting blood, dark tarry stools, or any other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention.
