Admission Date:  [**2106-8-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-8-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-11-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint: Hypotension Reason for MICU transfer: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line Placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 y.o.
man with history of ESRD on HD due to FSGS, RCC with known brain, pulmonary, and hepatic metastases s/p chemo and XRT, who presented to the MICU for hypotension.
On his last admission, he was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension which he developed during an MRI.
He also was found to have new ascites and progression of his metastatic disease.
His ascites was tapped, and given the 1600 neutrophils he was treated for SBP w/ ceftriaxone.
When he sat up for dialysis, he became dizzy and hypotensive to the 80s.
He noted a new raspy voice since this morning, diaphoresis, and a non-productive cough.
He also reports that he hasn't had a bowel movement in a week and a half and has had intermittent abdominal pain.
He denied fevers/chills, chest pain, SOB, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain.
He became hypotensive to the 80s and hypoxic.
CXR was concerning for a pneumonia.
He had b/l crackles on pulmonary exam, and he had a markedly distended abdomen and absent bowel sounds.

CXR [**8-26**] The multifocal airspace opacities have overall slightly improved in the background of metastatic disease and mild pulmonary edema; however, the right upper lobe opacity remains.
There is also unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
The loops of bowel do not appear to be distended and there is no obvious evidence of obstruction.
Given the supine nature of these films, we are unable to assess for fluid levels or free air in the abdomen.
Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable, though these images are limited somewhat because of underpenetration.
IMPRESSION:  Slight stacking of the small bowel which likely represents ileus but may also be secondary to ascites.
man w/ a history of ESRD on HD due to FSGS, RCC with known brain, pulmonary, and hepatic metastases s/p chemo and XRT, admitted to the MICU for hypotension which was likely a manifestation of his chronic hypotension from loss of tone from his metastatic disease burden, hypothyroidism, and hypovolemia.
Hypotension: He had several potential etiologies for his hypotension.
He does have known baseline hypotension which may have worsened in the setting of not receiving all of his doses of midodrine the day prior to admission.
He may also have been volume depleted in the setting of not having air conditioning and becoming diaphoretic, increasing his insensible losses.
Obstructive shock due to metastatic disease/ascites is another possibility.
Much less likely was the development of septic shock from his possible pneumonia found on CXR.
Given his known pulmonary metastases, he is at high risk for a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Arguing against sepsis was his lack of elevated WBC, lack of fever, and lack of elevated RR.
A cardiac cause was considered unlikely given the lack of history and unremarkable EKG, but still possible, especially given long history of dialysis and BNP of 4374.
His ECHO revealed pulmonary HTN and biatrial enlargement.
Adrenal insufficiency was essentially ruled out w/ a cortisol of 22.6 [**2106-8-22**].
Overall, his presentation seemed to be most consistent with rapid progression of his underlying metastatic renal cell cancer with progressive distributive pathophysiology and refractory shock due to the burden and extent of his disease.
Oxycodone SR (OxyconTIN) 30 mg PO Q12H hold for sedation or RR<10, 8.
