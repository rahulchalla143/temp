No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
Prominent sulci and ventricles, likely age-related involutional changes.
Hand X-ray [**2182-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute traumatic injury to the hand.
MRI Head [**2182-7-13**]: IMPRESSION: No acute infarct.
Brain atrophy, small vessel disease and chronic right posterior frontal infarct.
MRA Head/neck [**2182-7-27**]: Diffuse narrowing of the distal branches of the middle cerebral arteries and posterior cerebral arteries, likely indicating atherosclerotic disease, there is bilateral narrowing of the carotid siphons, more significant on the right, also consistent with atherosclerotic disease.
Atherosclerotic disease identified at the origin of the internal carotid arteries as described above, correlation with carotid Doppler ultrasound is recommended if clinically warranted.
Carotid U/S [**2182-7-30**]: Significant plaque in the distal common and internal carotid arteries with minimal plaque in the external carotid arteries.
Findings raise the possibility of an approximate 40-59% stenosis in the distal common carotid arteries.
There is probable moderately severe stenosis in the left external carotid artery.
Flow in the vertebral arteries is prograde  EGD/Colonoscopy on [**2182-8-8**] EGD reveals moderate-severe gastritis/esophagitis without bleeding ulcers.
Additionally, a few diverticula with small openings were seen in the ascending colon of mild severity.
Brief Hospital Course: 73yo male with insulin dependent diabetes here with hypoglycemia and repeated seizures.
Patient has distant history of seizures 30yrs ago.
Head CT and MRI were both negative for acute intracranial process.
Patient began having frequent and prolonged seizures on [**7-16**].
He became sedated with Ativan.
He initially had frequent electrographic seizures without any clinical manifestation.
This improved over the night of [**7-17**] to [**7-18**], and he had only frontal slowing on his EEG.
Initially, he did display some shaking movements that had no electrographic correlates.
Note that he was briefly started on valproic acid, which led to a transaminitis without obvious lesions on RUQ ultrasound.
He had no further complications related to his DMII, and his A1c was measured in the 6-7 range.
He had no major abnormalities on his lipid panel.
He continues to be on aspirin and plavix for his history of CVA and current cerebrovascular disease (refer to MRA head/neck, carotid U/S).
On [**8-8**], the patient developed some hypotension down to 75mm SBP and had some guaiac positive stool.
He was volume resuscitated and his blood pressures stabilized.
He was seen by GI who performed an EGD/colonoscopy, which revealed some scattered diverticula and esophagitis/gastritis.
