She returned to the OSH a few days later with increased jaundice and back pain.
She was found to have a markedly elevated bilirubin of 9.4 and an alk phos level of 492.
ALT/AST were moderately elevated at 348 and 291 respectively.

There was concern that her JP output was slightly bilious however there was no other evidence of leak reported.
CT abdomen demonstrated the drain in the appropriate position with mild peripancreatic stranding.
Her OR pathology demonstrated infiltrating adenocarcinoma with positive margins, signet cells and extensive perineural and lymphovascular invasion.
Past Medical History: - HTN: diagnosed 6 months ago - hyperlipidemia - breast cancer for the R breast s/p partial mastectomy and XRT ([**2107**]) - renal cysts (per report) - gallbladder adenocarcinoma: newly diagnosed as of [**10-25**] .

Adenocarcinoma: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-30**] w fever, rising bili, she was treated empirically for ascending cholangitis with a 7 day course of Unasyn on the surgical service.
She also underwent an ERCP with successful metal stenting for malignant strictures of her common bile duct and common hepatic duct.
OR pathology returned demonstrating infiltrating adenocarcinoma with positive margins, signet cells and extensive perineural and lymphovascular invasion.
CT demonstrated peritoneal metastases.
However, given her ongoing active renal failure, she was not a candidate for chemotherapeutics.
Patient opted to make herself CMO, stop HD, but continue antibiotics for her cdiff infection.
On [**11-19**], patient had episode of billious vomiting after which she became tachypnic.
It was believed this represented an aspiration event.
She was treated symptomatically, but had increasing respiratory distress.
HD/ultrafiltration was started on [**11-5**] for ATN which is being attributed to hypotension in the OR.
Leukocytosis/Hypotension:  Patient was noted to have a leukocytosis up to 22 from 10, in the setting of c diff positivie diarrhea, PO vancomycin and IV flagyl started.
This was thought to be [**2-3**] to a GI bleed related to a metastasis.
The patient was found to have new onset atrial fibrillation to a HR in the 150s associated with hypotension to a systolic in the 70s.
