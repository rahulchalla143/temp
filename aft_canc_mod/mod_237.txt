ATTENDING:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9753**] HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old male who was basically diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma with metastasis.
The patient presented to the [**Hospital **] Clinic on [**10-3**] with the complaints of orthopnea and lower extremity edema, which was felt to be consistent with CHF.
At home, the patient reportedly diuresed about 5 kg overnight and then subsequently developed weakness and vomiting on [**10-4**], [**2136**].
The patient was seen at the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department on the [**10-4**] for worsening shortness of breath.
The patient had a hypertensive and bradycardiac episode in the emergency department that that was afebrile.
EKG showed no changes.
Labs were notable for acute renal failure, increased white blood count.
The patient was given IV fluids for low blood pressure and subsequently developed increased shortness of breath.
The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Initial bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 25% to 30%.
The patient was transferred to the MICU and started on dopamine drip for hypertension.
HYPERTENSION:   It was unclear whether the etiology of hypertension was sepsis versus cardiogenic versus hypovolemia secondary to over diuresis.
Subsequently, the patient became hypertensive and less volume overloaded.
BRADYCARDIA:  Bradycardia was felt to be secondary to calcium channel blocker and beta blocker in the setting of acute renal failure; resolved after starting these medications.
CHF:  CHF in the setting of volume overload.
The patient had positive troponin, but negative CKMBs.
Repeat echocardiogram showed increased mitral regurgitation from 2+ to 4+.
Focal akinesis in the septum and apex, as compared to global hypokinesis on the first echocardiogram, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 30% to 35%, as compared to 25 to 30 initially.
Echocardiogram findings and troponin were felt to be secondary to strain secondary to increased blood pressure.
IV Nipride was used in the MICU to help with afterload reduction.
Elevated white count could have been secondary to steroids.
Chest x-rays were positive for possible atelectasis versus infiltrates.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated for hypercarbic failure.
The patient had some issues with delicate fluid balance.
