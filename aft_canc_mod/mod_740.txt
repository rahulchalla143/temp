Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with hx of MM (IIIA kappa) s/p autoBMT with relapse, PAF, subdural hematoma who presents with hypoxia and altered mental status.
# Altered mental status - Patient had many etiologies to explain his altered mental status.
He was on decadron, hypercalcemic, hypernatremic, likely uremic, and hypercarbic.
He also had a fever so infectious etiologies could not be excluded.
Then in the setting of his atrial fibrillation with RVR, the patient became more altered.
We had a discussion with the HCP given his persistent agitation and delirium.
As his prognosis for MM was poor and his delirium and atrial fib with RVR (see below) were acute issues, it was decided to change the goals of care to comfort only.
# Comfort: on [**2167-12-29**], the goals of care were changed to comfort only.
# Multiple myeloma - We were in contact with his primary oncologist and continued the steroids as previously prescribed.
# Acute on chronic RF-Likely a prerenal state leading to ATN from volume depletion with MMM and poor skin turgor on exam.
We consulted with renal who assisted in management of his acid/base and fluid status.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient went into atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**2167-12-26**] and several times on subsequent occasions.
Oftentimes RVR was associated with anxiety and agitation.
