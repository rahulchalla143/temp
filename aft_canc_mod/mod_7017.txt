Admission Date:  [**2129-11-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-12-1**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman originally admitted to the Medical Service with a remote history of breast cancer and six weeks of midthoracic back pain radiating to bilateral flanks, worse with movement.
She was treated with Percocet but continued with significant back pain, abdominal pain and constipation.
Anxiety and depression.
History of breast cancer in [**2112**], status post lumpectomy and radiation therapy.
General:  The patient was an elderly woman in moderate pain.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Back: There was positive midthoracic tenderness.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
The patient was seen by the Neurosurgery Service who noted a compression fracture at T9 on plain films.
MRI of thoracic spine revealed a large right paraspinal mass at 3 x 5 x 3 cm and T9 anterior wedge compression fracture with retropulsed segment compressing the cord.
There was evidence of metastases at C7, T1, T4, T8, T11, and T12.
CT Surgery was consulted to rule out paraspinal mass in the thoracic region.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] recommended T9 vertebrectomy with T8-T10 arthrodesis for stabilization, for palliation and relief of pain.
This most likely represented a primary lung cancer with direct extension to the T9 vertebrae with paraspinal soft tissue mass.
Bone scan results showed multifocal osseous metastatic disease.
Head CT showed no lesions.
Chest, abdomen and pelvis CT showed right lower lobe mass with a lung mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy and compression fracture of T9.
She underwent embolization of the tumor on [**2129-11-17**], without complications.
There were no intraoperative complications.
On [**11-23**], the patient was localizing to pain on the right, and withdrew the right lower extremity.
She had a liver and gallbladder ultrasound which showed multiple metastatic lesions with no ductal dilatation and no cholelithiasis.
The abdomen showed an increase in size of all lesions, right lung base, gallbladder, and biliary system.
