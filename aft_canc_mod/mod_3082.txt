HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 73-year-old white male with a history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes insulin dependent, and long history of bilateral calf claudication left greater than right with an onset of left foot rest pain, and dependent rubor as of [**Month (only) **] of this year.
The patient underwent an arteriogram on [**2157-1-21**] which demonstrated aortoiliac disease which was extensive, a 2-3 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, which extended to the left common iliac artery, the left SFA was totally occluded, the left popliteal was totally occluded, there was three vessel runoff with the proximal occlusion with slow reconstruction of the distal AT and the dorsalis pedis was patent.
History of cerebrovascular accident in [**2140**] which presented with left sided weakness with no residual.
Type 2 diabetes insulin dependent x12 years.
History of prostate carcinoma treated with radiation therapy in [**2150**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing, history of myocardial infarction.
Negative chest pain, negative PND, orthopnea, and congestive heart failure negative.
The patient has no history of gastrointestinal disease, bowel changes, melena, porosis, or liver disease.
No reoccurrence of cerebrovascular accident symptoms.
General appearance:  This is an alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates an abdominal aortic aneurysm on palpation without tenderness.
On the left, pulses are absent at the femoral, popliteal, and DP and PT, there are no femoral bruits.
Heart is regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, there are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There are no bruits, no organomegaly.
There is an abdominal aorta on palpation.
The bone-joint examination shows bilateral ruborous changes left greater than right on the foot.
The left toe is with dusky discoloration which is painful to light touch.
Hematology was requested to see the patient secondary to elevated INR and PTT with a total white count of 20.3.
Hematology felt the patient had polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] that if the hematocrit is greater than 54, that he would require phlebotimization for at least [**2-11**] units of red blood cells, and at a later date may need a bone marrow to rule out any myelosuppressive disease.
Recommendations were 2D echocardiogram to determine wall motion, left ventricular systolic function.
Stress portion of the MIBI was there were no anginal symptoms or ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
The nuclear study demonstrated no myocardial perfusion defects were seen.
The ejection fraction was calculated at 58% with no wall motion abnormalities.
Patient was begun on IV Heparin because of his polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with an increased risk of thrombotic events.
The patient remained NPO secondary to absence of bowel sounds and no flatus.
There were no acute or significant electrocardiogram changes.
Hematology saw the patient prior to discharge and discussed with his primary care physician the need for followup of his polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and recommended no iron replacements.
He had a monophasic dorsalis pedis and right PT.
He continued on his Lopressor 25 tid, and he should follow up with his primary care physician for continued blood pressure management and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] followup.
Aortoiliac disease status post aorto-bifemoral bypass graft.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] status post phlebotimization 2 units of packed red blood cells with improvement.
Type 2 diabetes insulin dependent controlled.
Hypertension improved.
