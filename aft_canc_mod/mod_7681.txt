Possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2193-8-22**]:  Echo:    The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
Dilated left atrium.
[**2193-8-24**]:  chest x-ray:   Evidence of failure with pulmonary plethora and a left effusion again seen, essentially unaltered since the prior chest x-ray.
Demand ventricular pacing.
Intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block type.
Since the previous tracing there is no significant change.
Overall, the lungs appear clearer than they did on [**2193-8-24**], with a substantial decrease in the amount of pulmonary edema present.
There was, however, a residual opacity in the left mid lung, which represents atelectasis.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Radiographic images from the OSH demonstrated free air and leakage of contrast from the bowel.
He was also reported to be in atrial fibrillation and started on an amiodarone drip.
On POD #1, he was tachycardic, febrile and hypotensive and there was a concern for septic shock.
His tachycardia was controlled with digoxin and lopressor and he was weaned off his amiodarone.
His fever persisted with a rising white blood cell count and he was started on vancomycin and fluconazole.
His blood and urine cultures showed no growth.
He was reported to have an isolated episode of elevated heart rate and his lopressor was increased to control the rate.
He also had an isolated episode of emesis and was made NPO.
He tolerated his diet but began having episodes of diarrhea.
A chest x-ray was done which showed left lobe residual opacity suggestive of ateletasis.
