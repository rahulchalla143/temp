CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a slowed and disorganized posterior background with predominant theta rhythms.
This record was diffusely abnormal and suggestive of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal to mid septum and inferior segment and severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall.
The other segments are mildly hypokinetic..
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional akinesis and mild global hypokinesis.
Dilated, depressed right ventricle.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
LIVER U/S: FINDINGS: Liver architecture appears diffusely echogenic.
No focal lesion identified within the liver.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No free fluid is seen.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
5.2-cm rounded hypoechoic structure with through transmission seen in the left kidney, consistent with a cyst.
Limited views of the pancreas head appear grossly unremarkable, though assessment of the body and tail are limited by abdominal gas.
Moderate right pleural effusion is noted.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, other forms of liver disease, including more significant forms of liver disease such as hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
No focal lesions are identified within the liver.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Small moderate of right pleural effusion.
Left renal cyst.
Biliary Tree: A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 8mm.
The limited intrahepatic cholangiogram was normal.
There were few filling defects in the distal CBD consistent with CBD stones.
A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 8mm.
The limited intrahepatic cholangiogram was normal.
There were few filling defects in the distal CBD consistent with CBD stones.
Recommendations: Continue IV antibiotics CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out metastatic disease Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Continue ICU care for now.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is an 86 yo male with pmhx htn, prostate cancer who presents with jaundice, fever, elevated bilirubin and dilated ducts on RUQ US suggesting acute cholangitis.
Acute cholangitis with resulting sepsis-  Diagnosed with fever, abd pain, jaundice, dilated CBD on RUQ ultrasound and elevated bilirubin.
S/P ERCP with stent placement, passage of pus and sludge.
Resolved with decreasing WBC and only minimally elevated Alk Phos and bilirubin.
Afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Also had metabolic acidosis with bicarb of 13 on admission.
Respiratory Failure requiring Intubation- intubated for airway protection.
Transferred to floor, but then back to ICU due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
No further events .
Delerium - Acute: - Given that patient was intubated for airway protection and not respiratory distress, he had a prolonged weaning course.
CT of the head showed no acute abnormalities.
Many labs to rule out specific causes (infection, thyroid, ammonia) sent and were negative as above.
Neurology evaluated patient and felt that mental status was slow to recover due to severe nature of initial infection and respiratory distress.
EEG was consistent with toxic/metabolic etiology.
B-blocker held due to low blood pressure.
Acute Renal Failure on CKD Stage IV - Resolved.
Likely from decreased perfusion and possible ATN.
Likely from combination of sepsis and renal failure.
Anemia Chronic Disease Hct trended down as did WBC count.
Likely from bone marrow suppression due to infection.
Hypernatremia Likely from no PO intake.
Benign Hypertension- Beta blocker held due to tenous blood pressures.
Prostate/colon cancers- No active issues.
PEG Flush PEG with 100ml for all medications   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cholangitis Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Altered Mental Status Secondary: Prostate Cancer Colon Cancer Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
You also had respiratory failure requiring intubation, which has now resolved.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have worsening abdominal pain or shortness of breath.
