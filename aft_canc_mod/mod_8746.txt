INDICATIONS FOR ADMISSION:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a fairly active 82-year-old woman who presented with a history of chest pain.
She was evaluated and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Her workup included radiographs that demonstrated a mass in the left upper lobe and was confirmed by computed tomography scan.
She also has a history of some atypical visual changes; possibly transient ischemic attacks, and a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
For the first two postoperative days, she was monitored in the Postanesthesia Care Unit for some (1) respiratory lability and (2) relative hypotension requiring [**Name (NI) 103585**] drip at low-to-moderate doses to maintain her blood pressure.
We were especially aggressive about this given her previous history of atypical transient ischemic attacks.
On or about the third postoperative day, the patient manifested signs of respiratory distress.
A chest x-ray demonstrated collapse of the remaining left lower lobe, and the patient was intubated.
Over approximately the subsequent second to nine days, the patient showed steady slow improvement.
She did not show any evidence of multiorgan failure, and her pulmonary symptoms slowly resolved.
She treated with prophylactic antibiotics, and several cultures did not prove her to have a pneumonia.
At this point, we re-evaluated her swallowing given the prolonged intubation and previous surgery, and thought this would be prudent.
Her swallowing evaluation showed gross aspiration.
However, increasingly over the next one to two weeks, this was felt actually to be related to withdrawal of her Hydrea medication for polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
We had a long discussion with her hematologist about this, and this was felt eventually to be the most likely cause of her leukocytosis.
Her pulmonary status, however, continued to be tenuous requiring aggressive pulmonary toilet.
Because of intermittent left lower lobe collapse and effusion on that side, Interventional Radiology was consulted and placed a small drain in the left pleural space on postoperative day fourteen for effusion.
The culture did not grow out any bacteria on final analysis.
Around this time, Ear/Nose/Throat was consulted for her swallowing difficulties, and she was found to have bilateral vocal cord paresis.
It was around this time she also had manifest signs of increasing blood pressure lability.
She had an acute decompensation around [**10-1**] or [**10-2**], and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was deferred for a later date.
The patient had an elevation in her troponin to a level of 18, and an echocardiogram which showed severe global dysfunction of her left ventricle.
She also had some arrhythmias at this time with some ventricular as well as atrial arrhythmias.
It was unclear as to the etiology of her acute decompensation in cardiac function, and this may have been related to some adverse reaction to a drug (which eventually remained undetermined).
By [**10-6**], the patient was showing steady progress.
Again, at this time, the patient had no signs of sepsis or infection.
On or about [**10-9**], the patient had an episode of monocular blindness and was consulted by the Neurology Service.
By [**10-13**], the patient was showing improvement with Physical Therapy, and Speech and Swallow evaluation showed significant improvement and no evidence of aspiration, and she was placed on a diet with aspiration maneuvers as described by the Speech Therapy Department.
It should be mentioned that the patient had an increasing interstitial pattern on her chest x-rays.
The differential included infection versus inflammatory connective tissue versus lymphatic spread of tumor.
Her pathology showed bronchoalveolar carcinoma well differentiated as well as a noninvasive thymoma.
She was eventually started on prophylactic antibiotics, but on [**10-14**] the patient had an acute decompensation of an extremely severe nature.
The patient showed evidence of respiratory distress and was intubated immediately by Anesthesia.
Her hemodynamics became progressively/rapidly decompensated, and fluids and pressors were necessary for support.
Immediately, invasive hemodynamic monitoring lines were placed including a Swan-Ganz catheter that was consistent with septic physiology.
Aggressive treatment was performed at this time to optimize her cardiac, respiratory, pulmonary, and renal function.
We agreed that aggressive management would continue to see if she showed dramatic improvement.
Over the subsequent two day, the patient showed absolutely no improvement with progression to multiorgan dysfunction.
After a long discussion with the patient's family (including her son who was her health care proxy), they felt that the patient would not want to persist with this mode of life support given her age and extremely poor prognosis.
