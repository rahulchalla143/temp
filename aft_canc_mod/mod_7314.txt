Admission Date:  [**2127-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-1-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Vomiting and Right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: 52 y/o otherwise healthy LHD F presents with vomiting and R side weakness x2 days.
Went to work on Monday and noticed difficulty maneuvering around object and people on her R side as well as difficulty with fine motor in the R hand.
This morning while walking outside, patient reported that she fell forward due to her R side weakness and her husband noticed that she was unable to understand him, he became concerned and took her to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.
While at OSH, head CT was done which revealed a L frontal lesion with significant edema.
She reports slight headache, nausea, R side weakness, and ataxia.
She denies any dizziness or blurred vision.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Persistent mild expressive aphasia Incision clean, dry and intact  Pertinent Results: [**2127-11-18**] 03:48PM URINE  HOURS-RANDOM [**2127-11-18**] 03:48PM URINE  UCG-NEGATIVE [**2127-11-18**] 03:48PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Hazy SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.013 [**2127-11-18**] 03:48PM URINE  BLOOD-SM NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-8.0 LEUK-MOD [**2127-11-18**] 03:48PM URINE  RBC-0-2 WBC-[**1-17**] BACTERIA-MOD YEAST-NONE EPI-[**1-17**]  MRI Brain [**11-18**] IMPRESSION:2.9 x 3.4 x 3.5cm lesion in the left frontal lobe, parasagittal in location, with heterogeneous signal intensity, a few areas of mineralization/blood products and a thick irregular rind of enhancing tissue in the periphery; moderate surrounding edema and mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle with minimal shift of the midline structures to the right side.
Possibilities include a primary glial neoplasm such as GBM, metastatic lesion, or subacute hematoma, the latter being less likely given the thick rind of enhancing tissue in the periphery.
While there are some vascular structures in close proximity to the lesion, these are not abnormally dilated.
Consider neurosurgical consult and close followup if no intervention is contemplated.
No findings concerning for primary neoplasm or metastatic lesion in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Approximately 2.4 x 2.8 x 2.8-cm parasagittal left frontal lobe mass with associated moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal effacement, as seen on CT and MRI.
Minimal cavernous carotid artery calcifications are notable for the patient's age.
[**11-21**] CT Head Post Op: Apparent resection of the left frontal lobe mass with pneumocephalus in the operative bed and along the left frontal cerebral convexity surface.
The brain edema noted was also present preoperatively, with relatively negligible alteration in its associated mass effect.
There is no subfalcine herniation.
No other new osseous or extracranial soft tissue abnormalities are detected.
[**11-22**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: The signal pattern of the blood in the operative bed suggests that it is subacute in nature.
Certainly, upon review of the CT scan from the preceding day, there did not appear to be hyperdense components within the tumor resection bed, typically seen with acute hemorrhage.
The present signal pattern is largely consistent with intracellular methemoglobin (subacute blood products within the central portion of the tumor bed).
Finally, it is conceivable that the hyperintense blood components might obscure a region of enhancement that could represent residual tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 y/o F with vomiting, R sided weakness, and headache presents with L frontal mass.
She was admitted to neurosurgery for further neurosurgical evaluation and metastatic work up.
On [**11-19**], patient had CT torso which revealed no lesions.
She developed a UTI and was placed on Bactrim and a urine culture was sent and her foley discontinued.
6. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: [**11-16**] Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left frontal Mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
