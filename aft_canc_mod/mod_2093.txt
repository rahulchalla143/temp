Admission Date:  [**2120-9-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-9-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-6-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic malignant melanoma metastatic to liver, lungs, and brain and small bowel who was admitted with right flank pain times two days and shortness of breath times two days.
The patient had woken up from sleep four days ago with right flank pain which was pleuritic and radiated to the chest and arm.
He became short of breath two days prior to admission.
Patient was first diagnosed in [**2107**] with melanoma and has been complicated by cerebral hemorrhage in [**12/2119**] with associated seizures status post craniotomy and also by the aforementioned metastases to liver and small bowel.
He recently completed the first 10-week cycle two weeks ago, and repeat CT scans and the brain MRI, which were done on [**9-12**], revealed significant regression in his ............ abdominal and pelvic disease, undetectable pulmonary nodules, and regression of the lesions in his brain.
Patient had numerous risk factors for a clot, which included his known malignancy, his treatment with thalidomide, which can be prothrombotic, his long car rides, which were greater than three hours times two.
In the Emergency Room the patient had a CT angiogram which showed 1) bilateral large pulmonary emboli with clot in the left main pulmonary artery bifurcation of the left and right main pulmonary arteries,  2) right-sided pulmonary effusion, and 3) collaterals of left chest wall suggesting a left subclavian clot.
Patient was not started on anticoagulation given his past medical history of spontaneous bleeding and his melanoma metastases to the brain.
Malignancy melanoma diagnosed in [**2107**].
Brain metastases status post XRT whole-brain radiation in the spring and summer of [**2120**].
Lung and small bowel metastases.
Pain with movements.
HEENT showed alopecia, plethora of the head and face.
Oropharynx:  Clear, PERRL and bilateral nystagmus.
Jugular venous distention lying flat 4 cm from clavicular line.
No carotid bruits.
Lungs: Right-sided one-third up reduced breath sounds, rales at the edge of the base, reduced breath sounds bilaterally, reduced fremita.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, [**3-3**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.
There are no significant laboratory abnormalities on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted from the Emergency Room where he had a CT angiogram showing 1) bilateral large pulmonary embolus with the largest embolus seen in the left main pulmonary artery; saddle embolus is present, 2) right-sided pleural effusion, 3) collateral vessels seen within the left chest wall suggesting occlusion of the left subclavian.
Patient also went directly to Interventional Radiology as he was not a candidate for coagulation for aforementioned spontaneous intracranial bleed.
In [**2119-12-31**] patient had IVC filter placed as well as an echocardiogram to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the pulmonary embolism and to guide IV fluid therapy.
Patient also had bilateral lower extremity Dopplers performed on [**2120-9-24**].
The results were 1) nonocclusive thrombus at the right common femoral vein which has extensions to the greater saphenous vein and the deep femoral vein, 2) no evidence of left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal, a trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate 2+ TR regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion compared with the findings of prior report of [**2120-4-19**], left ventricular enlargement is no longer apparent.
Given this result, deemed that right ventricular failure was not present, patient was transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the floor on [**2120-9-24**] in good condition.
Patient was satting approximately 95 to 96% on transfer on room air but was continuously short on breath with any walking or activity such as brushing teeth.
The results of the CT were no acute hemorrhage or mass effect, stable appearance of the right frontal lobe resection bed, and left cerebral hemorrhage likely due to punctate left cerebellar tonsillar metastases.
The finding of small focus of hyperdensity within the left cerebellum was consistent with the finding of susceptibility within the same region on a prior MRI and likely represented an area of old hemorrhage into a metastatic lesion.
There was the issue of recent hemorrhage into the cerebellar metastases.
In addition, patient had large pulmonary embolus.
Patient was loathed to begin anticoagulation and wanted to wait and see if he had more sequelae from clotting before addressing anticoagulation, especially given that he had a filter placed to prevent further pulmonary embolus from the lower extremities.
Pulmonology does not recommend anticoagulation with the idea that Heparin would not significantly affect propagation of the existing clot and the clot would eventually be reabsorbed and the patient would still have significant risk of bleeding into his metastatic lesion.
On [**2120-9-27**] the patient had sudden onset chest pain with pleuritic component.
EKG showed no S-T depressions, no T-wave inversions, no new Q-waves and was relatively unchanged from his admission EKG.
A stat portable chest x-ray was performed on [**2120-9-27**] showing 1) improving right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation, 2) patchy opacity of the left lateral lung field corresponding to area of pulmonary embolus on recent CT scan.
Exam was otherwise unchanged from prior study and was negative for pneumothorax or new pneumonia.
Given these results pain was attributed to the existing pulmonary embolus, and pain was eventually controlled on intravenous Dilaudid.
On [**2120-9-28**] patient awoke with pain relieved, intermittent nausea.
