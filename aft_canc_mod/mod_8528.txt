He was transfused an additional 1U and given bicarbonate in his IVF for renal protection.
On the floor the pt continued to have slow blood loss.
GI was consulted but an EGD was deferred because no therapeutic options were seen and the pt was reluctant to have a procedure done.
He was thought to have chronic bleeding most likely from multiple small lesions in the duodenum and erosive gastritis.
The pt will probably continue to require transfusions if the hct continues to fall.
Plan was coordinated between Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital3 2558**] to have hematocrits drawn every 4 days as long as he does not have grossly bloody stools and will be scheduled for regular blood transfusions through the pheresis unit at [**Hospital1 18**] with scheduling through [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 46376**].
