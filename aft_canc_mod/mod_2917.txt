She also has known aortic stenosis and coronary disease, undergoing a percutaneous intervention to the LAD back in [**2160**].
She was in her usual state of health until the night prior to admission, where she developed acute shortness of breath.
While in the EW, she became hypotensive and started on Dopamine.
She went on to develop wide complex tachycardia requiring DCCV back to a normal sinus rhythm.
Post DCCV, EKG was remarkable for ST depressions v2-v6.
She remained hypotensive and subsequently started on Levophed.
Repeat EKG was notable for resolution of subendocardial ischemia.
Past Medical History: HTN, ESRD - on HD, CAD - s/p LAD stent, Diabetes mellitus, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypothyroidism, Osteoarthritis, s/p Left Hip fracture, Ovarian Cancer - s/p TAH/BSO with ELAP  Social History: Lives alone in senior living.

FINDINGS: There is acute noncompressible thrombus within the inferior portion of the right internal jugular vein and also the right axillary vein.
On Doppler, there is also absent venous flow in the right subclavian vein.
CONCLUSION: Acute right upper limb deep venous thrombosis.
Doppler ultrasound of the left upper limb shows patent and compressible vessels.
Further surgical  evaluation included a dental consult and bedside examination which found no evidence of infection.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm - no atrial or ventricular arrhythmias were noted.
She remained pressor dependent and continued on Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm - brief runs of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted on telemetry.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm - no further dysrhythmia were noted.
An ultrasound was obtained on [**8-9**] for right upper extremity swelling which showed thrombus in the RI, R subclavian and R axillary vein.
Also on POD#7 she developed diarrhea which was positive for C.Diff and she was started on Flagyl with resolution of the diarrhea.
