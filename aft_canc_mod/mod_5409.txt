He had necrotizing enterocolitis diagnosed at 5 weeks of     age, after presenting with bloody stools and pneumatosis     by x-ray.

He was also noted to have     recurrence of pneumatosis at that time.
Infectious disease:  As previously noted, [**Known lastname **] received     two 2 week courses of intravenous antibiotics in concert     with treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis.
He also was     noted to have copious endotracheal secretions and was     treated for presumed tracheitis with a trached aspirate     culture positive for staphylococcal aureus.
Hematology:  [**Known lastname **] had a mild coagulopathy discovered on     routine preoperative labs at [**Hospital3 1810**].
