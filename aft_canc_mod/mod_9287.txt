Service MEDICINE Chief Complaint back pain     Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure T12 transpedicular decompression and posterior instrumented   fusion T10 to L2     History of Present Illness 47 yo male with renal cell cancer with intrahepatic and   paraspinal metastasis treated with stereotactic body   radiotherapy, completed on [**2111-8-5**], who is admitted   for pain control.
He was doing well after completion of   radiotherapy but within a few weeks developed severe left leg   pain as well as muscular spasms and areas of numbness.
Since   this weekend, he has developed severe left leg and back pain.
However, he denied fecal or urinary incontinence and focalized   weakness.
Because of the pain, on [**2111-9-28**], pt was admitted to local   hospital where he received pain medications and MRI under   anesthesia because of inability to lie flat.
The MRI revealed "      a large mass over the right renal fossa extending to the   paraspinal muscle and also there was a tumor involving the   thoracic 11 and thoracic 12 vertebral body extending into the   spinal canal, cord compression, and also a tumor involving the   paraspinous muscle.
Possible metastatic lesion of cervical 2   vertebral body with possible cord compression.
Review of Systems:   (+) Per HPI   (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or   gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies      cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
No   recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denies   arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
No feelings of depression or   anxiety.
Partial right nephrectomy in [**1-/2107**] after the patient   presented with hematuria and flank pain to [**Hospital1 **]   Hospital and was found on CT scan to have a 5.1 x 5.8 right   renal mass.
Resection of recurrent renal cell carcinoma in the right   subcostal region and rib in 11/[**2106**].
The pathology of the   resected tumor was consistent with the previously resected clear    cell primary.
This mass    had replaced the left side of the C2 vertebral body and extended    into the pedicle and neural foramen on the left at the C2-C3   level.
The patient,   however, had a nondiagnostic tumor biopsy, and was therefore   ineligible.
Resection of right retroperitoneal tumor, right colectomy,   partial liver resection, and ileal transverse colostomy   anastomosis on [**2110-11-14**] for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in   previous right nephrectomy bed with involvement of the liver,   right colon and right psoas muscle.
[**2111-6-15**] taken off protocol 09-215 because of disease   progression including T11-T12 paraspinal lesion invading spinal   canal   14.
[**Date range (3) 12208**] SRS to right infrahepatic metastasis;   [**Date range (2) 12209**] SRS to paraspinal metastasis     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   - Renal Cell Carcinoma (please see below)   - h/o RLE DVT [**8-/2107**]   - Colonic perforation   - Hyponatremia   - Anemia   - Cervical surgery with rod-placement due to C2 met   -[**2110-11-14**] Right colectomy, Segment VI partial liver   resection, resection of retroperitoneal tumor mass; ileal   transverse colostomy anastomosis (side to side).
He has 3 siblings and 2   children without medical concerns.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes   Abd: soft, tender in his right flank and RUQ area, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising   Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII intact.
no oral lesions.
The paraspinal mass which originates at the lytic lesion of   right 12th   rib, invades into the spinal canal, is more prominent as   compared to the prior studies.
Spinal cord compression at the   level of D12, D11, and D10, mostly from the right side but   crossing anteriorly to the left at the level of D11.
Findings   are consistent with spinal cord compression and can be further   evaluated by MRI.
The mass in the right lateral posterior abdominal wall   adjacent to the   liver now demonstrates small amount of air in it with possible   tract into   adjacent small bowel loop, suggesting a fistula.
Increase in size and number of numerous bilateral pulmonary   metastases and  one of them in the right middle lobe with a   cavitation.
New small right pleural effusion.
Extensive fluid surrounding the surgical bed, without   definite   organization or rim to suggest abscess formation.
This is   concerning for a   paraspinal abscess.
However, given the presence of a lesion near      this   location on a previous MRI, it is unclear if there is also a   component of   necrotic neoplastic disease.
Small, rim-enhancing collection in the left paraspinal   musculature on the   left, also concerning for a paraspinal abscess.

#Back/leg pain secondary to known spinal mets and cord   compression seen on imaging without neurological deficits:    Radiation oncology and Neurosurgery were consulted and decided   that a   surgical approach was best for his management.
He was extubated   POD#1 without difficulty.
Given his long history of chronic   pain, the pain managment team was consulted and recommended a   ketamine drip for pain control and dilaudid IV as needed.
He was   transferred to the floor in stable condition although he   suffered [**2111-4-9**] back pain and intense headache.
He was given IV caffeine      and benadryl for his headache with minimal improvement.
He will be discharged on fentanyl patch 400   mcg/hr q72 hrs, gabapentin 300 mg q8, indomethacin 25 mg tid,   tylenol 1000mg tid, methadone 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], and prn dilaudid [**3-23**]   mg po as needed for breakthrough pain.
Of note, a CT L-spine   [**10-16**] was read as concerning for possible paraspinal abscess.
This was not clinically correlated as the patient was afebrile   without leukocytosis.
The neurosurgery team reviewed the CT   films and reported that the changes seen were most consistent   with post-op surgical changes rather than infection.
