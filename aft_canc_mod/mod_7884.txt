Brief Hospital Course: 53-year-old male patient with h/o of hodgkins lymphoma in BMT '[**64**],  h/o splenectomy, h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism was initially admitted for fever in setting +sick contacts.
Pt initially did well first night, but then had rapidly worsened hypoxia am of [**2181-1-28**] with CT chest showing new multilobar consolidations.
Developed septic shock and ARDS, started broad Abx (vanc/cefepime/azithromycin), transfered to MICU, was intubated for hypoxemic resp failure [**1-28**].
There was some concern initially with persistant leukocytosis in 20s with fevers and imaging with pleural effusions that raised concern for parapneumonic efffuisons or empyema.
Still having low grade fevers and imaging with L>R infiltrates but clinically much better.
Of note, during hospitalization, pt had some LFT elevation with US/CT showing sludge but no evidence of cholecystitis and this was likely [**1-29**] acute illness and possible TPN which he recieved for few days (improving by time of discharge).
Also developed Anemia 12-->8 w/o gross evidence of bleeding or hemolysis, s/p 1U prbc [**2-9**] with hgb stable 9s thereafter.
Some concern initially with persistant leukocytosis/fevers and CT with persistant L>>R pleural effusions concerning for parapneumonic effusions but white count finally down.
Pt has been afebrile (low grade temps) - continue Nafcillin 2 gm IV q 4hr through [**2-18**] for total of 3 weeks per ID (confirmed plan) -since downtrending wbc, can hold off on [**Female First Name (un) 576**], but needs repeat imaging to ensure resolved effusions, f/u [**Hospital **] clinic in [**2181-3-6**] - continue incentive spirometry - guiafenisin prn, duonebs -note, pt is post splenectomy, asked to confirm pneumovax and meningitis vaccine, but none here while PNA .
Leukocytosis: as above, 20s for several days, today down to 12, as above, concern for parapneumonic effusions but holding [**Female First Name (un) 576**] as above with repeat CXR in 1week.
Currently with low grade temps, no fevers.
As for other sources,  LIJ tip not sent, PICC site looks good, no urinary complaints, no diarrhea.
note, baseline elevated wbc partly due to post-splenectomy.
Anemia and thrombocytosis: baseline hgb 12s, here 9-->7s s/p 1U prbc [**2-9**], now 9s.
No obvious bleeding or hemolysis but was acutely ill. -Fe studies will be unreliable since got blood t/f, hold supp since Fe load with transfusion -will need to be followed as outpt -as for thrombocytosis, likely reactive (anemia, illness) and post-splenectomy .
Hodgkins disease s/p BMT'[**64**], no issues .
Elevated Alk phos: RUQ [**2-4**] with sludge, no dilation, bili normal, no RUQ pain -slow trend down, monitor, follow as outpt .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Influenza type B Severe MSSA multilobar pneumonia as superinfection causing ARDS Anemia s/p blood transfusion   Discharge Condition: GOOD  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with influeza with superimposed severe bilateral pneumonia due to staph.
You had anemia during this hospitalization likely from your severe illness, please follow this with your doctor to make sure this is getting better.
