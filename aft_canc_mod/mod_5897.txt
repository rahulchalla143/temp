Argon Plasma Laser cautery of active bleeding.
History of Present Illness: 62 year old M with history of SCC lung s/p LUL and partial LLL lobectomy [**7-/2098**], no chemo or radiation who initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] [**2100-8-3**] with hemoptysis.
Patient states he had developed a cough and chest congestion w/o fevers.
Then around [**8-1**] or so, he noticed some blood in his sputum.
CT showed a mass involving right lateral wall of proximal trachea pushing carina anteriorly.
Bronch at [**Hospital 2079**] hospital showed blood in trachea and tumor on right lateral tracheal wall, compromising the terminal trachea and proximal main stem bronchi.
Biopsies were taken and BAL GS showed few polys and rare GPC.
Past Medical History: PMH: 1) squamous cell left lung CA dx [**2098**], w/ left upper and partial lower lobectomy [**7-/2098**], no chemotherapy or radiation 2) DM2 3) HTN 4) CAD s/p four stents in [**2096**] 5) IBD   Social History: lives with wife.

Paratracheal and subcarinal masses within the mediastinum invading the mid thoracic trachea and distal trachea, carina and mainstem bronchi.
There is marked narrowing of the tracheal and right and left main stem bronchial lumens due to invasion.
Findings favor secondary invasion of the airway from the mediastinal nodal masses rather than a primary airway neoplasm.
Consolidation within the left lower lobe, likely representing aspiration, infection, or hemorrhage in the setting of hemoptysis.
CXR [**8-9**]: Increased density involving the entire left hemithorax is suggestive of left pleural effusion.
Associated atelectatic changes are suspected in the left upper lobe and the left lower lobe.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Increasing left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Note:  1) Immunostains for P63, chromogranin (focal), synaptophysin and TTF-1 are all positive in subsets of the tumor cells.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen sectioned, and frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is: "carcinoma; foci of non-small cell carcinoma present; component of small round blue cells also present.
(Lymphoid cells vs. small cell component); final diagnosis pending permanent sections."
Part 2 is labeled "tracheal tumor" and consists of a 1.1 x 0.2 cm aggregate of  clotted blood and pink tissue fragments.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2401**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

# Hemoptysis: Likely due to malignant mass.
Hct stable w/o transfusion since [**8-4**].
# Lung cancer: Patient underwent bronchoscopy for bx/tx/dx and path c/w recurrent SCC.
Chest CT was repeated here and shows a paratracheal and subcarinal mass invading the right and left mainstem bronchi.
He has been scheduled for an outpatient PET scan for staging.
# MRSA pneumonia: Patient w/ hypoxia on presentation.
Patient's interventional pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], saw the patient during his stay and attempted ultrasound thoracentesis of patient's left pleural effusion.
# GI bleeding: Patient had increasing diarrhea in the ICU.
He has a h/o IBD and states this has happened to him in the past.
However, he also had an episode of bloody diarrhea (approximately 1 teaspoon).
# Htn: Home bp meds restarted following extubation and patient's bp has been well-controlled.
# CAD: No c/o chest pain this admission.
No CHF on CXR/exam.
# Crohn's: Stools are loose.
