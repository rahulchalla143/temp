Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Osseous structures reveal no abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Right obturator internus muscle hematoma.
No active extravasation is identified.
Right lower and middle lobe atelectasis.
Mesenteric vessels are patent and without abnormality evident, though evaluation is limited because of respiratory motion.
No definite bowel abnormality to suggest ischemia.
CXR AP [**2132-1-20**]: Lungs are low in volume but clear, exaggerating heart size which is probably top normal.
Azygous distention suggests increased intravascular volume but there is no pulmonary plethora and no edema or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE: 58 yo M with h/o ETOH abuse, prostate CA, gastrectomy presented after drinking binge and being down for 24 hours from home with somnolence, found to have a RLL aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis.
However, initially pt's mental status did not dramatically improve (was very somnolent) and also had RUE and RLE flaccidity and weakness (had been lying unconscious on his R side for >24 hours) and therefore neuro was consulted who recommended EEG and MRA head/neck completed on [**2132-1-21**] which were negative.
On the night of [**2132-1-20**] developed acute RUE swelling/erythema, initial plain film of on entire RUE negative for fracture on my read, final report showed no fracture.
Did have an initial WBC of 15, but once he cleared the secretions, his CXR revealed no further infiltrate and he had no O2 requirement.
There was MRSA(along with multiple other bacteria and yeast) in his sputum culture, so he was treated with vanco for 5 days then changed to doxycycline for the remainder of the course.
