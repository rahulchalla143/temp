Pt had recent 7 day admission for lower GI bleed.
On recent admission, pt was sent home with indwelling foley due to urinary retention with failed voiding trials.
Since then, he has noticed a bulla of fluid on the inferior portion of his foreskin.
Penis with small bulla on inferior aspect, nothing obstructing, able to urinate.
On arrival to the ICU, pt reports his biggest complaint is his penile swelling.
Also notes worsening pedal edema x 3 days, now up to his thighs.

Denies rashes or skin changes.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Dyslipidemia 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY:  CAD with STEMI in [**12/2111**] s/p DESx2 to the LAD and angioplasty with clot retrieval of the diagonal ([**2112-1-29**]).
Had EF 30% with apical akinesis, s/p coumadin therapy.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Achalasia s/p Laparoscopic [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy, Flexible esophagoscopy in [**2111-12-8**] - balloon dilatation in [**2094**] of his esophagus - GERD - dyslipidemia - hyperplastic polyps on colonoscopy five years ago.
Does not have HHA or VNS.
- Mother: CVA and [**Name (NI) 11011**] - Father: - Brother: Congenital heart disease Family history is notable for a daughter with achalasia, mother who had myocardial infarction and mother and father who reportedly had blood clots and deep venous thromboses.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: R 98.3, HR 72, 98/51, RR 14, 100%RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated- at level of clavicle when sitting upright, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley, has bulla at inferior part of foreskin head of penis Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, pale.
Pedal edema up to thighs bilaterally.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
Low voltage.
Anterolateral T wave changes.
No definite focal small bowel lesion seen.
Distended and trabeculared urinary bladder could be related to chronic outflow tract obstruction.
Abdominal and pelvic ascites .
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic function with apical hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Normal left ventricular size with mild regional systolic function (apical hypokinesis).
No significant valvular disease.
LENI [**3-8**]: MPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis .
[**3-8**] KUB: capsule is located in the LUQ either in the small intestine or colon .
[**2-26**] EGD: Findings: Esophagus: Lumen: Massively dilated esophagus with large amounts of liquid and semi solid food debris.
Other findings: No active bleeding was seen in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum.
Impression: Esophageal dilation Esophagitis.
No active bleeding was seen in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum.Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
[**2-26**] colonoscopy: Findings: Contents: The preparation was noted to be suboptimal with liquid stool throughout the colon.
Protruding Lesions Small grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 39221**] is 62M with history of achalasia s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy in [**12/2111**] c/b chronic GI bleeding, recent STEMI s/p DESx2 (on ASA & Plavix), LVEF 30% with apical akinesis (treated with coumadin, later discontinued when LVEF recovered to >55%), h/o internal hemorroids, recent admission for lower GI bleed who was admitted with melena and Hct 19. .
# Melena/acute blood loss anemia: Concern for small bowel bleed given that recent EGD and [**Last Name (un) **] were negative.
Pt with a history of CAD and recently stopped his coumadin.
Iron studies were consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia.
Initially on the floor, he continued to have small amounts of melena but remained hemodynamically stable, ambulating freely in his room.
However, the report noted food and debris in the esophagus due to known history of achalasia, esophagitis was noted.
The stomach and small intestine were not visualized.
Therefore, after extensive work up, no cause of bleeding was identified, but pt remained hemodynamically stable with resolution of his melena.
# Penile Swelling (foreskin)= Not obstructing, pt able to urinate without any difficulty.
No erythema, pain or penile discharge and pt as able to retract his foreskin without difficulty.
No evidence of cellulitis or infection.
This was likely due to the same process causing peripheral edema, see below.
# UTI: Complicated cystitis given recent Foley catheter in a male patient.
# bilateral lower extremity edema: Clinically not consistent with CHF as pt did not have elevation of JVD, hypoxia, or noticeable pulmonary edema/effusions, and cardiac echo showed a normal EF without evidence of heart failure or valvular dysfunction.
Known mild apical hypokinesis was noted.
UA showed moderate proteinuria, so spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was checked and was unremarkable, 0.2.
In the end, this was ttributed to chronic venous insufficiency plus moderate hypoalbuminemia.
Pt with more pain/swelling in R.leg, but LENI performed and was NEGATIVE for DVT.
Pt had recent evaluation by both GI and colorectal surgery.
Colonoscopy revealed non-bleeding hemorrhoids.
# CAD: Acute GIB with marked anemia was very concerning in setting of recent STEMI in [**12/2111**] with DES x2.
EKG without acute ischemic changes, MB and CK neg.
# BPH: On last admission, had urinary retention with failed voiding trials requiring discharge with Foley in place.
# achalasia s/p laparoscopic [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy [**12/2111**]: EGD during admission also confirmed this diagnosis.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for further evaluation of anemia and dark stools.
You had some leg swelling.
This is likely due to low blood protein levels.
Medication changes: 1.start ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 day course for urinary tract infection.
