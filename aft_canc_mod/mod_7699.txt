Sinus bradycardia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2131-9-15**] CXR: No acute pathology [**2131-9-19**] Echo: normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Bibasilar opacities greater on the left base have increased.
They are likely atelectasis but superimposed infection on the left cannot be totally excluded and followup is recommended.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
There is no pneumothorax or atelectasis.
The review of the peripheral blood smear reveals a population of variably sized blasts with large nuclei with smooth chromatin, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and scant amount of basophilic cytoplasm.
The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic findings (see S11-42160C) are consistent with the diagnosis of acute precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia.
This karyotype is most consistent with ALL.
[**2131-9-23**] CSF: no evidence of CSF involvement ->Diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia are not seen in specimen on a limited panel.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Review of corresponding cytospin showed a paucicellular specimen with small mature lymphocytes and monocytes.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: 51M with HTN, DM2, CAD s/p stenting in [**2123**] who presents with new ALL, started treatment with HyperCVAD and Gleevec, C1D1: [**2131-9-16**].
# ALL: Patient presented with SOB and a WBC of 199, as well as some evidence of spontaneous lysis.
Uric acid was elevated and he was given rasburicase x1 given concern for tumor lysis syndrome with improvement in uric acid level.
BMT felt this was more likely ALL so hydroxyurea was stopped and he was given dexamethasone 20mg x1.
Patient started on HyperCVAD and Gleevec, initially requiring frequent transfusions of cyroprecipitate for low fibrinogen.
LP does not show signs of CNS disease, flow cytometry negative.
# Febrile Neutropenia: Patient developed a fever to 101.0F about 10 days into treatment.
Afebrile with decreased diarrhea on IV flagyl, PO vanc, and cefepime.
Also, with chronic dry cough from 2 weeks prior to admission.
IV Antibiotics eventually discontinued, patient given short course of neupogen, and remained afebrile for remainder of hospital course.
# C. diff: [**9-27**] C. diff positive.
# Eye floaters: Patient initially complained of red and blue floating spots over field of vision in both eyes.
Ophtho consult r/o leukemic changes in eyes.
# Cough: Patient with persistent dry cough for the past couple weeks.Had been on ACEI prior to admission, so could be lingering ACEI cough.
# DM: on Metformin and glyburide at home.
Patient additionally getting methotrexate as part of chemo regimen, which treated psoriasis.
Transition Issues: Patient needs f/u with derm for biopsy of lesion on his back when plt count is sufficient (within 1-2months)  .

You were admitted with a new diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Your course was complicated by a diarrheal infection called C. diff, and you are still being treated with oral and intravenous antibiotics for this.
