_ ________________________________________________________________  The patient is a healthy 65 year old male with h/o tobacco use, ETOH, s/p ulcer and hernia repair who presents with headache which resolved after one week.
He also would make a bottle of milk for his grandaughter but could not pour the milk without making a mess.
He also developed a staggering gait, (he usually walks about 6 miles per day as he cares for his grandson), intermittent dizziness and vertigo along with personality changes in that he was more impatient and irritable than usual.
He went to [**Hospital6 4287**] where he underwent a CT of the head which revealed a left parietal-occipital lytic lesion with edema.
Chest x-ray showed evidence of lung mass.

The larger lesion measures up to 5.6 cm and the smaller lesion measures up to 2.2 cm.
No hemorrhage.
Differential considerations include infectious and neoplastic etiologies.
MR w/ gadolinium recommended for further assessment  -Vasogenic edema surrounding masses causing mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
No transtentorial herniation.
-------------------- MRI head IMPRESSION:  Three cystic lesions are identified within the left parietal and occipital lobes with peripheral rim enhancement and no slow diffusion within the cystic portion of the lesions.
Extensive surrounding increased FLAIR signal and mass effect on the lateral ventricle without hydrocephalus.
Primary considerations include metastatic disease, multifocal glioblastoma, or PNET.
Infection with abscesses remains within the differential, but this is less likely as there is no slow diffusion within the lesions.
Polylobulated right hilar and infrahilar pulmonary mass results in narrowing of the right upper lobe bronchus and abuts the adjacent right pulmonary artery at the bifurcation.
No evidence of intraluminal pulmonary vascular invasion or thrombus.
Findings are highly suspicious for primary bronchogenic carcinoma in this patient with history of smoking and asbestos exposure.
Consider bronchoscopic biopsy of the right hilar mass for histologic evaluation.
Right lower lobe indeterminate nodular densities could represent plaques or nodules.
Multiple conspicuous mediastinal lymph nodes as described, although are not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria, are suspicious due their number.
Heterogeneously enhancing left adrenal mass, highly suspicious for metastasis.
Additional right adrenal gland lesion is also noted.
Left upper abdominal soft tissue nodule may represent a peritoneal lesion versus a small splenule.
Small short gastric and celiac axis lymph nodes as described can be further evaluated on followup imaging.
Pleural plaques and centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema.
Sequela of asbestos exposure and likely smoking-related lung disease, respectively.
Coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis in the thorax and abdomen.
[**2111-8-13**] head MRI post-op IMPRESSION:  Evacuation of the lower portion of the cystic mass with post-surgical changes including blood products and pneumocephalus.
Larger portion of the mass appears to have compressed with residual post-contrast enhancement around it.
Additionally, the more posteriorly located satellite lesion in the left occipital lobe is still present.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 65 yo presents who presents with headache and ataxia, found to have large brain mass as well as right lung mass, concerning for primary lung cancer with brain metastasis.
#Cystic Brain Mass: metastatic lung cancer - Pt was initated on decadron and seen by neurosurgery, who performed resection/craniotomy on [**2111-8-11**].
He tolerated surgery well with no apparent complications.
He was also seen in-house by neuro-onc and rad-onc and has  f/u scheduled.
He does have a chronic limp which both he and his wife confirm is long-standing due to many years of construction work.
CT torso also support left adrenal mass, consistent with  diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer.
Pt was full code during this admission, though he stated that in the future he is not interested in any heroic measures or life-prolonging therapies.
New diagnosis of lung cancer with brain tumor, now s/p craniotomy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Brain mass Right lung mass, lung cancer Ataxia   Discharge Condition: discharge condition: stable mental status: lucid ambulatory status: independent with baseline limp   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with headache and unstable gait.
You also underwent surgery for the brain mass and are recovering well from this.
You may feel jittery or mildly anxious on the prednisone.
Please discuss with your doctor if you develop severe anxiety or any confusion.
