Patient presented to the Emergency department with severe back pain unlike previous back pain due to metastatic lesions, refractory to Vicodin.
As patient was being worked up in ED for spinal cord compression, patient became extremely hypotensive to systolic blood pressures to 70s-80s.
Patient was felt to be in bacterial sepsis and empirically started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which was later changed to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin when blood cultures were positive for gram negative rods X [**3-1**].
Patient denies previous history of sepsis, has never been on TPN, has no history of urinary tract infections, and has had this porta cath since [**2179-4-27**].
In addition, patient complains of history of loss of right hand dexterity over the last year, with tingling in the fingertips of both hands, which she feels started when she began taking Decadron.
Otherwise, she denies any asymmetric weakness or paresthesias.

SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
For serious infections, repeat culture and sensitivity testing may          therefore be warranted if third generation cephalosporins were          used.
SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
Findings indicative of metastatic focus in L2 vertebra described by the recent bone scan of [**2180-8-2**].
Heterogeneous marrow signal in L1 vertebra indicative of previous history of metastasis to this area.
No acute compression fracture or area of new pathologic fracture.
No evidence of high grade thecal sac compression, or compression of the distal spinal cord.
There are no pleural effusions.
The previously identified right lower lobe mass lesion is again identified and unchanged.
The lungs are clear without evidence of consolidation.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 47F with metastatic breast cancer and herceptin-induced cardiomyopathy, now with Serratia hypotension/sepsis.
Wound culture and gram stain yielded no organisms.
By hospital day 4, blood cultures speciated Serratia with a high possibility of developing resistance to third generation cephalosporins, and so antibiotics were changed to ciprofloxacin and cefepime, and vancomycin was discontinued.
Patient continued to be hemodynamically stable without pressor support, was afebrile, in no acute pain and was felt to be stable for the floor on hospital day 4.
Consultants advised that single therapy with a third generation cephalosporin should be avoided given the theoretical possibility of inducible beta-lactamase.
Patient continued to be hemodynamically stable and afebrile and was discharged home with a course of oral levofloxacin and to return to clinic a week following discharge.
2) Anticoagulation:  Patient had had a history of pulmonary embolism in [**2180-6-27**] for which she is chronically anticoagulated.
3) Breast Cancer:  Given patient's acute clinical instability, chemotherapy (scheduled weekly carboplatin) was deferred.
At the time of discharge, patient was in excellent clinical condition with only complaints of mild back pain (which she attributed to the hospital bed).
She was instructed to continue taking levofloxacin for 10 days following discharge, to continue taking all of her outpatient medications except for antihypertensives, and to follow up with her oncologist a week following discharge.
