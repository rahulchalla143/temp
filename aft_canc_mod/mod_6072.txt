Papilledema appreciated on the right; Visual fields are full to confrontation.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Large posterior fossa mass located adjacent to the left cerebellar hemisphere causing mass effect upon the fourth ventricle with some slight prominence of the ventricular system and no associated tonsillar herniation.
This mass has properties that are most likely consistent with a meningioma, however, metastasis is also considered in the differential diagnosis.
Focal area of enhancement in the ventral aspect of the right basal ganglia possibly consistent with telangiectasia, however, a tiny focus of metastasis cannot be excluded from the differential.
Left lower lobe consolidation is likely associated with a small pleural effusion, could be pneumonia.
Further characterization with standard PA and  lateral views is recommended as well as followup after treatment until complete resolution.
Stable large posterior fossa mass with multiple prominent vessels indicating hypervascularity.
While this most likely represents a meningioma, differential includes hemangioblastoma, lymphoma, metastatic disease, and sarcoid.
Pneumocranium associated with recent third ventriculostomy.
Head CT [**10-23**](post-crani): FINDINGS: The patient has undergone left occipital craniotomy and resection of the large posterior fossa mass, with a small amount of hyperdense material in the resection cavity which may represent a tiny amount of hemorrhage.
There is expected degree of pneumocephalus, compatible with recent postoperative state.
The mass effect in the posterior fossa continues to be present.
There is no hydrocephalus.
The bone windows demonstrate evidence of left occipital craniotomy and the right frontal burr hole.
Gas is noted in the soft tissues of the left parieto-occipital region, consistent with recent operation.
There are scattered mediastinal nodes, not meeting size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is a large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lung.
In addition, there is a smaller right pleural effusion, with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lung.
There are several enhancing lesions seen within the gallbladder, the largest measuring up to approximately 2 cm, not definitively seen on the pre-contrast images.
There is extensive omental caking with peritoneal nodular deposits throughout, some of which are located subserosal and directly abutting the colon.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes are seen, measuring up to 8-10 mm in short axis.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large heterogeneous lobulated left adnexal mass, difficult to measure, but measures grossly 8 cm in craniocaudad dimensions, with areas of nodularity, and areas of low attenuation centrally.
Additionally, enhancing nodules are seen immediately superior to the bladder, may reflect additional metastatic deposits.
There is free fluid within the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to neurosurgery service from the emergency department after experiencing  approximately 2 weeks of headache, nausea, dizziness and falls.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was found to have a posterior fossa mass and associated hydrocephalus.
Due to the location of the mass, and hydrocephalus, she was admitted to the ICU for close observation given her risk of herniation.
On [**10-23**] she then underwent suboccipital craniotomy for mass resection, which was tolerated well.
[**10-24**] she was found to have LLL pleural effusion, which was aspirated at the bedside, without ill effect.
She also had a CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis which revealed multiple foci of disease within the abdomen.
She was discharged to said facility on [**10-27**], with appropriate follow up arranged with the above doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for neurosurgical follow-up.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Melanoma Hydrocephalus  Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable  Discharge Instructions: General Instructions/Information  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**6-11**] days for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
