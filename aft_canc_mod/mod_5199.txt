Admission Date:  [**2154-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-2-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-12-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: loss of consciousness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Stereotactic brain biopsy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 71673**] is a 56 year old right handed man who was feeling completely well until 2:55 pm the day of admission, when while at work he was looking at the clock, thinking he would put his tools away and go home, and then slumped over unconscious.
His only neurologic deficit described in the notes is slight weakness of hand grip on the left.
He then had a head CT, which revealed lesions read as subacute to acute infarcts of the right cerebellar hemisphere and the right occipital lobe.
There was some mass effect on the fourth ventricle but it was not occluded, and there was no hydrocephalus.
Mr. [**Known lastname 71673**] has not been ill recently, and has had no trauma to his head or neck.
He has had no neck manipulation.
As far as vascular risk factors are concerned, he denies any history of heart problems, high cholesterol, diabetes, or prior strokes.
Review of systems:  No recent fever, weight loss, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.
Family History: No strokes or seizures.
Physical Exam: On arrival: T 98   HR 78  BP 156/85  RR 13 Pulse Ox 99% on RA General appearance:  Anxious appearing 56 year old man in NAD HEENT:  NC/AT CV: Regular rate without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No carotid or vertebral bruits audible.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hsm or masses palpated Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Mental Status: Alert and oriented to person, place, and date.
There is no nystagmus.
There is very mild flattening of the left nasolabial fold.
There is mild right tongue deviation.
Strength is full throughout with the exception of mild right interosseous muscle weakness.
There is no pronator drift.
No tremor or adventitious movements.
Coordination: No dysmetria with finger to nose and heel to shin.
Normal finger tapping and rapid alternating movements.
No truncal ataxia or titubation.
Areas of low attenuation in the right occipital and right cerebellar hemispheres with subtle areas of more discrete higher attenuation within.
These could represent subacute infarcts, and the relatively higher attenuation surrounding these areas could represent hemorrhagic transformation.
Nodular appearance to some of these higher attenuation areas could also suggest the presence of underlying mass lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema.
1-cm round nodular density in the left frontal lobe with hypodense rim is suspicious for a mass lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Given this finding, and the above described hypodensities, these lesions could represent multiple metastatic foci.
MRI [**2-2**]: There are multiple areas of enhancement identified in the brain including two lesions in the left frontal lobe, one in the medial right frontal lobe and one in the inferior right frontal lobe.
Additional lesions are seen in the right occipital and posterior temporal regions and in the right cerebellar hemisphere.
The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion is largest in size and demonstrates rim enhancement and measures approximately 2.6 x 2.1 cm in size.
Mild surrounding edema is visualized.
The remaining lesions demonstrate hyperintensities on diffusion images indicating T2 shine through except for rim of low signal on ADC map in the left frontal lesion.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.
There is no evidence of acute infarct seen on diffusion images.
Soft tissue changes are visualized in the paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions in the brain are identified as described above.
Although the right cerebellar lesion demonstrate slow diffusion within the center, which would favor infective etiology such as abscess, given the appearance of the other lesions metastasis appears more likely.
Mediastinal and right hilar necrotic lymphadenopathy with scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in the right, findings are suspicious for primary lung neoplasm (with possible metastatic disease in the ipsilateral lung given multiple pulmonary nodules).
In addition, there is interstitial thickening at the right lung base, which may be secondary to lymphatic drainage from the right lower lobe due to hilar lymphadenopathy versus lymphangitic spread of neoplasm.
Lower on the differential would be TB, given appearance of brain lesions primary lung neoplasm is favored.
Left pleural thickening and calcification as well which may be secondary to prior hemothorax or empyema.
Scattered segmental atelectasis.
No evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis.
CXR: 1) Prominence of interstitial markings about the right hilar region of indeterminate significance.
This could represent early asymmetric fluid overload or an early infectious infiltrate.
In the appropriate clinical setting, impaired drainage through the right hilum due to a hilar mass would also be considered.
2) Small focus of pleural thickening left base  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 57 year old previously healthy man with only vascular risk factor being former smoker, who had LOC at work with generalized tonic clonic movements x few minutes consistent with seizure.
CT showed hypodensities in the right cerebellar and right occipital lobe, with some crowding of fourth ventricle.
Repeat CT revealed slight hemorrhagic transformation of cerebellar portion, with stable mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Further evaluation of the CT and imaging by MRI revealed the hypodensities to be more consistent with multiple masses instead of stroke, consistent with metastatic disease.
CT of the torso revealed right pulmonary nodules and hilar and mediastinal necrotic lymphadenopathy concerning for cancer.

Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have any seizures, involuntary movements, loss of consciousness, persistent nausea or vomiting, weakness, numbness, tingling, difficulty speaking, slurred speech, change in vision, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
