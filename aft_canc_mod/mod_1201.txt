Admission Date:  [**2127-10-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**] Chief Complaint: 50M w/ hx obesity, CHF p/w lower abdominal/groin erythema, swelling.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] is a 50 year-old gentleman with history significant for obesity and CHD who presents with chief complaint of abdominal and scrotal swelling and pain.
Since that time he has noted gradually increasing swelling in his lower abdomen.
During the last several weeks, the area has become increasingly irritated, hard, and painful, and during the last two nights the swelling extended to his R scrotal sac > L. He has felt slightly feverish during the last several weeks, with occasional mild nausea.
He also notes increased shortness of breath during the last several months, with no acute worsening.
He denies chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.
He sleeps on 2 pillows at night, a requirement that has not changed.
He recalls that he had injured a blood vessel while straddling a fence, followed by erectile dysfunction.
On ROS, the patient denies chills, abdominal pain other than superficially at the irritated region, changes in appetite, constipation, or diarrhea, dysuria, changes in vision, hearing, any coriza or sore throat.
Past Medical History: - DM II - Obesity - HTN - CHF - on CPAP for OSA - Chronic leg ulcers - Torn cartilage in R knee  PSH: - splenectomy s/p MVA in late teens - Bypass surgery for R testicle, as noted above (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 25268**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Location (un) **] Hospital)  Social History: Lives in [**Hospital1 8**] with wife and two children.
No LAD appreciated.
PULM: Reduced breath sounds throughout.
Distant heart sounds.
Two well-healed abdominal scars noted; at midline (deviating to left inferiorly), and R groin; the latter incision was raised, hardened, and tender.
GENITAL: bilateral scrotal swelling, R > L.  Per patient, the swelling has decreased since diuresis last night.
EXT: 1+ edema bilaterally.
Changes of chronic venous stasis noted.
Pertinent Results: [**2127-10-2**] 03:22PM   GLUCOSE-88 UREA N-21* CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-34* ANION GAP-13 [**2127-10-2**] 03:22PM   WBC-12.1* RBC-5.41 HGB-16.3 HCT-50.4 MCV-93 MCH-30.1 MCHC-32.3 RDW-14.7 [**2127-10-2**] 03:22PM   NEUTS-65.3 LYMPHS-23.0 MONOS-8.7 EOS-2.2 BASOS-0.8 [**2127-10-2**] 03:22PM   HYPOCHROM-3+ [**2127-10-2**] 03:22PM   PLT COUNT-324  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 50M with history of CHF, DM, and morbid obesity who presented with several months of abdominal swelling and intermittant lower abdominal tenderness, increasing shortness of breath, and scrotal swelling.
The patient was diuresed aggressively, with resolution of the scrotal swelling, and treated with oxacillin for a presumed cellulitis.
The first was deemed consistent with obesity hypoventillation syndrome, and the second was thought related to either Seroquel, hypoxia, or hypercapnia.
Volume status  The patient's report of stopping diuretics several months prior to presentation, along with increasing SOB and lower abdominal/scrotal edema, suggests that the patient was fluid overloaded.
His volume overload might have contributed to his low saturations if there were pulmonary congestion.
CXR was difficult to assess, also due to habitus, but suggestive of some pulmonary edema.
His scrotal edema resolved with diuresis.
Other factors likely contributing to the scrotal edema could include the patient's habitus, compressing the IVC; and a history of R vascular insufficiency due to an old injury, addressed through a bypass procedure 20 years ago -- which might explain why the patient's scrotal edema is R > L.  The patient was fluid restricted and ran approximately 1-1.5 L negative each day.
Hypoxia  Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] significant baseline hypoxia, with sats on RA in the low 80s.
These data implicated that aggressive oxygenation caused hypercapnia, consistent with a chronic obesity hypoventillation syndrome.
He was afebrile and his white could was unimpressive.
While the erythema and induration did resolve somewhat during the hospital stay, some tenderness remains.
He might have had a cellulitis, or simply chronic congestions secondary to regional lymphatic or venous drainage in the region.
Mental status  Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] had several concerning episodes of night-time somnambulation and delerium.
We noticed that, on the nights when Seroquel was held, there were fewer desaturations and less delerium and agitation.
Additional contributory factors to his delerium were thought to include hypoxia and hypercapnia.
Echo was limited by habitus, but showed no indication of either failure or significant wall motion abnormalities.
FEN  Mr. [**Known lastname 25269**] labs during his stay were significant for elevated bicarbonate (ranges 30 to 40) and low chloride (as low as 91).
His elevated bicarbs were thought partly metabolic compensation for a chronic respiratory acidosis, and partly due to aggressive diuresis.
There may have been a contribution from hypochloridemia secondary to aggressive diuresis as well.
Pain control: Mr. [**Known lastname 25269**] slight abdominal pain was well-controlled on acetominophen.
Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] will require arrangement for a new biPAP device at home, to be discussed at his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
