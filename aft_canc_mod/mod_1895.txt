She was given cefepime for neutropenic fever.

She noted no fevers or shaking chills, and over the past one to two weeks prior to admission to [**Hospital1 31548**], her family also noted some changes in mental status.
Her family also reports that since she broke her wrist in [**8-/2183**], she has had a overall slow decline as well, as she needed more help with activities of daily living and this had prevented her from being more independent.

She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever and had intermitted episodes of RVR from AFIB while on rate controlling medications.
Her episodes of RVR correlated with fevers.
Subsequently she developed increasing stool output from a clostridum difficle infection.
She was started on Oral vancomycin but developed acute altered mental status and decreased PO intake.
This was followed by hypotension necessitating a ICU addmission.
She was transfered to the floor with delerium, and subsequently spiked fevers while on antibiotics.
She was strated on a morphine drip and given Ativan PRN for breathing.
