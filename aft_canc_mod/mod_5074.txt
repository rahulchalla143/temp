Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 41519**] was admitted to the hospital with fevers, chest tightness and shortness of breath after recent inguinal hernia repair and significant R groin hematoma.
He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially with Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible groin infection and this was changed to Vancomycin alone on [**2143-10-29**].
He was initially given Lasix for possible CHF exacerbation and recieved Lasix 40mg PO.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and CKs were flat with an elevated Troponin felt to be due to his renal function.
He had a pelvic CT and ultrasound for concerns for groin infection with recent surgery and these studies were reassuring that he did not have an infection, but he was kept on the antibiotics for a total 10 day course.
For his tachycardia, he underwent a V/Q scan for concern for pulmonary embolism which was low probability.
He had a persatine thallium study to evaluate his coronaries which showed a fixed lesion and normal stress portion.
He was continued on aspirin and Plavix for his coronary disease and history of recent stent.
For his renal function, his creatinine was checked daily and he was given no further Lasix.
He experienced joint swelling and was evaluated by rheumatology who did not feel that this was a gout flare.
