TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired.
In addition, MP-RAGE axial images were obtained following gadolinium for CyberKnife planning.
FINDINGS: The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Edema is seen in the left parietooccipital region with a well-defined T2 low signal abnormality in the posterior frontal region, which demonstrate enhancement following gadolinium.
The mass measures approximately 2 cm in size.
There is also some surrounding parenchymal or meningeal enhancement, which appear postoperative.
There is no mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: A 2 cm enhancing lesion in the posterior frontal lobe with surrounding edema.
Postoperative changes since the previous MRI of [**2127-6-12**].
FINDINGS: Again identified is a left frontal mass that is slightly hyperdense to cortex.
The patient is now status post left frontal craniotomy with postoperative changes including a small amount of intracranial air.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
Local mass effect and slight left to right midline shift appear unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy with a small amount of intracranial air.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
The mass is surrounded by vasogenic edema appears unchanged.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-6-6**] no significant change.

UPPER EXTREMITY R/O METS  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 25.2 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2127-6-11**]); HISTORY: Metastatic cancer.
INTERPRETATION:  Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections.
There is linear increased uptake in the left 6th rib posteriorly.
In the CT ([**2127-6-6**]) this corresponds to a healing fracture with a prominent soft tissue component.
This appearance is suggestive of a pathologic fracture secondary to osseous metastasis.
There are no other skeletal metastases.
There is also a simple fracture of the right 11th rib posteriorly.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
Linear increase uptake in the left 6th rib posteriorly corresponding to a fracture in the CT.
However, the linear appearance on the bone scan and the soft tissue component seen on CT are suggestive of a pathologic fracture secondary to osseous metastasis.
There are no other skeletal metastases.
Simple right 11th rib fracture.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following the administration of oral and intravenous contrast with multiplanar reformatted images.
Enlarged heterogenously enhancing left cervical lymph nodal mass (3,1) measuring 4.5 x 2.6 cm is present.
Left hilar lymphadenopathy measures 3.0 x 3.9 cm.
Lung windows demonstrate no nodules or pleural effusions.
CT ABDOMEN: Left adrenal lesion measuring 1.4 x 1.9 cm, measuring 42 Hounsfield units on the non-contrast images, increasing to 85 Hounsfield units in the post-contrast images is concerning for an adrenal mass lesion.
No enhancing liver lesions are present.
Small low-density lesion in the medial left lobe adjacent to the falciform ligament could represent focal fatty infiltration.
Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes measure 7 to 10 mm in diameter (3,67).
Multiple retroperitoneal, left paraaortic lymph nodes (3,64) measure 6 and 7 mm, and up to 9 mm (3,70).
Retrocrural lymph node (3,50) measures 7 mm in short axis diameter.
There is no free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.
Left cervical, mediastinal (prevascular, pretracheal and paratracheal) and hilar lymphadenopathy with smaller retroperitoneal, retrocrural and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Left adrenal mass.
Overall findings most suggestive for lymphoma.
Metastatic disease from an undetermined site of primary carcinoma unlikely.
