Admission Date:  [**2128-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-6-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-7-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 76 year old male with a medical history of localized gastric cancer s/p billroth II and chemo and lung cancer s/p lobectomy (both 20 years ago) who presented to OSH with nausea since last evening.
At that time he was diagnosed with a TIA (symptoms of arm and leg parasthesias).
One to two weeks later he had erythema and edema of his left leg and was diagnosed with a LLE DVT and started on coumadin.
HE had decreased PO intake.
Later in the day he started feeling very lethargic and was a little confused.
His wife was concerned he was having another TIA and brought him to the hospital.
At OSH a CT revealed a small bowel obstruction.
OSH CT with evidence of an SBO without contrast, but mult lesions in liver consistent with metastatic disease from possible pancreatic primary.
They reported that there was no indication of limb iscemia at this time and that all his symptoms were likely from a severe DVT.
General surgery evaluated the patient and reported that he was not a surgical candidate given his likley metastatic cancer (question related to pancreas).
He reported he was in no pain.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76 year old male with a distant history of gastric and lung cancer who presented to an OSH with N/V and AMS and was found to have an SBO and liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease.
# Septic shock/MODS: Patient meets criteria for sepsis and is in shock.
Discussions with family resulted in no escelation of care based on patients poor prognosis from undiagnosed metastatic cancer likely pancreatic in source.
# SBO: Evaled by surgery who felt that given liver mets and possible pancreatic head mass that he was not a surgical candidate.
Patient was given IVF and broad spectrum antibiotics.
There is an area of small bowel in the right lower quadrant that is concerning for bowel wall ischemia (less likely hemmorhage).
# Anemia: Patient with anemia and thrombocytopenia in the setting of elevated INR.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent a consumptive coagulopathy such as DIC.
No overt GI bleeding seen.
Unclear chronicity of anemia, may be related to underlying malignancy.
# Thrombocytopenia: As above may be related to DIC.
Patient also with recent exposure to heparin products.
# Elevated INR: Patient on coumadin as outpatient.
Currently elevated may just be secondary to coumadin in the setting of decreased PO intake and infection.
Alt may represent liver disease or possible DIC as above.
# DVT: Eval by vascular in ED.
No current signs of limb ischemia of compartment syndrome.
However given un-reliability of INR in current setting severe illness and the large size of the clot, vascular recommended argatroban for treatment acutely.
# Elevated creatinine: Unclear baseline.
Question given distention of abdominal compartment syndrome.
# Liver lesions/Panc head mass: New diagnosis.
Current thought based on CT is that patient has a pancretic head mass with mets to liver.
# Elevated Trop: Likely demand.
