History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 5239**] is a 61 year-old right-handed woman with a multifocal left temporal glioblastoma multiforme.
Her Decadron had been lowered one month ago but she developed severe headaches so this was increased back up to the 2 mg daily.
Her neurologic history began on [**2156-6-30**] with word finding difficulty, memory loss, confusion and holocranial dull headache.
She came to our emergency room and a head MRI revealed a left temporal mass.
Only 80% of the tumor could safely be resected.
MRI on the [**2157-2-4**] showed right occipital enhancing lesion, therefore Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] decided to do steriotactic brain bx to differenciate tumor growth versus radiation necrosis.
Involved-field cranial irradiation + Temodar ([**Date range (1) 18951**]) to 6000 cGy 3.
Cyberknife radiation to right occipital lesion on [**2156-9-10**] 4.
Hospitalized [**Date range (1) 18952**]/05 for fever, neutropenia and left elbow abscess 5.
Visual fields and EOM's are full without nystagmus.
There is no drift.
FINDINGS: Again demonstrated are multiple areas of abnormal enhancement within the brain, unchanged.
The right medial inferior parietal lobe rounded enhancing lesion and the lesion of the left posterior corpus callosum are unchanged in size and appearance.
Associated increased T2 signal associated with these lesions is unchanged as well.
The left temporal lobe tumor resection site is unaltered, with blood products and mild irregular enhancement.
No new sites of abnormal enhancement are detected.
Patient tolerated procedure well, no intraoperative complications occurred, with minimal blood loss.
Her headache has been under good control.
She has been afebrile and vital signs has been stable throughout her hospital stay.
Report fever greater than 101.5, chills or any other neurologic symptoms that may be concerning.
