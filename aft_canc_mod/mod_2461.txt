Patient has baseline sinus bradycardia and underwent ablation after presentation with tachyarrythmia on [**2188-7-16**].
Atypical Reccurent Right Frontal Meningioma: Symptoms began in [**2180-6-22**] per [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 38984**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] "when he became forgetful and sluggish.
Initially he was treated for depression.
A head MRI showed a large dura-based mass in the right frontal brain.
He had a second resection on [**2182-1-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38985**].
A follow up MRI on [**2183-6-26**] showed a 0.5-mm dural based nodular enhancement and he was referred here for SRS.
Surveillance MRI on [**2184-12-8**] revealed growth of the meningioma in the superior margin of the surgical cavity invading the skull.
There had been invasion into the inner and outer tables of the skull.
Pathology revealed atypical meningioma."
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Poor air flow bases bilateral.
No wheezes or crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
Pertinent Results: [**2188-8-22**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Head CT [**2188-8-31**]:  Multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the right frontal lobe with surrounding edema is relatively unchanged when compared to prior exam.
A small amount of extra-axial hemorrhage along the right frontal craniotomy is stable in appearance as well.
Areas of pneumocephalus near the right frontal craniotomy mesh is persistent.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Hypodensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter reflects chronic microvascular and vascular ischemic changes.
MRI [**2188-8-22**]: Status post interval resection of right frontal scalp mass and the contiguous extra-axial enhancing lesions.
There is stable enhancing heterogeneous tissue in the inferior right frontal lobe.
There are findings suggestive of ischemia in the right frontal lobe which is new compared to the prior study of [**2188-8-21**].
There is a new mesh cranioplasty in the right frontal region.
Labs on Discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was electively admitted on [**8-21**] for a planned surgical resection and esthetic reconstruction of his left cranium for recurrent meningioma.
Intraoperatively, he had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was refractory to cardioversion.
Post-operatively, he was admitted to the ICU for this reason, and cardiology consulted for control of his atrial fibrillation he was started on an Amiodarone drip and Diltiazem drips which eventually converted him.
# Atrial Fibrillation: On [**8-27**] he was transferred to the step down unit.
On arrival, he was in atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Given that he had failed swallow studies twice in the previous week, he was not able to take any medications by mouth.
On the morning of [**2188-8-30**], patient was given metoprolol IV 5mg x1 for atrial flutter with heart rate in 130s.
No significant pauses or brady on conversion.
Pacemaker placement not an ideal option as patient will require multiple MRI for meningioma resection follow-up.
- Started Aspirin 81 mg, Neurosurgery stated this was ok. **** Per neurosurgery, need to wait 1 month before anticoagulation can be started due to recent craniotomy.
# s/p frontal craniotomy: Of note, on [**2188-8-30**] plastic surgery noted fluid build up at the incision site on frontal region.
Fluid was cultured and final report was no growth.
Continued Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
# FEN: Patient has failed swallow study twice.
On tube feeds with banana flakes secondary to bowel incontinence.
# Hypothyroidism: Repeat TSH 1.3, however free T4 remained elevated at 1.9.
Repeat Ua no RBC.
Hematuria most likely secondary to trauma from patient pulling at foley.
When patient becomes more oriented can d/c foley - recheck Ua for hematuria in [**1-23**] months .
Pepcid (Famotidine)(20 mg daily)  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Meningioma Atrial fibrillation with RVR .
Secondary Diagnosis: Hypothyroidism Diabetes GERD   Discharge Condition: Vitals stable, sinus rythm.
During the hospital course you were transferred to the cardiology service for further management of a fast heart rhythm.
Call your primary care doctor or go to the ER if you experience rapid heart rate, feeling dizzy, pass out, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other symptoms.
CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING - New onset of tremors or seizures.
- Any confusion or change in mental status.
- Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
- Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
- Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
- Fever greater than or equal to 101??????
