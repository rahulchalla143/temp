Admission Date:  [**2156-11-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-9-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Lopressor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: 77 year old white female with chest pain.
History of Present Illness: 76 yo female with PMH HTN, hyperlipidemia, presumed CHF/CAD now being evaluated for acute respiratory distress and renal dysfunction while in cath lab holding area for evaluation of acute coronary syndrome.
Apparently treated with antibiotics.
No echo or cath was performed during that hospitalization.
Since [**5-18**], pt had episodes of intermittent substernal chest pain with associated shortness of breath sometimes waking her up from sleep and self-limited.
Pt denies significant extremity swelling or PND.
Pt states she has unexplained weight loss.
In PCP office today, pt presented with an episode of CP this morning.
EKG performed at PCP's office reportedly showed inferolateral ST depressions.
She arrived in [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab holding area after evaluation at OSH where she was chest pain free but loaded with Plavix, ASA, heparin, and integrillin drip.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], found to have hyperkalemia of 7.1 and was given amp of bicarb, calcium chloride, followed by additional 1.5 amp of bicar, 10U IV insulin, and 40mg IV lasix.
Noted to have significantly decreased urine output.
Developed increased SOB and hypertensive to 170's, requiring 97% non-rebreather.
Past Medical History: poorly controlled HTN hypercholesterolemia CHF OA gout   Social History: lives alone in [**Location (un) **] Denies tobacco, ETOH, drugs  Family History: mother with glomerulonephritis sister with MI at age 70 brother with MI in 30s  Physical Exam: p55, 143/70, 98% 6Lnc Gen: lying in bed, mild dyspnea, no acute distress HEENT: MMM, clear OP, JVP difficult to assess CVS: RRR, no s1 s2, no m/g/r Lungs: bilateral crackles 2/3 up from base Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS Ext: trace edema bilaterally Neuro: nonfocal  Pertinent Results: Hematology   COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WBC RBC Hgb Hct MCV MCH MCHC RDW Plt Ct [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM    6.0 3.53* 10.1* 30.0* 85 28.6 33.6 13.8 258   BASIC COAGULATION Plt Ct [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM    258  Chemistry   RENAL & GLUCOSE Glucose UreaN Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM    86 72* 2.2* 136 4.5 96 29 16   CHEMISTRY TotProt Albumin Globuln Calcium Phos Mg UricAcd Iron  [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM          8.5 4.4 1.9  RADIOLOGY  Final Report  PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC  [**2156-11-30**] 4:34 PM  PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC  Reason: please assess Lt adenxal mass  INDICATIONS: A 6-cm left ovarian cyst seen on MRI.
IMPRESSION: 6-cm avascular cystic structure in the left adnexa with internal debris with a fluid debris level.
This could be ovarian in origin, but could also represent a paraovarian cyst with internal hemorrhage.
Fibroid uterus.
No evidence of a pnuemothorax is seen.
No failure is seen.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax, atelectasis left base.
However, she was unable to have a cath performed immediately given her acute on chronic renal failure and respiratory distress secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
She was chest pain free on admission.
ACE was held secondary to renal failure.
Pt has cardiac cath performed on [**11-22**] with showed severe diffuse 3 vessel disease (see results section for details).
No intervention was performed.
She was given IVF, bicarb, and mucomyst peri-procedure for renal protection.
Pt was evaluated by neurology stroke service who recommended MRI/MRA of brain to look for intracranial artery stenosis and subclinical right hemisphere watershed stroke.
MRI/MRA of brain found no acute stroke and occlused left vertebral artery; all other intracranial vessels were open.
Carotid stenting was performed on [**11-30**] without complications.
Pt remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable throughout the hospitalization.
Renal failure: Pt presented with acute on chronic renal failure.
Etiology of chronic renal failure likely poorly controlled hypertension.
On arrival to the CCU, K still elevated at 6.8.
EKG initially showed junctional rhythm with peaked T waves.
Pt appeared to be clinically volume overloaded with decreased urine output.
By HD2, K was 5.6, EKG changes were resolved, and pt appeared less volume overloaded with resolution of respiratory distress.
Diuresis was changed to prn basis.
She was given IVF, bicarb, and mucomyst peri-procedure for renal protection.
After the procedure, creatinine slowly increased to 2.7, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.
Pump: On initial presentation, pt was significantly volume overloaded with flash pulmonary edema.
Pt presented from cath lab on nitro drip for afterload reduction.
Pt had TTE performed which showed  LV systolic dysfunction with EF 30-35% and mild symmetric ventricular hypertrophy.
Pt remained euvolemic until HD16, 1 day after carotid stenting, when she appeared volume overloaded.
Rhythm: Initially, while hyperkalemic, pt had episodes of asymptomatic junctional bradycardia.
Beta-blocker was titrated up for CAD management.
On HD7,pt developed asymptomatic junctional bradycardia.
Pt also had occasional episodes of sinus tachycardia.
These episodes were felt to be likely secondary to anxiety.
HTN: Pt has history of poorly controlled hypertension.
ACE was held in setting of renal failure.
MRI of the abdomen showed mild bilateral renal artery stenosis.
MRI of the pelvis showed 6-cm thick-walled cystic mass in the left adnexa without focal or nodular areas of enhancement.
The differential diagnosis includes epithelial neoplasm, large follicular cyst, parovarian cyst, or residual endometrioma.
CA-125 was sent and found to be mild elevated at 124 (normal range 0-30).
Pelvic ultrasound was performed and showed 6-cm avascular cystic structure in the left adnexa with internal debris with a fluid debris level.
This could be ovarian in origin, but could also represent a paraovarian cyst with internal hemorrhage.
On HD3, noted to have decreased hct of 24.7 without obvious source of bleed.
She remained intubated overnight as she had some increased chest tube drainage and was transfused 3UPRBC.
She was started on Natrecor for decreased urine output, and had an increasing creat.
HTN Hypercholesteremia CHF   Discharge Condition: Good.
You should shower, let water flow over wounds, pat dry with a towel.
