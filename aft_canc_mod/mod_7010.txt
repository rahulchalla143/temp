There is diffuse opacification of both lung fields.
There is mild re-distribution of pulmonary vasculature, but no septal lines and no frank evidence for pulmonary edema.
Severe thoracolumbar scoliosis is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia with more diffuse pneumonia or mild pulmonary edema.
[**2119-9-29**] CTA chest:   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59 yo patient with advanced MS presents with multilobar PNA.
Multilobar Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient had a fever, cough, and chest xray finding s consistent with pneumonia.
He developed progressive respiratory distress and was electively intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
Of note, he did develop a self-limited mild eosinophilia while on zosyn.
He did not develop a rash or clinically worsen.
Hypotension: The patient did develop hypotension to sbp ~90 during his admission.
The hematocrit drop was thought secondary to the pulmonary hemorrhage with subsequent blood being swallowed into the stomach.
Hypothyroid: no acute issues during this hospitalization and he continued on his home dose of synthroid.
H/o schizoaffective disorder, anxiety.
The patient is non-verbal and minimally responsive at baseline and it was difficult to assess mood or thought disorders.
He received versed and fentanyl while intubated then low dose ativan as needed for anxiety and agitation post-extubation.
He has a neurogenic bladder and chronically foley dependent.
Thrombocytosis: The patient had an elevated platelet count which was thought to be a reactive process secondary to his resolving pneumonia exacerbated by the diuresis that was required to resolve the pulmonary edema.
Confirmed in NH records and with sister who is legal guardian.
