He suffered a reinfarction in [**2155**] and ICD placement for a ventricular fibrillation arrest.
More recently he has been having multiple episodes of heart failure, a pulseless electrical activity arrest following anesthesia and recently suffered a myocardial infarction on [**2172-4-29**] following surgery to removed a squamous cell skin cancer from his left temporal region.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] where he underwent a recatheterization revealing native left main and three vessel disease along with two of three vein grafts occluded.
It is felt that he is rather high risk to undergo general anesthesia for any further surgery without his coronary disease first being addressed.
Given the severity of his disease and complexity of his situation, he has been referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evalutation.
