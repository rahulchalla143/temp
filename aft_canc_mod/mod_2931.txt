Was given flumazenil 0.2mg X 2 for respiratory depression and subsequently had tonic-clonic seizure lasting approximately 5 minutes which terminated after 1mg Ativan IV.
During episode of hypoxia HR decreased to 30s and SBP to 80s.
No prior h/o seizures.
Patient had been admitted to OSH [**6-29**] with jaundice and abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: -Colon CA-dx [**2115**], s/p resection at [**Hospital1 2025**] w/ no adjuvant tx, liver mets confirmed w/ CT guided bx -vit K deficiency -DCM [**1-13**] ETOH w/ EF<20% in [**5-14**] -ankylosing spondylitis s/p fusion -h/o ETOH abuse but reports none since [**Month (only) 205**] -Afib   Social History: lives in group home.

An underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded, and followup PA and lateral views are recommended CT head ([**7-16**]): no intracranial bleed or mass effect   Brief Hospital Course: 53 y/o M w/ metastatic colon CA c/b obstructive jaundice treated w/ palliative ERCP/stent.
Procedure c/b hypoxia requiring flumazenil w/ subsequent seizure.
Patient transferred to ICU for further monitoring and had an uneventful course.
Respiratory depression/hypoxia: - likely related to conscious sedation - CXR w/ right pleural effusion and possible infiltrate but unlikely primary source of hypoxia as readily reversed -no witnessed aspiration event  2.
Seizure: -likely [**1-13**] hypoxia and flumazenil (although sz uncommon reaction) -head CT negative for bleed or mass effect but cannot r/o metastatic foci of sz activity (MRI would not affect tx) -prn Ativan but no need for empiric or further treatment  3.
Hypotension: -likely related to narcotics as readily reversed w/ fluids and no evidence of sepsis -diuretics and lopressor were held o/n  4.
-no evidence encephalopathy or asterixis.
