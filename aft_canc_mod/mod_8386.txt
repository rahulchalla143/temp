Admission Date:  [**2132-5-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-6-2**]   Service:  [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 78 year old male with a complex past medical history notable for non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] Thoracic Surgery Service on [**2132-5-16**], for preoperative evaluation for a planned mediastinoscopy with a right upper lobe resection scheduled for [**2132-5-19**].
The patient initially presented to his primary care provider in [**2132-3-1**] with a two week history of hemoptysis.
Evaluation chest CT scan demonstrated a 3.2 centimeters right upper lobe mass and a 2 centimeter pre-carinal lymph node.
Subsequent needle biopsy was notable for non-small cell lung cancer.
A PET scan conducted [**2132-5-1**], demonstrated right sided primary lung cancer with activity in the right hilum, and no apparently involvement of other organs.
The patient was subsequently admitted on [**2132-5-16**], for preoperative heparinization given a past history of chronic atrial fibrillation and a mechanical mitral valve.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
The patient was successfully anti-coagulated without complication through [**2132-5-19**], at which point he underwent a mediastinoscopy with a right upper lobe resection.
On postoperative check, the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with a 91% oxygen saturation on a 40% face mask and a postoperative hematocrit of 32.2.
A right sided chest tube was noted to be in place with evidence of a small leak and moderate drainage to low continuous wall suction.
While on the floor, the patient had a protracted clinical course, but was nonetheless noted to gradually progress well clinically.
Secondary to a persistently coarse respiratory examination, the patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2132-5-21**], which demonstrated old obstructing blood clots with a greater preponderance in the right side versus the left side.
The patient was subsequently suctioned clear of all such blood clots and was noted to have a clean and intact right upper lobe operative site.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy who continued to follow the patient for the duration of his stay and recommended to patient to [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation following resolution of his acute medical issues.
The patient's Coumadin was subsequently discontinued pending resolution of his super-therapeutic status and further investigation as to the etiology of his hyper-sensitivity.
Following identification of his super-therapeutic status, the patient was again noted to have transient worsening of his respiratory examination, instigating a repeat bronchoscopy on [**2132-5-23**].
Repeat bronchoscopy demonstrated a complete obstruction of the right main stem, right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi with blood clots and thick secretions, which were all subsequently removed with suction.
In addition, marked extrinsic compression of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe was noted.
Serial video swallow studies were thereafter obtained, which initially demonstrated total intolerance of thin liquids and marginal tolerance of soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
Given these results, as well as the patient's apparent propensity for hyper-sensitivity to Coumadin therapy, it was thought that the patient was a significant risk for malnutrition and he was subsequently fitted with a Dobbhoff feeding tube for direct gastric feeding.
The patient's chest tube was subsequently removed without complications and the patient demonstrated a continued adequate oxygen saturation on minimal supplemental O2 therapy.
Repeat video swallow and barium swallow studies conducted on [**5-30**], demonstrated persistent but decreased aspiration of plain liquids and adequate tolerance of soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
In addition, the patient was noted to demonstrate significant esophageal spasm with associated reflux of swallowed contents to the pyriform sinus.
Despite these findings, it was thought that the patient would benefit from a feeding trial and he was subsequently re-instituted on soft solid diet and thickened nectar liquids with Boost supplements on [**5-30**].
The patient was thereafter noted to be tolerant of this modified diet and his tube feeds were entirely discontinued.
The patient was thereafter noted to progress well clinically through postoperative day number 14, [**2132-6-2**], at which point he was cleared for discharge to an extended care facility for further evaluation and management, and was provided instructions for follow-up.
Physical Therapy for daily strength, balance and chest therapy.
