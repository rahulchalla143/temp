The patient reports that she has had progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and a cough productive of whitish sputum over the past several months, and that these symptoms prompted her CT chest in [**8-4**] that demonstrated her pulmonary metastasis.
She states that over the past 2 days, she has had worsening shortness of breath such that she is now unable to climb [**11-27**] flight of stairs.
She also endorses some right sided chest pain that is not pleuritic, which she states has been intermitent for several months.
She developed a worsening O2 requirement to 5L nc, and received vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.
Denies any CP, palpitations, or assymetric lower extremity edema.
Past Medical History: BREAST CANCER: - [**2170**] - diagnosed with 4 cm right breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3, LVI, ER/PR/Her-2/neu +, [**9-13**] positive axillary nodes.
Underwent 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan and four cycles of Taxol, followed by right total mastectomy, which revealed no residual carcinoma.
- [**2177-12-4**], found to have 1 cm left breast mass.
Partial mastectomy demonstrated 1.1 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 2, LVI positive, 3 mm posterior [**Last Name (un) 2027**] and DCIS 2 mm from inferior margin.
[**11-27**] positive sentinel lymph nodes.
Genetic testing revealed her to be BRCA2 heterozygosity, so she underwent left mastectomy, which revealed no residual carcinoma.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] performed a laparoscopic TAH-BSO.
She had no evidence of recurrence at the time of her last visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2180-6-5**].
- [**8-4**], developed dry cough and frontal headaches.
CTA chest on [**2180-8-22**] demonstrated LLL pulmonary mass (17 x 16 mm with possible lymphangitic spread), enlarged cervical nodes, and a 2.2-cm paratracheal node.
- [**2180-9-13**] - Brain MRI revealed a 4.3 x 4.2 mm left cerebellar lesion and two small foci in the right occipital lobe.
There was no edema or mass effect around these lesions.
- [**2180-9-15**] - started xeloda CROHN'S DISEASE - dx [**2167**].
Mild flare in early [**2179**] not requiring medication changes.
L RADIAL FRACTURE: - s/p requiring surgical repair on [**2178-2-3**], and hardware removal on [**2178-3-27**].
HISTORY OF RUE CELLULITIS - s/p AxLND bilaterally, but only has had complications on the R   Social History: Lives with her dog [**Female First Name (un) 2029**] in [**Location (un) 2030**].

Pericardial Fluid [**2180-10-30**] WBC: 2920/uL RBC: [**Numeric Identifier 2034**]/uL Polys 36% ATYPICAL AGGREGATES OF EPITHELIAL CELLS WITH OVERLAPPING NUCLEAR BOUNDARIES PLEASE REFER TO CYTOLOLGY Lymphocytes 42% Monos 10% Macrophage 12% Total Protein, 4.2   g/dL Glucose 64   mg/dL LD 1036 IU/L Amylase 29   IU/L Albumin 2.8   g/dL .
CYTOLOGY: DIAGNOSIS: Pericardial Fluid:   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma.
CXR ([**2180-10-29**]): Ill-defined hazy opacities in both lungs, worse within the left perihilar region, with increased size of the cardiac silhouette and small left pleural effusion.
Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior CT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is brief right ventricular diastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Moderate pericardial effusion with echo evidence of tamponade.
CT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]): No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Massive progression of disease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural effusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared multifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis carcinomatosa.
There is a very small pericardial effusion which is partially echodense.
CXR [**2180-11-2**]: IMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer disease with pericardial effusion, extensive infiltrates in left lower lobe, and additional probably metastatic spread in other lung regions.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast cancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to CCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized.
Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: On presentation to the ICU, the patient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of several months duration.
CXR on arrival demonstrated left peri-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious consolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of metastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the left lower lobe.
A CT with contrast was performed to further evaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a multifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases, pleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
Given productive cough and radiographic evidence the patient was started on Levaquin and Vancomycin for robust CAP treatment.
Blood and urine cultures were performed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA, which was negative.
Urine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for leukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no additional coverage was added.
On [**10-31**], patient spiked fever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted.
After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so Cepfepime was dc'd again.
Pericardial Effusion: Patient was tachycardic on presentation.
There was concern that it may be related to the patient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or possibly hypovolemia.
Antibiotics for her pneumonia as above.
Intravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change in heart rate.
A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further, which was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
A TTE was ordered to evaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology.
The interventional cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] who performed pericardiocentesis which produced 470mL serosanguanous fluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria.
Cytology on pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells.
On [**2180-11-3**], a repeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical effusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild metabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15.
The most immediate concern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress and impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation ketosis.
Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a worsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on admission).
# Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of metastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally.
Once on [**Hospital1 2035**], given pt's breast cancer was progressing on current therapy (CA27-29 rising) and pt's clinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] discussed started a new chemotherapy regimen.
20 minutes into the infusion, Herceptin was stopped bc pt developed SOB and hypoxia to mid 80s.
Pt's symptoms resolved with time, Ativan and Lasix.
Pt's symptoms resolved with time.
# Elevated LFTs: Pt had midly elevated LFTs after chemo administration, which were trending down with time.
# Diarrhea:  Pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.
# Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the patient's known baseline.
The patient subsequently received several liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her hematocrit came down to 35.
