PATHOLOGY: STOMACH, MUCOSAL BIOPSY [**2161-3-18**]: Poorly differentiated carcinoma with signet ring features.
Left internal jugular approach central venous catheter, with tip terminating in the junction with the left brachiocephalic vein.
Small patchy focus in right lung base.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent atelectasis and vessel crowding, however small focus of aspiration and/or pneumonia not excluded.
CT STUDIES:  CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST [**2161-3-24**]: A small amount of oral secretions are seen dependently in the trachea (3:16).
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying consolidation, likely atelectatic.
A calcific focus in the right lower lobe represents a calcified granuloma.
The heart and great vessels are notable for coronary arterial calcification.
There is no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
A punctate calcific focus is present in the left adrenal gland.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast in a symmetric fashion are notable for numerous bilateral hypodensities, some of which are too small to characterize, others of which are consistent with simple cysts.
A soft tissue mass is seen in the retroperitoneum, just posterior to the third portion of the duodenum difficult to precisely marginate, though measuring approximately 50 x 29 mm (3:76).
This lesion extends along the anterior surface of the aorta, though does not constrict or deform the otherwise normally opacifying aorta.
Numerous mesenteric lymph nodes are visualized, none of which are enlarged by CT size criteria.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2161-3-24**]: The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter.
There is no free gas in the pelvis.
A small amount of free fluid is seen dependently in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy concerning for metastatic disease 2.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Trace ascites settling dependently in the pelvis.
Numerous renal and hepatic cysts as well as other renal and hepatic hypodensities, too small to characterize, likely also cysts.
EKG [**2161-3-22**]: Sinus rhythm with ventriculr premature beats.
Clinical correlation is suggested for possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect.
Since the previous tracing of [**2161-3-17**] borderline sinus tachycardia is absent, ventricular ectopy is seen, the QTc interval appears prolonged and ST-T wave abnormalities are decreased.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo M with recent admission for upper gastrointestinal bleed, found to be H.pylori positive and changes in gastric mucosa concerning for infiltrative process; now readmitted the day after discharge with hematemesis x 7 and NG lavage that returned bright red [**Date Range **].
# Adenocarcinoma: EGD biopsy showed poorly differentiated carcinoma with signet ring features.
CT abdomen with evidence of significant lymphadenopathy.
A trial of palliative radiation therepy was suggested to help decrease risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
# Hematemesis: Patient with known gastric mucosa abnormality as seen on EGD suspicious for infiltrating process with biopsy now showing adenocarcinoma.
After biopsy showed adenocarcinoma and CT scan of the abdomen showed retroperitoneal mass with associated lymphadenopathy concerning for metastatic disease, oncology was consulted and recommended palliative radiation for control of symptoms of hematemesis.
- Continue with therapy for H.pylori infection for comfort for total 10 day course - Recommend continuation of pantoprazole due to recent GI bleeding.
# EKG changes: Patient with new TWI in lateral leads compared to prior EKG.
#Hypertension: The patient's [**Month/Day (4) **] pressure was elevated on arrival but with ongoing [**Month/Day (4) **] loss, decision was made to hold his hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril.
- Held Namenda and Aricept initially in the setting of GI bleed, but were subsequently resumed.
# H/o Metastatic prostate cancer: previously on Bicalutamide.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient's atorvastatin was discontinued due to changes in goals of care.
PPx: at risk for DVT.
Pt received pneumoboots in setting of GI bleed.
