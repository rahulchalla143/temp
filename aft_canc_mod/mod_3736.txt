Admission Date:  [**2102-5-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2020-2-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**] Chief Complaint: Recurrent falls  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transbronchial nodal biopsy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo female with PMH  significant for HTN and HLD who initially presented from OSH on [**5-20**] with 3 week history of multiple falls, approximately once per week.
She had an MRI which showed 4 enhancing cerebellar lesions, thought to be consistent with metastatic cancer.
She underwent a CT scan chest at OSH (read by our radiologists)which showed a RUL lung mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
She acutely became hypertensive and tachycardic causing her to go into flash pulmonary edema.
Initial EKG showed ST depressions inferiorly and laterally.
Repeat ECG showed ST elevations in V2 and V3 and post-procedure cxray showed moderate R sided pneumothorax.
ST elevations resolved and she was transferred back to the oncology service.
No deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities.
2)ECHO ([**5-23**]): No obvious vegetations visualized.
Mild focal hypertrophy of the basal septum with normal biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pathologic structural valve disease.
If  clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for evidence of endocarditis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4)CT Head ([**6-5**]): Bilateral cerebellar masses with no evidence of hydrocephalus or herniation.
Multifocal pneumonia/aspiration, greater in the left lower lobe than the right lower lobe.
Right lower lobe opacities are more rounded in configuration and underlying nodules are not excluded.
There is no dominant lung mass visualized.
Small peripheral centrilobular nodular opacities, sub-5-mm in size.
These may be inflammatory, but it is unclear if these preceded the current pneumonia as no prior CT exams are available for comparison.
Several small mediastinal lymph nodes, and more infiltrative opacity of the left hilum.
Lytic lesion of the left T10 pedicle.
Fracture of the right posterior eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 82yo female who presented with multiple falls, found to have multiple brain lesions now s/p transbronchial biopsy complicated by respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and STEMI.
1)Respiratory distress: Occurred in the setting of malignant hypertension during the bronchoscopy causing her to go into pulmonary edema.
In addition, she was found to have a R sided pneumothorax secondary to bronchoscopy but she did not require a chest tube.
As a result of her hypoxemia, she was found to have ST depressions and then elevations, likely demand ischemia.
Upon transfer to the oncology service, she was diuresed further but given mild improvement in her respiratory status a CT scan chest was done.
CT revealed multifocal opacities.
She was started on Vancomycin & Zosyn for presumed hospital aquired pneumonia and the pulmonary service was consulted.
2)Brain lesions: Patient initially presented with multiple falls and found to have multiple lesions on imaging.
Likely metastatic cancer but no primary found thus far.
3)Hypertension: Patient found to have extremely elevated SBPs s/p bronchoscopy.
This likely caused her to flash causing her respiratory decline.
After her return from the MICU she was hypernatremia and her free water deficit was appropriately corrected.
The etiology was thought to be hypovolemic given poor oral intake.
5)UTI: Patient found to be growing enterococcus in urine cultures.
6)STEMI: Patient found to have ST depressions/elevations on EKG after bronchoscopy which have normalized since then.
She has remained chest pain free.
Cardiology was consulted in the ICU and did not feel that her presentation was consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
7)Depression: Patient extremely depressed in context of her husband's suicide while she was in the hospital.
Patient was started on Paxil for her depression and should titrated up appropriately.
There was concern for vocal cord dysfunction given her recent intubation and resultant aspiration.
ENT was consulted and felt that there was no vocal cord dysfunction.
8)Prophylaxis: Patient on heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution [**Month/Day/Year **]: 0.63 mg Inhalation Q6-8H (every 6 to 8 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Pneumothorax Urinary tract infection Brain masses Hypertension Cardiovascular disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1)Please take all medications as listed in the discharge instructions.
4)If you experience any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms please return to the emergency room.
