She had no localizing symptoms.
Today she states she was walking in the common room and while she was turning around she tripped and feel to the floor without hitting her head or losing conciousness.
When aid arrived she was found down very somnolent, but responsive without any abnormal movement or signs of loss of sphincter control.
There was no visible bleeding or signs of trauma.
She could not undergo CT scan until more sedated with medications described above.
Her CT head was negative for acute pathology and her CT neck showed extensive DJD with canal narrowing.
She became transtiently hypotensive with SBP in 80s and received IVF.
In the ER to look for RP bleed she underwent non-con CT, which showed diffuse nodularity of the stomach, concerning for neoplasm, involving the retroperitoneum, eroding L2 and possibly infiltrating the spinal canal.
She then underwent a contrast CT, which showed soft tissue mass medial to L kidney, thickened gastric mucosa and lytic lesions in sacrum as well as stable pulmonary nodule.
Reports occasional black stool, but no bright red blood or other signs of bleeding.

Extensive gastric mucosal thickening, worrisome for malignancy.
Soft tissue density mass moderately displacing the left kidney with adjacent osseous destruction, concerning for a metastasis.
Soft tissue density masses within the right hemisacrum and left illiac [**Doctor First Name 362**].
These findings are concerning for metastatic disease.
Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine with scoliosis.
Extensive coronary artery disease and aortic calcifications.
Atelectasis in bilateral lung bases, although infection cannot be excluded.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions and evidence of mild pulmonary edema.
Heterogeneous thyroid.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
[**2177-1-20**] CT head FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is slight prominence of the ventricles and sulci, compatible with parenchymal involution and stable.
There is calcification within the bilateral basal ganglia.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation remains well preserved.
There is slight periventricular white matter hypodensities compatible with sequela of chronic small vessel infarction.
There are carotid siphon calcifications.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
Stable atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Extensive degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, most pronounced at C5/C6 causing indentation of the thecal sac.
If there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be more sensitive for this evaluation.
No fracture or dislocation.
Heterogeneous appearance to both lobes of the thyroid with multiple nodules.
Ultrasound could be performed on a non-emergent basis for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Apical septal thickening indicates mild pulmonary edema.
[**2177-1-21**] TTE The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
CXR [**1-21**] Study demonstrates slight progression of the pulmonary edema, currently interstitial, with some degree of alveolar edema towards the lung bases in combination with bilateral pleural effusions and might be consistent with volume overload.
There is also distention of the right upper mediastinal veins including the azygos vein.
The small focal consolidations seen on the CT abdomen from [**2177-1-20**] are not visible on the current radiograph.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname 24188**] [**Known lastname 24189**] is a very nice 87 year-old woman with significant past medical history of CAD s/p MI, HTN, HL, stage I breast ca s/p lumpectomy on remision who comes after a fall and is foung to have a 13-point HCT drop and CT-scan findings concerning for malignancy.
# High grade lymphoma: gastric infiltration and retroperitoneal mass were found to be lymphoma.
# Anemia: Hematocrit on presentation 23.7 down from 36 in [**2176-9-5**].
Felt to be chronic given patient's relative compensation, and likely secondary to underlying malignancy of GI origin/involvement given CT findings of gastric mucosal thickening/mass.
Labs suggestive of underlying iron deficiency and no evidence of hemolysis.
Lab draws were discontinued after change in goals of care with no sign of active bleeding.
# Abdominal Mass: CT abdomen on presentation was significant for nodular thickening of the stomach, a retroperitoneal mass with vertebral involvement, and bony lesions concerning for metastasis.
LFTs also notable for mild transaminitis, but no liver lesions seen on CT.
These findings were suggestive of malignancy with a broad differential diagnosis.
SPEP and UPEP were sent for possible GI lymphoma and were negative.
EGD revealed multiple submucosal masses in the fundus and body of the stomach.
There were also multiple small and large ulcerations noted on mucosa of the massess.
Biopsies were taken and consistent with High Grade lymphoma.
# Elevated cardiac biomarkers: On presentation the patient was noted to have a troponin T of 0.19 in the setting of hypotension in the ED.
The patient never had any chest pain.
Elevated cardiac biomarkers felt to be secondary to demand ischemia and trended downward.
Given her history of coronary artery disease, the patient was put on a high dose statin, continued on a beta-blocker (though dose was decreased initially because of hypotension in the ED), and continued on aspirin.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed with conclusion of demand ischemia and felt it was safe to proceed with EGD.
She had no further episodes of BRBPR during her hospitalization.
# Hypoxia: Patient had a new O2 requirement on day 2 in the ICU and appeared volume overloaded on exam.
Serial CXRs revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
# UTI: On day of transfer pt was noted to have increased urinary frequency.
She had no fevers, abdominal pain or dysuria.
UA was obtained which revealed postive leuk esterase and nitrite.
# Altered Mental Status - Likely multifactorial given diagnosis of lymphoma with evidence of spread to L2 and spinal canal.
Also had evidence of UTI, now on Cipro.
# s/p Fall: Patient had no obvious signs of trauma.
CT head was negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
CT C spine negative for acute fracture.
There was no evidence of infection on evaluation, acute MI felt to be unlikely given absence of chest pain and wall motion abnormalities, and no evidence for seizures or focal neurological deficit.
Fall ultimately felt to be mechanical and possibly secondary to volume loss and anemia.
# Hypercalcemia: Patient noted to be hypercalcemic on presentation with a corrected calcium of 11.
This was felt to be secondary to likely malignancy with bony metastases.
# Acute renal failure: Patient's creatinine was elevated to 1.0, up from her prior baseline of 0.6.
# H/o Stage I Breast CA: last mammogram w/o evidence of recurrence.
Metastatic breast cancer remains possibility.
Dicyclomine 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for urinary incontinence.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lymphoma - High Grade B-Cell Upper GI bleed Urinary incontinence Hypertension Anemia Urinary Tract Infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a fall and found to have a low blood count.
Your endoscopy also showed multiple tumors in your GI tract.
An x-ray during the work-up of your bleeding showed a mass in your abdomen, which was determined to be high grade B cell lymphoma.
