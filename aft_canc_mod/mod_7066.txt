According to the patient, he had been in his usual state of good health until the the day of admission when he had six episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
He states that the first episode was a "gush" of blood which "filled the toilet bowl", following that he had five more bowel movements which he initially described as diarrhea but acknowledged that is was mostly blood.
He took two tablets of Alieve two days before admission for hip pain but stated that he did not regularly take NSAIDS.
Family History: Denies family history of gastrointestinal malignancy, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or malignancy.
CTA Abdomen ([**9-1**]): Arterial extravasation in the ascending colon, just proximal to the hepatic flexure, compatible with active GI bleeding.
Small hiatal hernia with fluid in the distal esophagus.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Due to only fair prep, which was inadequate, would recommend repeat colonoscopy within the next 1 year.
Brief Hospital Course: A 64 year old male with PMH GERD presents with bright red blood per rectum and found to have active extravasation of blood into the colon.
ACUTE ISSUES #Lower GI Bleed In the ED, initial vital signs were stable, and by report, patient was well-appearing and asymptomatic.
A CTA abdomen revealed active extravasation in the ascending colon.
In Interventional Radiology, the source of the bleeding could not be identified despite the CTA, but due to deteriorating vital signs, the patient was electively intubated and transported to the MICU for further volume resuscitation.
The patient had a colonoscopy performed at OSH 5 years before this admission, which revealed extensive diverticular disease throughout the colon.
Because of the nature of the bleed, it was thought that this was most likely lower GI in origin, and most likely from a diverticular source.
GI had been consulted in the ER and agreed that the pattern of bleeding was consistent with [**Month/Year (2) **].
They deferred on performing a colonscopy during the acute bleeding phase for concern of poor visualization in the setting of bleeding.
He had multiple small brown stools that had some red tinge, but there were no signs of active bleeding.
The patient was discharged with a follow-up appointment scheduled with his PCP in one week and explicit instructions to return to the ER if additional bleeding occurred or the patient experienced lightheadedness or CV symptoms.
#Suspected Adrenal Adenoma: The CTA abdomen on [**2131-9-1**] demonstrated a 2.2 x 1.9 cm left adrenal nodule has Hounsfield attenuation of -7.2, compatible with an adrenal adenoma.
