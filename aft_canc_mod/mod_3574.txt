The patient is a former smoker that presented to the outside hospital with a 2-week to 3-week history of persistent cough and weight loss.
A computed tomography scan obtained on [**2182-3-12**] showed a left lower lung collapse with abnormal soft tissue density in the left intrahilar area.
She underwent a bronchoscopy and was noted to have an obliteration of the distal portion of the left main stem at the level of the secondary.
Biopsies obtained were all negative for malignancy so far.
The patient presented to the Emergency Department today with hemoptysis, dyspnea on exertion, and mild shortness of breath.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management and for a tentative diagnosis.
History of left carotid occlusion.
The patient was in no acute distress.
She was complaining of shortness of breath.
She had no scleral icterus.
The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
She had a right carotid bruit.
There was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased bibasilar breath sounds (left greater than right).
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 74-year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with hemoptysis after bronchoscopy and biopsy for an occluding lesion of the left secondary main stem at the level of the secondary carina.
The patient is here for further diagnosis, workup, and management.
This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], and the patient's pulmonary function tests were obtained with a question of repeat computed tomography scan and a positron emission tomography scan in preparation for potential surgery.
Lung volumes were not obtained due to low oxygen saturations.
On hospital day two, the patient was short of breath without oxygen.
The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed no ischemic changes.
A urinalysis was sent which showed many bacteria, 6 to 10 white blood cells, and no urinary tract infection.
A chest computed tomography showed calcifications on the right lung and left lower lung collapse.
A head computed tomography showed calcifications in pons with no metastasis.
There, they found enlarged lymph nodes and a mass on the secondary carina of the left lung.
On hospital day three, postoperative day one, after mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy, the patient complained of a sore throat.
The patient had decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Obtained a chest x-ray which showed atelectasis, bilateral effusions, and congestion.
No complaints of shortness of breath.
The patient's chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe collapse which was similar to previous.
There were bloody secretions and clots in the endotracheal tube.
The patient was also placed on a Neo-Synephrine drip for low blood pressures.
The patient had experienced hypotension and hypoxia after bronchoscopy and intubated.
The patient's hypoxia improved with increased positive end-expiratory pressure.
The patient had experienced some labile blood pressures.
Oncology felt the patient had poorly differentiated non-small-cell lung cancer with a very prominent left endobronchial lesion and a high-grade obstruction.
Oncology felt there was little or no role for chemotherapy and felt that if anything she would be more of a candidate for radiation therapy.
The patient was seen by the Nutrition Service for nutritional consultation.
The patient had surgical tumor ablation.
The plan was for radiation treatment to decrease tumor burden.
On[**4-23**], the patient was then transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit from the Medicine Service to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit for thoracic surgery.
On [**2182-4-23**] the patient underwent sternotomy, left pneumonectomy, omental flap of the left main bronchus by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
On postoperative day two, the patient was still on a Neo-Synephrine drip for labile blood pressures.
The patient was still on a Neo-Synephrine drip for labile blood pressures.
On postoperative day seven, the patient had burst of supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation to the 130s with labile blood pressures.
The patient had hypertension when awoken and was agitated; however, was hypotensive when asleep.
Thick yellow secretions were suctioned from the airway but the patient continued to do well extubated.
The patient was afebrile and her vital signs were stable.
On postoperative day ten, the patient required a Foley placement for an inability to void.
The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient had some coarse lung sounds, but tolerated the removal of chest tube.
