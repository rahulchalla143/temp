Recurrent acute pancreatitis, with enlargement and hypoenhancement of pancreatic head and peripancreatic standing, suspicious for necrosis.
No organized fluid collections.
Large right and small left pleural effusions, with right lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
Moderate cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion.
Severe atherosclerosis.
KUB [**2180-3-19**]: Single abdominal radiograph demonstrates air within dilated small bowel segments in the mid abdomen.
If there is concern for obstruction, then CT would be helpful for further assessment.

Surgery was consulted, and recommended no acute surgical intervention.
