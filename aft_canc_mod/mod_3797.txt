Central venous catheter placement in ED [**2208-5-27**]  History of Present Illness: 64M with a PMH of complex partial seizures with secondary generalisation with previously good control, likely focus was right parietal IPH in [**2199**] s/p craniotomy and residual mild left hemiparesis, T2DM poorly controlled with severe diabetic retinopathy s/p laser surgery with left eye blindness, HTN, dCHF, right groin mass with biopsy results of an atypical spindle cell neoplasm [**4-/2208**] awaiting excision and CKD with new worsening renal function and nephrotic syndrome possibly secondary to minimal change (awaiting EM result from bx) with recent tapering of AEDs in the setting of her worsening renal function presents with status epilepticus, intubated at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Patient had decreased Keppra from 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] to 500 [**Hospital1 **] at recent medicine admission 5/23-28/[**2207**] given worsening renal function up to Cr c4 on renal guidance at which time he had presented with a mechanical fall, new peripheral edema and worsening renal failure.
Since then patient had continued to be seizure free and was maintained on prednisone 60mg qd for nephrotic syndrome felt likely secondary to minimal change nephropathy and receiving diuresis with furosemide.
He has also had a groin mass biopsied on [**2208-5-4**] which showed atypical spindle cell neoplasm and is awaiting elective resection with clear margins.
In addition, he had a recent ED admission for a burst blister on his left shin due to his severe anasarca on [**2208-5-24**].
Since then, patient had been in his usual state of health until the evening of [**2208-5-26**] when he started to have generalised convulsions and apparently convulsive status for over 30 minutes.
Had 3 doses of lorazepam en route without termination of his seizures and was intubated on arrival at [**Hospital **] Hospital at 20:39 and paralysed with x1 dose of vecuronium.
Per documentation, patient came in actively seizing (eye deviation to L) and very scant documentation and given midazolam 10mg and loaded with 2g IV Keppra.
Labs there revealed a high WCC 13.1 and UA was negative.
In addition, patient was afebrile throughout and vitals were stable.
Patient was noted to have eye movements where they would drift to the left with sustained nystagmus which was concerning for ongoing seizure activity.
On assessment, he had no withdrawal at all on the left and had reasonable withdrawal on the right but would not grimace to pain but wold occasionally keep his eyes open.
He has had no recent neurology evaluation, the last being 8/[**2206**].
Past Medical History: - R parietal ICH in [**2199**], s/p cranotomy with subsequent left hemiparesis and seizure disorder - Seizure disorder: last seizure [**5-/2208**] when Keppra decreased due to worsening kidney disease.

Extensive area of encephalomalacia is redemonstrated in the right temporoparietal and occipital lobes as a sequela of prior hemorrhagic event, causing ex vacuo dilatation and asymmetry of the right cerebral hemisphere.
No acute findings are identified.
The MRA of the head is extremely limited and nondiagnostic, there is partial visualization of the internal carotid arteries and basilar artery, however, the distal branches are not identified, related with motion artifacts, please consider and repeat this examination if clinically warranted.
No evidence of pneumonia.
[**2208-5-31**] LUE LENI: No deep venous thrombosis in left upper extremity.
EEG: [**2208-5-27**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study.
The initial portion of the recording shows severe diffuse background attenuation, worse on the right, likely secondary to propofol effect.
There is asymmetric EMG activity over the right hemisphere, consistent with left hemiparesis.
These findings are indicative of severe focal dysfunction over the right hemisphere, with moderate diffuse dysfunction on the left, and are consistent with the history of known prior stroke and likely postictal state.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
[**2208-5-28**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study.
There is focal attenuation over the right hemisphere and frequent right occipital epileptiform discharges, frequently with periodic discharges every three to four seconds.
These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction with focal highly potentially epileptogenic cortical dysfunction in the right hemisphere.
There was report of focal left facial twitching during the pushbutton episode, but this was not seen on video during the study.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change in background activity but frequent epileptiform discharges and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are now present in the right occipital region.
[**2208-5-31**]: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG due to the slow and low voltage background with additional attenuation of activity over the left hemisphere, suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy with further left hemispheric dysfunction.
There were frequent low voltage sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave discharges in the right occipital region indicative of an area of potentially epileptogenic cortex.
There were no clear electrographic seizures.

On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] patient had episodes of gaze deviation to the left with sustained nystagmus which was concerning for ongoing seizure activity.
He withdrew briskly in the right upper and lower extremity but only minimally in the left leg and no movement was observed in the left arm.
CT revealed stable chronic right temporo-parietal hypodensity and encephalomalacia without change since last CT in [**2205**].
Labs revealed elevated WCC 17.1 and Cr 2.8 better than at OSH.
CXR showed obscured left hemi-diaphragm likely effusion and some pulmonary congestion but no clear pneumonia.
He was maintained on propofol overnight with resolution of his seizure activity.
The most likely precipitant of his status epilepticus was thought to be the rapid reduction in longterm maintenance Keppra in setting of worsened renal failure.
No clear infectious or metabolic precipitants were identified initially.
He then had focal motor seizures, involving the left face, neck and shoulder with semirhythmic twitching.
# ID: He remained afebrile with no obvious signs of infection.
# Renal: patient has CKD with recent acute worsening of his kidney function, thought to be due to minimal change disease.
# Resp: CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
# PPX: He was maintained on S/C heparin and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
