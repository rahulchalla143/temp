However, he now has developed a therapy-related leukemia and is status post remission induction with 7+3 and completed high-dose ARA-C on [**2147-8-6**] (now Day 19 after therapy).
However, his course has been complicated by development of skin rash on extremities with recent biopsy revealing leukemia cutis.
He has felt cold but no rigors.
He feels tired and has generalized muscle aches today with the fever but otherwise no localizing signs of ifection.
Specifically, he denies nausea/vomiting, diarrhea (last normal BM this am) or abdominal pain.
He states that his skin is not significantly worse - though to him some of the nodules appear more raised than before.
He has had no easy bruising or bleeding.
Duodenal adenocarcinoma in third segment of the duodenum diagnosed in [**2142-7-25**], stage 2, T3, N1, M0, status post resection and chemotherapy with 5-FU and leucovorin times six cycles.
Status post carpal tunnel release.
History of prostate cancer, diagnosed in [**2140**] due to an elevated PSA, status post radical prostatectomy.
8.  hypercholesterolemia 9.
Family History: Father died of prostate cancer at 80.
He has no siblings or relatives with cancer.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: The patient is a healthy-appearing man in no acute distress.
There is no evidence of any oral thrush or mucositis.
There is no injection or  exudates.
There is no evidence of gingival bleeding.
LYMPH NODES: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal or epitrochlear lymph nodes.
No wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No obvious ascites or other masses.
SKIN: Livid nodular rash on both legs and arms (increased since last admission) EXTREMITIES: Lower extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Motor, sensory and cerebellar exams are also grossly normal.
No pleural effusions.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
TTE [**2147-8-20**]: There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now more prominent (in focused views).
The heart and great vessels of the mediastinum are unremarkable and there is no evidence for acute aortic injury.
No pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy is identified.
There are very small bilateral pleural effusions with small dependent atelectasis.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver enhances without focal lesions.
The gallbladder is moderately distended with pericholecystic fluid.
No radiopaque stones are identified.
The patient reportedly has a history of duodenal cancer, and atypical anatomy within the second portion of the duodenum would be consistent with previous surgery.
Study is limited secondary to lack of oral contrast.
The distal pancreas enhances greater than pancreatic head, but this is of unclear importance given early arterial phase.
There is a small amount of free fluid about the liver, spleen, and in the pelvis.
No pathologic adenopathy is identified, though multiple small retroperitoneal nodes are present.
The patient's prostate is not identified, consistent with the patient's history of prostate cancer.
No pathologic adenopathy is identified.
BONE WINDOWS:  Small sclerotic focus is present in the right posterior column of the acetabulum, as well as a small 8-mm sclerotic focus within the left iliac and sacrum.
Though these likely represent bone islands, but given history of prostate cancer, comparative imaging would be helpful.
Gallbladder US [**2147-8-21**]: The gallbladder is normal in appearance, with no evidence of cholecystitis or gallbladder wall thickening.
Trace pericholecystic fluid is seen adjacent to the fundus of the gallbladder.
Labs at time of discharge: WBC 1.5 ANC 600 Hct 32 Plt 360 INR 1.1 Na 142 K 3.6 Cr 0.7 Ca 8.2 Mg 1.8 Culture data negative     Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit for treatment of neutropenic fever.
Overnight however, the patient became hypotensive with bp 80s/50s.
The patient was asymptomatic and denied fevers/chills/sweats/, SOB at that time.
Vancomycin was started for concern for sepsis, and 3 1L boluses were given.
AM cortisol was high and there was no chronic steroid use.
Prior to transfer the patient developed chest pain and hypoxia associated with hypotension so a bedside echo was performed to r/o pericardial effusion.
This was neg for effusion, but notable for EF of 35%.
EKG showed twi in II, AVR and V1, as well as left anterior fascicular block and RBBB, no change from prior, no acute ST changes.
He had no further episodes of chest pain.
On the floor he remained afebrile and after his ANC increased to 600 on the day of discharge his antibiotics were discontinued.
The source of fever remained unclear.
Patient has no central lines, no focal signs of infection on exam.
CT abdomen/pelvis was also negative for focal infection.
Gall-bladder US showed no cholecystitis and patient did not have RUQ pain.
Patient has multiple violacious nodules on upper and lower extremities that were biopsied on [**8-5**]: path showed cells + for CD68 and CD15, neg.
The patient had occasional nausea during admission that responded well to ativan prn and he was given a prescription for this upon discharge.
Febrile neutropenia 2.
Leukemia cutis   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, ANC 600, afebrile, tolerating PO   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for fever and neutropenia.
