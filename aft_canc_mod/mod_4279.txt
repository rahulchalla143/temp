Admission Date:  [**2168-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-2-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: fever, cough, confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: A 69-year-old gentleman with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement undergoing XRT, PCP ([**2168-7-28**]), DVT s/p IVC filter placement, was admitted for hypoxia, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue.
His wife called the clinic for concern that the patient has had shortness of breath, new oxygen requirement, fatigue and weakness, and with temperature of 101.6 3 days PTA.
He has had decreased activity tolerance (before could ambulate with walker) and shortness of breath which required 2L NC at home for comfort when normally he is not on oxygen.
He notes decreased PO intake, constipation, and decreased LE edema after his IVC filter placement.
He has noted some bruising on his hands but no other bleeding particularly any blood in his urine or stool, epistaxis or gum bleeding.
He underwent biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] that showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
He was well until [**10/2167**] to [**11/2167**] when he developed right lower extremity weakness.
Followup PET scan for his R-CHOP showed no evidence for lymphoma.
However, his lower extremity weakness and pain radiating down his right leg increased.
He underwent repeated MRI scanning with his first on [**2167-12-10**], which showed a partially enhancing lesion within the posterior L4 vertebrae suggestive of an atypical hemangioma.
He subsequently was admitted in [**1-/2168**] for workup of his right lower extremity weakness as the concern was for CNS involvement or a cord compression.
He was evaluated by additional MRIs and lumbar puncture, which did not show any evidence for malignancy, although noted the same question atypical hemangioma in the lumbar spine area.
He was extensively followed by his primary oncologist as well as the neurologic service.
On [**2168-2-17**], his CSF cytology did show evidence for malignant cells.
MRI also demonstrated increased uptake in the sacral plexus with evidence of possible right lumbosacral plexopathy.
At the end of [**8-/2168**], it was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had shown some progression of his systemic disease as his last CT had shown some evidence of bony erosion and he was having some increasing lower extremity weakness.
He noted a decreased visual acuity and unfortunately a head MRI showed a new 1.5 cm suprasellar mass likely representing progression of his CNS disease.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as noted above, complicated by lymphomatous meningitis and a new recent CNS lesion.
Right lower extremity weakness secondary to plexopathy.
Bilateral upper extremity weakness.
Right lower extremity DVT.
His wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], is very supportive.
No h/o smoking or recreational drugs.
His sister is 65 and has diabetes and hypertension.
Physical Exam: VITALS: T 98.6, BP 100/64, HR 116, RR 20, 94% on 3L NC GENERAL:  Pleasant tired-appearing gentleman lying comfortably in bed but with increased dyspnea with movement.
HEENT:  PERRL with anicteric sclerae.
LUNGS:  With crackles/rales up to mid right lung, at lower left lung.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, rounded, and nontender, with hypoactive bowel sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly or other masses appreciated.
EXTREMITIES:  1+ bilateral edema markedly improved from his prior examination.
He can recall recent evants but his wife reports recent difficulties with memory and carrying out tasks at hand.
[**Name8 (MD) **] NP examination: His muscle strength is most notable for his left upper extremity [**5-5**] with right upper extremity 2-3/5.
His right leg continues with poor proximal strength.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid: no PMNs, negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] positive rods c/w oropharyngeal flora .
There is increased left pleural effusion to account for atelectasis and volume loss of the left lung, however there is also likely consolidation concerning for an infectious process in the left lung.
The right lung now demonstrates pleural effusion with relaxation atelectasis and volume loss at the lung base.
There is also a ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe that is concerning for an infectious process.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is not significantly changed, the largest node measures 2.7 x 1.6 cm in the prevascular region (3:20), which is not a significant change.
No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy is identified.
There has been interval intubation and nasogastric tube placement.
A previously identified hypoattenuating lesion in segment [**Doctor First Name **] is not well visualized in this scan due to a difference in timing of contrast administration.
There has been interval atrophy and fatty replacement of the pancreas, with a slight diffuse increase in fatty appearance of the mesentery.
There is clot in the inferior vena cava inferior to the filter, extending far inferiorly into the iliac veins.
There are paraaortic lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: A 69-year-old gentleman with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement undergoing XRT, PCP ([**2168-7-28**]), DVT s/p IVC filter placement, was admitted for hypoxia, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue found to have pneumonia, leukemic transformation of his lymphoma, and septic shock.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for with presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia.
The patient continued to decline with increasing oxygen requirement and the morning of [**11-7**] he was noted to be tachypneic to 30-40 breaths/min on 100% non-rebreather oxygen.
He went into septic shock with hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation and required central venous line placement and vasopressive medications to maintain MAP>65.
