Upon questioning patient is very unsure about the events of the day on [**5-15**].
large left orbital ecchymosis and edema.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Exam on Discharge: neurologically intact with L orbital ecchymosis and well healing incision   Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD WBC-16.4* RBC-5.52 Hgb-17.1 Hct-47.9 MCV-87 MCH-30.9 MCHC-35.6* RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-208 [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD Neuts-76.8* Lymphs-17.2* Monos-4.6 Eos-0.3 Baso-1.0 [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD PT-12.6 PTT-28.4 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD Glucose-92 UreaN-17 Creat-1.3* Na-142 K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-16 [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-1164* [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2129-5-16**] 04:05PM BLOOD Calcium-9.8 Phos-3.8 Mg-2.3 [**2129-5-16**] 04:44PM BLOOD Lactate-1.8  Labs on Discharge: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ------------------ IMAGING: ----------------- CT/CTA OF HEAD [**5-16**]: 4.8x4.3x4.5cm rounded hyperdense slightly enhancing right frontal mass causing  mass effect on right and left frontal lobes with grey matter hypodesity in the right frontal lobe likey edema.
no herniation.
mass may arise from skull base, but no significant bony remodeling.
no hemorrhage.
soft tissue thickening and stranding around right preseptal orbital tissue.
MRI HEAD [**5-17**]: midline structures and surrounding vasogenic edema.
There are a few punctate foci of susceptibility artifact within the mass likely consistent with calcification or hemorrhage.
No additional enhancing lesions are identified.
There is no significant restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is mucosal thickening involving multiple bilateral ethmoid air cells, the sphenoid sinuses and the left frontal sinus.
There is fluid within the mastoid air cells, bilaterally.
Probable meningioma of the planum sphenoidale or olfactory groove with mass effect on both frontal lobes and slight leftward shift of the normally midline structures.
No acute hemorrhage or infarction.
Sinus and mastoid disease as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
MRI Head [**5-20**](post-op): FINDINGS: Since the previous MRI examination, there has been resection of the large mass in the inferior frontal lobe region representing an olfactory groove meningioma.
No residual nodular enhancement is seen.
There is surrounding edema seen as on the previous MRI examination.
There is no hydrocephalus or new midline shift.
Soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells, which could be related to intubation.
Blood products, fluid and air are seen in the surgical cavity as well as scalp edema and fluid level.
No hydrocephalus or midline shift seen.
No new areas of brain parenchymal hemorrhage distal from the surgical site noted.
Due to the proximity of the tumor supply to opthalmic artery supply-it was decided to forego embolization because of the risk to his vision.
While on the floor, his neurological exam continued to improve, and his pain was well controlled.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.

Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
