Admission Date:  [**2195-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-5-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-8-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**] Chief Complaint: Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2195-4-15**] 1.
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, right neck.
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma subcutaneous tissue scalp.
Reconstruction of scalp defect with a split-thickness skin graft from the right leg.
[**2195-4-17**] Evacuation of hematoma and ligation of vessels.
History of Present Illness: INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male with a known history of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the central portion of the occipital parietal scalp which was excised using a Mohs technique.
It was noted at the time of resection that he had lymphovascular invasion.
More recently, he noted a mass in the right neck and over the ensuing period of time, over the past several weeks, other masses became evident in the right posterior neck which seemed to enlarge.
They also became quite painful.
Clinically he was also found to have an additional lymph node on the contralateral side in the mid portion of level V. CT scan corroborated all of these findings.
Findings consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the right neck with deep invasion into the prevertebral musculature.
Past Medical History: - HTN - Atrial Fibrillation, on coumadin - AAA s/p repair in [**2179**] - ESRD following AAA rupture.
S/p renal transplant in [**2181**] (A 6 antigen matched cadaveric kidney) - h/o SBO [**2146**] - Moderate Aortic Stenosis: Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *1.1 cm2 [**8-27**] - Aortic regurgitation 2+ in [**8-27**] - h/o Endocarditis - s/p splenectomy - Gout - Glaucoma - Cataracts - Axonal polyneuropathy- bilateral LE peripheral neuropathy - Low back pain with radiculopathy to the lower extremities - GERD - Anemia - Negative exploration for pheochromocytoma in [**2153**] - Left leg osteomyelitis in distant past - Right simple orchiectomy s/p varicoceles, hydroceles [**2182**] - Repair of ventral incisional hernia with Marlex mesh.
[**2182**] - Left ankle synovial osteochondromatosis.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: General: Well, NAD, A&O CV: Irreg, 1-2/6 Systolic murmur RESP: CTAB ABD: Soft, NT, ND HEENT: Surgical skin graft donor site on head C/D/I with no sign of necrosis or breakdown at graft edges.
Left neck surgical incision C/D/I with sutures removed.
Right neck surgical incision with staples.
(Final [**2195-4-25**]): No MRSA isolated.
Lymph node, left neck (A-B): Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one lymph node.
Note:  There is extracapsular extension.
The immunostains and histology favor a diagnosis of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Skin, scalp, excision (C-K): -Dermal malignant neoplasm consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, completely excised.
Modified radical neck dissection with dissection of deep cervical musculature (L-[**Doctor Last Name **]): -Level II: Twelve lymph nodes; no malignancy identified.
-Level III: Eight out of fourteen lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma.
-Level IV: Five out of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma.
-Level V: Ten out of eleven lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma.
Note: There is a total of 23 of 46 nodes positive for carcinoma.
Slides AB-AE, Level V, show tumor with necrosis involving muscle, fat, and possibly may completely involve a lymph node (included in lymph node count), however, no definitive lymphoid tissue is identified.
This may represent a soft tissue metastasis.
The specimen shows a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma extending from the epidermis and more poorly differentiated carcinoma which is predominantly dermal.
The poorly differentiated histology and extensive nodal involvement are somewhat unusual for a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and raise consideration of a primary site from the head or neck region.
On POD#2 worsening swelling was noted in the neck dissection/resection bed site.
On POD#2 ([**4-17**]) pt was taken back to the operating room for R neck exploration and evacuation of hematoma/seroma and two new JP drains were placed.
On [**4-17**] JP output was 35 and 80 serosanguinous with decreased edema.
JP output increased to 250 and 170 on [**4-18**] though edema over Right neck was decreased.
On [**4-19**] output continued to be elevated at 185 and 225, was serous in quality, and neck continued to be flat in contour.
On [**4-22**] (POD [**6-27**]) increasing erythema was noticed around the drain site and inferior staple line.
On [**4-24**] JP drain culture grew out pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens.
The pt remained afebrile during this time.
The remaining JP drain continued to have high outputs on the order of 200-300 cc/day, though it was clear and serous in quality.
Patient is being discharged: afebrile, tolerating regular diet without nausea/vomiting, pain well controlled on oral medication, voiding, and ambulating well.
On [**4-16**] a plain film revealed a Non-displaced fracture through the radial styloid as above.
Orthopaedic surgery was consulted and managed his wrist injury conservatively without the need for casting or splinting.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic squamous cell carcimona.
HTN, A-fib, ESRD s/p CRT, mod AS, gout, glaucoma, cataracts, axonal polyneuropathy, LBP, GERD, anemia   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Seek immediate medical attention for fever >101.5, chills, increased redness, swelling or discharge from incision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything else that is troubling you.
No strenuous exercise or heavy lifting until follow up appointment, at least.
