Admission Date:  [**2122-9-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-3-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Upper GI Bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of Right Femoral Cordis  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 73 y.o.
female with h/o duodenal adenocarcinoma (dx in [**2-14**] @[**Hospital1 112**]) h/o epidoses of hematemesis, h/o CAD s/p stent placement, ?h/o esophageal cancer?
Of note her ECG in the ED demonstrated ST depressions in leads V2 and V3.
Past Medical History: PMH: 1. h/o duodenal dysplasia then found to have duodenal adenoCA diagnosed at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2-14**].
NSTEMI in [**7-12**] with EF = 60% on echo in [**2121**] with RVH and depressed RVEF 3.
Chronic atrial flutter (times 10 years).
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2107**] with residual facial droop.
Apparently when she was well, her mother stated that she wants to live at all cost and her daughter believes that she is not in her right mind because she is so tired because of her illness.
Family History: Brother with heart disease.
No other access besides cordis.
Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
Interval opacity in left lower lung zone; underlying effusion or consolidation cannot be ruled out.
* CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2122-9-5**] 8:57 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  Reason: HEMATEMESIS, ESOPHAGEAL CA, HYPOTENSION, ?
BLEED, ?
MASS Field of view: 32 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 73 year old woman with hx of esophageal CA p/w hematemesis, hypotension.
INDICATION: Esophageal cancer and hematemesis.
Evaluate for hemorrhage and metastatic disease.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
As the patient was actively bleeding from the upper GI tract, the referring service requested no oral contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes that are definitely identified.
There is some soft tissue density in the subcarinal region, but a discrete lymph node is not definitely identified.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, and the left pleural effusion tracks medially with a small amount of low-attenuating fluid surrounding the descending thoracic aorta.
Within the left lung apex, there is a 4 mm nodule which is new compared to the prior study of [**2121-8-10**].
No additional lung nodules are identified.
There are no consolidations.
There is bilateral minimal dependent atelectasis associated with the small pleural effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A small lymph node is noted at the gastroesophageal junction, measuring 7 mm in short axis dimension.
There is relative low attenuation that is ill defined in the inferior aspect of the spleen, which is nonspecific.
There is a rounded hypoattenuating lesion on the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 2.8 x 3.1 cm.
It likely represents a cyst, as it measures 8.7 Hounsfield units.
The stomach contains a fair amount of mixed attenuation material with air.
There is atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta.
Small retrocrural lymph nodes are noted, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
They measure approximately 6-7 mm in short axis dimension.
Small mesenteric lymph nodes are noted that do not meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement as well.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a small amount of cystic change with associated sclerosis of the right ilial portion of the superior sacroiliac joint, likely degenerative.
No other osseous lesions are noted.
No areas of active extravasation.
There is a fair amount of mixed attenuation material within the stomach.
A 7-mm lymph node at the gastroesophageal junction and small retrocrural lymph nodes.
While these small lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement, attention on follow-up studies is recommended to evaluate for interval growth and evaluation of possible metastases.
New 4 mm nodule within the left lung apex.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Coronary artery calcifications and calcification of the abdominal aorta.
* Admission ECG:   Brief Hospital Course: A/P 73 y. o. female with h/o CAD, s/p stent, h/o duodenal cancer, h/o admissions with UGI bleed p/w UGI bleed.
UGI bleed: We thought that her hematemesis was most likely secondary to her duodenal cancer.
A CT scan was obtained which did not demonstrate an acute GI process.
* ECG changes: The patient remained chest pain free and cardiac ischemia was ruled out by serial flat cardiac enzymes.
She was not given an aspirin in light of her risk of bleeding and she continued on a statin.
SQ heparin was held secondary to bleeding.
*  Medications on Admission: Meds in NH: Tylenol Lorazepam Bisacodyl 10 mg supp Ritalin 5 mg Morphine 15mg SR [**Hospital1 **] Mirtazapine 7.5 qhs Prochlorperazine 10 mg q 8 prn Prochlorperazine 25 mg supp q 8 prn nausea Hyoscyamine 0.125 Sl PRN increased secretions Morphine 20 mg /ml give 0.5ML q 1-2 hrs prn pain Morphine .75 ML - 15 mg LS prn pain   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Duodenal Cancer with upper GI bleed Secondary: 1.
CHF with EF = 60% 2.
Chronic atrial flutter (times 10 years).
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2107**] with residual facial droop.
