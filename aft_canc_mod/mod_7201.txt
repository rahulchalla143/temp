Admission Date:  [**2126-2-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-10**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  SURGICAL  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69 year-old gentleman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post a bone marrow transplant with refractory thrombocytopenia is admitted with weakness and confusion.
He was recently discharged from the hospital with severe thrombocytopenia awaiting potential splenectomy.
He was found to have left hand weakness and noticed that he could not move his wrist and he was becoming more confused.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with a bone marrow transplant in [**2124-7-26**] with recurrence status post chemotherapy.
He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, clot in the inferior vena cava, glaucoma, chronic low platelets with past history of ITP and also of myelofibrosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was awake, but drowsy and arousable.
There was gingival bleeding in the mouth.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted with decreased mental status and thought perhaps to have intracerebral bleed.
MRI showed some enhancement over the right side of the brain.
There was a question of carcinomatosis versus bleed.
However, reread showed a probably small subarachnoid bleed.
A lumbar puncture was performed and there was a question of meningitis for which he was treated with Acyclovir, Vanco, Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone.
There was no evidence of lymphoma on cerebral spinal fluid cytology.
A very long conversation was again had with the patient and his family about options and it was thought that perhaps the only way for the patient to have a reasonable life was to have a splenectomy, which may decrease the patient's requirement for platelet transfusion.
However, over his Intensive Care Unit stay he had more difficulty with respiration and required reintubation for a pneumonia.
There is no evidence of active bleeding, but the patient continued to have severe consumption of his platelets and probably no platelet production.
He then had severe deterioration of his respiratory function with developing ARDS, increasing respiratory acidosis and dead space.
Because of his extremely poor prognosis and the fact that the splenectomy did not improve his platelet problem as well as severe respiratory failure it was thought that further measures were to attempt to improve the situation were futile.
Severe thrombocytopenia.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Ventilator associated pneumonia with respiratory failure.
