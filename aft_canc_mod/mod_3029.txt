Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with complicated cardiac history including CAD s/p CABG ([**2196**]), DES to RCA and protected OMCA ostium in [**2199**] and sCHF with EF 35-40% who p/w lethargy, melena, and hyperglycemia thought to have GI bleed complicated course including hemoperitoneum managed medically w/ bowel rest and decompression, as well as acute on chronic renal failure and UTI/ bacteremia .
# Microcytic Anemia - Pt a/w Hct 21 (most recent prior values 34-38), guaiac pos brown stool; despite patients history of significant CAD, patient asymptomatic on presentation; guaiac pos stool in setting of microcytic anemia was concerning for GI loss especially in patient on coumadin, ASA, plavix; It was unclear if this would be lower or upper GI source.
He was also started on IV protonix 40mg daily for concern of possible upper GI bleed.
His post colonoscopy course was complicated by hemoperitoneum requiring admission to the MICU with transfer to the SICU as described below.
He continued to note intermittent small amounts of bright red blood per rectum which surgery felt was likely residual blood from his intramural hematoma.
Though the initial source of bleeding remained unclear bleeding had subsided at the time of discharge and there was no clear plan for future repeat scope, though if bleeding were to recur would consider capsule endoscopy to r/o small intestine as the source of bleeding.
# Hemoperitoneum:  As above the pt was admitted to the Medical ICU on [**9-26**] for medical management of bowel perforation versus hemorrhage after colonoscopy.
Pt complaining of increased abodominal pain,CT demonstrated intraabdmonial and pelvic hemorrhage - hemoperitoneum in the pelvis and upper quadrants, hemorrhage in the rectosidmoi lumen, and intramural hemorrhage of the sigmoid wall, without no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
Repeat CT  in the setting of increased abdominal distension showed an increase in the size of the blood collection and the patient was transferred to the Surgical ICU on [**9-27**].
Bladder pressures were increased in the 20-30s however clinically the patient denied pain and was making urine which was made abdominal compartment syndrome unlikely.
He had a few non bloody stool and was determined to be stable to go to be transferred to the floor.
The patient did have residual suprapubic tenderness and began to pass small amounts of blood per rectum however a third CT showed resolution of his hemoperitoneum.
# Supratherapeutic INR - on coumadin for LV thrombus, but w INR 4.7 on admission, uncertain etiology.
However, it began to trend upward again while on the floor and vitamin K was given PO due to the patients high risk for bleeding.
His increased INR was felt to likely be due to poor nutritional status as the patient also had a low albumin.
# Hyperglycemia - Pt reporting elevated sugars at home ~500 without recent change in diet or change in medications; no anion gap; no signs infection on CXR; EKG of limited use given LBBB; no CP to indicate ACS, although given DM, atypical presentation of ACS is possible but cardiac enzymes were trended and ultimately negative.
Urinalysis was negative for infection.
Blood sugars remained elevated and his morning 70/30 was increased to 20 units with some improvement in glucose control.
# Chronic sCHF - Patient appeared euvolemic on exam so his carvedilol was continued.
This was increased from 25 to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] for better blood pressure and rate control His diuretics were initially continued but were eventually held in the setting of increasing creatinine.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure:  Patient had CKD with known baseline creatinine of 4.0.
Urine lytes and FeNa (3.3%) were consistent with a intrinsic or post renal etiology.
The patient was noted to have increasing suprapubic abdominal pain and placement of a foley drained 500 mL of urine suggesting a post renal etiology to the increased creatinine.
The patient failed post void trials and the foley remained in place as below.
#Leukocytosis, Fever: While in the ICU the patient was noted to have a leukocytosis with high of 22.1.
There was a concern for bacterial translocation from the gut and the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with linezolid and zosyn.
The patients WBC trended downward and antibiotics were discontinued as no source of infection was identified.
The patient continued to have intermittent fevers on the floor,CXR unconcerning for PNA, c.diff was negative.
Repeat TTE was done to r/o endocarditis in the setting of a murmur on exam was negative.
# Urinary retention:  The patient was noted to have urinary retention as above in the setting of a UTI.
Patient was having increasing suprapubic pain as well as urinary incontinence so a foley was placed and drained 500 mL of urine.
# Hypernatremia: Patient noted to have sodium of 155 while in the ICU believed to be secondary to free water deficit in the setting of poor intake.
Given his poor cardiac function the patient was monitored closely for signs of fluid overload.
Sodium trended downward and fluids were discontinued as the patient increased his oral fluid intake.
# CAD - The patient was continued on  atorvastatin and carvedilol, aspirin and plavix were held in the setting of an acute bleed.
He was noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes over the course of the hospitalization (tropoinin to 0.95) felt to reflect   demand ischemic.
These trended downward and the patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
EKGs remained unchanged and echo showed left ventricular function that was similar to what was seen on a TTE done in [**4-13**].
He was monitored on telemetry throughout admission and was noted to have a lot of ventricular ectopy.
# h/o LV Thrombus - The patient's coumadin was initially held for supratherapeutic INR.
Repeat TTE showed no evidence of thrombus therefore coumadin was not restarted.
Outpatient Physical Therapy please evaluate and treat   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: GI Bleed Hemoperitoneum Urinary tract infection Bacteremia Acute on Chronic Renal failure Urinary retention .
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes Hypernatremia Chronic systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital because you were having difficulty controlling your blood sugars.
Your stomach pain got worse and CT scan showed you had bleeding in your abdomen.
You got more blood and your blood counts were stable.
When it is too high you are at an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding.
It can raise your risk of developing bleeding in your gastrointestinal tract.
Because of the bleeding you just developed your Plavix was stopped.
Neither of these showed a source of bleeding, which indicates the bleeding is coming from your small intestine, which can be evaluated with a capsule endoscopy (small camera that you swallow).
You were also found to have an infection in your urine and blood.
