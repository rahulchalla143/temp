The overall background is somewhat slow and may represent a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-9-30**] 11:41 AM FINDINGS: A large rim enhancing mass is again seen in the right temporo- occipital lobe just posterior to the right trigone, with a central area of low attenuation, which likely represents necrosis.
The lesion measures 3.1 x 2.6 cm, which is slightly smaller in size compared to prior MR examination; however, an accurate estimate cannot be done due to differences in modality.
There is marked vasogenic edema surrounding this mass extending to the right corona radiata, occipital, parietal and temporal lobes, and the splenium of corpus callosum.
There is no midline shift, acute intracranial hemorrhage, or abnormal extra-axial fluid collection.
No new areas of abnormal enhancement are identified.
Minimal ethmoid mucosal thickening is identified.
There is nasal septal deviation to the left.
Large right temporo-occipital lobe mass, previously described as glioblastoma multiforme, with likely central areas of necrosis.
The size is slightly smaller; however, more accurate comparison cannot be performed due to differences in technique and modality.
No acute hemorrhage, significant midline shift, or new enhancing lesion noted.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-9-30**] 10:28 AM FINDINGS: Evaluation limited due to low lung volumes.
No focal consolidation is identified.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There is mild opacity in the left costophrenic angle, which could represent small left pleural effusion or thickening.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-10-1**] 8:54 AM FINDINGS: Again seen is a mass in the right temporo-occipital lobe posterior to the right trigone with associated marked vasogenic edema extending to the right corona radiata, occipital parietal and temporal lobes in splenium of the corpus callosum.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures or intracranial hemorrhage.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No new midline shift or intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 10664**] is a 70 year old right handed woman with history of right parietal Stage 4 Glioblastoma who presented to OSH with seizure then seized again, then was intubated and transferred here for further care.
Her known tumor certainly places her at risk for seizure, which likely was secondarily generalized in type (given her known focal mass and L hemiparesis and neglect per history and exam).
There was intial concern for NCSE on admission, but this was not confirmed by EEG, and her impaired mental status was likely related to benzodiazepines and due to a postictal state.
No underlying infection was encountered as a potential trigger.
EEG did not reveal evidence of nonconvulsive status.
She had no further evidence of seizure during this admission.
She was continued on bactrim for UTI prophylaxis.
3) History of Pulmonary Embolism- Her coumadin was held on admission for elevated INR (likely interaction with dilantin).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 931**] House Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 932**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure Glioblastoma Grade 4 on Temodar   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51036**] or 911 if you have any further seizures, new tingling, numbness, weakness or any other concerning symptoms.
