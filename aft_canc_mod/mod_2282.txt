[**Name (NI) **] reports a 2-week to 3-week history of a progressive onset of jaundice.
He also had lower abdominal discomfort but denied any significant upper abdominal pain.
He denies any nausea or vomiting.
He states that his appetite has been poor over the past few weeks.
The patient was initially seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital for these symptoms and was found to have a bilirubin level of 32.4, and He subsequently underwent an abdominal ultrasound which was consistent with distal common bile duct obstruction and pancreatic ductal obstruction, though no definite lesion was seen.
He also was noted to have a distended gallbladder with evidence of gallstones.
The patient also underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at the outside hospital which demonstrated a markedly dilated bile duct with a distal stricture.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation of his obstructive jaundice and possible surgical intervention.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No past surgical history.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was a middle-aged male in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was mildly distended, soft, nontender.
Mild ascites.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Skin was notable for jaundice.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute, and no evidence of ST changes.
A CT of the abdomen with intravenous contrast revealed (1) pancreatic head mass measuring 2.4 cm X 2.6 cm with minimal small peripancreatic lymph nodes and minimal stranding of the mesentery, grade 0 involvement of the superior mesenteric artery and probable grade 1 or 2 involvement of the superior mesenteric vein; (2) normal celiac access; (3) ascites; (4) findings suggestive of mild cirrhosis.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ([**2170-8-31**]) revealed (1) ampullary mass; (2) biliary dilatation compatible with distal obstruction; (3) stent placement in the common bile duct; (4) gastric mucosal changes consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
HEPATOBILIARY:  The patient initially presented to an outside hospital with signs and symptoms consistent with obstructive jaundice.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and CT scan demonstrated a mass in the head of the pancreas consistent with adenocarcinoma.
He was also noted to have mild ascites.
Following the patient's CT scan, he developed an elevated creatinine to 2.4.
On [**2170-9-10**], he was taken to the operating room for exploration, possible Whipple, and possible biliary bypass.
Intraoperatively, the patient's liver was noted to be cirrhotic in nature and approximately 2 liters of straw-colored ascites fluid was also noted.
The liver wedge biopsy revealed chronic obstruction with marked bile stasis and active cholangiolitis as well as mild steatosis with prominent regeneration.
The pancreatic biopsy revealed invasive adenocarcinoma which was moderately differentiated.
He was evaluated by the Medical/Oncology and Radiology/Oncology teams for his pancreatic cancer.
The patient's liver disease was likely secondary to chronic alcohol use.
He was started on Aldactone 100 mg by mouth daily for management of his fluid status.
His absolute neutrophil count was determined to be [**2108**]; which was consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He was started on intravenous Unasyn for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The culture from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain fluid also grew out alpha streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As noted above, the patient was found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as suggested by the cell count and culture from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain fluid.
He underwent a diagnostic paracentesis on [**2170-9-20**] for further evaluation of his ascites fluid.
The Gram stain revealed no evidence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes or microorganisms.
This also confirmed the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis since the patient's absolute neutrophil count was 911.
He has remained afebrile and has not complained of any abdominal pain since that time.
However, following the patient's CT scan with intravenous contrast, the patient developed an increase in his creatinine to 2.4.
WOUND CARE:  The patient's incision was healing well, and there was no evidence of a wound infection.
A stitch was placed at the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site, and there was no evidence of leakage for the next one to two days.
However, on postoperative day 11, the patient noted leakage of straw-colored fluid from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site despite the stitch that was placed previously.
He was discharged home with an ostomy bag for fluid collection.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Status post cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, liver biopsy, and pancreatic biopsy.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He was instructed to return should he develop any fevers or persistent abdominal pain.
