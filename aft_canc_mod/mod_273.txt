MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-10-31**] 6:07 AM IMPRESSION: Stable residual neoplasm in the right side of the sella extending into the right cavernous sinus, and encasing the cavernous segment of right internal carotid artery.
Postoperative changes in the form of right frontal and temporal craniotomy.
Pneumocephalus in bifrontal regions.
Extra-axial collection in right frontal region.
Residual neoplasm in the right side of the sella extending into the right cavernous sinus and encasing the right internal carotid artery.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-2**] 4:34 AM IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2124-12-13**]:  Moderately severe opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones is probably edema, also affecting the right lower lung and accompanied by a moderate right pleural effusion.
Thickening of the right apical pleural surface is chronic.
A large reticulated opacity projecting over the right mid lung could be unusual atelectasis or bronchiectasis or even a pleural calcification present in [**2122**].
No evidence of cerebral edema or acute intracranial process.
Edema in the left lung appears less radiodense but this may be a function of better inflation following tracheal intubation.
Severe right lung scarring and concurrent emphysema make it difficult to determine if a concurrent pneumonia is present.
Right pleural thickening is more pronounced now than it was in [**Month (only) 404**] suggesting either a component of pleural effusion or pathologic pleural involvement.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and hyperdynamic global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-3**] 10:07 AM  IMPRESSION: AP chest submitted for review at 4:53 p.m.:  Moderate pulmonary edema unchanged since [**11-3**].
Emphysema, right pleural thickening and pleural calcification have been discussed on prior and subsequent radiographic reports.
Mild pulmonary edema is clearing.
Inferiorly severe scarring in the right lung is a persistent region of opacification, could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
Extensive thickening of the right pleural margin has increased since [**2124-11-25**] and could be either more infiltration of pleural surface or additional component of right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Mild pulmonary edema is clearing.
Inferiorly severe scarring in the right lung is a persistent region of opacification, could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
Extensive thickening of the right pleural margin has increased since [**2124-11-25**] and could be either more infiltration of pleural surface or additional component of right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-4**] 10:06 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-2**] through 10: Minimal edema persists in the left lung.
Large region of consolidation inferior to the central lungs and pleural scarring has not cleared.
Denser right pleural thickening is chronic, but more pronounced today than in [**2124-11-25**].
No pneumothorax.
Additionally, more scattered punctate densities throughout the right and left lung are compatible with calcified pleural plaques as confirmed by the visualized chest portion of the abdominal and pelvic CT from [**2125-2-9**].
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
Right mid and lower lung scarring and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER [**Year (4 digits) **] VEINS Study Date of [**2125-11-5**] IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.
Right apical parenchymal opacity is unchanged in extent.
Minimal left parenchymal scarring.
No evidence of pulmonary edema, a linear lucency at the left lung apex, mimicking a pneumothorax, is in fact outside of the patient.
There is interval resolution of previous pneumocephalus with unchanged right frontal and temporal tip extra-axial fluid collection (measuring 10 or 5 mm in maximal thickness).
While postsurgical subgaleal soft tissue swelling is largely unchanged, there is an increasing fluid collection noted along the right temporal muscle.
In the absence of peripheral enhancement and restricted diffusion, there is no evidence of abcess.
There is restricted diffusion and FLAIR signal abnormality involving the tip of the right temporal ventricle, in keeping with a small area of infarct.
A small focus of hyperintensity on diffusion weighted imaging involving the medial left high frontal lobe is too small to characterize by ADC map and may represent artifact versus a small area of infarct.
No interval change is seen with regard to the homogeneously enhancing mass at the right side of the sella, extending into the right cavernous sinus.
There is persistent encasement of the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery.
Unchanged periventricular and deep white matter FLAIR/T2 signal abnormalities are again noted and likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Previously noted opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells has progressed since the prior.
Interval resolution of pneumocephalus with stable [**Hospital1 **]-hemisperic hygroma as well as right frontal and temporal tip subdural collections.
Acute ischemia involving the tip of right temporal lobe.
A small focus of hyperintensity on diffusion weighted imaging involving the medial left high frontal lobe is too small to characterize by ADC map and may represent artifact versus a small area of infarct.
More prominent fluid collection along the medial aspect of the right temporal muscle that does not demonstrate ring enhancement or restricted diffusion, likely consistent with seroma.
Status post partial resection of suprasellar mass with stable appearance of residual tumor.
EEG [**2125-11-7**] IMPRESSION: This continuous recording shows what appears to be an evolving diffuse encephalopathy.
There were no clear epileptic features.
While there were some asymmetries with either voltage increase on the right or decrease on the left, depending on underlying pathophysiology, no clear epileptic or sustained abnormalities were identified.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-7**] Right mid and lower lung and left lower lung opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia have worsened since [**2125-11-6**].
An coexisting component pulmonary edema is possible.
No other interval changes.
Scarring in the right lower lungs and right apical dense pleural thickening are unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar.
No pneumothorax.
There is bullous disease at the lung bases.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-9**] Extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the right lower lobe, and overlying pleural calcification are longstanding, but previous pulmonary edema in this location has improved if not resolved, leaving behind a small residual right pleural effusion.
The left lung base was relatively clear on [**11-5**] and also developed some edema, which has decreased since [**11-8**].
Given the severe scarring in these lungs, some pneumonia could be present and not appreciated, for example, just projecting over the right hilus, but in the left lung, there is no evidence of pneumonia.
Right pleural thickening is most extensive at the apex and unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
EEG [**11-8**]- [**11-9**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG due to diffuse attenuation and slowing of background consistent with a moderate  encephalopathy.
