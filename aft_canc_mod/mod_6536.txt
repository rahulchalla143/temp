**FINAL REPORT [**2147-6-14**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2147-6-14**]):    No MRSA isolated.
DIAGNOSIS:  Distal esophagus and proximal stomach, esophagogastrectomy:         - High grade glandular dysplasia present in a background of Barrett's esophagus.
- No residual adenocarcinoma identified.
- No malignancy identified in seventeen paraesophageal lymph nodes (0/17).
Note:  High grade glandular dysplasia is present in a background of Barrett's esophagus (slide F).
Some adjacent glands and ducts show atypia consistent with treatment effect.
Proximal and distal surgical margins of resection are negative for dysplasia.
A palpable mass is not present.
The gastroesophageal junction is blocked out in two parts: a proximal block and a distal block.
The blocks are serially sectioned to reveal no residual tumor, there the submucosa is diffusely fibrotic.
The paraesophageal soft tissue and omentum are dissected to reveal no grossly apparent lymph nodes.
Final Report INDICATION: 54-year-old man with rising T belly.
COMPARISON: No previous exam for comparison.
FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty  infiltration.
No focal liver lesion is identified.
There is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.4 cm.

There are no gallstones and the gallbladder is not distended.
No ascites is seen in the lower quadrants.
No gallstones, no biliary dilatation, and no sign of cholecystitis.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Scant trace of ascites in the perihepatic space.
No ascites seen in the lower quadrants.
Esophageal cancer.
Ultrasound and micropuncture set was utilized to gain access to this loop of jejunum.
There were no post-procedural complications.
The right kidney measures 13.1 cm, with no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Moderate ascites is noted.
Moderate ascites.
TECHNIQUE: 5-mm contiguous axial images from the thoracic inlet through the lesser trochanters without IV and with Gastrografin which was injected via the J-tube were obtained.
FINDINGS:  CT THORAX WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis of the posterior lower lobes.
No frank dehiscence of the anastomotic sutures.
No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Mild atherosclerotic disease is seen in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries.
No evidence of pericardial effusion.
There is a single-lead left chest wall cardiac pacemaker with its tip in the right ventricle.
The lack of IV contrast limits the evaluation of the solid parenchymal organs.
Liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and right kidney appear normal.
There is a rounded soft tissue density (29 [**Doctor Last Name **]) lesion in the left renal fossa which contains a peripheral calcification.
This lesion measures 1.8 cm x 1.5 cm and may represent a left kidney remnant.
Oral contrast passes through the nondistended small bowel and colon to the level of the rectum.
No evidence of bowel obstruction or ileus.
No evidence of pneumatosis.
No focal fluid collections or free air.
Moderate atherosclerotic disease is seen in the abdominal aorta which is normal in course and caliber.
No evidence of retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic and lumbar spine.
No evidence of ileus or bowel obstruction.
No frank dehiscence of the gastric pull-through anastomosis.
If there is a clinical suspicion for anastomotic leak, a fluoroscopic study is recommended with water-soluble contrast.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.

No prior studies available for comparison.
A 5 French [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was then advanced into the abdomen, and approximately 1.5 liters of tan-colored ascites was drained, with samples sent to the laboratory as requested.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, without immediate post-procedural complications.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, yielding 1.5 liters of tan-colored ascites.
ESOPHAGRAM DATED [**2147-6-21**]  HISTORY: A 54-year-old male with a history of laparoscopic esophagectomy with prolonged course of intolerance to p.o.
The barium passes through the upper esophagus into the intrathoracic stomach freely with no evidence of constrast extravasation, obstruction or stricture.
IMPRESSION: No extravasation of contrast at the level of the intrathoracic esophagogastric anastamosis.

The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
Stomach:  Contents: Bilious fluid was seen in the stomach body.
Mild resistance was encountered in passing the scope past the pylorus in the duodenum.

On POD 0, overnight, he went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate which was controlled with diltiazem drip.
His urine output was low and unresponsive to significant fluid bolus.
On POD 9 lopressor was increased and on POD 10 he was persistantly tachycardic so a diltiazem drip was started.
Given large JP output and ?
On [**6-1**] he was started on levaquin for presumptive pneumonia.
On [**6-6**] he underwent a renal usg for increased creatinine which was essentialy normal, though he remained distended.
His atrial fibrillation responded well however given his distension he underwent a CT torso which showed a significant amount of ascited.
For the next 2 weeks he had fluctuating levels of nausea and vomiting, which were attributed to ?
Given continued output from his JP drain each time he had a small amount of retching, it was assumed that he had a leak in his esophageal anastamosis, despite a drain study in radiology that had indicated otherwise.
He was noted to have continued bouts of small amounts of emesis vs. regurgitation which sometimes would have increased output in his L neck JP drain.
In this EGD his pyloris was dilated and injected with botox and his symptoms improved signficantly.
He was tolerating his tubefeeds well with minimal regurgitation and no drainage from his neck.
He will be discharged on a soft solid diet with explicit warning about certain signs of collection / fevers.
