Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from an outside hospital where you had been intubated as you were found to have a large tumor compressing your airway and much of your left lung.
You were brought here to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a stent placed in your superior vena cava (SVC) as it had a large clot in it which was preventing blood flow out of your head.
The chemotherapy that you received at the outside hospital has decreased the size of your tumor and your breathing has become much better.
If you have ANY shortness of breath, chest pain, fever or chills, blood in your sputum, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or lightheadedness or any other concerning symptom, please seek medical care immediately.
