His first week of his hospitalization, he required multiple pressors, but did not have any surgical intervention.
He developed progressive renal failure to Cr 3.8 with minimal UOP.
Arrangements were made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of acute severe pancreatitis and renal failure.
Sedated, minimally arousable.
Somewhat dry MM, limited exam of oropharynx Neck: difficult to evaluated JVP given trach and body habitus Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Distant heart sounds; regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: bowel sounds present; distended, somehwat firm GU: foley draining clear urine Ext: warm, pedal edema; no clubbing or cyanosis.
**FINAL REPORT [**2163-10-4**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2163-10-4**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.

Overall, findings are suggestive of focal ileus in the setting of pancreatitis.
This could be further evaluated with abdominal CT if clinically indicated.
CXR [**2163-9-29**] Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, supraclavicular regions and small pneumomediastinum is better seen in subsequent CT of the chest as well as collapse of the left lower lobe and almost complete collapse of the right lower lobe.
There are small right and moderate left pleural effusions.
There are low lung volumes.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema extending throughout the cervical soft tissues, superiorly to the face and inferiorly through the pectoralis and paraspinal musculature.
Aside from the entry site of the tracheostomy, no obvious source for air leak is identified.
Limited views of the abdomen demonstrate ascites, anasarca, mesenteric fat stranding as well as right renal and adrenal lesions.
Further evaluation with dedicated abdominal imaging is recommended.
No hydronephrosis seen in the right kidney.
Note is made that this is an extremely limited ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus and the patient's inability to position for the examination.
Within the limitations of non contrast administration, no discrete loculated drainable fluid collections are identified.
Extensive stranding and fluid demonstrated in the region of the pancreas compatible with known clinical diagnosis of severe pancreatitis.
Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreatic neck can either represent interdigitating fluid or necrosis.
Moderate amount of simple intra-abdominal ascites.
Small right and moderate left pleural effusion.
Bibasilar right greater than left atelectasis.
Multiple scattered renal lesions, some of which represent hyderdense cysts, though some demonstrate increased complexity such as a 3.3 x 2.4 cm exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney.
This may represent a solid renal mass or a lesion with sequella from chronic hemorrhage.
Again, [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale images are of nondiagnostic quality.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited study due to patient body habitus and extensive lower limb edema.
On the images obtained there is no evidence of thrombus in lower extremity.
[**2163-10-1**] CT abd INDICATION: 74-year-old male with pancreatitis and persistent fevers.
Evaluate for focal fluid collections.
EXAMINATION: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast.
TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of oral contrast only.
Intravenous contrast was deferred secondary to impaired renal function.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  There is a small left and moderate right pleural effusion.
There is associated bibasilar atelectasis with increasing right lower lobe atelectasis since [**2163-9-30**].
There is a 6.0 x 4.1 cm well-marginated oval mass centered within the right adrenal gland that demonstrates both punctate calcifications and macroscopic fat compatible with an adrenal myelolipoma.
There are multiple scattered hypodensities and hyperdensities seen throughout both kidneys, likely representing a combination of simple and hyperdense cysts.
However, exophytically arising from the lower pole of the left kidney, there is a 3.3 x 2.4 cm lesion that measures higher attenuation than simple fluid and demonstrates several punctate calcifications.
In the region of the pancreas, there is extensive stranding and fluid compatible with clinically known diagnosis of pancreatitis.
Portions of the pancreas demonstrate some heterogenity in the neck which either may represent interdigitated fluid or necrosis.
There are no discrete loculated drainable fluid collections identified.
The visualized portions of intra-abdominal small and large bowel are unremarkable.

Bibasilar right greater than left atelectasis.
Multiple scattered renal lesions, some of which represent hyderdense cysts, though some demonstrate increased complexity such as a 3.3 x 2.4 cm exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney.
This may represent a solid renal mass or a lesion with sequella from chronic hemorrhage.
CT chest, abd [**2163-10-3**] FINDINGS:  CHEST: Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are similar in size to [**10-1**].
Moderate left and small right dependent atelectasis is also stable.

No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy is present.
Extensive peripancreatic stranding is visualized consistent with pancreatitis, with extension along the anterior pararenal fascia bilaterally, more markedly on the left.
The pancreatic head enhances normally, but only minimal enhancing pancreatic tissue is seen in the body and tail, consistent with pancreatic necrosis.
No discrete rim-enhancing fluid collection is identified although a loculated collection of fluid about the greater curvature of the stomach is consistent with a developing pseudocyst.
The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation is present.
A 6 x 4 cm marginated oval mass centered within the right adrenal gland again demonstrates punctate calcifications and macroscopic fat compatible with an adrenal myelolipoma.
Scattered hypodensities and hyperdensities are seen within both kidneys likely representing a combination of simple and hyperdense cyst.
An exophytic lesion arising from the lower pole of the left kidney measures 3 x 2.4 cm, measures higher attenuation than simple fluid and demonstrates several punctate calcifications.

Stable small right and moderate left pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Moderate ascites is unchanged.
Complex exophytic left lower pole renal lesion which should be evaluated with MRI when patient is clinically stable.
Incidentally noted right adrenal myelolipoma which can be evaluated at time of follow up MRI or within 6 months.
Small left lower lobe subpleural nodule which should be evaluated on follow-up imaging.
Compared to the film from the prior day there is no significant interval change.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 74-year-old man with necrotizing pancreatitis, C. diff infection, weaned off sedation, poor mental status, like to evaluate for toxic megacolon versus pancreatic pseudocyst.
The left pleural effusion measuring simple fluid is approximately stable in size.
There is a small amount of pleural fluid on the right.
A subpleural nodular opacity at the left base measuring approximately 5 mm is unchanged (2:4).
There is also a 5 mm nodular opacity at the right base (2:3).
Extensive coronary artery calcifications are noted.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The lack of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the solid parenchymal organs.
There is no evidence of toxic megacolon.
A non-distended portion of transverse colon demonstrates bowel wall thickening.
There is low attenuation of a portion of the head, the entire neck and body and a portion of the tail of the pancreas.
Low-density corresponds to areas of necrosis demonstrated on prior contrast-enhanced examination.
There is also a moderate degree of ascites in the abdomen and pelvis which measures simple fluid.
Again visualized is a stable-appearing loculated collection of fluid around the greater curvature of the stomach likely representing a developing pseudocyst.
This measures approximately 10.9 x 4.4 x 6.6 cm in AP, transverse and craniocaudal dimensions respectively.
There are no new obvious areas of loculated fluid collection.
The kidneys demonstrate multiple lesions bilaterally some of which represent simple cysts and some complicated cysts (hemorrhage or containing proteinaceous material).
However, there is an exophytic lesion arising from the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 2.6 x 3.4 cm.
Anterior to this is a low-density exophytic lesion measuring 1.8 x 1.8 cm with calcification in the rim of the lesion.
Again demonstrated is the 5.6 x 3.8 cm right adrenal gland lesion with areas of fat.
There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy.

Moderate ascites.
Complex exophytic left lower pole renal lesion and adjacent cystic lesion with calcification in the rim.
Incidentally noted probable right adrenal myelolipoma may also be assessed at time of MRI.
5 mm lower lobe nodular opacities may relate to inflammatory changes and should be followed on subsequent imaging.
Final Report INDICATION: 74-year-old man with necrotizing pancreatitis, poor mental status after weaning sedation.
Mild periventricular hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
His course there was complicated by C diff and worsening renal failure.
# Pancreatitis:Acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
The patient continued to have fever and abdominal distension upon transfer, although bladder pressures remained <30 cmH2O.
CT abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] showed severe pancreatic necrosis, extensive stranding and fluid around the pancreas but no discrete drainable fluid collections.
The hospital course was characterized by overall progressive clinical decline, with escalating mechanical ventilator requirement, hypoxemia, escalating vasopressor needs, progressive acidosis despite continue renal dialysis, rising lactic acidosis and rising WBC.
Upon discontinuation of vasopressors and dialysis, the patient quietly and peacefully passed away on [**2163-10-8**] at 4pm.
# Fevers: Persistnet fevers attributed predominately to underlying acute pancreatitis, although several infectious sources also identified.
Pt has been treated for C diff (C Diff + on [**2163-9-18**]).
Pt not tolerating being off wall suction, so continuing IV Flagyl, bladder pressures remained elevated (26 this AM).
Con't IV vanc given concern for catheter tip infection and small area of right foot concerning for cellulitis.
Patient was started on oral vanc on [**10-5**] once residuals in gut had decreased given concern for untreated cdiff with rising leukocytosis.
Pt now has gross volume overload likely compromising respiratory status.
Restrictive physiology of abdominal distention is likely contributing.
Pt was started on CVVH for fluid removal.
# Anemia: Possible sites of acute drop, either bleed in the belly or retroperitoneum vs. hemolysis.
Worsening metabolic acidosis and volume overload; transferred here to initaite CVVH.
Concern for a component of obstruction given debris in foley catheter tip, but no hydronephrosis on US and no improvement in Cr after foley changed.
Rigid bronch scope with switched trach (fenestrated replaced) on [**2163-9-30**] by IP.
# Kidney masses:  Incidentally noted 3.3 x 2.4 cm exophytically arising lesion from the lower pole of the left kidney and 6.0 x 4.1 cm adrenal myelolipoma on the right seen on abd CT. these had also been noted on OSh imaging.
