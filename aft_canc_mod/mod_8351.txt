He had increasing shortness of breath and fatigue.
He had stopped eating and was not taking any of his medications.
However, his caregiver had noticed occational cough with blood tinged sputum of uncertain amounts.
The patient went to dialysis today but was noted to be dyspneic and short of breath.

Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but there has been improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema.
Residual airspace opacities remain more prominent in the right lower lobe than the left, and likely represent asymmetric edema although a coexisting pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
Radiodensity overlying the upper mediastinum is reportedly related to prior vertebroplasty procedure.
AV fistula ultrasound [**3-8**]:  Patent left upper arm arteriovenous fistula without thrombus.
**TTE [**2198-3-8**]:** The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-1-23**], the findings are similar, although regionality of LV dysfunction is less apparent on today study - LV systolic dysfunction now looks global.
CXR [**3-15**]: As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided pulmonary opacities appear less dense but more widespread than on the previous examination.
In the interval, the retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly increased in extent.
Otherwise, the radiographic appearance is unchanged, there is no evidence of pleural effusion.
There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with subtle signs of overhydration, in unchanged manner, radiopaque material projects over the trachea.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year-old M with ESRD on HD, CAD, metastatic poorly differentiated cancer (likely NSCLC), s/p vertebroplasty presenting with acute respiratory failure.
Brief MICU course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which appeared to be subacute process over several days.
Symptoms were thought to be related to fluid overload given that the patient missed dialysis on day of admission and CXR was most consistent with pulmonary edema.
(There was a question of a RML infiltrate, but the patient had no F/C or cough with only mild leukocytosis.)
The patient symptoms resolved after HD, and he was transferred to the floor in stable condition with breathing at baseline (2L O2 for comfort).
UTI: The patient developed fevers and leukocytosis after his transfer to the floor.
He was initially treated with vancomycin for possible coagulase negative staph bacteremia.
He had signs of fluid overload on CXR, and responded well to HD, as above.
CAD: The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI.
As above, the patient was ruled out for acute MI with stable EKG and cardiac enzymes.
HTN: The patient was continued on home antihypertensives with no acute issues.
ESRD: The patient was continued on HD on M/W/F schedule with no acute issues.
His Phoslo (Calcium acetate) was stopped because of hypercalcemia, most likely due to his underlying malignancy.
Metastatic NSCLC: The patient has metastatic NSCLC with metastases to bone.
Vertebral fractures: The patient has a history of C2 fracture s/p C1-C3 fusion and T4 compression fracture s/p vertebroplasty.
Pain: Mostly in his neck secondary to the pathologic fractures.
The patient's oxycontin and oxycodone were increased to improve his pain control.
DVT: The patient was continued on coumadin, which was briefly held on admission for supratherapeutic INR.
Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, most likely [**1-6**] renal disease.
Hct remained at baseline of 28-30 with no evidence of bleeding.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Oxycodone 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for Pain: hold if patient is sedated or RR < 10.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis:  Respiratory Failure Secondary Diagoses:  End Stage Renal Disease, Urinary Tract Infection, Metastatic Lung Cancer, Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure, Coronary Artery Disease, History of DVT on anticoagulation   Discharge Condition: Breathing improved with sat's in 90s on room air to 2L by nasal cannula.
You also were found to have a urinary tract infection.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop fevers greater than 101F, difficulty breathing, chest pain, shaking chills, or any other concerning symptom.
