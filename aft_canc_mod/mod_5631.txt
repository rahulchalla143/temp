There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although the right costophrenic angle has been excluded, partially from the study.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 66M h/o antiphospholipid syndrome on anticoagulation (held for past 5 days), s/p dental procedure p/w one day of hematemesis.
Hematemesis: He presents w/ hematemesis s/p tooth extraction.
He received 2 units FFP and 10mg IV Vitamin K. He was likely supratherapeutic prior to procedure, leading to increased blood loss and failure of hemostasis at extraction sites.
He was mentating well and hemodynamically stable throughout stay, although sinus bradycardia and SBP 90-100 while sleeping (increasing while awake).
Had EGD on [**2-27**], which failed to reveal an upper GI source of bleeding.
Leukocytosis with bandemia: Resolved.
He has been afebrile, with no complaints.
Bandemia resolved by second blood draw.
Likely secondary to transient bacteremia in setting of tooth extraction.
No dysuria, no evidence of UTI on UA.
He has no cough or dyspnea.
Acute renal failure: Improved with IV fluids.
Unclear baseline Cr, but decreased to 1.3 on day of discharge.
Likely pre-renal in the setting of poor PO intake and hematemesis.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hematemesis Leukocytosis Acute kidney injury Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for bleeding from your gums after your dental procedure, which was treated with stitches and holding your Coumadin.
An endoscopy showed that the bleeding was not coming from your stomach.
