She underwent EGD and colonoscopy on [**11-7**] (reports above) when a L colon mass was found and biopsies taken.
It was decided to perform a splenectomy to avoid possible bleeding complications.
Post-operatively she was taken to the PACU and remained there overnight for increased monitoring giving the amount of intraoperative blood loss and her age/comorbidities.
Secondary to altered mental status (sedation and then agitation) as well as decreased respiratory drive and continued O2 requirement, she was transferred from the PACU to the Trauma Surgical ICU.
The patient experienced delerium on transfer to the ICU which she gradually recovered from over the following days, returning to her baseline mental status.
Therefore a CT of the chest was performed to confirm this diagnosis(without contrast given reports of prior adverse reaction), which did not show any pulmonary infarct, but did show a RLL pneumonia.
Zosyn was started empirically for nosocomial pneumonia.
On [**11-16**] the patient was transferred to the surgical floor, however on [**11-18**] she went into rapid a-fib with some hemodynamic instability (mild hypotension).
The patient expericenced a 4 second pause in cardiac rhythm and relative hypotension and so was transferred back to the ICU for rate control by diltiazem drip and beta blockade.
She remained in a-fib, and given the patient's desire to avoid anticoagulation, as well as her fall risk, it was decided by the surgical and cardiology teams not to have the patient on anti-coagulation except aspirin.
Of note, the patient does have a history of paroxysmal AF, for which she had refused anticoagulation previously.
She was therefore discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] for acute rehabilitation on the afternoon of [**11-23**].
GI was consulted on [**11-4**] for GI bleed and recommended protonix, transfusion with goal HCT >30 and EGD and colonoscopy which were performed [**11-7**].
Pre-operative course issues: Melena: The Patient presented with 4-day h/o melena with diarrhea, lightheadiness and abdominal pain.
This was c/w with upper GI bleeding even though NG lavage was negatvie in.
She was not tachycardic or hypotensive.
She had a EDG done wich showed gastritis and a submucosal lesion in the mid-esophagus.
Colonoscopy revealed two polyps and a malignant appearing mass at 45 cm.
There was no active bleeding identified.
Lightheadedness: The patients's lightheadiness started at the same time she noticed melena and diarrhea.
Her lightheadedness was unchanged throughout the pre-operative portion of her hospital stay.
She had no orthostatics.
There was suspicion for pancreatitis given slightly elevated amylase and lipase, however there was no clinical or radiographic evidence.
She was on telemtry with no concerning changes.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine was 1.5 on admission, which was baseline.
Diabetes mellitus type 2: Her Blood sugars were in the range of 80-200.
She had mild hypoglycemic symptoms after being NPO for her procedure.
Medications on Admission: - Docusate Sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] as needed for constipation.
Gastritis 2.
Anemia 3. adenocarcinoma of the colon 4. splenectomy Secondary diagnoses: 1.
Chronic renal insufficiency 2.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 3.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: good.
Pain well controlled on oral medications.
-Please call the doctor if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER for any of the following: * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
* New or worsening cough or wheezing.
* If you are vomitting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomitting, diarrhea or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or is changing location or moving to your chest or  back.
* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 101.5 (F) degrees or 38(C) degrees.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had evidence of blood in your stool and had abdominal pain and light-headedness.
Based on the endoscopy you were diagnosed with mild gastritis (inflammation in the stomach) which was most likely the cause of your bleeding.
This mass was removed with the left part of your colon and it showed adenocarcinoma.
