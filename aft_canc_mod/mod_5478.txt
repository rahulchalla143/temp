1) Pain: Most likely related to metastatic spread from small cell lung cancer.
2) Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.5, but on admission elevated to 1.8 and increased to 2.6 during admission.
In setting of anasarca and liver dysfunction, most likely decreased renal perfusion.
Indicative of infection, with concern on CT chest for left lower lobe pneumonia.
Declined placement of central venous line.
White count remained slightly elevated, but results difficult to interpret given oral steroids for pain relief.
4) Shortness of breath: Patient with history of PE and DVTs while on coumadin.
No IVC thrombus detected on CT abdomen and pelvis.
IVC filter placed on [**5-19**], as coumadin was stopped as concern for intracranial bleed in setting of metastases.
-Cardiac enzymes negative.
No evidence of pericardial effusion on chest CT. .
5) Weakness: Increased weakness on days prior to admission.
Most likely due to decreased PO intake.
No evidence of new metastatic foci in brain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of Greater [**Location (un) 86**]/AKA [**Hospital1 11485**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -Metasatic small cell lung cancer -Acute renal failure -Respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: Expired.
