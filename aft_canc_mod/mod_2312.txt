The patient is a 67-year-old female who had been bed-ridden for two years who presented to an outside hospital with hematemesis of bright red blood with a hematocrit drop from 34 to 18.
Here, she got an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed grade III esophageal varices which were banded.
She has had no hematemesis since then during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.
The patient had been bed-ridden for two and a half years because she initially had a lower extremity fracture that caused her increased pain, and she had decided not to walk on this lower extremity fracture and heal it by remaining in bed and had remained in bed since for the next two years.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient complained of pain in her legs that mostly began on ambulance transfer to the stretcher.
She was found to have a distal right femur fracture and bilateral proximal tibial fractures that were both impacted and not healed and a question of their age.
The patient began to have atrial fibrillation during this admission which was well rate controlled on her propanolol 10 mg p.o.
She was not anticoagulated because of her bleeding history.
The patient also was found to have a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in the Medical Intensive Care Unit after bronchoalveolar lavage was done which grew out this methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.
She was also found to have a right-sided lung mass of 5 cm, and bronchoalveolar lavage of this lung mass did show atypical cells consistent with non-small-cell lung cancer.
She did have non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and apparently a history of alcohol use; which she quit 15 years ago.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Her medications prior to admission were a question of large nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use for her lower extremity pain.
She has an 80-pack-year tobacco history and quit 15 years ago along with a question of a history of alcohol abuse which came with the patient in her records, but was denied by the patient and family.
Alert, not oriented, and in no acute distress.
Sclerae were anicteric with dry mucous membranes.
The neck with inaccessible jugular venous distention.
The chest revealed poor air movement with wheezes bilaterally and anteriorly.
First heart sound and second heart sound.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was obese, nontender and nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.
No appreciable ascites and a nonpalpable liver and spleen.
Extremities had 2+ pitting edema in the right lower extremity and trace pitting edema in the left lower extremity.
Both lower extremities were grossly malformed with multiple ulcers on her lower extremities.
She had a sacral pressure sore noted by nursing.
She had a weak left arm, and her lower extremity strength was not assessed secondary to her leg fractures.
Her skin showed no rashes.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Her electrocardiogram from [**6-8**] showed low voltage and a question of chaotic atrial rhythm.
She had an echocardiogram that showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
She had an abdominal CT which showed positive ascites, a positive cirrhotic liver, and a 7-mm liver mass.
A chest x-ray on [**6-14**] showed the nasogastric tube placed post pylorically with a left lower lobe atelectasis.
A chest CT on [**6-3**] showed right lower lobe consolidation, left basilar atelectasis, and ascites.
There was a 5-cm mass in the right lower lobe.
Hip and femur films from [**6-14**] showed distal right femur fracture and bilateral proximal tibial fractures.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, This is a 67-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis with grade III esophageal varices who had been bed-ridden for two years who presented to an outside hospital and subsequently transferred for a variceal bleed.
She subsequently got a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and was found to have multiple old and new lower extremity fractures.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had no further episodes of variceal bleeds up to this point.
Question of the cause of her cirrhosis; alcoholic versus perhaps NAS.
She had a negative hepatitis serologies as well.
At that time, her nasogastric tube was removed and it showed some ulceration, so another nasogastric tube was not replaced.
for variceal bleed and portal hypertension prophylaxis.
On [**6-17**], it was noted that the patient started to have an increased abdominal girth and the presence of a fluid wave.
On [**6-18**], she was noted to have gained about three pounds of weight and had increased abdominal girth and had increased peripheral edema.
This was most likely due to her cirrhosis, and she was given some diuresis with Lasix with good results.
She was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells to draw some of the interstitial fluid into her intravascular space.
ORTHOPAEDIC:  The patient had been bed-ridden for two years after confining herself to the bed because of pain in her previously fractured leg.
Apparently, she has treated other fractures in this way by treating them herself by bed rest.
After this two years of bed-rest the patient is severely osteopenic and osteoporotic and his being given calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D.  The pain from her fractures is currently managed by morphine.
She was intubated for most of the time in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and did present with apparently some degree of hepatic encephalopathy.
This improved throughout her hospitalization, and when she was transferred to the floor, she did respond to questioning and did not have fluctuations in her degree of consciousness and did not have asterixis.
It is unknown if this is a change in her mental status at this current time or if this has been her mental status all along in the recent past, but without her ability to speak it was just unknown.
The patient may be suffering from delirium secondary to her medications such as morphine or maybe having increased encephalopathy secondary to cirrhosis, or maybe at a new baseline status post her prolonged illness and hospital course.
During her time of relative hypotension, she had no symptoms related to the hypotension and no electrocardiogram changes.
The patient had a new onset of atrial fibrillation on this admission; question if this was secondary to hypoxia with the pneumonia.
The patient is mostly auto anticoagulated from her cirrhosis and will not be anticoagulated for embolic prophylaxis.
There is no evidence of ischemia or cardiomyopathy on the cardiac workup this patient had.
ONCOLOGY:  The patient was found to have a lung mass at the right base; which upon workup with bronchoalveolar lavage was found to most likely a non-small-cell lung cancer.
The patient's family at the current time did not want the patient to be aware of this diagnosis and does not want any further workup of her lung cancer.
She also has a small mass on her cirrhotic liver that is of unknown etiology.
RENAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 43244**] has had decreased urine output from her time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
It was thought that her renal function is normal at this time, and her oliguria is most likely a result of decreased effective circulating volume from her cirrhosis.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient initially could not take orals because of a failed swallow study on [**6-14**].
On [**6-18**], she was evaluated by the team for her swallowing function, and she had shown a good improvement in her ability to speak.
She was given small sips of water and swallowed these without problems, or aspiration, or coughing.
Her volume status has been difficult to control secondary to her cirrhosis.
She is more recently, with her continued lower urine output than input from intravenous fluids and oral intake, began to be having increased ascites and lower extremity edema.
WOUND CARE:  The patient has small ulcers on her legs which are healing well.
She is currently being seen by Wound Care for sacral pressure sores.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has a anemia which is likely secondary to her loss of blood that was not fully replaced during her gastrointestinal bleed, and she also has anemia of chronic disease.
Multiple lower extremity fractures.
Atrial fibrillation.
