# widely metastatic gastric cancer - patient has been evaluated by surgery and is not a surgical candidate.
He was seen by Heme-Onc during his last hospitalization and scheduled for outpt follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for palliative chemo options (Has not yet seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# abd distension -  Initial concern for ileus on admission, however, no evidence of ileus on admission.
His abdominal distension was from large ascites.
He had a paracentesis with 3.5L amber colored drainage (some blood so from malignant ascites from peritoneal carcinomatosis).
# Tachycardia - Resolved the night of admit with paracentesis of 3.5L, reinstitution of metoprolol and fluid bolus of 1L.
Thus, likely resultant from hypovolemia, increased abdominal pressure and b-blocker withdrawal.
No note of tachycardia on his last discharge, EKG on [**9-23**] w/ HR 95.
# Wheezing - has asthma and emphysema.
Patient denies feeling short of breath.
Abdominal ascites may have been contributing to taking rapid breaths and wheezing.
# Hyponatremia - IMPROVED, although seen on last hospitalization.
Volume status consistent with hypovolemia.
# HTN - RESOLVED.
