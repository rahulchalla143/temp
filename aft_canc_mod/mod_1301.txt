That morning, he had a fall at home and hit the right side of the head, no LOC.
Past Medical History: Primary melanoma in [**2105**] with right axillary dissection and radiation - discontinued due to R arm swelling.

Speech was slurred, slight dysarthria, but was fluent, no paraphasic errors, no anomia, no evidence of neglect, apraxia.
CN: pupils [**3-1**] b/l to light, VFF to confrontation, EOMI w/ significant R-beating nystagmus on lateral gaze, facial sensation intact, smile symmetric, hearing intact b/l, palate symmetric, tongue midline.
Motor: increased tone b/l at LE, significant swelling of the R arm, strength full throughout Reflexes: normal throughout, toes flexion b/l Coordination: significant dysmetria w/ b/l arms and legs on FNF testing and on HTS testing Sensation: intact to light touch and pinprick throughout Gait: not tested  On Discharge: Expired   Pertinent Results: [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   PT-46.0* PTT-33.0 INR(PT)-4.9* [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   PLT COUNT-156 [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   NEUTS-89.7* LYMPHS-6.3* MONOS-3.7 EOS-0.1 BASOS-0.1 [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   WBC-5.8 RBC-3.99* HGB-11.0* HCT-33.4* MCV-84 MCH-27.7 MCHC-33.1 RDW-15.0 [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   cTropnT-0.02* [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   estGFR-Using this [**2118-10-3**] 08:33AM   GLUCOSE-321* UREA N-32* CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-131* POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-97 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-16  CTA Head and Neck [**2118-10-3**] 1.
Right cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhagic lesion, better seen on the recent non-contrast head CT. No evidence of underlying AVM or aneurysm.
This could represent a parenchymal hematoma in the setting of the patient's anticoagulated status or a metastasis from his melanoma.
No cervical spine fracture.
Extensive degenerative changes.
Post-radiation/post-surgical changes in the right lung apex and right axilla partially visualized.
Local mass effect as described, with leftward shift of the right cerebellar hemisphere and concern for early tonsillar herniation.
Differential diagnosis includes traumatic injury, hemorrhagic metastatic disease given history of melanoma or vascular abnormality.
Low lung volumes somewhat limit evaluation as well as slight patient rotation to the right.
Old healed right lower rib fractures are again noted.
No acute fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic injuries evident.
Nodular area of enhancement along the lateral margin of the large infratentorial hemorrhage is suggestive of an underlying mass, compatible with metastatic disease.
New small focus of hemorrhage in the left anterior inferior cerebellar hemisphere.
New supratentorial subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sylvian fissures and the occipital sulci.
Intraventricular hemorrhage.
CT head [**2118-10-4**]  Compared to [**10-3**] head CT, increased size and distribution of right cerebellar hemorrhage with increased surrounding edema and mass effect; however, lesion is stable compared to more recent MRI.
Doppler US [**2118-10-4**]: No new acute deep vein thrombosis identified.
A single tiny venous structure identified in the region of the subclavian represents either collateral flow or is extremely diminutive vessel lumen.
[**10-5**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Decreased size of right cerebellar hemorrhage with decreased associated mass effect and reestablished patency of the fourth ventricle.
New post-operative extra-axial pneumocephalus and air within pre-existent clot cavity.
[**10-6**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
Similar size of right cerebellar hemorrhage.
Bilateral frontoparietal and occipital subarachnoid hemorrhage which appears similar.
Interval worsening in the obstructive hydrocephalus.
Stable bilateral frontal, parietal, and occipital subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Stable right cerebellar hemorrhage with slight redistribution of blood due to positioning.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 953**] was admitted to SICU under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] on [**2118-10-3**] for evaluation of Right cerebellar hemorrhage.
He had an MRI on the evening on [**10-4**] which revealed tumor, presumed to be metastatic melanoma.
Biopsy and aspiration was performed without complication.
Post op head CT revealed residual hematoma but significant evacuation and decompression of 4th ventricle.
He was transferred to ICU for close neurological observation.
The family was updated and plan was to place EVD if hydrocephalus were to worsen vs. no intervention if hemorrhage were to worsen.
