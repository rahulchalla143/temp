Admission Date:  [**2192-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-5-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 69-year-old man with CAD s/p MI [**12**] years ago, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and poorly differentiated metastatic squamous cell lung cancer who was discharged from the OMED service yesterday after an admission for hemoptysis and jaw pain, during which he was found to have a large left pleural effusion thought to be malignant in etiology and s/p therapeutic thoracentesis yesterday during which only 500cc of fluid was removed, who went on to develop chest pain and diaphoresis at 3am overnight.
He awoke with this pain and diaphoresis and was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ED where he was noted to be in A-fib w/ RVR and hypotensive.
In the ED here he continued to have chest pain and diaphoresis, and was hypotensive to the 70s, so he cardioverted at 7am with 100J into NSR.
CXR showed worsening of his effusion from yesterday, and CTA showed no PE but did show a left hilar mass with new collapse of the left main bronchus and LLL > LUL atelectasis, as well as larger metastatic masses compared with CT [**2192-4-8**].
On arrival to the CCU, patient chest pain free and in sinus rhythm in the 70's.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CAD s/p MI [**12**]+ years ago, not on aspirin -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: none -PACING/ICD: none 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: s/p tonsillectomy poorly differentiated squamous cell lung cancer with metastases to the adrenals, brain, and soft tissue  Social History: The patient lives at home with his wife.
Physical Exam: Vitals - 97.6, 130/74, 85, 20, 94%2L Eyes: EOMI, PERRL, conjunctiva clear, noninjected, anicteric, no  exudate ENT: Moist, a 1.5 x 2 cm fixed nodule over the R maxilla adjacent to the R ear, nontender Neck: No JVD, no LAD, no thyromegaly, no carotid bruits Cardiovascular: RRR, nl S1/S2, no m/r/g Respiratory: RLL basalar crackles, decreased [**Month/Day (2) 1440**] sounds entire left lung Gastrointestinal: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds Musculoskeletal/Extremities: no clubbing, no cyanosis, no joint  swelling, 1+ pitting BL ankles, L>R, noted chronic skin scaling leison non-infected over R ankle Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, ambulating to the bathroom  Integument: a 5 cm x 7 cm hard purpuric, blanching nodule (fixed) noted to the right of the midline of the upper thoracic  vertebrae Psychiatric: appropriate, pleasant Hematological/Lymphatic: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary,  or inguinal lymphadenopathy palpable   Pertinent Results: Imaging: ======= Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2192-5-2**] at 2:35:18 PM      FINAL The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall and mid inferolateral wall.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Increased PCWP  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2192-5-2**] 6:46 AM Left lobe remains collapsed, extent of a left pleural abnormality has increased since [**2192-5-1**] suggesting bleeding or infection in the setting of extensive intrathoracic malignancy involving the lung, hilus, pleural space and probably the mediastinum.
Enlargement of the mediastinal contour since [**2192-4-8**] may reflect pericardial effusion.
Right pleural thickening is longstanding, and probably not malignant.
Left hilar masses have progressed to now cause obliteration of the left main bronchus, with associated collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula as well as atelectasis in the left upper lobe.
Dominant left lower lobe mass is again noted.
Small left pleural effusion is slightly increased.
Size of multiple metastatic lesions including left axillary and posterior chest wall soft tissue masses as well as right adrenal and bilateral pleural nodules are all increased in size.
No pulmonary embolism is seen.
Cytology: ======== NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Night of discharge, patient presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with chest pain and diaphoresis A-fib w/ RVR and hypotensive.
No history of Afib with RVR, cardioverted.
Found to have NSTEMI given statin.
No change in shortness of [**Hospital3 1440**], continues to have same oxygen requirement.
Patient s/p bronch APC for hemopytysis, XRT for R jaw met, Patient started XRT to lung and as resumed minimal hemoptysis.
Patient is a 69 year old male with metastatic poorly differentiated squamous lung ca with multiple mets and L main bronchus obliteration on carboplatin/taxol C1D1 [**4-25**],  who on night of most recent discharge after thoracentesis, had acute CP and was found to be in afib with RVR.
He sustained an NSTEMI and was put on high dose statin.
# SCHF - secondary to repeat NSTEMI now with ventricular wall focal hypokinesis.
Patient initially started on Lasix, which was discontinued upon discharge given mild hypotension and euvolemia.
# CAD: Now s/p NSTEMI.
No ASA since large necrotic lung mass and scant hemoptysis.
Patient changed from atenolol with sotalol and was given statin and no further antiplatelet therapy given large risk for bleeding and hemoptysis.
# Anemia: Normocytic, stable, likely of chronic disease in setting of malignancy .
Oncologic: # Neutropenic / Pancytopenic- No fever at this time.
Patient became neutropenic, as expected, while in house and was given Neupogen for stimlation.
He was transiently on levofloxacin for neutropenic fever, which was subsequently discontinued after 48 hours with no fevers and negative micro .
# Poorly differentiated metastatic squamous lung cancer - He has  metastasis to the adrenals, brain and soft tissue (jaw & back).
# Pain control - Secondary to Metastatic R temporal leison - from poorly differentiated squamous lung ca s/p local XRT.
Patient also from superficial midline thoracic back metatasis.
No new neurologic symptoms.
Patient's pain was well controlled upon discharge.
