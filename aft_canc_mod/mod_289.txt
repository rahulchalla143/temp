Dual-lead AICD device is again noted with lead tips extending into the right atrium and right ventricle.
There is slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with lucency below the right hemidiaphragm, which could reflect air-filled bowel below the right hemidiaphragm, though pneumoperitoneum cannot be excluded.
There is relative increased opacity at the left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia.
No pneumothorax is present.
Atherosclerotic calcifications along the thoracic aorta are noted.
Please correlate clinically and with left lateral decubitus views of the abdomen to further assess as indicated.
Increased opacity at the left lung base could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
There is no definite sign of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No definite signs of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
- CT Head: There is no hemorrhage or major acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is no edema, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent in size and configuration, likely due to age-related global atrophy.
Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities are likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Bilateral calcified atherosclerosis are noted in the carotid siphons.
BONE WINDOWS: There is no concerning lesion for metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial abnormality.
In the setting of continued clinical concern, MRI is more sensitive for metastatic disease evaluation.
[**2116-10-13**] - Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular global hypokinesis.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Extensive vascular calcification noted in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries.
There are new small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
The right upper lobe mass has decreased in size from 2 x 1.7 cm to 1.9 x 0.8 cm.
The bulky right paratracheal and right hilar lymphadenopathy has decreased in size, this previously measured approximately 2.3 x 4.1 cm but now measures 2.2 x 1.7 cm cyst.
This may account for the appearance of a pneumoperitoneum on the chest x-ray.
No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
No free fluid.
Calcification of the abdominal aorta noted with a 3.3 x 3.6 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm seen.
The urinary bladder and rectum are unremarkable in appearance.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.
No free fluid.
A fat-filled left inguinal hernia.
- OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative joint disease is noted throughout the lumbar spine with anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and mild scoliosis convex to the left.
No concerning lytic or sclerotic bony lesions seen.
Extensive vascular calcifications throughout the visualized aorta, common iliac and femoral vessels as well as the coronary vessels.
No pneumoperitoneum, large bowel loop extending anteriorly between the dome of the diaphragm and the liver, known as Chilaiditi's syndrome and a normal variant.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.6 cm, right common iliac artery aneurysm measures 3.5 cm.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
[**2116-10-14**] - Bilater LENIS: IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis involving the right or left lower extremity.
[**2116-10-20**] - Penile u/s (prelim): hypoechoic 1.7x0.9x0.8 superficial penile lesion at base of penis, likely post-radiation effect though penile mets cannot be formallly excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old male with a CAD, CHF, and metastatic small cell lung cancer presents with hypotension, cough with thick sputum production as well as reported hemoptysis.
# Hypotension:  Initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of poor PO intake.
Upon transfer to the floor after 1 day in the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt did well, but did trigger twice for hypotension on the floor the evening of [**10-16**] and [**10-17**] which was fluid responsive.
We felt this was unlikely to be septic shock, and PE was considered but given clincal stability and stable O2 sats this was not felt to be likely.
Echo did not show right heart strain but did note some pHTN.
# Cough/sputum production:  Likely pneumonia vs viral URI in the setting of his small cell lung cancer.
He was noted to have a choking episode on [**10-17**] while eating with associated coughing.
# Metastatic small cell lung cancer.
Possibly contributing to recent chest pain and SOB with possibly hemoptysis.
# Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation:  Has underlying restrictive lung disease.
[**Month (only) 116**] have increased dead space secondary to atelectasis, possible PE, or possible hypoventilation.
# Chronic systolic CHF.
Persantine MIBI in [**2109**] showed global hypokinesis with LVEF 40%.
Echo was repeated to evaluate for the heart function, which showed persistent poor function of 35-40%.
# Acute on chronic renal failure, most likely pre-renal azotemia due to poor PO intake and insensible losses through vomiting as suggested by urine lytes.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have a small component of obstructive process given urinary retention and prostate cancer s/p TURP and radiation proctitis.
His Cr improved, but noted to have urinary retention of 600cc on [**10-18**].
Foley was difficult to place likely [**12-24**] to his history of prostate surgery, so this was not done.
He was switched to an insulin sliding scale with diabetic diet.
His anti-hypertensives were initially held given hypotension on presentation.
Likely from anemia of chronic inflammation.
There was history of GI bleeding, but while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he did not have any active signs of bleeding.
# Penile lesion:  Pt was noted to have a 1cm nodal lesion at the penile base.
Clinical apperance most consistent with a sbaceous cyst.
The study was performed, which showed a superficial lesion, likely a post-radiation effect, however penile metastatic disease cannot be formally ruled out.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital  for Continued Medical Care [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pneumonia Hypotension Urinary retention  Secondary diagnosis: Metastatic small cell lung cancer Chronic systolic CHF DMII CAD/HL Dysphagia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for low blood pressure and breathing difficulty.
You did, however, have a couple of episodes of low pressure on the floor which improved with fluids.
We believe your low blood pressure may have been from low blood volume from decrased fluid intake.
We believe your cough may be from a pneumonia which we treated with antibiotics.
You were noted to have some low urine output.
We have made the following changes to your medications: STARTED: Benzonatate 100mg by mouth 3 times a day as needed for couth STOPPED: MS Contin, Morphine IR STARTED: Oxycodone as needed for pain  Please continue all other home medications as before.
