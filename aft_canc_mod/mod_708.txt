Admission Date:  [**2192-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-9-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-3-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: witnessed sz, fall at home  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Serial stereotactic biopsy.
History of Present Illness: 77M h/o Alzheimer's dementia became confused, weak, and had 1 episode of urinary incontinence 8pm yest.
He was taken to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital where a head CT revealed a mass ?tumor and he was given ativan for agitation.
He was transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, and now presents with post-ictal confusion and excitement.
HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, pupils 2->1mm bilat, EOMI, no nystagmus detected.
C-collar on, no C-spine tenderness elicited.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2192-8-25**] 5:58 AM IMPRESSION: 2.8-mm right temporoparietal mass without shift of normally midline structures.
Differential includes both primary and metastatic malignancy as well as focal infection and clinical correlation is recommended.
Overall, there is limited evaluation without contrast and MRI is recommended for further characterization.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2192-8-26**] 7:32 PM IMPRESSION: Right parietal lobe mass with vasogenic edema.
In absence of slow diffusion within the central portion of the lesion, this most likely represents a neoplastic lesion and locations are suggestive of metastatic disease.
A fetal right posterior cerebral artery is incidentally noted.
There is no vascular occlusion or high-grade stenosis seen.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report [**2192-8-27**] 12:17 AM CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT NECK W/ & W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 3 cm lobulated right upper lobe mass with indentation and spiculation, with continuous extensive mediastinal and hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy representing primary lung cancer with lymph node metastasis.
The mediastinal mass invades into the lower SVC, and compresses right main pulmonary artery.
Centrilobular emphysema.
Small bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of active inflammation.
Left renal cyst.
Degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesion is noted, however, bone scan can be performed for staging.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2192-8-30**]  8:57:20 AM Sinus rhythm Left axis deviation RBBB with left anterior fascicular block Since previous tracing of [**2182-8-13**], right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block present   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 77 146 134 420/449 68 -64 70  Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2192-8-28**]  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small (0.5 cm) circumferential pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small, echo dense pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function.
Mild diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No significant change in the 2.7-cm right parietal mass with large area of surrounding edema.
A head CT showed a 2.8cm R parietotemporal mass with edema, no midline shift.
This patient presented with a single seizure and CAT scan and MRI scan revealed an irregularly contrasting enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe.
The patient was also demented since several years and the torso CT showed multiple lung lesions.
After extensive discussions of the pros and cons, the family wished a serial stereotactic biopsy to be done so that a definitive histological diagnosis could be obtained and any further measures could be decided upon on the basis of a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and the pertinent prognostic outlook.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for agitation.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1) Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 169**] Center-Elmhurst  Discharge Diagnosis: Right parietal metastatic brain tumor, most likely small cell lung cancer.
