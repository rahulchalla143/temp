During his work up for esophageal cancer, an enhancing right upper pole real mass was identified.
MRA showed this to be a 3x3 cm mass that enhances, therefore, had a high likelihood of renal cell carcinoma.
He denied any history of hematuria, abdominal or flank pain.
Esophageal cancer as stated above.
History of peptic ulcer disease.
He has had Port-A-Cath placement and an exploratory laparotomy to rule out metastatic disease.
Additionally, he has had a pilonidal cyst excision.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His grandmother has diabetes, but no other genitourinary cancer history.
He was afebrile with a temperature of 98.7??????
Incision site was well healed, no erythema.
He had no lymphadenopathy and septal neck.
His trachea was midline, no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no palpable masses.
No costovertebral angle tenderness.
No inguinal lymphadenopathy.
He does have a healed J-tube removal site.
No inguinal hernia.
He has an exophytic lesion involving the upper pole as well.
Chest tube is draining 130 to 150 cc of serosanguinous effluent.
Chest x-ray postoperatively showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
He did have basilar atelectasis on the right side and a small right effusion.
Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
His epidural would be utilized for pain control.
On postoperative day #1, he had an epidural in place.
He completed his perioperative Ancef and was ultimately transferred to the floor.
No nausea or vomiting.
Follow up chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
On postoperative day #3, the patient had had the epidural completely removed although it had been previously capped and flagged.
At this point, he had developed a right upper extremity IJ clot related to his Port-A-Cath.
After his conservative therapy, his right upper extremity arm edema had decreased somewhat.
He will be reassessed to see how the progression in his right upper extremity edema had gone.
This had markedly improved over 36 hours of conservative management.
Additionally, the patient should follow up with his primary care physician in approximately 7 to 10 days and to have a PT/INR drawn in approximately two days from time of discharge with results being sent to the primary care physician as previously stated.
Status post open right partial nephrectomy for exophytic 3.3 lower pole renal mass presumed to be renal carcinoma.
