Admission Date:  [**2101-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-6-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2024-8-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Blue Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting x 4.
The patient had recently been undergoing an evaluation for painless jaundice.
In early [**Month (only) 116**] the patient had an abdominal CT at an outside hospital which demonstrated intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
On [**2101-6-10**] the patient came to [**Hospital1 1444**] and underwent an ERCP by the GI team which demonstrated a pancreatic duct stricture, which was compatible with a mass, a biliary stricture, and a stent placement in the biliary system.
At home over the next several days the family reported the patient developed worsening abdominal pain accompanied with nausea and vomiting.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He had diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding and rebound.
Chest x-ray demonstrated the possibility of free air overlying the epigastrium.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the presentation of an acute abdomen following an ERCP and the possibility of free air the patient was emergently taken to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy.
The patient's renal function improved with a significant drop in the creatinine.
On the floor the patient had a temperature spike which prompted a work-up and a CAT scan was performed.
The patient demonstrated multilocular retroperitoneal fluid collection.
The patient defervesced and a follow-up CAT scan done prior to discharge demonstrates that the fluid collections have decreased in size.
The family would rather have the patient be discharged to home, recover from his current illness, and reassess the situation at a later time during a follow-up visit.
Biliary stricture which is presumably a carcinoma but with no definitive tissue [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
Duodenal perforation and repair.
Abdominal fungal abscess.
Wet-to-dry dressing changes to the abdominal wound b.i.d.
