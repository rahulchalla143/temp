History of Present Illness: 79 yo AAM w/PMH sx for CAD s/p CABGx2 and PCI, ventricular pacer, DM2, and BPH s/p recent biopsy for elevated PSA who was at home sitting at his computer when he felt the urge to defecate.
He notes that he delayed going to the bathroom for a while, then noted increasing urgency to move his bowels, and on the way to the bathroom, he passed a large amount of bright red blood per rectum, with associated lighthesadness.

Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG X 2 and PCI, Pacer DM-2 on insulin PVD.
BPH Chronic anemia Chronic thrombocytopenia Prostate Cancer - diagnosed today - had biopsy one week ago today, but did not have any bleeding afterwards at that time.
Poor inspiratory effort.
No rales or rhonchi.
Mildly distended.
No bleeding or tenderness at site.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema in BLE.
No rash or tenderness.
Blood-flow images do not show any abnormal trace of activity.
Delayed blood-flow images show increased trace of activity in the area behind the urinary bladder.
Increased trace of activity is also seen in the sheets adjacent to the patient's buttock, who was having bright red blood per rectum during the time of this study.
IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with active bleeding in the rectosigmoid area.
No evidence of angiodysplasia, arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm involving the bowel vascular tree.
Local anesthesia in the right inguinal region with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine.
No immediate complications.
Sigmoidoscopy: A single diverticulum was seen in the splenic, however, the presence of more diverticula can not be excluded due to the poor prep.
Source of GI bleeding is due to post-prostate biopsy bleed.
Angioectasia in the mid-ascending colon 3.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon  Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 79 year old man with hx CAD and MI s/p PTCA on Plavix and ASA, ventricular pacer, DM2, and prostate cancer presents with BRBPR [**1-25**] prostate biopsy performed several days prior.
BRBPR: On admission to the MICU, patient was initially stable, and in the early morning, he became tachycardic, and dropped his blood pressure into the 60s/30s, and received 4u pRBCs and 2L NS for resuscitation.
On evaluation by GI, patient was felt to need a tagged RBC scan by IR, which showed bleeding at the rectal sigmoid junction, with continued BRBPR.
An embolization was attempted in IR, but it was felt that they were unable to localize the bleeding and the embolization was unsuccessful.
A sigmoidoscopy was attempted as well, but also did not localize site of bleeding due to incomplete bowel prep.
Colonoscopy was performed, and showed an adherent clot at left lobe of the prostate gland, with endoclips applied for hemostatis, as well as angioectasia, polyps, and diverticuli.
It was felt that the source of GI bleeding was due to post-prostate biopsy bleeding.
After hemostasis was achieved during colonoscopy, patient remained stable with no further decrease in hematocrit.
On discharge, his  hematocrit was He had trace OB+ stools on discharge, felt to be residual from his large volume LGIB two days prior.
Patient had three sets of negative cardiac enzymes and no changes on EKG, as well as no complaints of chest pain.
He was restarted on his blood pressure medications when he was transferred out of the MICU; however, he had an asymptomatic hypotensive episode of SBP in the 90s, and patient's lisinopril and Imdur were both discontinued, and he was discharged only on metoprolol 50 mg po qd.
Access - Patient had two large-bore peripheral IV's placed.
