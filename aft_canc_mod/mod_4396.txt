Patient is a poor historian given underlying dementia and son is not aware of complete medical history.
Per son, patient went to his PCP approximately several days ago with complaints of chest pain and back pain.
At that time he was also noted to be more forgetful and it was suspected that he has underlying alzeihmer's dementia.
His chest pain is described as sharp in the sternal area as well as upper abdominal area.
Patient has also had worsening dizziness.
An ECG was concerning for Mobitz II vs complete.
He got CTA that was concerning for widened mediastinum.
He had no infectious symptoms.
An ECG showed Mobitz II and CHB.
His CT was reviewed with radiology who did not think there was dissection, but a recess of the pericardium.
Currently, he denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
