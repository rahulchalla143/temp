Her husband was at her side and noted increasing auditory respiration, and she became less responsive.
Regarding her leiomyosarcoma: Presented with vaginal bleeding and had a D and C; She then had a TAH/BSO in [**2101-4-12**] - the pathology showed a leiomyosarcoma 7.5 cm in dimension with 10 mitosis per 10 high-powered field.
On [**2102-8-1**] she had a right lower lobe wedge resection for metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
She has had 2 admits due to chemo related side effect - 1. fever and neutropenia [**2103-3-13**] and discharged on [**2103-3-17**]; #2 C.Difficile Colitis admit on [**2103-4-12**] and discharge [**2103-4-17**].

Early developing pneumonia in this region cannot be entirely excluded.
There is mild volume overload.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis may be of benefit to assess for this possible underlying infection.
Echo: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Cardiac Enzymes [**2103-12-5**] 02:10PM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2103-12-5**] 10:48PM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2103-12-6**] 05:56AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-<0.01   Brief Hospital Course: The patient presented to the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] outpatient Hem/[**Hospital **] clinic for treatment of metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
She received 2g Mag given the the prolongation of QTc from 438 to 458 after ARQ 171 administration, but no other intravenous medication.
An ABG showed no acidemia.
However, she did have a gap acidosis with bicarbonate compensation.
There was no evidence of renal failure, uremia, dka, or history of ASA ingenstion to account for acidosis.
Her CXR showed no new findings, no pneumothorax, no widened mediastinum, no dilated heart.
An echo was performed to look for an arrthymogenic metastasis; although it was a poor study, no wall-motion abnormalities suggestive of a metastasis where found.
Based on these findings, it was thought that ARQ 171 most likely caused Torsades and cardiac arrest.
She remained asymptomatic the rest of her hospital course without chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis or palpatations.
We believe that you experienced cardiac arrest because of an abnormal rhythm called long QT that occured because of the chemotherapy [**Doctor Last Name 360**] ARQ 171.
However, you will need to have the QT interval monitored closely.
