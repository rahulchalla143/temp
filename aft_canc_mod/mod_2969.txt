Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 50862**] Admission Date: [**2150-4-19**] Discharge Date: [**2150-4-24**] Date of Birth:  [**2071-7-4**] Sex:  F Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of CAD, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C virus, gastric varices, who originally presented to an outside hospital on [**2150-4-12**] with hematemesis and a low hematocrit.
Endoscopy at that time revealed 2 to 3 plus esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, but no active bleeding.
The patient had a slow hematocrit drop over the next week requiring frequent blood transfusions.
The patient was pleasant in no acute distress.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with a wide systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Chest showed minimal crackles at the left base.
No organomegaly.
Extremities:  There were positive pulses, no edema.
EGD from [**2150-6-13**], 2 to 3 plus esophageal varices, no stigmata of a recent bleed, blood in the stomach, portal gastropathy.
No mass in the liver, increase in size from the prior.
Portal vein patent with hepatopetal flow.
She underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate the portal vasculature, which showed a patent portal vein.
Endoscopy revealed portal hypertensive gastropathy, grade 2 esophageal varices, but no active bleeding.
She was treated with beta- blockers and nitrates to reduce portal hypertension and had no further active bleeding throughout her stay.
Hepatocellular carcinoma:  Her primary oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**] and prior to her admission was being assessed for the possibility of surgery versus chemoembolization versus radiofrequency ablation of her HCC.
She felt that although her hepatoma had slightly increased in size, she felt it was asymptomatic and her variceal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension, cirrhosis, as well as a history of coronary artery disease and flash pulmonary edema were much more significant medical problems that were negatively impacting her health and that these would greatly increased the likelihood of complications if any tumor-directed therapy was attempted.
DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home in a stable condition with no further GI bleed and stable hematocrit without any further need for transfusions.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Include variceal/portal hypertension, hypertensive bleed, hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertension.
