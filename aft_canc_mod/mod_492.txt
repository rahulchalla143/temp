Admission Date:  [**2195-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-3-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia, sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 89M h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia and prostate CA presented with increased confusion, fever, lethargy with multiple falls for several days prior to admission.
In the ED, patient was febrile to 102F, and found to have a retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia as well as a creatinine of 2.3 increased from his baseline of 1.2.
The patient had a central line placed in the ED, received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin as well as volume resuscitation, and admitted to the MICU for sepsis.
No other source of fever was located and antibiotics were therefore tailored to levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia.
On arrival to the floor, the patient had only mild dyspnea, and no other complaints.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Osteoarthritis Seasonal allergies Prostate cancer:  IV tx q6 months  Social History: # Personal: Russian speaker.
MM dry appearing Neck: No JVD, dressing over right neck s/p triple lumen Chest: CTAB at anterior fields, few rales at left base.
# UA: Small leukocytes, no bacteria .
There is an indistinct opacity adjacent to the superior mediastinum in the right apex.
While this may be due to underlying aortic tortuosity, either airspace process, atelectasis, or possible underlying ground-glass nodule cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
# CXR [**2195-3-25**]: Left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation with worsening failure.
Right upper lobe opacity is concerning for a mass, and should be further investigated with cross-sectional imaging.
# CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage .
Well marginated 3.5 cm mass abutting the pleura in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe corresponding with the region of abnormality seen on the previous chest radiograph.
If no FDG activity is seen within this lesion on PET imaging, a followup chest CT is recommended in three months to assess for temporal stability.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent relaxation atelectasis.
Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggesting previous granulomatous infection.
Moderately severe compression fractures of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies of unknown chronicity.
Brief Hospital Course: 89M Russian speaking h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, admitted to the MICU with CAP and sepsis, and found to have a mass in right lung apex.
# Community acquired pneumonia/sepsis:  Given patient's admission x-ray, community acquired pneumonia was considered the most likely cause for his symptoms and hypotension.
# Acute renal failure: Patient was in acute renal failure with elevated creatinine of 2.3 on admission.
He received IV fluids and antibiotics for septic pneumonia, and his creatinine returned to baseline.
# Falls: Patient's falls were considered likely secondary to infection and sepsis.
On transfer to the floor he was borderline hypertensive and outpatient antihypertensive regimen resumed including nifedipine.
Atenolol stopped and he was changed to metoprolol given acute renal failure on admission.
# Lung mass NOS: CXR on admission revealed a rounded nodule at right apex concerning for malignancy.
CT chest demonstrated a 3.5 cm mass abutting pleura in posterior segment of RUL.
# Prostate cancer: Patient's history of known prostate cancer was considered a possible source of his new lung mass.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: family extended care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Community acquired pneumonia Acute renal failure Lung mass NOS .
Secondary diagnosis: Hypertension Prostate cancer  Discharge Condition: Stable.
You were also found to have kidney failure.
Later, you were found to have a mass in your right lung.
