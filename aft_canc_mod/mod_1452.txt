Endobronchial resection of neoplasm invading right bronchus intermedius   History of Present Illness: 79F w/recent diagnosis afib presents from cardiology clinic for workup of possible left atrial thrombus visualized on routine office TTE.
Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 2 mos ago, when she saw her physician for complaining of feeling her heart fluttering and ongoing fatigue for 3 weeks.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation, TTE at that time showed LVEF 45%.
Atrial fibrillation has been difficult to control medically: she was started on sotalol 120 [**Hospital1 **], then switched to dronedarone 400 [**Hospital1 **], then back to 160 mg sotalol [**Hospital1 **] about 10 days prior to admission.
She had episodes of atrial fibrillation near daily which she feels and documents by self-pulse checks.
She started pradaxa about 10 days prior to admission when she called her cardiologist to report  an episode of atrial fibrillation lasting >48h.
About 10 days prior to admission she also noted new bilateral leg edema.
No chest pain, pressure, SOB; no nausea/vomiting.
She noted no improvement in fatigue symptoms, also no improvement in dry cough which predated her fatigue and palpitations by ~1 year and was nonresponsive to antibiotics (azithromycin) as recently as 2 mos ago.
TTE showed possible [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] or external mass compressing LA.
She had no neurologic symptoms - no change speech, vision, hearing, motor, sensation, concentration or memory.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2200-4-27**]):       ~6OOO/ML Commensal Respiratory Flora.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2200-4-28**]):    No MRSA isolated.
A large mass involving the right lower medial lung extending into the paraesophageal, subcarinal and right hilar mediastinal regions with invasion to the pericardium, right atrium, left atrium and compressing the right airways causing complete collapse of the right middle lobe and partial collapse of the right lower lobe.
Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
Enlarged left supraclavicular lymphnode, 6 x 7 mm solid nodule in the right lower lobe and a suspicious lytic area in the left transverse process of the D1 vertebra and posterior end of the left second rib are concerning for the deposits.
Uncharacteristic 16 x 17 mm focal hypodensity in the right lobe of liver which is only imaged on the unenhanced series.
Tissue sample can be easily obtained by transbronchial approach for tissue diagnosis.
IV) STUDIES: EBUS Some white-colored mucous plugs were aspirated from the now visible RML and RLL and sent for culture.
The [**Hospital1 **] had a residual 40% airway obstruction by extrinsic compression.
A large mediastinal mass was visualized and sampled from both the right and left carinae, a total of 8 samples with at least 15 passes each was performed for cytology and flow cytometry.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 79 year old female with recently-diagnosed atrial fibrillation admitted with pericardiac mass and found to have a large mediastinal mass concerning for malignancy with compression of the heart, lung, and esophagus.
Atrial Fibrillation 3.
Chronic Cough 4.
Chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%.
Inpatient cardiology re-review of this TTE and [**2200-2-2**] TTE showed interval enlargement of an extra-pericardial mass rather than an intra-cardiac thrombus, now compressing the left atrium, which was not clearly apparent by CXR.
A chest CT was performed which showed that there was a large mediastinal mass which was compressing the right/left atrium, as well as the lower segment of the right lung, and esophagus.
Her symptoms of difficult to control atrial fibrillation, chronic dry cough, loss of apetite, mild systolic heart failure as well as loss of appetite were all felt likely to be the result of the mass effect exerted by the tumor.
She had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 140s-150s which did not result in hemodynamic instability or chest pain.
Despite large doses of diltiazem (as high as 360mg per day), she remained in atrial fibrillation with frequent episodes of rapid ventricular response.
Since the etiology of the patient's problems were secondary to mass effect caused by the mediastinal neoplasm, tissue biopsy was necessary to inform future decisions on definitive oncologic management.
During the procedure, they found that the tumor was invading the right lung parenchyma.
In addition, there was extensive neoplastic growth causing occlusion of the right bronchus intermedius.
Following the procedure, the patient went into respiratory failure secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and edema secondary to inflamation from the mechanical instrumentation.
She remained euvolemic with clear breath sounds, and no lower extremity edema.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**],  You were admitted for workup and evaluation of your atrial fibrillation.
You were found to have a large tumor extending in your lung and pressing on your heart.
This tumor is what has been causing your difficult to control atrial fibrillation, chronic cough, and loss of appetite.
There is a small chance that you will need a repeat biopsy for a definitive tissue diagnosis, however, this is unlikely.
