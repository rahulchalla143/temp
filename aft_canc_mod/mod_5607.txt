Admission Date:  [**2105-1-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-2-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation central venous line placement arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: 83-year-old gentleman with a h/o microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular/colon cancer who presented to the ED with mental status changes and increasing confusion.
He also reported dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath stating that he felt like he was going to "pass out."
After returning from CT scan, he developed respiratory distress.
The ED was concerned about possible allergic reaction from IV contrast and he was given nebs, solumedrol, pepcid, and benadryl.
His respiratory status did not improve and he was intubated for increased work of breathing.
He was also noted to be guaiac positive on rectal exam.
Of note, he was recently discharged after admission for 30-pound weight loss, nausea after eating with occasional vomiting, jaundice and epigastric pain and was found to have several liver lesions on CT.
Given the multiple liver lesions, suspicious lymph nodes, possible carcinomatosis of the omentum, and poor liver function, the patient was noted to be stage IV.
Liver biopsy returned with adenocarcinoma with a staining profile c/w colon cancer.
Concern for a primary hepatocellular carcinoma along with another primary cancer metastatic to the liver, likely colon.
Past Medical History: Recent diagnosis of hepatocellular and colon cancer, felt to have 2 different primary cancers per notes and biopsy reports Right microfollicular adenoma s/p resection 4/[**2096**].
Hypercholesterolemia   Social History: Emigrated from [**University/College **] ~35 years, and is a retired welder and electrician.
Family History: Father died of liver cancer at age 66.
**************MICRO************ admission bcx, ucx all negative sputum culture with sparse oropharyngeal flora .
Overall no significant interval change from [**2105-1-13**] with slight improvement in nonspecific jejunal wall thickening.
Multiple hepatic masses in a cirrhotic liver with thrombosis of the left portal vein and partial thrombosis of the right posterior portal vein.
Small ascites.
Bibasilar atelectasis .
[**1-28**] CT head IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect .
[**1-29**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous examination, the lung volumes have further decreased.
Increase of vascular markings which could be due to a combination of reduced lung volumes and slight increase of pulmonary edema.
The pre-existing right- sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Lower lung volumes with increase of vascular markings that could partly be due to slight increase of pulmonary edema.
[**1-31**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-28**] through 22:  Moderate right pleural effusion, and bibasilar atelectasis have worsened since [**1-28**].
Stomach is severely distended with gas and may account in part for low lung volumes.
Cardiac silhouette is largely obscured, probably not appreciably enlarged though mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests a component of volume overload or cardiac decompensation.
Brief Hospital Course: 83-year-old gentleman with a h/o recent diagnosis of hepatocellular/colon cancer who presented to the ED with mental status changes and increasing confusion, found to be obtunded in the setting of severe hypoglycemia (FSBG 20) and intubated for respiratory failure c/b hypotension on levophed.
# Respiratory failure - unclear reason for intubation as pt was never documented as hypoxic in the ED.
An arterial line was placed in the ICU which showed excellent gas exchange and the pt was easily and rapidly extubated without complication.
# Hypotension - occurred in the setting of intubation, and was started on levophed in the ED.
# Flash pulmonary edema - after extubation, pt had repeat episodes of uncontrolled hypertension, acute SOB, paradoxical breathing, elevated JVP, and hypoxia.
of ST elevation in anteroseptal leads.
Treated with ASA and BB as pt not a candidate for heparin or intervention.
An echo was ordered which showed mild focal left ventricular dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Patient continued to have hypoxia in the setting of hypertension, with shorntess of breath relieved with nitropaste and IV morphine.
# Acute renal failure - in setting of fluid restriction and aggressive diuresis pt had acute renal failure.
FE urea was consistent with prerenal etiology.
Likely secondary to poor intravascular volume with low serum albumin.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have suffered ATN from hypotension during peri-intubation period.
# Metastatic hepatocellular/colon cancer - tumor markers were revealing for a very elevated AFP, CEA within normal limits, and slightly elevated CA-19-9.
An ultrasound guided liver biopsy was done during last admisison and initial cytology results were positive for malignanct cells consistent with a poorly-differentiated carcinoma.
Due to the patients declining status with multisystem failure and limited therapeutic options, the patient was made CMO.
# Portal vein thrombosis - known, chronic.
# Guiaic positive stools/h/o melena - was scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy on day of admission.
# Microfollicular thyroid adenoma s/p resection [**3-/2097**] - was very hypothyroid per clinical presentation on recent admission, discharged on levothyroxine.
# Hyponatremia - stable, most likely a hypervolemic hyponatremia [**1-10**] to liver dysfunction and resultant constitutive activation of ADH axis.
# Hypoglycemia/ DM-II - was recently begun on an oral insulin secretagogue which is likely responsiible for altered mental status at home and presentation hypoglycemia in the ED.
Due to severe hepatic impairment, his gluconeogenesis is certainly dysfucntional.
# Hypertension - treated with standing beta blockade.
This was continued for patient comfort since he had periods of tachycardia which caused discomfort.
# FEN - ate a heart healthy diabetic diet.
# Code - DNR/DNI .
# Comm - [**Name (NI) 1116**] [**Name (NI) 7086**], HCP and son, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99736**] (cell), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99737**] (home) .
# Dispo - Patient transferred from ICU to medical floor on [**2-5**] morning and then discharged to a skilled nursing facility as CMO patient.
