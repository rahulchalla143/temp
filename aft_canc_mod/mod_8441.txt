Stat echo showed trivial pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
She then had R heart catheterization and swan ganz catheter placement for closer monitoring.
Following the procedure she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
There was a prior history of intermittent facial swelling that was of unclear etiology.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Metastatic colon cancer (mets to anterior abdominal wall and peripancreatic region) [**2158-2-12**]: Oxaliplatin/xeloda discontinued after 1 dose because of allergic reaction to oxaliplatin [**2158-3-15**] to [**2158-11-22**]: Irinotecan/Xeloda for 9 cycles.
Discontinued because of rising CEA [**2158-12-27**]: Erbitux/Irinotecan weekly started, baseline CEA 45.
CEA fell to 7 ([**2159-3-14**]) [**2159-4-11**]: Begin single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Erbitux, baseline CEA 22 [**2159-6-6**] to [**2159-10-3**]: Erbitux/irinotecan discontinued because of allergic reaction to Erbitux [**2159-10-24**]: Begin [**Month/Day/Year 49565**]/irinotecan, CEA rose to 43 [**2159-12-25**]: Begin 5-FU/LCV/[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 49565**] [**2160-1-13**]: Cyberknife treatment (radiation therapy) [**2160-11-4**]: Began [**Month/Day/Year 102068**], developed angioedema (unclear if culprit [**Name (NI) 102068**] or Fluconazole), transiently discontinued, then resumed with Medrol and Benadryl [**2161-3-12**]- [**2161-5-12**] 5-FU/Leucovorin/[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 49565**] [**2161-6-12**] Cyberknife * PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.
Metastatic colon cancer as above 2.
Hypertension 3.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease on Prevacid 4.
Allergic rhinitis 6.
Iron deficiency anemia, tolerated oral iron poorly  Social History: She lives at home with her husband.
Family History: 1 child with asthma and allergic rhinitis.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Resting hemodynamics slightly elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 13 mm Hg.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was slightly elevated (20/23/20).
No evidence of cardiac tamponade.
Evidence of contrast extravasation into pericardial space.
No evidence of cardiac tamponade.
PA catheter left in place for ongoing hemodynamic monitoring.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 65 yo F w/ metastatic colon cancer with iatrogenic RA perforation during attempt to recannulate malfucntioning port.
previously stable, newly found SVC thrombus, bilateral PE who developed and increasing pericardial effusion on anticoagulation.
Patient had no further signs of tamponade with resuming therapeutic Lovenox.
# Pericardial Effusion/RA Perforation.
Iatrogenic perforation of the RA initially without significant effusion, no sign of tamponade.
On [**2161-7-19**], she was noted to have upper extremity and facial swelling concerning for SVC thrombus.
MRV was performed which showed nearly complete occlusive SVC thrombus, and saddle PE in the right/left pulmonary arteries.
The patient initially did well, with TTE on [**7-20**], early [**7-21**] with minimal pericardial effusions.
However, TTE repeated later on [**7-21**] demonstrated increased pericardial effusion with evagination (but not collapse) of the RA.
At that time the patient was HD stable, stable oxygenation, though with episodes of breakthrough sinus tachycardia to 120s-140s.
The heparin gtt was stopped for concern of bleeding into the pericardium from the previous RA perforation.
She continued to be hemodynamically stable with mild sinus tachycardia.
# SVC thrombus: She had onset of dramatic upper extremity and facial swelling within two days of the procedure.
This was concerning for SVC syndrome due to thrombus around her occluded port (still in place).
She had gradual reduction in her upper extremity swelling.
She had a repeat MRV after 1-2 weeks which showed little change in the thrombus.
Interventional radiology was consulted for possible intervention and presented the patient with options.
She plans to continue with anticoagulation and further consider IR or surgical intervention if her swelling does not resolve.
She remains with mild upper extremity and intermittent facial edema.
# Pulmonary embolism: MRV performed for SVC syndrome as above also revealed pulmonary embolus straddling the right and left main pulmonary arteries.
# Tachycardia: She became intermittently tachycardic with sinus rhythm at various points during her admission.
She becomes tachycardic to the 120's with mild exertion.
The etiology of this could be due to pulmonary embolism, poor preload from SVC clot, or due to irritation from blood within the pericardium.
Her tachycardia should improve as her pericardial effusion clears and as her endurance increases with physical therapy.
# Metastatic Colon Ca.
# Anxiety: Anxiety is stable.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
You have some complications while in the hospital, including more clotting around your catheter and some blood in the sac around the heart.
Please call your primary care physician or call 911 if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal or back pain, fevers, increased swelling, or other concerning symptoms.
