PCP thought her to have a pneumonia given her symptoms of fever, cough, and SOB, found that she was having O2 saturation of less than 88%, and sent her to the emergency room for possible pneumonia.
At the ED, she was started on IV vanc/zosyn and steroids for pneumonia because of fever to 101 and leukocytosis.
CXR with small amount CHF and possible LLL consolidation.
She was initially treated with lasix, IV Nitro but became hypotensive so nitro was stopped.
She was admitted to the ICU for poor respiratory status.
In the ICU, they noted ST elevations on EKG in inferolateral leads, and a troponin of 4.84 and 6.75.
Also noted to have pulmonary hypertension.
Patient was subsequently transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring given tenuous respiratory status.
On arrival, patient feels that she is short of breath.
Having difficulty speaking full sentences.
Not having chest pain, no pleuritic chest pain.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p DES to LAD ([**2167**]) - HTN - severe COPD on 2L home O2 - squamous cell lung carcinoma s/p left lobectomy, chemo, XRT - hyperlipidemia - uterine fibroids - laryngeal paralysis - s/p partial hysterectomy - h/o head injury with seizure disorder 11 years ago - anxiety - chronic back pain  Social History: Patient is married.
Family History: father - CAD in 50s mother - CAD in 70s  Physical Exam: On admission VS: 99.3, 125/73, 129, 91% on 3L Gen: chronically ill appearing female, short of breath HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, no LAD, no JVD CV: S1S2, tachycardic, no m/r/g Chest: crackles on exam bibasilarly, wheezes throughout Abd: soft, ND, NT, +BS Ext: cath site clean and dressed.
No bruit, no hematoma, no bleeding.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCA was a large tortuous vessel with 50% stenosis at the mid segment.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 12 mm Hg, elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP 29 mm Hg and PCWP 22 mm Hg.
There was pulmonary artery hypertension with PA  72/28 mm Hg, mean 43 mm Hg.
Careful pullback across the aortic valve revealed no significant gradient.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Diastolic dysfunction with elevated left sided filling pressures.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with extensive severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the septum, anterior wall, distal third of the left ventricle (including the apex).
Ejection fraction is difficult to assess in setting of marked tachycardia but appears severely depressed (EF 25).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis and distal dyskinesis of the apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or stress-induced cardiomyopathy (or focal myocarditis).
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Chest CT: Lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and right hilum extending along the bronchovascular structures in the right lung could be reactive due to infection, but is concerning for neoplasm given the patient's previous history of lung neoplasm and should be followed up with repeat CT thorax in 2 months to ensure resolution.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo female with PMH of CAD s/p DES to LAD in [**2167**], squamous cell lung carcinoma s/p left lobectomy, chemo, and XRT, complicated by laryngeal paralysis, COPD on 2L home O2, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization.
Transferred to CCU post-cath for poor respiratory status .
Hypoxia- shortness of breath is likely multifactorial, a combination of multifocal pneumonia superimposed on underlying poor pulmonary reserve in setting of cancer with resection and XRT with new development of acute systolic heart failure.
Patient has a history of largyngeal paralysis, making her more likely to aspirate.
During her stay in the ICU she was found to have a pneumonia.
She was covered for both CAP and aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.
CT of Chest report read: PE was of concern given tachycardia and SOB, however patient was ruled out with CTA.
Lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and right hilum extending along the bronchovascular structures in the right lung could be reactive due to infection, but is concerning for neoplasm given the patient's previous history of lung neoplasm and should be followed up with repeat CT thorax in 2 months to ensure resolution.
Systolic and Diastolic congestive Heart Failure: EF 25%: It is possible that her elevated [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] changes, and TTE findings of apical hypokinesis represents stress induced cardiomyopathy.
It may have been caused by stress of pneumonia on top of already compromised lungs.
viral cardiomyopathy is also a possiblility.
She also received scheduled nebulizer treatments and had gradual resolution of her symptoms.
Her pneumonia was treated as above.
H/o CAD, stress cardiomyopathy/focal myopericarditis - s/p [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to LAD in [**2167**].
TTE on this admission shows EF of 25% with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the septum, anterior wall, distal third of the left ventricle.
Given these focal wall motion abnormalities she was taken to cath which showed patent LAD stent with 50% prox LCx lesion and 50% mid RCA lesion, and given these findings of non-flow limiting CAD in the setting of focal wall motion abnormalities, the pt was felt to have a stress related cardiomyopathy vs focal myo/pericarditis.
EKG post-cath still showed ST elevations however these resolved over time and the pt was without significant Q waves.
Losartan was temporarily held given hypotension but was added back by discharge.
Hypotension - patient was initially hypotensive with SBP in the 70-80s, for which antihypertensives were held.
Concern was for sepsis given her pneumonia.
# Tachycardia - The pt was initially in the 140's on admission, with narrow complex sinus tachycardia and frequent ectopy.
Severe COPD - patient is on 2L home O2.
Patient had long acting tiotropium held while acutely sick.

Discharge Instructions: You had trouble breathing and low oxygen levels and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac catheterization after changes were seen on your EKG.
Your heart is also weak, possibly due to a virus or possibly because of stress/strain.
It is likely that you may retain fluid in the future so please weigh yourself every morning, call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
Please eat a low sodium diet.
You had an outbreak of herpes type 1 lesions in your mouth.
You also had a pneumonia that is probably caused in part by your laryngeal problems.
