Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
New opacities in the left upper lobe are worrisome for aspiration.
There is no pneumothorax.
Stomach: Protruding Lesions A fungating and ulcerated non-bleeding 2-3 cm mass of malignant appearance was found at the antrum.
A fungating and ulcerated 1 cm mass with stigmata of recent bleeding of malignant appearance was found at the antrum.
Impression: Mass in the antrum.
No adjacent lymph adenopathy was found.
No peri-gastric ascites was noted.
There was a ulceration at the tip of the polyp.
There was no active bleeding.A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare and both the polyps were removed.
The polyps were retrived using a [**Doctor Last Name **] net and sent for pathology.
2 clips were applied at the site of the smaller polyps to prevent post-polypectomy bleed.
There was a ulceration at the tip of the polyp.
There was no active bleeding.
The polyps were retrived using a [**Doctor Last Name **] net and sent for pathology.
2 clips were applied at the site of the smaller polyps to prevent post-polypectomy bleed.
Colonoscopy: [**1-9**] Findings:  Protruding Lesions Small non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old woman with mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve, tricuspid valve replacement ([**Doctor First Name 7624**] ring), atrial fibrillation on coumadin and aspirin presenting with melana in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and new diagnosis of antral gastric polyps.
Hospital Course by Problem:  # GI Bleed: Patient with upper GI bleed in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, recent weight loss, and chronic iron deficiency anemia.
She was subsequently called out to the medical floor: EGD and EUS revealed 2 antral gastric polyps removed via endoscopic polypetomy.
Colonoscopy only significant for grade I hemorroids.
Pathology of polyps showed granulation tissue and inflammation, but no evidence of adenocarcinoma.
# Anticoagulation: Patient has significant stroke risk given mechanical mitral valve and atrial fibrillation.
Due to risk of rebleeding s/p polypectomy, heparin gtt was initiated and then held for 48 hours after polypectomy.
# Aspiration Pneumonitis: Noted a LUL opacity on CXR after patient spiked fever and had elevated leukocytosis.
Patient was briefly placed on Vancomycin/Cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia coverage.
Repeat CXR 24 hours later showed resolution of opacity, consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
Repeat leukocytosis occurred a few days later, repeat CXR showed no acute process.
Her leukocytosis resolved and she remained afebrile with no complaints through the course of her hospital stay.
She was observed eating her meals and there was no concern for aspiration.
# Atrial fibrillation/Flutter: Decreased metoprolol to 25 mg daily and added amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# H. pylori infection: During her GI work-up, she was found to have positive serology for H. pylori.

You were found to have some gastric polyps that were removed endoscopically.
The tissue diagnosis of those polyps showed no evidence of cancer.
You were also noted to have an infection of the stomach called 'Helicobacter pylori', and you will require treatment for this infection.
