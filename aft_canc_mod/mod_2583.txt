PET scan performed today revealed progression of his disease as well as a lytic lesion in the left femur.
Additionally he has had a decline of his renal function of the past month and creatinine is up to 2.7.
He is admitted for evaluation and management of renal failure,pain, and his new lytic bone disease.
Past Medical History: Non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic Arterial embolic disease s/p right SFA stent in [**June 2159**] CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) 205**] 97 HTN COPD CHF; EF 35-40% Hypercholesterolemia Primary polydipsia BPH s/p TURP Schizophrenia, Paranoia Nephrotic Syndrome [**2-29**] membranous GN   Social History: No current tobacco.

Family History: Mother died at age 60 of cancer (unknown type)  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.6  BP  164/84  HR  92  RR 22  98%RA GEN: chronically-ill appearing, NAD HEENT: MMM, OP clear, anicteric, PERRL NECK: Supple, no LAD, no masses CV: RRR no m/r/g LUNGS: bilateral diffuse rhonchi and wheeze ABD: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM EXT: no edema, left thigh w/o palpable mass, mild TTP SKIN: no rash NEURO: A/A, anxious, Ox3, strength intact throughout, CN II-XII intact   Pertinent Results: 133 / 97 / 69       gluc  248 4.7 / 23 / 2.7 .
PET Scan: Multiple new FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar, liver, and soft tissue lesions consistent with progression of disease.
Lytic lesion in the proximal left femur with evidence of cortical breakthrough placing the patient at high risk for pathologic fracture.
Interval resolution of two right upper lobe spiculated opacities and non-visualization of two right lower lobe nodules.
L thigh xray: Large lytic intratrochanteric lesion (33mm in diamater).
No pathologic fracture  Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old male with progressive metastatic lung cancer and membranous nephropathy who presents with left thigh pain in the setting of a new left femur lytic lesion.
Left lytic femoral bone lesion/fracture:  Pt was found to have a lytic lesion in the intertrochanteric left femur on admission.
Unfortunately, the patient sustained a traumatic pathologic fracture while in the hospital when he fell.
Pt was then found to have low blood pressure, and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
He was found to have a perifracture hematoma and was transfused 4 units of PRBCs.
Repeat xray films of hip, femur and knee revealed minimal change since time of fracture.
Chronic renal failure:  Pt has history of membranous nephropathy associated with malignancy.
However, he again became hypotensive to 70's and all antihypertensives were held.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia, RLL:  His sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeroginosa.
After completing his course patient was intermittiently hypotensive and tachycardic.
There was concern for sepsis and cultures were sent.
Sputum grew out sparse gram negative rods and patient was started on 2 week course of ceftazidime because of concern for partially treated pseudomonal pneumonia (sensitivities to Zosyn were borderline).
CT chest was completed that showed worsening of his lung cancer, scarring secondary to radiation and areas of persistent pneumonia.
Patient's blood pressures stabilized and pulmonary felt there was no indication to bronch patient.
COPD:  Pt appears to have wheezing at baseline.
Hypertension:  After returning from the ICU, pt was noted to have high blood pressure.
Beta blockers were avoided given his poor respiratory status and past records noting inability to tolerate beta blockers.
However blood pressure again became tenuous requiring boluses with IV fluids.
Schizophrenia and Paranoia:  Pt was continued on his outpatient regimen of olanzapine, lorazepam, and fluphenazine.
[**Name2 (NI) **] changes were made to his regimen and patient did not have any auditory hallucinations while in house.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution Sig: One (1) ML Inhalation q4 hr prn () as needed for wheezing.
You were found to have a bone lesion there and have unfortunately fractured your bone at that site.
