IMAGING: TTE [**2115-7-19**]: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion.
No clear-cut evidence of tamponade physiology.
However, the presence of tachycardia and relatively small chamber sizes along with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function is suggestive of poor diastolic filling.
CT Chest [**2115-7-18**]: Moderate layering nonhemorrhagic left pleural effusion is larger  today than on [**7-11**].
Left pleural catheter enters laterally, traverses the major fissure and ends superiorly alongside the spine at the level of the fourth posterior interspace.
No left pneumothorax:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is larger, particularly in the right lower and anterolateral hemithorax where [**Month (only) **] now replaces previous air component.
Fissural and paramediastinal components of the moderate-to-large right pleural effusion have also increased.
More extensive ground-glass opacification in the upper aspect of the right lower lobe which is still consolidated at the base could be edema associated with pleural [**Month (only) **] interfering with lymphatic milking due to pleural restriction that prevents ventilatory change in lobar volume, however, could also be progression of pneumonia even though cavitation present previously has not worsened.
The residual esophagus or upper neoesophagus is still distended above the alimentary stent, which though unchanged in position, roughly from the level of the T5-T9 is still largely occluded with semisolid material.
The superior vena cava above the pericardial reflection is larger than the intrapericardial segment, and the right atrium and ventricle are both smaller today than on [**7-11**], warranting evaluation for possible early cardiac tamponade.
Mild atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe are probably due to ventilatory compromise by the larger left pleural effusion.
Atherosclerotic coronary calcification is heavy in the left main, anterior descending and circumflex vessels.

CTA showing reaccumulation of large bilateral pleural effusions.
Active diagnoses: #Bilateral pleural effusions, R-sided empyema: CT on admission showed large bilateral pleural effusions, with the right one being loculated, which had reaccumulated from prior drainage 6/[**2114**].
Pt had R pigtail placed [**2115-7-5**] by IP with pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] exudative, cytology neg, culture with rare growth of lactobacillus and STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS.
A repeat gram stain of the right pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] was sent, which showed polymicrobial results.
This repeat pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] culture from R on [**2115-7-6**] with moderate growth of lactobacillus and STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS.
Given the concern for an esophageal-pleural fistula, a CT thorax with PO contrast was done on [**7-7**] which was inconclusive, so an esophagram was performed on [**7-9**] that did not show evidence of esopahgeal leak.
R sided pleural effusion loculations and bacterial growth concerning for empyema.
In pt with h/o bilateral effusions with reaccumulation, seems that pt likely infected preexisting effusions.
Bacteria are consistent from oral flora per ID.
This suggests microaspiration caused infection and organization of R pleural effusion.
R sided effusion/empyema concerning for abscess or necrotizing pneumonia per CT chest [**2115-7-11**].
Initial etiology of pt's pleural effusions still unclear since cytology consistently negative but known to reaccumulate.
L effusion exudative but does not appear infected on pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] culture.
On [**7-17**], pt accidentally pulled remaining R chest tube.
Pt with small PTX after L tube exchanged.
They reported they did not feel he would benefit from decortication based on mainly parenchymal abnormalities on imaging.
#Pericardial effusion: The patient had a TTE that noted an approximately 1cm effusion located posteriorly but had no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Cardiology recommended following the effusion with a repeat echo in 2 weeks (~[**2115-7-23**]).
Pt found to have slight increase in pericardial effusion on chest CT [**7-17**], so TTE completed [**7-18**].
Showed moderate effusion without clear tamponade physiology.
Talked to cardiology about poor diastolic filling on repeat TTE from [**7-18**] and they said that without clear tamponade physiology they did not want to do a pericardiocentesis.
#Hypotension: The patient occasionally became hypotensive with systolics in the high 80s.
HR in 100-110s mostly with occasional elevation to 120s.
#Thrush: pt put on fluconazole on admission because of inability to tolerate nystatin secondary to severe worsening of GERD.
Pt also developed asymmetric edema of L arm distal to the elbow.
Pt had duplex U/S on [**7-14**] which was neg for DVT.
L arm edema worsened, so pt had repeat duplex U/S on [**7-18**].
Chronic diagnoses: # Recurrent esophageal adenocarcinoma: s/p C5D1 [**2115-5-30**], cycle 6 held [**7-4**].
Continued pain mgmt, nausea mgmt, home ativan.
# CAD s/p MI: Continued home [**Month/Day (2) **], atenolol held for low BPs.
# GERD: continued home PPI  Transitional issues: # Pt to f/u with ID in [**Hospital 4898**] clinic, IP with plan for repeat chest CT prior to appt, cards for pericardial effusion f/u # Pt will also f/u with OP oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] # Pt will require weekly lab draws: CBC with diff, Chem7, AST, ALT; please fax results to ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4591**].
