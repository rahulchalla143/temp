# Hypotension:  Likely etiology was septic shock in the setting of fever and neutropenia and hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation in the ED.
Sources included bacteremia from coagulase negative staphylococcus.
Concern for adrenal insufficiency in the setting of hyponatremia and long term use of steroids.
Other infectious etiologies were ruled out (no PNA noted on CXR, gallbladder u/s showed no cholecystitis, TTE without evidence of endocarditis.)
1/4 bottles of blood grew coag negative staphylococcus.
Never had definitive evidence of UTI (U/A negative but no urine culture sent) but did get 3 days of Ciprofloxacin.
Irradiated, leuko-reduced blood products he received in clinic were cultured by the blood bank, but showed no source organism.
Patient was admitted to the MICU initially for hypotension and treated with IV fluid boluses as needed, pressors were not required.
#) Anemia: Likely due to multiple myeloma.
Hemolysis labs negative.
Concerning for gout, but no elevated uric acid levels.
Plain films showed no evidence of multiple myeloma or acute fracture.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

This was either due to a contaminated blood product you received or due to a transient bacterial infection in your blood.
- You were discharged on a slightly higher steroid dose than you were admitted on due to concern for low blood pressures and adrenal insufficiency.
- Your cialis and terazosin were held in the setting of low blood pressure.
Please seek medical attention if you experience fever > 100.4, chills, light-headedness or dizziness, cough with sputum production, severe chest or abdominal pain, diarrhea, a spreading rash, or any other symptoms not listed here concerning enough to warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 96471**]   Followup Instructions: with your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Tuesday, [**2148-4-30**] at 1:30 pm.
