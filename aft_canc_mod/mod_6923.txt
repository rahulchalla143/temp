Admission Date:  [**2110-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-6-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Left sided subdural hematoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left sided craniotomy   History of Present Illness: 73 yo man s/p fall whom has fallen 3-4 times the past couple months.
Patient denies any seizure, CP, SOB, visual changes, bowel or bladder incontinence.
Patient suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses walker.
Hypertension 4.
Pancytopenia 5.
Depression 6.
Chronic LE edema 7.
Chronic GU tract obstruction (bilateral hydronephrosis and bilateral hydroureter to the level of the ureterovesicular junctions)   Social History: Lives alone.
Family History: Father deceased from a myocardial infarction.
HEENT: Pupils:equal, reactive EOMs intact Neck: Supple, no tenderness on cervical spine.
2+ edema on the right lower extremity with ertyhema, warm.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Right pronator drift.
Head CT [**5-29**]: Left subdural hematoma involving the entire left convexity and left middle cranial fossa, with subfalcine herniation to the right of [**2-2**] mm.
Apparent effacement of the left suprasellar cistern may be due to oblique patient positioning but is concerning for early uncal herniation.
No rib fractures.
CT C-spine [**5-30**]: Severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is likely secondary to degenerative changes .
EEG [**6-1**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of  bursts of sharp slowing and delta frequency slowing over the entire left hemisphere and increased voltage gradient over the left hemisphere throughout the recording.
Additionally, the background over the right hemisphere is mildly slow and disorganized.
The first abnormality suggests subcortical and possible cortical dysfunction diffusely  affecting the left hemisphere, predominantly over the left fronto-central region.
The second abnormality suggests a widespread mild encephalopathy with subcortical and cortical dysfunction.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded.
MRI [**6-2**]: No acute infarcts.
Stable small left subdural hematoma and pneumocephalus after recent subdural hematoma evacuation.
Small vessel ischemic changes.
Carotids [**6-2**]: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
Marked dilatation of large bowel with the cecum measuring 12 cm.
This may represent colonic ileus, although, a low rectal obstruction cannot be excluded.
ECHO [**6-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Multiple small subsegmental pulmonary emboli within the right upper and right lower lobes.
Right lower lobe pulmonary nodules are unchanged from the PET/CT of [**2109-9-18**].
Head CT [**6-6**]: No change since the prior examination in the size of the small left subdural collection, status post evacuation of a subdural hematoma.
No midline shift.
No new hemorrhage.
KUB [**6-6**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with nondilated loops of air-filled small and large bowel.
Head CT [**6-9**]: Stable appearance of a small left subdural collection status post evacuation of a subdural hematoma.
No midline shift or evidence of new hemorrhage   Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the NeuroICU for Q1 Neurochecks, he was prepared for surgery on HD#2.
Due to his significant pronator drift and cofounding MS which could impaired his exam he was consented for a left sided craniotomy for subdural evacuation.
On POD#1 he was found to have right sided weakness and a repeat head CT showed some reaccumulation of blood in the subdural space he was transferred to the neurological floor.
An MRI done was of poor quality but did not show stroke.
A chest Xray was done and showed right infrahilar mass that on a followup CT was shown to be insignificant stable findings from previous studies.
An EEG was done and showed no epileptiform focus.
He also had two brief episodes of bradycardia and the medicine service was consulted.
He had caroted duplex studies that showed no significant stenosis.
An echo showed no cardiac abnormalities.
He was found to have abdominal distension and had a fleets enema which resulted in minimal stool.
KUB was ordered to assess bowel obstruction which showed a 12cm dilated cecum and dilated loops of large bowel.
A rectal tube was placed resulting in a large bowel movement and a decrease in his abdominal distention.
On POD#6 A CTA was ordered and he was premedicated with mucomist for renal protection.
CTA showed multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Patient had one large bowel movement, abdomen no longer distended.
Patient with intermittent expressive aphasia which resolved spontaneously.
Patient continues to have intermittent expressive aphasia.
PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for GI prophy.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: - Left sided subdural hematoma - Multiple small subsegmental pulmonary emboli within the right upper and right lower lobes - Colonic ileus   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: You have been started on a new medication called warfarin.
Watch incision for redness, drainage, bleeding, swelling or fever greater than 101.5  Followup Instructions: Follow up in 6 weeks with a head CT and appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106639**] [**Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic.
