Evolving left MCA territory infarction with moderate edema and no appreciable mass effect or shift of the midline.
Resolution of high-density material within the left sylvian fissure, likely to represent contrast administration.
There is involvement of the insular cortex in frontal and temporal opercular regions.
There is no evidence of blood product identified.
No mass effect or midline shift seen.
The images through the posterior fossa demonstrate a mass in the region of left cerebellopontine angles with expansion of the medial portion of the left internal auditory canal.
The mass measures approximately 1.5 cm and is in contact with the left side of the middle cerebellar peduncle without significant deformity.
There is no hydrocephalus.
The findings are consistent with vestibular schwannoma.
IMPRESSION: Acute left middle cerebral artery territorial infarct.
No evidence of blood product or midline shift.
1.5-cm left-sided CP angle mass consistent with vestibular schwannoma.
No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
MRA OF THE HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal narrowing at the left MCA bifurcation with occlusion of posterior division.
The left posterior cerebral artery is fetal in origin, a normal variation.
No other abnormalities.
[**11-8**]: IMPRESSION: Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta without definite vascular congestion or pneumonia.
Repeat CT head: IMPRESSION: Left middle cerebral artery territorial infarct.
Small high- density area within the left middle cerebral artery near the bifurcation of unknown significance in nature.
Several small air bubbles are visualized in the region of frontal lobe which could be related to the recent procedure.
High-density material identified along the left sylvian fissure could be due to enhancement from the recent contrast administration or could be due to petechial hemorrhages.
[**11-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No obvious cardiac source of embolism identified.
If clinically indicated, a focused study with contrast administration may allow for evaluation for intracardiac shunt.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild diastolic dysfunction with normal left ventricular filling pressures.
Probable mild right ventricular dilation with borderline normal right ventricular function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
[**11-8**]: CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM: HISTORY: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 100404**] is a 62-year-old male who was found by his wife in the morning on awaking with left upper extremity weakness and aphasia.
He had a CTA performed which was consistent with a left M2 occlusion though there was an area of MCA which was hypodense.
The decision was made to pursue intra-arterial thrombolysis with Merci clot retrieval device.
At this point we concluded that there was probably significant infarcts of the brain in that territory and this was the reason why the artery was not opening up.
We therefore decided to stop the procedure as more than 6 hours had elapsed since the onset of symptoms and the patient had a demonstrable infarct on his preprocedure CT scan.
A neurologic examination could not be performed immediately due to deep sedation and muscle relaxants.
FINDINGS: Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows no significant stenosis of the left common carotid artery bifurcation.
The left external carotid artery fills well.
The left internal carotid artery fills well along its cervical petrous cavernous and supraclinoid segments.
There is some cross filling of the middle cerebral artery superior division through the anterior cerebral artery collateralization.
Left internal carotid artery arteriogram demonstrates that the left M2 superior division is occluded.
Left middle cerebral artery arteriogram confirms the location of the microcatheter in the left middle cerebral artery and the presence of the thrombus.
At the end of the procedure there was significant occlusion of the M2 division secondary to completed infarct of the left MCA superior division territory.
Oral apraxia was noted in his following simple oral-motor directions - regardless of visual cues - with only 10% accuracy.
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 100404**] presents with nonfluent global aphasia with poor auditory comprehension and expressive language filled with neologisms and paraphasic errors which are mostly phonemic in nature.
He also presents with oral/verbal apraxia.
Articulatory agility breaks down with single-syllabic words.
Aphasia literature and communication strategies were reviewed with pt's wife.
[**11-19**] speech follow-up: A: Pt continues to present with severe expressive and receptive aphasia with difficulty getting into set for tasks.
He has obvious frustration regarding his deficits, but shows little recognition of his inability to communicate effectively verbally.
His speech was fluent, but is filled with jargon and paraphasic errors.
He was continued on his Atovastatin and was found to have an excellent lipid panel.
On the floor, his strength improved on the right to [**4-25**] at the right deltoid and triceps, though distal weakness was still somewhat weak in the extensors of the hand and fingers.
He continued to have a facial droop.
Aphasia was the most prominent finding on examination, with global aphasia noted initially, with gradual improvement of comprehension to the point that he could understand "close your eyes," "raise your hand," and one or two things said by his family.
Regarding his stroke workup, his cardiac rhythm was noted to be atrial fibrillation, and he was started on a heparin drip as well as coumadin (held for G-tube placement).
His blood sugars in the hospital were within normal limits for the most part, and no new diabetes medication regimen was initiated apart from a standard insulin sliding scale (requiring no doses of insulin on this).
Atrial fibrillation was ultimately felt to be the cause of the stroke, and the patient's family agreed to therapy with coumadin.
2D Echo was unrevealing as source of clot; though he had admitted to recent dental infection, cardiology felt that endocarditis was very unlikely and did not feel TEE was indicated.
1) Kidney biopsy results were followed up; pathology revealed papillary renal cell carcinoma.
His urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25443**] (at [**Hospital1 112**]) was [**Name (NI) 653**], and he recommended follow-up with MRI over the next several months, with consideration for percutaneous cryotherapy.
No further workup of this mass was recommended, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25443**] felt that G-Tube placement should be safe.
2) Severe agitation was noted on the wards, particularly later in the day or late at night.
This was replaced with a PEG tube, which was advanced into the duodenum, due to technical difficulties of placement.
IR was [**Name (NI) 653**], and they felt that this was consistent with recent PEG placement, and the PEG was cleared to use.
On [**11-19**], there was some hematuria and urethral irritation was noted, with elev WBC the next morning.
He was evaluated by urology with cystoscopy, who noted urethral (but no bladder) trauma and felt these findings were consistent with traumatic urethritis.
When hematuria has cleared in one to two days, the foley may be removed at rehab.
Please flush the Foley catheter q 2 hourly to prevent possible obstruction of the urethra by clots.
