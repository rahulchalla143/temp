Admission Date:  [**2131-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-11-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-1-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 287**] Chief Complaint: COPD flair, hypercarbic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated (3x), central line (2x), arterial line (2x)  History of Present Illness: 77 year old woman with a history of COPD (FEV1 0.4/FVC 1.2 in [**2131-9-13**]), on chronic home O2 at 3L, nocturnal BiPAP at night for hypercarbia, who was directly admitted to MICU from the clinic by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for management of COPD with mental status changes and ABG of 7.29/96/101.
Her nocturnal BiPAP settings were changed from [**10-17**] to 13/5, however, the patient did not do well on these new settings and developed abdominal distension that made her dyspnea worse.
In the last few weeks she completed two courses of Levaquin and Prednisone for COPD exacerbation.
She did have cough productive of yellow sputum and increased shortness of breath.
Prior to her current admission, she has had increased confusion and was noted to be more lethargic and somnolent at home.
The patient was seen in the ED complaining of subacute progressive episodes of confusion and forgetrullness, on [**2131-11-2**], where her ABG was 7.36/77/63.
Head CT was done and was negative for intracranial hemorrhage but did show suprasellar mass.
She does complain of nausea, no vomiting, and diminished appetite while on prednisone.
She denies urinary urgency, frequency or incontinence.
No chest pain.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Sellar mass ??????
noted on head CT [**10-17**], thought to be benign pituitary adenoma, prolactin nl, TSH slightly elevated at 4.9 6.
No polyuria, polydipsia, visual changes 8.
Family History: Father died at 80 of lung cancer (smoker).
Pulm: Soft crackles bilaterally, decreased air movement, no wheezes Back: No CVA tenderness, no spinal tenderness Abd: NABS, soft, NT, ND, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well-perfused.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Confused at times, but answers questions appropriately.
CT Head ([**2131-11-11**]) Stable appearance of the brain parenchyma since the prior examination including unchanged appearance of large round sellar mass.
No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
CT-Chest ([**2131-11-20**]) An enlarging mass in the lingula, suspicious for cancer.
New 1.4-cm nodule at the left lung base.
Severe diffuse emphysema.
Diffuse esophageal wall thickening with air along the esophageal wall extending from the inlet to the carina, likely esophagitis.
CT-Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2132-11-27**]) 3.5 x 3.3 cm region of inflammatory fat stranding in the midline abdomen, just medial to the G-tube insertion site, most consistent with a phlegmon.
No focal fluid collections are identified.
This is most likely related to the recent G-tube manipulation.
Interval resolution of the left lung base nodule, which likely was infectious in etiology on the prior scan.
Emphysematous changes throughout the lungs, unchanged.
Aside from the left lung nodule, lungs are clear of any focal abnormality.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified, but not focally dilated.
Left mid lung zone nodular opacity, which has grown compared to older chest radiographs and is highly concerning for primary lung malignancy.
EKG [**2131-11-5**]: sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes, occasional PVCs.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Cytology ([**2131-11-22**]): BAL washings positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
Stool cultures: ([**2131-11-28**]) - C. diff neg .
Mrs [**Known lastname **] was admitted with hypercarbia and mental status changes.
At baseline, she has severe COPD with an FEV1 of 0.4L, and was on nocturnal bipap with settings of [**12-17**] prior to admission without resolution of symptoms, and with ABG of 7.29/96/101/48.
At approximately 1am that night, she suffered respiratory arrest, and was emergently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with fentanyl and versed sedation.
However, she quickly went into respiratory distress and was re-intubated.
Midday, she self-extubated, and with increased work of breathing and respiratory distress, she was again re-intubated.
She was evaluated daily for possibility of extubation, but the combination of her anxiety and agitation on lowering of sedation and low tidal volumes with low pressure support led to the conclusion that she was not a candidate for extubation.
Post op, her course was marked by tachycardia and hypertension, with sputum cultures continuing to grow MRSA.
On [**11-29**], the patient pulled out her tracheostomy tube; after briefly being intubated, the tracheostomy tube was re-placed that morning, and trach mask trials were re-initiated.
During the intubation on the night of arrival, she became hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s and was given IVF boluses and started on phenylephrine and norepinephrine drips.
This episode of hypotension was ascribed to hypovolemia, LV preload dependence, and sedation.
She then maintained her blood pressure ~90-100 systolic, with hypertensive episodes when anxious/agitated.
On [**2056-11-8**], she spiked fevers to 103.5, developed thickened and copious secretions and failed to wean from vent, and was started on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed vent associated pneumonia.
TTE was negative for vegetations or lesions.
Her last positive blood culture was from [**11-11**], and surveillance cultures remained no growth.
Pt had been treated prior to admission with levaquin for two courses of management of COPD flairs.
CXR on admission showed bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrate concerning for pneuomonia.
Initial sputum sample was positive for gram positive cocci in pairs, a second sample was negative, and cultures only grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Mental status.
However, she had periods of agitation concerning for thrashing movement and for her episodes of self-extubation.
CT-abd on [**2131-11-28**] done for complaint of abdominal tenderness as well as persistent low grade fevers revealed a phlegmon extending from the subcutaneous tissues to the peritoneum with no focal fluid collections.
In addition, she was on steroids while admitted, and consequently her elevated blood glucose levels were managed with insulin drip and then insulin sliding scale with standing NPH.
Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage done at the time of tracheostomy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
