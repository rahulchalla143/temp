Admission Date:  [**2143-11-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-11-14**]   Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Apnea, status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old nursing home patient with a past medical history significant for stroke, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who came in on [**11-2**], for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement.
All of a sudden the patient became apneic and a chest x-ray was obtained which showed a right upper lung collapse which appeared to be secondary to some bronchial mucous plugging.
At that time it was decided to reintubate the patient and the patient was reintubated and a bronchoscopy was done and a significant amount of secretion/bronchial mucous plugging was removed.
A repeat chest x-ray was done which showed reinflation of the right upper lobe after the bronchoscopy.
In addition, the patient also became very hypotensive and was started on Lopressor, Neo, 1 mcg/kg/min and her blood pressure improved from systolic of 60s to 70s to 110s.
The patient also has a history of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the past and so the surgery team who did the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement contact[**Name (NI) **] the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit and asked the patient to be transferred to the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit for further workup and evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Left atrial myxoma, stroke, hypertension, recurrent pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diverticulosis, breast cancer, status post left mastectomy, questionable gastric cancer, hiatal hernia, left proximal humeral fracture, status post wide cataract surgery.
Jugulovenous distension is flat, no lymphadenopathy noted.
Lungs, mild wheezing in the bilateral lower lobes.
Heart, S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops heard.
Abdomen, soft, nondistended, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
Extremities, no edema, no cyanosis and no clubbing, 2+ distal pulses.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm, sinus tachycardiac to 110s, no ST elevation noted, normal intervals.
Chest x-ray, no evidence of pneumothorax, resolution of right upper lung collapse as compared to the previous x-ray that was done prior to the reintubation.
After the procedure the patient was extubated but became apneic and her oxygen saturation dropped and her chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe collapse, and so the patient was reintubated and a bronchoscopy was done with a significant amount of mucous clubbing, secretions were removed.
An attempt was made on [**11-5**], to extubate the patient but the patient failed secondary to increase of secretions and at that time it was also thought to volume overload.
The patient was receiving a significant amount of fluid boluses because of the patient was hypotension, and as we were trying to wean off of the pressor, she was getting more and more fluid.
After the failure of extubation on [**11-5**], it was decided to extensively diurese the patient and treat the patient for her secretions.
Her oxygen saturations were 96 to 98% on 2 liters through the nasal cannula  Cardiovascular - Rate and rhythm, the patient was mostly normal sinus rhythm and would get occasional premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions.
Ischemia, no ischemic changes or signs noted on electrocardiogram.
At that time we decided to start her on broad coverage of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for questionable aspiration pneumonia since she did have the bronchial plugging that lead to the right upper lung collapse.
At that time it was thought that the reason why she had a elevated white count of 25.6 was probably secondary to the stressfulness of the procedure.
12 hours for her known Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization.
A Vancomycin trough level was obtained which was slightly elevated and so based on the pharmacy recommendations, her Vancomycin was changed to 1 gm q.
12 for pseudomonas coverage since her sputum grew out mild to moderate pseudomonas aeruginosa which was sensitive to Cefepime and mild to moderate Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
It was initially thought that this drastic fall is secondary to overhydration since the patient was becoming hypotensive.
In addition, the patient is also getting tube feeds through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and she was having her electrolytes checked, usually b.i.d.
Code - The patient is Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate.
