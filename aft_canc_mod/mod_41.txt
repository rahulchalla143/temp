Admission Date:  [**2149-9-2**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2081-3-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath, cough, increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 year old male with a history of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 30 to 40%, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a [**2149-5-25**] admission for pansensitive Streptococcus pneumococcal pneumonia who presented yesterday with shortness of breath for two days, a cough productive of white sputum, chills, and increased dyspnea on exertion.
mile before becoming winded until three to four days ago when he developed rhinorrhea and congestion.
Then one day later he developed shortness of breath, cough, chills and increased dyspnea on exertion.
He also commenced sharp, substernal nonradiating chest pain which he rated 4 out of 10 in intensity.
This pain was relieved with rest and worsened with cough.
He did have one episode of dry heaves.
He denied green or yellow sputum, hemoptysis or fevers.
He does deny paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and new orthopnea, although at baseline he sleeps on four pillows.
He does note one day of bilateral lower extremity edema.
Congestive heart failure, [**2149-5-25**] ejection fraction of 30 to 40% with moderate mitral regurgitation, [**2146**] ejection fraction of less than 20%; 4.
Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 7.
Left pneumothorax with chest tube placement; 8.
Mild chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3; 15.
Left lower lobe pneumococcal pneumonia in [**2149-5-25**]; 16.
The patient reports compliance with medications and no recent change in medications.
He owned a travel agency company.
General:  Obese male in no acute distress on face mask.
No oral lesions.
Neck:  Supple, full range of motion, no jugulovenous distension appreciated.
Chest:  Bilateral crackles at the bases, right greater than left.
Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Extremities, trace pedal edema, no calf tenderness.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  When the patient presented to the Emergency Department he received an aspirin and because he was thought to be in congestive heart failure he also received 100 mg of Lasix intravenously spread out over two doses.
His initial oxygen requirement in the Intensive Care Unit was 12 liters by face mask with an FIO2 of .5 and was subsequently weaned from the face mask to a nasal cannula once on the floor.
His oxygen requirement slowly improved while in-house, however, his saturations frequently dropped while ambulating.
There were no electrocardiogram changes and he experienced no chest pain while in the hospital.
Infectious disease - The Gram stain of the patient's sputum showed multiple organisms consistent with oral pharyngeal Flora.
The sputum culture grew out oropharyngeal organisms as well as moderate coagulase positive Staphylococcus growth.
He remained afebrile for the remainder of his inpatient stay and he was continued on his 14 day regimen of Levofloxacin 500 mg.  4.
Of note, his PTT was elevated as were his fibrinogen and haptoglobin.
His FDT and D-dimer were also mildly elevated.
It was unclear how much of this was due to mild DIC, how much due to acute phase reaction and how much due to underproduction of coagulation factors by the liver.
Oncology - Because the patient's PTT remained elevated without explanation while in-house and because he had not received regular follow up after his Hodgkin's disease an oncology consultation was obtained.
Renal - The patient initially appeared to have some degree of acute and chronic renal failure, given his elevated BUN and creatinine.
Gastrointestinal - For his history of Crohn's disease with chronic diarrhea, the patient was maintained on Asacol 800 mg p.o.
Fluids were not given after the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor because of his likely congestive heart failure.
His INR was therapeutic or supertherapeutic throughout the hospital stay and so no further deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was required.
