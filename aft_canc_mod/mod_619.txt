As part of his work-up, he was found to have metastatic disease in the liver of unknown primary on CT and ERCP confirmed an ulcerated necrotic mass.
There, the patient denied F/C/N/V, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, and was without diarrhea.
He received IV Vancomycin & Zosyn as well as 2u pRBC's and 3L NS, but he remained persistently tachycardic with hr's in the 100's.
A CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated constipation so he was disimpacted 700-800cc of guaiac positive brown stool.
He was noted to have some minor skin irritation around the anal verge.

| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S DAPTOMYCIN------------       S PENICILLIN G----------     2 S VANCOMYCIN------------ <=0.5 S  Imaging:  CXR [**2185-2-7**]: SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are low, with linear opacities at the lung bases consistent with atelectasis.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with a tortuous aorta and mild cardiomegaly.
There is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
IMPRESSIONS: Bibasilar atelectasis, without other acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Moderate pneumobilia with CBD stent in place, extending from mid CBD into the duodenum.
Wall thickening and inflammatory changes in the second portion of the mediastinum, likely related to ERCP.
Rectum distended with fecal matter, likely impacted, with wall thickening and inflammatory change of the distal rectum.
Large hypodense masses within the liver, incompletely characterized but concerning for metastases.
3.4 cm soft tissue densities in the mesentery adjacent to the duodenum and pancreatic head, mass or enlarged lymph nodes.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
Bilateral hydroureter, with dilation of the ileal conduit to the level of the the abdominal wall hernia; unchanged from prior exams.
Severe degenerative disease.
[**2185-2-17**] Lower Extremity Doppler: No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
[**2185-2-18**] TTE: No obvious vegetations seen, but very limited image quality  [**2185-2-20**]: Abd Ultrasound: Diffusely heterogeneously echogenic liver with multiple areas of hypoechogenicity, concerning for diffuse metastatic disease   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15138**] is an 80 year old Russian-speaking man with h/o multiple malignancies (bladder, colon, acoustic neuroma), chronic kidney disease, hypertension, new ampullary adenocarcinoma, and recent dx of metastatic disease of unknown primary who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with diarrhea and enterococcal bacteremia.
# Septic shock: Patient initally admitted to the ICU and required IVFs along with peripheral vasopressors.
[**12-6**] blood cultures grew enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin.
At time of discharge, he was on IV ampicillin (10 days) without any other positive blood cultures.
It was thought that his bloodstream infection may have originated in his biliary tree vs a GI source.
The family declined a EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] to evaluate for a definitive source of his bacteremia.
It was felt that the patient would be unable to tolerate TEE with a low clinical risk of endocarditis.
# GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Patient has a baseline Hct in low-30's & MCV in mid-70's since [**2181**] by OMR records.
On admission patient with Hct below baseline to 23.4 and manual disimpaction revealed blood clots concerning for GI bleed.
On the floor, he had guiaic positive stools but no frank blood per rectum.
# Malignancies: Patient with history of multiple malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.
Given prognosis of metastatic cancer, a family meeting was held in which the family decided to make the patient DNR/DNI with limited intervention, with the exception of antibiotic treatment for his presumed infection and pain control.
Oncology was consulted but given his poor performance status and multiple other co-morbities, they did not feel that systemic chemotherapy would not be recommended.
Patient is at risk for additional biliary obstructions as well as possible bowel obstructions and additional metastasis.
He is also at risk of infection from cholangitis.
Patient's family is interested in hospice for symptoms control and will readdress depending how he does.
# AVNRT: Several episodes of AVNRT to HR 170s with BP 80-90s/50s-60s was noted when patient was sleeping.
# Decreased Hearing: Patient has history of L acoustic neuroma and bilateral cerumen plugs likely contributing.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Unknown etiology of CKD, but may be secondary to history of bilateral hydronephrosis.
# Recurrent UTI: Patient is status post ureterostomy for bladder cancer in [**2166**] leading to frequent UTI's due to various pathogens resistant to Cipro/Bactrim/Gent/Unasyn.
On admissions, UA was negative and patient had no urinary symptoms.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Enteroccoccal Bacteremia Cholangitis Dementia Hearing Loss Hemorroids AVNRT  Secondary: Ampullary Adenocarcinoma Metastatic Disease of the liver   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for diarrhea and changes in your thinking.
You were given antibiotics and found to have a bacteria called enterococcus in your blood.
Because bacteria were found in your blood, you had a TTE (an ultrasound of your heart) to look for infection on the heart valves.
There was no infection seen on the heart valves.
You were given blood transfusions for a falling blood count.
Given the slow decline of your blood count, this may be partially a result of frequent blood draws.
There was some microscopic blood in your stool as well and you may be losing some blood in your stool.
Given that you had no active signs or symptoms of rapid blood loss you were given transfusions as needed.
