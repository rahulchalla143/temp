T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma over 20 years ago, treated and cured with radiation and chemotherapy.
Operative specimen showed suboptimal necrosis (only 5% necrosis) and her postoperative chemotherapy was switched to AP alternating with IE (ifosfamide/etoposide).
Her chemotherapy course was complicated by profound myelosuppression and mucositis/esophagitis.
Presents with worsening dyspnea (particularly on exertion), fatigue, and upper body/facial edema over the last several days.
She apparently was noted to have small lung nodule or nodules in early [**2194**] by imaging.
However, the symptoms got quickly worse, and one of the lesions, apparently mediastinal in location, began to cause SVC type symptoms.
She was treated with palliative XRT to the mediastinal mass to 18 [**Doctor Last Name **], finished on or around [**8-3**].
Due to extensive prior chemotherapy for her hematologic malignancy and osteosarcoma and previous serious myelosuppression with AP and IE, she was started on a 50% dose of gemcitabine and did NOT receive docetaxel for her 1st cycle.
She feels that her shortness of breath, particularly when she tries to ambulate is worse, and that her face and left arm have begun to swell up over the last 2 days.
Seen in clinic today and was admitted to the hospital for aggressive palliative treatment of her progressive symptoms.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient states that she also has some increased chest pain in the midsternal area over the past 2 days.
Does not describe any acute worsening of her respiratory status, though is tachypneic at rest.
Past Medical History: --T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma 20 years ago treated with chemo and mediastinal irradiation --Osteosarcoma of the proximal left tibia s/p 2 cycles of Adriamycin and Cisplatin in [**9-28**] and [**10-28**], complicated by febrile neutropenia, espophagitis, s/p radical resection on [**2193-12-23**] --Cecal volvulus s/p right partial colectomy --Thyroidectomy [**12-26**] thyroid nodules ([**12-26**] mediastinal radiation) --ARF, pre-renal, resolved --UE DVT [**12-26**] PICC  Social History: Works as rad tech.
No coagulopathy.
Hx of cancer in two maternal aunts of unknown type.
No jaundice, no skin rash.
Tongue coated with some green/whie exudate.
Lungs, clear,with reduced breath sounds on right Heart regular, but tachycardic.
Extremeties: Left upper: edema from the elbow down.
No leg edema, well healed surgical scar in left tibia.
STUDIES: CT CHEST with CONTRAST IMPRESSION [**8-20**]: 1) 16 x 15 x 10cm, new prevascular mediastinal mass occluding a long segment of the superior vena cava, severely compromising the right bronchial tree and right lung pulmonary circulation invading the pericardium, accompanied by new and/or enlarging right lung nodules and bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Segmental pulmonary embolus, left lower lobe.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY VISUALIZATION OF VEINS IMPRESSION [**8-21**]:  1) Recent thrombosis of the left and right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, due to severe encasement of the SVC.
2)A 12 mm x 8 cm stent was placed in the SVC and extended with a 10 mm x 6 cm stent into the left brachiocephalic vein with good angiographic results.
CXR [**8-23**]: Markedly increased bilateral basal consolidations are seen accompanied by bilateral increase in pleural effusion.
This consolidations might be either due to bibasilar atelectasis or massive aspiration.
Mild pulmonary edema is seen.
There is no change in the position of the right central venous line.

1) Mediastinal Mass/SVC syndrome:  Patient has developed a large medistinal mass compressing right upper lobe bronchus, shifting mediastinum to left and compressing right and left atria seen on CT scan.
ECHO done confirming left and right atrial compression, but only physiologic effusion.
She was admitted to Oncology service on [**8-19**] as patient was considering chemotherapy options, although disease has progressed despite chemo/XRT.
After CT scan was ordered showing SVC syndrome, right upper lobe lung compression, subsegmental PE, possible pericardial invasion and compression of right and left atria on Echo, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**8-20**] for closer monitoring.
She remained tachycardic 120-130's (although has been for 1 month) and bp stayed 95-110 systolic (also stable for a month).
Pulmonary performed thoracentesis of L pleural effusion.
Right Main Stem narrowed secondary to external compression.
Pt was given 4 liters of fluid and 1 unit PRBC for procedure.
Over the day, night patient developed increased sputum production and increasing opacity in left lower lobe.
Started on morphine IV for comfort/decreased dyspnea ---> changed to morphine gtt on [**2195-8-24**].
Added scopolamine for secretion management [**8-24**] and ativan prn for agitation.
2) Tachycardia - Likely secondary to atrial irritation/compression with intermittent hypoxia.
Consider heavy heparin products and HIT especially in light of rapid drop.
Anticoagulation contraindicated given bleeding risk and invasion into pericardium.
Possible evolving infarct from PE or new thrombus.
6) Non anion gap acidosis- consistent with persistent hyperventilation.
No diarrhea or ATN noted.
7) Anemia- patient has myelosupression secondary to chemotherapy.
8) Hypothyroid - No further lab draws given comfort measures status.
