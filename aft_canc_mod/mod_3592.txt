History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 41-year-old right-handed man, with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention, s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, chronic pain, who presented to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-11-12**] with increased weakness.
The patients sister reports that he had been having fecal incontinence and diarrhea over the last week, and then developed SOB and acute onset abdominal pain the day of admission.
There were no fevers or CP, but were some chills.
ED COURSE: He was noted to be somnolent and hypotensive.
Labs were notable for elevated lactate 7.1 and acute renal failure (creatinine 1.8).
Scans of head and torso with evidence of possible pneumonia (aspiration) but no other source.
Cardiology and surgery were consulted for questionable cardiogenic shock and acute abdomen, respectively.
MICU COURSE: He was weaned off vasopressors with repeated fluid boluses.
Urine and blood cultures from the ED eventually grew E. coli sensitive to cephalosporins and antibiotics were tailored to cefazolin and flagyl.
But he developed CHF with echocardiogram suggestive of Takotsubos.
He was auto-diuresed and started on ACE inhibitor per Cardiology; no beta-blocker given chronically bradycardic (HR 40-50s, asymptomatic).
Anticoagulation was discussed given apical akinesis but deferred due to risk of bleeding with underlying malignancy.
But he developed thrombocytopenia and heparin products stopped but HIT negative so restarted and platelet counrs have subsequently improved.
Currently the patient complains of mild abdominal pain and loose stools.
No other pain including no chest pain.
Denies nausea or vomiting.

Pertinent since extubation; EXTREMITIES: 3+ edema at hands and feet NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: His Karnofsky Performance Score is 60.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no nystagmus.
Motor Examination: He does not have a drift.
In his left lower extremity, there is weakness at his left [**Last Name (un) 938**] and left tibialis anterior at 4-/5, as well as 4/5 strength at left quadriceps.

Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
C. Diff negative x 3  ECG: Sinus tachycardia @118, no acute st/t changes.
Imaging: CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Bibasilar consolidations.
Properly positioned endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central venous catheter.
No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic findings.
Oral contrast material is noted within the stomach and has not progressed throughout the bowel, and thus evaluation of the bowel is somewhat limited.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal LV akinesis.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with Takatsubo cardiomyopathy.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No vegetations identified.
There is minimal streaky density consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.
Ill-defined increased density in the retrocardiac area may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating retrocardiac density consistent with atelectasis or consolidation unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: The patient is a 41-year-old right-handed man with a history of progressive anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine on high-dose steroids presented with urosepsis.
E. coli grew from blood and urine cultures.
Since transfer to the flow there have been o further fevers or signs of infection.
(2) Acute Renal Failure: Prerenal due to hypotension from septic shock.
Resolved with correction of sepsis and aggressive IVF.
Troponin leak from hypotension rather than ruptured plaque.
Volume overload resolved after diuresis.
He later downtrending again, responed to IVF therefore likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Tender over right AC joint.
(7) Diarrhea: Possibly due to chemotherapy.
Considered C. diff although stools negative x 3.
(8) Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation.
Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention.
Patient also has fecal incontanance.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 14468**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis Pneumonia Acute renal failure cardiomyopathy and NSTEMI Anaplastic astrocytoma of the T-L spine  Secondary dx: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Anemia  Discharge Condition: Comfortable and alert, afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for increased weakness and urinary retention.
Upon arrival to the hospital you entered septic shock from massive infection.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection as well as an pneumonia.
During your treatment course you had a heart attack which weakened your heart.
After much discussion with the oncology team and your family it was decided that your spine cancer is progressing and is not curable.
If you have worsening weakness, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, increased diarrhea, headache, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, or any other worrisome symptom please seek urgent medical attention.
