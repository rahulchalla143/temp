Admission Date:  [**2148-1-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-2-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-6-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 58 year old male with a past medical history remarkable for pericarditis, diverticulosis, status post colostomy and take-down, obstructive sleep apnea, who was evaluated for painless jaundice in [**2147-12-6**].
The patient's CT scan revealed 1.6 by 2.0 centimeter Klatskin tumor with no evidence of liver mass nor encasement of vessels.
The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed normal pancreatic duct but biliary stricture, consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
An MRCT in [**2147-12-6**], revealed a 2 centimeter mass in the porta hepatis consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, with extensive periportal lymphadenopathy.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
HEENT:  Sclerae was icteric with evidence of jaundice.
Mucous membranes were moist; no evidence or oral ulcers.
no cervical lymphadenopathy noted.
Extremities had two plus edema, significantly decreased since discharge from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit; no evidence of rash noted.
Bio-cultures from [**2-5**], Enterococcus species in yeast and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] cultures revealed Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus.
Blood cultures from [**2-5**] showed no growth.
IMAGING:  [**2-5**], cholangiogram:  Patent anastomosis with irregular left hepatic duct with multi-filling defects.
Leakage of contrast material from left hepatic duct leading to a 5 centimeter fluid collection.
[**2-6**] fistulogram:  Drainage of right subhepatic collection after manual suction of 45 cc.
[**2-6**] CT scan of abdomen:  Complete resolution of right subhepatic collection.
However, later on during the day, the patient's hypoxemia worsened secondary to fluid overload and required re-intubation.
A [**1-24**] culture revealed coagulase negative Staphylococcus from blood, one out of four bottles and enterococcus fro peritoneal drain culture.
By [**2-2**], the patient was transferred to the floor on Vancomycin after having discontinued Zosyn and Fluconazole.
The patient had multiple fluid boluses from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit stay resulting in three plus peripheral edea.
Zosyn and Fluconazole were added after consulting with Infectious Disease Service.
With drain directly in proximity to the collection, aggressive suctioning lead to complete evacuation of this collection.
