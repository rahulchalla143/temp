CT revealed a left parietal lesion.
Past Medical History: Obesity, Hyperlipidemia, Diabetes, Hypertension, depression and anxiety, thyroid biopsy   Social History: per son, no tobacco/drugs.
Neuro: Mental status: EO to voice Pupils: PERRL 3mm, tracks examiner Motor: following commands x4 extremities, antigravity x4  Reflexes: R  Br  Pa  Ac Right     1+ 1+  1+  1+ Left      1+ 1+  1+  1+  Toes upgoing bilaterally  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:  VS: 98.2, 62, 138/83, 15, 96% on trach mask HEENT: trach in place, no exudate or erythema noted on examination of tympanic membranes bilaterally CV: RRR PULM: mildly rhonchorous breath sounds throughout.
ABD: soft, NT, ND EXT: no edema  NEURO EXAM: MS - AAOx3 (whispering over the trach) CN - PERRL 3->2, EOMI, tongue midline, face symmetrical, facial sensation intact MOTOR - [**5-17**] throughout SENSATION - intact to light touch throughout   Pertinent Results: [**5-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: 1.
Low lung volumes with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
[**5-22**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: Homogeneously enhancing extra-axial lesion along the left parietal convexity with mild mass effect on the left parietal lobe associated with perilesional edema.
Interval resolution of pulmonary edema has been demonstrated with overall clear lungs currently seen with no definitive evidence of masses or consolidations.
CT shows a partially calcified mass in the left parietooccipital region consistent with a meningioma.
CT angiography demonstrates increased vascularity in the region, but exact origin of this vascular structure is difficult to ascertain given the limited ability of the CTA, but there appears to be some meningeal supply from the superficial aspect of the mass.
The parietooccipital branch of the left middle cerebral/posterior cerebral artery is seen draped over the mass.
Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear, and no acute skeletal abnormalities are detected.
[**5-25**] MRI brain Wand: Unchanged enhancing extra-axial mass lesion along the left parietal region, with mild mass effect on the left parietal lobe and associated with perilesional edema.
[**5-26**] CT head: Expected post-surgical changes with a small amount of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus in the region of previously visualized left occipital mass.
Post-surgical changes status post resection of left parietal extra-axial mass, likely representing meningioma.
No evidence of residual enhancement to suggest residual tumor.
There is an area of slow diffusion anterior to the resection cavity, likely representing an area of ischemia or related to surgical procedure.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Mildly enlarged heart size is stable, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
She was continued on Keppra for seizure phophylaxis and steroids for cerebral edema.
She underwent MRI imaging which revealed a left parietal lesion, likely meningioma.
She was placed on dexamethasone 4Q6 for the mass but also for airway edema.
Postoperative head CT showed post operative changes, but was stable.
On [**5-28**] she was unable to be extubated due to a lack of cuff leak.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
9. fluticasone 50 mcg/actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: One (1) Spray Nasal Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for rhinitis.
12. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for continuing Medical Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Left parietal mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
While you are on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
F.  We made the following changes to your medications: 1) We STARTED you on TYLENOL 650mg every 6 hours as needed for pain or fever.
3) We STARTED you on BISACODYL 10mg once a day as needed for constipation.
8) We STARTED you on ALBUTEROL 6 puffs inhaled every 6 hours as needed for SOB/wheeze.
