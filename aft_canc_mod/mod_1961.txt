The patient had presented in the Emergency Department with confusion, word-finding difficulty, and cognitive slowing.
Computerized axial tomography scan of her head as well as an magnetic resonance imaging scan performed in [**Month (only) 216**] showed a 3 cm left frontal and a left parietal metastases.
There was some extensive surrounding edema at the time with some compression of the body of the left lateral ventricle.
Pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
A computerized axial tomography scan of the chest performed on [**2140-7-27**] showed a mass in the left lower lobe.
She had stereotactic radiosurgery to the left frontal and left parietal surgical bed in [**2140-9-7**].
Following further workup there was no evidence of further metastatic disease and given the patient's young age, the Oncology Division as well as the Thoracic Surgery staff felt that the patient's survival may benefit from surgical resection of the lung mass.
Metastatic lung cancer as mentioned above.
Left foot drop.
Osteomyelitis of the left lower extremity.
Bilateral lower extremity edema times approximately nine months (etiology unclear.
The patient has also required increasing doses of narcotic medications to control lower extremity pain believed related to that edema.)
Traumatic splenectomy, effusion of the right wrist, straightening of the left great toe subsequent to osteomyelitis.
Right breast duct excision.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The procedure was uncomplicated with an estimated blood loss of 150 cc.
In a postoperative area the patient was noted to have a new left hemiparesis.
An emergent computerized axial tomography scan of her head was obtained which revealed a large area of hemorrhage in the right temporal and parietal region.
On postoperative day #2, the patient required reintubation for extreme agitation where the patient attempted to get out of bed, pulling her line and flashing on her bed.
Following intubation, the patient had a bronchoscopy performed for copious secretions.
The bronchoscopy revealed that her left lower lobectomy stump site was intact with no bleeding.
There was copious clear sputum on the right.
The site was immediately dressed appropriately and a chest x-ray performed which revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.
Following the removal of the chest tubes, the patient had a chest x-ray which revealed a significant pneumothorax.
At this time, the patient remained disoriented, confused and mildly agitated.
On postoperative day #9, the patient had a bedside swallow evaluation.
Over the following few days, the patient made some slight improvement, but on the morning of postoperative day #13 was noted to be significantly improved.
The patient remained confused but easily reoriented.
She remained intermittently agitated but could be calmed down with the family present.
On postoperative day #15, the patient pulled out her nasogastric feeding tube.
She was calmer, responding appropriately to questions, moving all extremities and still had some slight weakness on the left.
Her pain was well controlled.
The patient had a very good appetite and was tolerating her food with no problems.
The patient's pigtail catheter into the chest had been removed without complications.
The patient had been afebrile essentially throughout her admission.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable from a thoracic surgery standpoint and improving from a neurological standpoint.
Adenocarcinoma of the lung, left lower lobe.
Hemorrhagic stroke, right parietal area.
