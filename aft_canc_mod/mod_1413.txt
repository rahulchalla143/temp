Admission Date:  [**2115-7-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-8-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-4-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 24-year-old [**Country **] Rican gentleman with a history of CML status post matched unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant, whose hospital course has been complicated with severe graft-versus-host disease of skin, GI tract, and liver, who presents today with acute onset of abdominal pain.
Patient has been on home TPN as well as a variety of regimens for his graft-versus-host disease including photophoresis and most recently treated with CellCept [**Pager number **] mg [**Hospital1 **] and cyclosporin.
He comes in today complaining of intermittent constipation for 10 days, and also with a relatively acute onset of localized abdominal pain in the periumbilical area.
He has been afebrile with no other complaints.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia diagnosed in [**2113-6-30**], positive [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome, status post MUD BMT [**2114-8-30**] complicated by severe engraftment syndrome requiring intubation.
Severe graft-versus-host disease of abdominal tract, skin, and liver.
History of Clostridium difficile colitis.
Status post hernia repair.
Oropharynx:  Red with sore on upper lip, no evidence of thrush.
Pulmonary:  Scattered crackles at right base.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft with localized tenderness in the periumbilical area, no clear guarding, questionable minimal rebound, right upper quadrant epigastric or left upper quadrant tenderness.
GI:  The patient received abdominal CT scan on admission which showed free air within the abdomen and a moderate amount of free fluid.
There was also evidence of mild thickening of the wall of multiple distal small bowel loops, but difficult to evaluate given no oral contrast.
On [**7-14**], he received an exploratory laparotomy with drainage of intraabdominal abscess as well as an oversew of perforated pyloric channel ulcer with omental ........... patch.
After surgery, the patient was started on aggressive bowel regimen for constipation and experienced gradual resolution in his pain.
The patient was placed on TPN throughout his hospitalization, but demonstrated an increasing appetite.
Hematology/Oncology:  Patient admitted with a history of CML with severe graft-versus-host disease of the skin, gut, and liver.
Patient was also instructed to continue use of his tacrolimus, which he used topically for his graft-versus-host disease complications of his lips.
The patient's generally decreasing LFTs as well as his ability to form stool indicated that his graft-versus-host disease was being sufficiently treated.
Infectious Disease:  A peritoneal swab specimen obtained during surgery grew out Pseudomonas and fungus, and the patient was started on fluconazole, Vancomycin, and Flagyl shortly after surgery.
The evening of his transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] and the following morning, the patient developed low-grade fevers.
The patient was placed back on Zosyn per ID approval, and once a chest x-ray became positive for a new left basilar infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, levofloxacin was added to his antibiotic regimen.
A CT scan performed on [**7-22**] was significant for multifocal patchy pulmonary opacities in the peribronchial distribution involving mid and lower lung zones with associated bronchial obstruction of segments of the left lower lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonia versus fungal infection.
Given these findings, expectorated sputum and induced sputum samples were sent for culture.
The cultures from the sputum samples eventually grew out Aspergillus fumigatus.
A CT scan performed on [**7-25**] was significant for interval resolution of a mucoid impaction of the left lower lobe airways, however, tree ............... opacities and ill-defined peribronchial nodules and foci of consolidations were discovered primarily in the lower lobes, but also in the right middle lobe and lingula.
These findings were considered consistent with worsening infection with a possibility of aspergillus infection.
Given these sputum culture results as well as these radiological findings, the patient was started on voreconazole per recommendation of the Infectious Disease team.
Once the patient was afebrile for several days, and demonstrated remarkable clinical improvement, Zosyn was discontinued on [**7-27**].
Infectious Diseases was consulted and recommended changing voreconazole to caspofungin secondary to voreconazole's effect on the liver.
Cardiovascular:  After transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], the patient's blood pressure became gradually increased with diastolic blood pressure over 100.
The patient's cyclosporin levels were found to be markedly elevated given thought to be secondary to voreconazole increasing their levels.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia status post MUD transplant complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease of his skin, gut, and liver.
Status post surgery for perforated pyloric channel ulcer.
