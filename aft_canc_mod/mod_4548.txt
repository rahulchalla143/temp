INDICATIONS:  This gentleman has esophageal cancer and has undergone neoadjuvant treatment.
He has previously undergone laparoscopy and laparoscopic jejunostomy.
FINDINGS:  There was inflammatory change consistent with radiotherapy.
In the thoracic portion, there was no evidence of metastatic disease nor were there any particularly concerning enlarged lymph nodes.
The tumor itself appeared to become extremely fibrotic and there was no evidence of mucosal tumor when the specimen was removed, although there was a great deal of thickening at the esophagogastric junction which could either be a complete response of scarring or submucosal tumor.
We purposely left the tissue right around the thoracic duct but then were able to dissect down right down onto the aorta.
A #5 trocar was placed laterally on the left, and #12 dilating ports were placed superiorly on the left and the midclavicular line on the right and laterally on the right.
At this point, we encountered no other metastatic disease or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes .
Because the patient was fairly large and our incision was a little bit on the low side, we were going to be forced to use a longer scope for the upper dissection, and therefore we went up as far as we could with our regular scope and then started from that area on the greater curve and worked towards the patient's right.
The gastrohepatic omentum was then opened up to the level of the diaphragm with Harmonic scissors.
Working from below, we were then able to identify the tissue around the left gastric artery.
At this point, we were satisfied with the entire stomach had been mobilized with the exception of the uppermost portion around the hiatus, which we saved until last to prevent pressurized air entering the thoracic cavity.
The new gastric conduit was then sutured to the specimen using 3 sutures of 2-0 silk in order to facilitate transfer through the mediastinum.
Of interest, is that we originally had a small amount of difficulty because the Penrose drain was actually a lot higher than we thought it would be.
The nasogastric tube was then switched to the stomach and extra amounts of esophagus and stomach were then divided with another application of the [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler.
The area was checked for hemostasis which was adequate.
I did try gentle attempts with a slightly smaller tube which way in away I was not totally satisfied.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] had primary responsibility in the chest and I in the abdomen, and both shared responsibility in the neck.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-8-17**] 10:53 PM  Reason: ccvl pulled back  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with esophageal CA s/p esophagectomy REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ccvl pulled back CLINICAL INDICATION: Central line pulled back.
FINDINGS: There is a right internal jugular catheter with distal tip projecting over the distal SVC.
Again noted small amount of subcutaneous emphysema projecting along the right thorax, decreased in amount from the prior examination.
Unchanged plate-like atelectasis seen at the left lung base.
No effusions or consolidations seen.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-8-21**] 7:14 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval ptx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57 year old man with esophageal CA s/p esophagectomy now w/ CT on WS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval ptx AP CHEST, 7:35 A.M. [**8-21**].
HISTORY: Esophageal carcinoma.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-17**] through 11:  Small left pleural effusion is decreasing.
Left basal atelectasis has improved.
No pneumothorax.
Mild distention of the neoesophagus is stable.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2198-8-23**] 2:15 PM  Reason: please eval for interval change, ptx s/p CT d/c  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 57M s/p esophagogastrectomy, chest tube now d/c REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for interval change, ptx s/p CT d/c CHEST, PA AND LATERAL  INDICATION: Status post esophagectomy, chest tube now discontinued.
Surgical subcutaneous clips still seen overlying the left apical mediastinal area.
The previously described residual apical pneumothorax persists but has decreased in size and measures now approximately 2 cm.
No other new abnormalities have developed.
Plate atelectasis remains on left base and obliteration of lower descending aortic contour is suggestive of postoperative atelectasis in left lower lobe.
No new abnormalities have developed in the pulmonary fields and no evidence of pulmonary congestion is present.
IMPRESSION: Persistent slightly smaller right apical pneumothorax.
No new pulmonary abnormalities after removal of tubes and line.
Brief Hospital Course: There were no intra-operative complications and he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit with a foley catheter, right sided chest tube, nasogastric tube, jejunostomy feeding tube, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drainage tube.
He required intravenous fluid bolussing for low urine output and mild hypotension; a Levophed drip was also started which he was weaned off successfully.
POD 1 he had an episode of desaturation and tachycardia after being transferred from the bed to a chair, an electrocardiogram showed no acute changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
On POD 4 he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, he remained afebrile and was oxygenating well on nasal cannula.
His chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate left sided pleural effusion with atelectasis, no pneumothorax; the thoracic service maintained the chest tube to wall suction.
On POD 5 he had +flatus, +bowel movement and a swallow study which demonstrated no leak from the surgery; his nasogastric tube was removed and his diet was advanced which he tolerated.
On POD 6 his chest tube and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] was removed by thoracic surgery, a follow-up X-Ray demonstrated no pneumothorax.
On POD 7 his abdominal incision was noted to be reddened without drainage, he was started on Kefzol which he will continue for five days.
At the time of discharge his pain was well controlled with oxycodone elixir, he remained afebrile and was tolerating both a clear liquid diet and tube feeds.
