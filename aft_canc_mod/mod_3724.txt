Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**10-2**]: Rickham Catheter Placement   History of Present Illness: [**Known lastname 14537**] is a 53 year-old woman with h/o metastatic breast CA to liver and brain, chronic LE weakness, ?chronic dyspnea who is being transferred from the neurosurgical service for spinal XRT.
She is well known to this service from her previous hospitalization, when she presented with urinary retention, back pain, and worsening shortness of breath.
She was started on dexamethasone, treated for UTI, and her symptoms improved until discharge, when she was voiding on her own and without any more back pain.
[**Known lastname 4338**] of her C-T-L spine during that hospital course showed no cord compression, but there were three distinct lesions noted in the thoracic cord, likely representing metastatic disease; there was question of leptomeningeal involvement of the tumor.
Radiation oncology had been consulted and believed the thoracic lesions were unlikely the cause of her symptoms.
She denies any associated symptoms, including chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness.
On admission her neuro exam showed A&Ox3, general weakness, no focal deficits.

Interval placement of a right ventriculostomy catheter with slight interval improvement of prominence of the bilateral ventricles.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year-old woman with history of metastatic breast cancer to liver and brain, transferred from neurosurgical service status post [**Last Name (un) **] catheter (ventriculostomy tube) placement for XRT to C7-T3 and T8-L2.
METASTATIC BREAST CANCER She was transferred to the oncologic medicine service from neurosurgery after venticulostomy tube had been placed.
She underwent follow-up LP and cytology showed atypical cells.
[**Last Name (un) 4338**] of her brain showed diffuse cerbral metastatic disease that was unchanged from prior.
The treatment was without complications.
HISTORY OF URINARY RETENTION She has a history of urinary retention that started about three weeks ago.
The symptoms transiently resolved after steroids were increased during her previous hospitalization.
We are hoping that her symptoms may improve as her metastatic CNS disease is treated.
HYPERTENSION We uptitrated her home HCTZ from 25 mg to 50 mg once daily.
