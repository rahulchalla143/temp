She has noted these symptoms since about [**12-16**] and they have progressed from tingling to numbness.
She also notes for the past 2 weeks she has had weakness &numbness of her LLE, for the past 1 week she has been unable to flex her hip, extend her knee, or dorsiflex her foot.
She also complains of low back pain.
This morning she had difficulty holding her urine to make it to the bath room.
Open MRI (see below) showed bony disease of the greater wings of sphenoid, extending into the optic canal, and bony involvement of the mandible approaching the inferior alveolar nerve canal.
Past Medical History: Metastatic breast cancer with verterbral metastasis s/p XRT to thoracic spine & chemotherapy HTN Morbid Obesity Depression Anemia Post partum cardiomyopathy- EF now improved to 45-50% h/o peritonsillar abscess [**2101**] s/p I&D ?transfusion reaction recently ?anxiety   Social History: Lives at home with husband and children.
Physical Exam: T 97.5 HR 95 BP 130/95 RR 16 100%RA GENERAL: NAD, AOX3, Speaking in full sentences HEENT: PEERLA, No scleral icterus.
CV: S1 S2 No M/R/G PULM: Clear to ausculation bilaterally ABDOMEN: Morbid Obesity, soft, Non-Tender, Non-Distended, BS+ EXTREMITY: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema NEURO: Alert and Oriented x3.
Bilateral mental area lacking sensation.
Mild left facial droop.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left lower extremity weakness and urinaryincontinence, rule out cord compression.
FINDINGS: Diffuse metastatic lesions are identified in the cervical vertebral bodies on the partially visualized upper thoracic region.
Mild compression of the inferior endplate of C7 vertebra and mild anterior wedging of T4 vertebra are identified.
There is no cord compression seen or epidural mass.
There is no abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse bony metastatic disease.
No cord compression seen.
FINDINGS: Diffuse bony metastatic lesions are identified in the thoracic region.
No evidence of epidural mass or spinal cord compression seen.
There is no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities identified.
No acute compression fracture seen.
Diffuse metastatic lesions are identified in the liver and also an area of atelectasis seen in the left lower lung.
No abnormal intraspinal enhancement.
No cord compression.
FINDINGS: Diffuse bony metastasis is identified in the lumbar region and in the visualized sacrum.
There is no evidence of high-grade thecal sac compression identified.
No epidural mass is seen.
At L4-5, there is diffuse disc bulge identified indenting the thecal sac with mild left-sided and moderate right-sided foraminal narrowing.
The disc bulging and a small protrusion is in contact with exiting right [**Name (NI) 5774**] nerve root at this level.
At L5-S1 level, mild disc bulging identified.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse bony metastatic disease.
No evidence of epidural mass or high-grade thecal sac compression.
Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar region as described above.
COMMENT: Compared to the previous MRI of [**2102-7-5**], there appears to be some progression of bony metastatic lesions in the spine.
No epidural mass is seen.
Pertinent Labs: [**2103-12-22**] 05:14AM BLOOD calTIBC-298 VitB12-> [**2094**] Folate-8.4 Ferritn-> [**2094**] TRF-229 [**2103-12-22**] 05:14AM BLOOD Calcium-9.8 Phos-5.9* Mg-1.6 Iron-245*  Brief Hospital Course: 40F with metastatic breast CA to bone presenting with facial numbness and leg weakness and urinary incontinence.
# Mental Numbness: The patient presented with left sided facial weakness and bilateral mental numbness.
This was thought to be secondary to metastic disease.
The patient underwent a single cranial XRT treatment and subsequently her left sided facial weakness and numbness resolved.
Neuro-Onc was consulted and stated "This is most likely localized in the jaw but not in the principal or spinal gnaglia of V." The patient stated her mental numbess was much improved at the time of discharge.
# Left Sided Visual Changes: The patient reported black spots in her vision upon presentation.
This was thought to be second to optic nerve compression secondary to tumor.
# Leg Weakness and r/o Cord Comprssion: The patient reported 5 to 7 day history of left lower extremity and numbness prior to admission.
In addition she had noted urinary incontinence.
The initial differential included deficits to cord compression vs a central process.
The patient underwent a MRI spine (requiring subsequent intubation and transfer to the unit for extubation, details of which are above), that did not reveal evidence of cord compression.
The patient continued to receive PO dexamethasone and subsequently her leg weakness and numbness completely at the time of discharge.
# Anemia of Chronic Disease: The patient presented with a Hct of 26.
Iron studies that were sent that were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Disp:*21 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Metstatic Breast CA - Mental Neuropathy - r/o Cord Compression - r/o Left Optic Nerve Compression   Discharge Condition: Good.
Patients left lower extremity weakness completly resolved.
Left lower extremity numbness completely resolved.
Left visual changes completely resolved.
Left facial numbess resolved with exception to mild numbess on the patients chin.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to hosptial with facial numbness, blurred vision in your left eye and left leg weakness and numbness.
Please return to hospital if you experience worsening back pain, loss of urine or stool, numbess in your lower extremities, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, worsening visual changes.
