He also had significant electrolyte imbalances, tachycardia, and tachypnea expected from this protocol.
On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, patient had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.
At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had an episode of nausea and vomiting.
Biologics attending was not concerned about other parameters, but was worried abt bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding given his plts have dropped in the past few days.
Pt has guiac positive brown stools, but complains of hemorrhoids and some rectal irritation that may be contributing.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx per OMED notes: Pt was diagnosed with melanoma in [**4-/2167**] when he was found to have a mole on his left abdomen.
He underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time which revealed no residual melanoma and the 3 sentinel nodes were negative.
Two years later in [**4-18**], he developed a red raised nodule under the scar of the local excision.
Recent PET/CT done revealed a left axillary lymphadenopathy as well as 2 liver lesions.
Family History: Father with lung cancer  Physical Exam: PE:  98.2  133-152/72-75  HR 132  RR 28  100% 4L NC Gen: obese, breathing rapidly, no acute distress, comfortable, alert HEENT: mm dry, op clear, neck supple with tripple lumen in place, eomi CV: distant HS, tachy s1s2 no m/r/g Lungs: crackles noted bilat, L>R, otherwise clear Abd: obsese, multiple metastatic nodules palpable on L side of abdomen, soft, nt/nd, active bs Ext: 1+ edema bilat Rectal: brown guiac positive stools  Pertinent Results: CXR PORTABLE [**3-27**] IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy basilar opacities likely due to atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
[**2170-3-31**] CXR PORTABLE IMPRESSION: New diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities compatible with pulmonary edema.
Again seen extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
There is more dense consolidation in left lower lobe with air bronchogram, compatible with pneumonia.
[**2170-4-2**] BILATERAL LE DOPPLER IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Multiple parapelvic cysts.
Right kidney stone.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
No evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
Two hypoechoic liver lesions likely corresponding to the lesions seen on CT. Metastatic disease to the liver is within the differential.
[**2170-4-9**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] and 24: Left lower lobe consolidation is clearing, probably resolving atelectasis.
Pulmonary vascular congestion is present but edema has not returned.
Azygous distention indicates volume overload.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes through the mid stomach and out of view.
*** CULTURE DATA *** [**4-11**] urine cx neg [**4-10**] blood cx X 6 pending [**4-10**] sputum cx: 2+ GPC in pairs, sparse growth oropharyngeal flora [**4-10**] stool: O&P pending [**4-7**] blood cultures neg [**4-7**] worm macroscopic pending [**4-6**] CMV VL not detected [**4-6**] Crytococcus negative [**4-5**] Rapid resp viral negative [**4-5**] BAL: oropharyngeal flora, no PMN, no microorg, neg fungal, AFB   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, [**2170-3-29**], patient had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.
At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had an episode of nausea and vomiting.
The covering MD noted 2 very large blood clots in the emesis.
Biologics attending was not concerned about other parameters, but was worried about bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding given his plts have dropped in the past few days.
Pt has guiac positive brown stools, and complained of hemorrhoids and some rectal irritation that may be contributing.
On [**4-1**], the pt was intubated for respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema thought to be secondary to capillary leak syndrome from HD IL-2.
Another reason abx d/c'd was b/c pt developed a rash thought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which improved post d/c abx.
ID was consulted [**4-4**] for continued fevers and recommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl.
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped [**4-8**]), RUQ US to r/o cholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give steroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm source.
Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs. PNA.
Also, he was noted to have renal insufficiency, with Cr to 1.6, and eosinophilia, with presumed AIN.
They felt he had a number of reasons to have ARF, including: capillary leak syndrome, NSAIDs, infection, contrast on [**4-2**], and drug reaction though no eos or WBC in urine.
The pt's creatinine demonstrated slow improvement, was 1.4 [**4-7**], and on transfer from ICU, his Cr was 0.9 (baseline).
Subjectively on transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the medical floor, the pt felt well, is laughing and joking with family, and has no pain complaints.
No abd pain.
No diarrhea or constipation.
No chest pain or shortness of breath.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ Impression:  A/P: 69 M with metastatic melanoma s/p IL-2 therapy, last dose at 3 pm [**3-29**], now with fevers, resp failure [**2-15**] non-cardiogenic pulm edema; now improving, extubated [**4-12**], and satting well on NC.
Pulmonary status s/p respiratory distress: Mr. [**Known lastname 64730**] was intubated initially [**3-31**] for resp distress, thought secondary to non-cardiogenic pulm edema from capillary leak syndrome from Il-2, with possible contribution from PNA.
LLL inbfiltrate on CXR, fevers, but sputum never grew anything, so unclear if PNA vs atalectasis.
Chest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs PNA.
Lenis were neg, but he did not have a CTA because of renal failure.
He has no h/o CHF, COPD or asthma.
No Echo on file.
The pt was then taken off all abx on [**4-11**] because all cx data was negative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial nephritis given eosinophilia, ARF, rash versus due to his melanoma and IL'2 treatment.
# ARF, resolved: this was thought to be acute interstitial nephritis given fever, rash and ARF with peripheral eosinophilia.
All work up unrevealing to date, and fevers tapered off.
Afebrile for 6 days prior to leaving ICU.
He has remained afebrile on the medical floor and has been instructed to report to the ED for fever, chills.
Hypernatremia, resolved: Likely due to increase insensible lossess.
?Line infection:  Pt was continuing to spike fevers in the ICU with a negative panculture workup and no infiltrate.
His line was pulled, no drainage and erythema at site.
His restaging lung CT, head CT showed only mediastinal nodes largest 1.7 cm, could not assess for pulm nodules given pulm edema.
GI Bleed:  The pt had emesis with large clots on [**3-28**].
No further bleeding, hct has since remained stable stable.
His Hct has remained stable, as well as his vital signs.
#  Confusion/ICU psychosis:  Pt had vivid dreams as well as hallucinations while in the ICU, and would often speak inappropriately at times or answer questions with responses unrelated.
Nutrition: The pt initially failed his speech and swallow study, however the study was done a few hours post extubation, when the pt still had copious secretions.
He did not experience any choking or coughing episodes with eating, and he is tolerating a po diet well.
We did not repeat his swallow study.
He does not appear to be an aspiration risk now.
