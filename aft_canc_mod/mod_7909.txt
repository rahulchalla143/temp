Head CT was performed and demonstrated a large left frontal mass and patient was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation.
U/a was positive for glucosuria and ketones with blood but no rbcs.
ECG demonstrated no ischemic changes.
Chest radiograph demonstrated no acute process.
CT head without contrast demonstrated large left frontal extraxial mass, with associated mass effect.

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
- Outside Hospital CT Head without contrast [**2107-2-6**]: Prelim read: Large left frontal extraxial mass, with associated mass effect, and djacent white matter edema.
- CT head without contrast: There is a 5.6 x 6.5 cm extra-axial mass which is relatively homogeneously hyperdense without calcifications centered in the left frontal convexity and exerting mass effect on the adjacent frontal lobes bilaterally with a small amount of surrounding edema.
This mass displaces the midline structures approximately 2.3 cm to the right.
The frontal horns of both lateral ventricles are compressed due to the mass effect exerted upon them.
No hydrocephalus is present.
No intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
Large extra-axial mass centered in the left frontal convexity, most likely represents a meningioma.
[**2108-2-8**] - CTA Head: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Redemonstrated is a large extra-axial left frontal mass measuring 7.1 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm (CC x AP x transverse).
A 3-cm region of low density within the inferior, posterior aspect of the mass is better demonstrated today.
Mass effect upon and hypodense change within the adjacent brain is unchanged with posterior and lateral displacement of the corpus callosum and left greater than right frontal lobes.
There are multiple calcifications within the lesion.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or interval cortical infarct.
CTA HEAD: There is mild calcific arteriosclerosis of the carotid siphons.
The cavernous and more distal segments of the intracranial left internal carotid artery are moderately, diffusely small in caliber.
The A2 and distal ACA branches are displaced laterally and posteriorly by the mass.
The left M1 segment is slightly larger in caliber than the more proximal left ICA.
There is no evidence of aneurysm.
The mass densely enhances with portions of persistent low density particularly in the inferior/posterior aspect.
The mass abuts the left frontal bone along the anterior vertex in the left aspect of the falx.
IMPRESSION: Large extra-axial left frontal mass with dense but heterogeneous enhancement, abutting and displacing the falx and abutting the anterior left frontal bone.
The regions of low intensity within the mass are better seen today compared to the prior examination and likely represent regions of cystic degeneration.
The somewhat small in caliber distal left internal carotid artery may represent a combination of hypoplasia and underlying atherosclerosis disease.
No evidence of pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
No focal parenchymal opacities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Small amount of post operative acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Postoperative changes status post resection of large left frontal extra-axial mass with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation anterior left frontal lobe.
[**2108-2-18**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes with hemorrhage in the operative bed precluding evaluation for residual neoplasm.Small foci of restricted diffusion in the left frontal lobe which could represent postoperative cytotoxic edema or ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old female with T2DM initially with unknown history was transferred for hypothermia, witnessed seizure, hyperglycemia, newly found left frontal mass intubated from OSH on [**2108-2-6**] and discharged on [**2108-3-19**]  #.
Altered mental status.
By reconstructing her recent history, patient could have had a seizure and in post-ictal state [**2-22**] left frontal mass or altered personality/behavior [**2-22**] left frontal mass leading to her social situation (homeless) and inability to care for herself with ultimate DKA/HHS/HONC.
It is impossible to know the exact cause that led to patient's initial presentation with altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection.
However, during her stay in the MICU as well as on the Medicine Floor ([**2108-2-6**]), she exhibited evidence of delirium with wax and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and fluctuating attention span.
No pharmacological agents were necessary because she did not show signs of agitation.
However, while on the medicine service, patient also showed signs of inhibited personality and pathy, which could be result of the the left frontal mass.
By [**2108-2-17**], patient was able to answer questions with [**Hospital1 2824**] content rather than single word answers but continued with evidence of delirium.
This created radiographical evidence of midline shift as well as edema.
Her level was measured on a regular basis and dosed after adjusting for low albumin (2.8) for goal of [**11-8**]..  CTA showed obvious necrosis and complex vascularization of the tumor.
Repeat CT head on [**2108-2-13**] did not show increased edema or changes compared to prior.
A post op MRI showed post op changes and resection of tumor.
She will need to have outpatient mammography done to screen for breast cancer given association with meningioma.
Diabetic ketoacidosis/HHS/HONC and Type 2 DM.
Patient presented with high blood sugar, ketosis, severe anion metabolic acidosis.
Initially she was maintained on an insulin gtt and then transitioned to ISS when her anion gap closed.
As her oral intake improved, she was transitioned and titrated to [**Hospital1 **] Novolin N 15 units with meal time Novolog 5 unit and an aggressive ISS given patient was on dexamethasone prior to surgery.
This is due to prolonged supine position on the ground and hypothermia.
The extend of her frostbites include 2 degree with large bullae and skin loss and spread from bilaterally buttocks to entire posterior thighs as well as right sided lateroposterior leg (~17-20% loss).
While on the Medicine Floor, care was given per pressure ulcer guideline.
Support surface was the First Step Select MRS [**Last Name (STitle) **] low air loss and moisture management.
She had her wound cared for twice a day with wound cleansers.
She was kept on IVF almost continuously given the amount of insensible fluid loss.
By the time she went to surgery on [**2108-2-17**], there is a lot of signs for re-epithelialization.
There was no new focal finding on exam and recent CXR was negative.
While on the Medicine floor, patient had borderline fever often in the low 100.0-100.7.
However, there was no focal findings on exam.
(Foley catheter was kept to prevent her wounds from getting irritated by the urine or causing infection to her wounds.)
There was no GI symptoms.
Her wounds were also without signs of infection.
ABG showed mild respiratory alkalosis but PaO2 > 80% is less suggestive of PE.
Tachycardia is also stable and slightly improved with fluid resuscitation from 110s to 100s.
Sinus tachycardia.
Initially thought to be hypovolemia, insensible loss from significant skin break down, and the stress.
She was without respiratory symptoms and ABG results not suggestive of PE.
Metoprolol was started as a way to control her heart rate for risk reduction and to also lower her BP.
Iron deficiency anemia.
No baseline Hct available.
This suggests predominance of iron deficiency anemia.
Her initial EKG showed elevated J points in V2-V4 and small [**Doctor Last Name **] waves.
Her Hgb was also elevated as expected with her initial temperature.
Patient initially presented with elevated CK, blood in the urine but no RBCs seen in urine.
Acute renal failure.
It is suspected that the inital lower creatinine (0.6) occurred in the setting of hypothermia, but as the body rewarmed, the true renal function begins to show.
It is likely from hypovolemia and the seizure.
There was an initial concern for phenytoin to be the cause, but this resolved spontaneously, possibly confounded by being on dexamethasone as well.
Code:  Presumed full given patient's delirium and initial inability to reach patient's family.
Social Situation/Formal Consent.
Formal consent was obtained from the daughter because she is the next of kins given patient's delirium at the time.
# Communication.
Wound nursing was re-consulted due to left leg wound from hypothermia.
They commented that the wounds were showing drastic signs of improvement.
-On [**2-23**] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance in managing her blood glucose leveles which have been fluctating as well as for assistance in long term management as her HgbA1C was 13 upon admission.
She was accepted by St [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Location (un) **] but must first determine somewhere for her to go once she is done with rehab as she is homeless currently.
on [**3-1**] she developed some nausea and had 2 episodes of emesis.
A KUB was ordered, which demonstrated no acute abnormality.
