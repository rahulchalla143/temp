On admission, she was found to have a partial large bowel obstruction at the sigmoid colon with the transition point at the location of her mass.
She was also found on CT scan to incidentally have four pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
1-cm nodule in the left lung base should be further evaluated with a dedicated chest CT on a non-emergent basis.
Dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel with relative transition point at the level of the sigmoid colon.
Distended large bowel.
Segment of the descending colon appears thickened and irregular which may be related to recent colonoscopy.
No free air seen.
Severe cecal dilatation to 10.9 cm.
No free air or pneumatosis.
Four pulmonary nodules measuring up to 11 mm within the lungs bilaterally are most consistent with metastatic disease.
