If there is concern for acute ischemia, MRI with DWI is more sensitive.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure.
Admitted for workup and became acutely agitated in CT.
His altered mental status cleared.
We felt his hyperkalemia may have been due to acute renal failure, allthough despite fluid challenge to the point of oxygen requirement, his creatinine had been slow to improve.
He had an abnomrmal blood gas, which was consistent with a respiratory alkalosis and a metabolic acidosis.
In addition to a urinary anion gap that was posative @ 40, we flt this consistent with an RTA, possible type 4 RTA, which also could have contributed to his hyperkalemia.
Altered Mental Status:  Concern for infectious process given fever to 102.5, received cefepime in ED.
# Hyperkalemia:  Unclear cause, not an issue during floor stay.
# CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): No active issues.
# Chronic Diasolic heart failure.
(EF 50%): No active issues.
