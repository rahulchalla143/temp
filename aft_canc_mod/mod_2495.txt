HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of diverticular bleed in the past and mantle cell lymphoma who was in his usual state of bright red blood per rectum and was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
He had a large hematocrit drop of 12 points from 38 down to 26 without any hemodynamic instability.
The bleeding scan there revealed bleeding of the hepatic flexure making this largely a large bowel bleed.
He complained of no abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting, no hematemesis, and most importantly no bright red blood per rectum.
He had no shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations.
An angiogram was performed which revealed no bleeding and, therefore, he had no embolization.
Mantle cell lymphoma diagnosed in [**2132**], status post XRT and chemotherapy, recently diagnosed with radiation pneumonitis, started on prednisone.
Diabetes mellitus, currently diet-controlled.
Atrial fibrillation, two episodes, always in the context of surgery.
Diverticulosis with the previous GI bleed in [**2124**].
The patient had a sigmoidoscopy with no sources localized.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of colon cancer or diverticulosis.
General:  The patient was a comfortable gentleman in no acute distress.
HEENT:  No icterus.
Neck:  Supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  A consultation with the GI Service was obtained and given that there was no bleeding seen on angiography their recommendations were to proceed with colonoscopy.
This was done and the colonoscopy revealed multiple diverticuli but no evidence of active GI bleed.
He continued to have several Guaiac positive bowel movements per day but no episodes of frank blood in his stool.
Of note, he had absolutely no episodes of hemodynamic instability.
PULMONARY:  The patient carries the diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis.
We also withheld his aspirin in the context of a GI bleed and decreasing platelets.
