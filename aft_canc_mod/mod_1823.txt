HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 27830**] is an unfortunate 84 year old female with a history diabetes mellitus, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks, bilateral carotid artery stenosis measured at 40 and 60% by ultrasound and carotid Duplex studies; history of hypertension, history of deep venous thrombosis, recurrent pulmonary embolism, and renal insufficiency, who was admitted to the Vascular Service after complaining of a several months history, approximately four to five months, of claudication and rest pain.
She was noted to have Doppler-able dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right lower extremity.
She had a right femoral angiogram which showed an occluded SFA and occluded dorsalis pedis.
There were no complications.
Over the next several days, the patient had complications of postoperative renal failure and mental status changes.
Their impression was she had a cardiac event complicated with low cardiac output versus sepsis as the likely potentiator of this persistent oliguria and renal failure.
By [**7-24**], which would be postoperative day number 11 from her operation, the renal attending that was consulting on the case, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**], felt that the patient was probably pre-renal secondary to worsening cor pulmonale, and recommended to attempt to diurese the patient.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] did suggest to check troponin I for a question of a cardiac event, as covered in the perioperative period to precipitate this, to check for a fractional excretion of urea to see if this was consistent with a prerenal state, continue the diuretics, maintain blood pressure greater than 120 for renal perfusion, and to start optimizing her nutrition.
A Neurology consultation was obtained at this time also for her altered mental status.
At that time, Neurology's impression was that this was just an 84 year old woman with a prior polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who was noted to have difficulty speaking after right femoral to AT bypass graft using composite PTFV and non-reversed saphenous vein.
Her neurologic examination was significant for inattention and somewhat lethargic, which might reflex a metabolic encephalopathy.
Their recommendations were to check a head CT scan to evaluate a large stroke or bleed.
Recheck urinalysis since the leukocyte esterase was also positive and to continue support as needed.
Neurologically, a head CT scan was achieved that showed no evidence of large intracranial bleed.
Infectious Disease:  She had an increasing white count.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] was continued for her low urine output management.
There was some question of a new cerebrovascular accident event despite some negative imaging.
She was noted to have an orbital bruit which was questionable of siphon stenosis.
They wanted to repeat the EEG to rule out any artifacts or rule out seizure for any reason to explain her persistent encephalopathy.
Overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], she developed some facial twitching.
This responded to an Ativan dose times one and then being stopped as well as repleting electrolytes as needed.
