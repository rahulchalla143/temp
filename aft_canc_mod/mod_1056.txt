Admission Date:  [**2125-11-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2125-11-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-5-27**]     Sex:  M  Service: Medicine HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old male with a smoking history and COPD who was recently diagnosed with squamous cell cancer in the right main stem bronchus, status post mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy performed on [**2125-10-29**].
He initially was doing quite developed a productive cough without hemoptysis, increasing shortness of breath, no fever or chills.
Patient denied nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
On [**2125-10-31**], patient had markedly increased shortness of breath with midsternal chest pain.
Patient was intubated and started on gatifloxacin for questionable post obstructive pneumonia.
Of note, bronchoscopy on [**2125-10-29**], showed a large endobronchial lesion at the right main stem takeoff with almost complete occlusion of the bronchus.
Biopsies were sent which showed squamous cell carcinoma.
Mediastinoscopy showed dense fibrous reaction in the anterior aspect of the trachea.
There was question of lymph node versus mass distension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic lower back pain.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs had diffuse rhonchi and wheezes.
Abdomen soft, absent bowel sounds, no masses.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray right upper lobe collapse with hyperlucency of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
Small right pleural effusion.
Left lung with diffuse haziness.
Bronchoscopy showed near complete obstruction of the right main stem bronchus with lobulated tumor tissue.
Right upper lobe bronchus was completely obstructed with tumor mass.
Right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi were patent with no tumor tissue.
Patient was placed on a brief prednisone taper for questionable COPD inflammation secondary to the tumor.
Patient was also continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl for post obstructive pneumonia.
Patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent MDI and nebulizer for diffuse wheezing.
The patient was noted to have a bradycardic episode into the 40s post bronchoscopy and stent placement.
EKG showed sinus rhythm at 45 beats per minute with QTc of [**Street Address(2) 34642**] elevations.
Troponin was found to be elevated at 3.2 with normal CKs.
It was thought that this elevated troponin was secondary to stress from the procedure.
An echo was obtained on [**2125-11-2**], which showed an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with trivial mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Patient will likely need an outpatient stress test performed once his pulmonary issues and oncologic issues remain stable.
The patient underwent a bone scan, chest CT scan, head CT scan, abdominal and pelvic CT performed to assess for metastases.
There was no evidence of metastases, however, on bone scan there was evidence of a focus of radiotracer activity in the cervical spine which may be secondary to degenerative disease.
The patient was placed on a CIWA scale and there was no evidence of withdrawal.
Squamous cell lung cancer with large obstructing right upper lobe mass.
