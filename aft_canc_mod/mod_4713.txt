Admission Date:  [**2199-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-4-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Pneumococcal Vaccine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p bronchial artery embolization   History of Present Illness: 79-year-old male with history of NSCLC s/p chemotherapy and radiation in [**2191**] with local recurrence diagnosed [**4-10**] who developed hemoptysis and was transferred for bronchial artery embolization.
At that time he developed intermittent hemoptysis.
At that time he noted increased hemoptysis totaling a couple teaspoons and he presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**2199-12-4**].
He was noted to have Hct of 28, had bronchoscopy with 90% obstructing mass in proximal right bronchus at the orifice of RML and RLL.
He has evidence of mets to RML and RLL.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchial artery embolization.
After the procedure the patient was transferred from angio table to stretcher and developed tachypnea to 40s, desaturation to low 80s on 2L NC and significant work of breathing.
CXR was done with no apparent change from prior description (although no comparison CXR).
Over the next 5-10 minutes the patient became more comfortable and patient no longer in respiratory distress.
He endorses intermittent shortness of breath and notes he occassionally has productive cough, sometimes with blood clots.
Stage IIIB NSCLC, s/p radiation and chemotherapy in [**2191**].
COPD 3. h/o Seizures secondary to brain injury 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5. h/o pseudomonas pneumonia   Social History: Widower, quit smoking in [**2199-4-1**], denies EtOH.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.5, BP 135/61, HR 108, RR 26, SaO2 97% 40% FM General: Alert, oriented, cachectic, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated Lungs: Decreased breath sounds throughout, more decreased in RLL and RML.
No crackles or wheezes appreciated.
No murmurs or rubs.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, cyanosis or edema, mild clubbing, no hematoma/bruit at groin.
CXR [**2199-12-11**]: FINDINGS: Right middle and lower lobe post-obstructive combination of collapse and consolidation with volume loss and rightward shift of midline structures is unchanged.
Increased opacity within the right upper lobe and the entire left lung reflects vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax or left effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema within the left lung and right upper lobe with unchanged right pleural effusion and post-obstructive atelectasis and consolidation of the right middle and lower lobes.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
CT chest with contrast [**2199-12-8**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: No pathologically enlarged supraclavicular, or axillary lymph nodes are present.
A small 8-mm left hilar node seen.
There is loss of the normal fat plane along the right mediastinal surface with 2 inferior paraesophageal nodes measuring 6 and 10 mm in short axis (2:29).
Volume loss is noted involving the right lung with paramediastinal fibrosis seen bilaterally, but predominantly on the right in the upper lobe which is poorly enhancing.
Some aerosolized secretions are noted within the distal trachea extending into the proximal main stem bronchi on the right with complete occlusion of the bronchus intermedius and proximal segmental branches of the right middle and right lower lobe by soft tissue mass.
The right upper lobe bronchus has some secretions within its origin but is patent distally.
The overall size of the right hilar mass is difficult to delineate in conjunction with the surrounding post-obstructive collapse of a large portion of the right lower lobe with the vasculature remaining patent and coursing through the atelectatic lung.
Some scattered centrilobular nodules are noted within the right upper lobe in conjunction with regions of bronchiolectasis and bronchial/bronchiole wall thickening (4:64).
Mild thickening is noted along the pleural surface of the right major and minor fissures.
Mild enhancement is noted along the right pleural surface in conjunction with a moderate-sized pleural effusion with fissural components.
The left lung displays some apical scarring and paramediastinal fibrotic changes as well as a tubular 4 x 6-mm nodule within the lingula (4:95), without any other suspicious pulmonary nodules.
Underlying traction bronchiectasis is noted adjacent to the post-radiation changes with the remaining airways appearing otherwise unremarkable.
Moderate background centrilobular emphysema is better appreciated within the more normal-appearing left lung.
Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic calcification is noted involving the aortic arch, ascending/descending aorta, and coronary arteries.
Atherosclerotic calcification is also noted involving the aortic valve.
Included portions of the upper abdomen display a few scattered small cardiophrenic lymph nodes.
No suspicious masses within the liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, or visualized bowel.
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are noted.
Poorly defined mass in the region of the right hilum with complete opacification of the bronchus intermedius and proximal segmental branches of the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi.
There are extensive post-obstructive and post radiation changes involving the right lung with resultant volume loss.
Lymphangitic spread of disease is not excluded.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion with pleural enhancement suggesting complex fluid.
Effusion surrounds the large portion of the right lower lobe with fissural components.
Left lobe contains single lingular nodule and mild post-radiation changes  Note: Please note assessment for superimposed pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or worsening post-obstructive changes is not possible in the absence of any prior exams available for our review.
Right common femoral arterial access.
Bronchial artery embolization.
Intermittent hand angiograms were performed to rule out filling of the anterior spinal artery.
No active extravasation is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79-year-old male with history of NSCLC s/p chemo and XRT in [**2191**] now with local recurrence who developed hemoptysis and s/p right bronchial artery embolization who developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient developed hypoxemic respiratory distress after being turned on right side after procedure.
The differential is broad and includes airway obstruction from tumor, mucous plugging, intermittent bronchospasm, and pulmonary embolus.
The most likely etiology of the original hypoxia was secondary to airway obstruction from tumor or from mucous plugging causing temporary shunt physiology.
Interval CXRs showed worsening opacifiation of his right lung suggesting complete tumor or mucous occlusion of his bronchus versus a post obstructive pneumonia process.
He then spiked a fever and flagyl was started on [**12-9**].
The patient was given nebulizations to ease any possible bronchospastic response.
No peripheral signs of DVT, including negative LENIs although pt is mildly tachycardic and PE was not entirely excluded as CTA was not done with PE protocal.
However, cancer and PNA can explain his oxygen requirement and anticoagulation treatment would be risky given recent arterial access, embolization, and hemoptysis.
He generally requires 4-5L of oxygen to maintain sats in the low 90s (has h/o hypercarbia and COPD) with intermittent needs for facemask ventilation in the setting of coughing fits.
He also has a lot of anxiety which he receives lorazepam 0.5mg po as needed.
He only had minimal hemoptysis after the procedure and once or twice in the week following.
# Metastatic NSCLC: The patient is undergoing palliative chemotherapy with Gemcitabine.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine .
Constipation: Pt had constipation while here that he did not report to us initially.
# h/o Seizures secondary to brain injury: Continue home phenytoin.
# Hypophosphatemia: He repeatedly had a low phos while in hospital.
#.Hyponatremia: Is SIADH also likely a hypovolemic component given decreased pos.
# Thrombocytosis: Likely secondary to suboptimally tx post obstructive pneumonia .
# Insomnia in setting of respiratory issues: Pt does well on trazodone 25mg qhs.
