Slight increase in the size of the left anterior temporal lobe enhancing mass.
Increased temporal lobe edema and mass effect, but no herniation or evidence of hydrocephalus.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the awake and drowsy states due to the presence of a slowed disorganized background rhythm with intermittent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing and the presence of occasional left temporal lobe sharp and slow [**Male First Name (un) **] e isodic symptoms.
The presence of discharges in the left temporal lobe is suggestive of a potential epileptic focus due to cortical dysfunction.
The slow and disorganized background rhythm with intermittent bursts of delta frequency slowing is suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 882**] was admitted after recently being discharged after being admitted for a coarse of MTX (not able to be given due to neutropenia likely caused by valgancyclovir).
CNS lymphoma/chemo/cytopenias- These are stable and confirmed on recent temporal lobe biopsy as being high grade, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Pt had aggressive hydration and alkalinization of urine and was then given methotrexate as per neuro-med protocol for chemo responsive CNS lymphoma starting [**2118-9-3**].
Pt also received intrathecal ARA-C via Omayya reservoir on [**2118-9-8**] - this was done becasue of a concern for leptomeningeal invovlment causing a flaccid bladder.
CSF x 2 from his Ommaya was negative for malignant cells.
He was neutropenic s/p chemotherapy and then became febrile on [**9-10**].
Empiric cefepime for fever/neutropenia was initiated and continued until discharge, as all cultures remained neg, pt remained afebrile, and his neutropenia had resolved.
Neupogen was continued daily for neutropenia and for one day post-D/C.
He also had a significant drop in his platelets, which were in the 20s on discharge, but stable and he was without signs of bleeding/petechiae.
Keppra and Lamictal were added, as was decadron(due to edema around brain met) before he stopped seizing.
He did have continued twitching of leg which is a partial epileptic seizure.
For breakthrough seizures- low dose ativan- but not needed for focal epileptic seizures of leg.
Anemia - He also had a drop in his Hct after the MTX treatment.
His short term memory fluctuated.
He had some difficulty remembering short term events.
He may have had some confusion from continued seizures, ativan tx, and edema from brain mets.
He had improved fairly significantly until fever over weekend.
He was usually fairly alert, but couldn't do calculations or difficult tasks.
A fever spike abuot 5 days before his discharge was felt to be due to the IT ARa-C he received; this caused his mental status to again decrease, this gradually cleared as the week went on, but he was not at his complete baseline when discharged.
He is thinking clearly, but the problem seems to be with an expressive aphasia.
Due to neutropenia and recent transplant, he was put on or already taking fluconazole, lamivudine, bactrim DS, and acyclovir.
Diarrhea: He had some episodes of diarrhea and was on vanco in the recent past.
Sent C diff which was neg.
Also had rectal pain that was most likely due to the XRT.
The pain was treated with oxycodone effectively.
