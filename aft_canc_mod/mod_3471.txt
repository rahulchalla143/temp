Admission Date:  [**2107-9-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-9-14**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**] Chief Complaint: sepsis secondary to perforated sigmoid diverticulitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: exploratory laparotomy, sigmoidectomy, transverse end colostomy  History of Present Illness: 86 yoM with recently diagosed infiltrative glioma as well as htn, who p/w 1-2 weeks of decreased po intake and fatigue, found by niece to have HR in 160s.
He states he has had no desire to eat or drink.
He thinks it may be due to his steroids.
He does note some lower extremity swelling since starting steroids.
However, he denies and vision changes, numbness, weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or loss of consciousness.
EKG showed Aflutter in the 150s as well as possible coarse Afib.
Patient was felt to be very dry on exam and IVFs were begun in both arms.
He received diltiazem 10 mg IV x 2 with HRs decreasing to the 100s but SBPs also dropping to the 80s.
Given that patient is on steroids as an outpatient for recently diagnosed glioma, differential of adrenal insufficiency was considered and he was given 100 mg of hydrocortisone IV.
Of note, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on the Neuro service [**Date range (1) 22730**] when he presented with 24 hours of dysarthria and several weeks of dizziness/lightheadedness.
His exam was significant for dysarthria, left gaze nystagmus, and left hemiataxia at that time.
A CT showed right posterior limb capsule lesion consistent with cavernoma.
MRI showed extensive signal abnormality involving the left temporal lobe, left superior cerebellum, and left lateral mid brain.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and felt presentation and imaging was consistent with gliomatosis cerebri.
Past Medical History: # Gliomatosis Cerebri -infiltrative glioma: L temporal lobe,insula,left cerebellum, brainstem diagnosed [**7-/2107**] - began whole brain cranial radiation recommended due to infiltrative nature (28 treatments scheduled) - Also treated with daily temozolomide but stopped [**2107-8-19**] due to thrombocytopenia # DM # htn # Gout # hyperlipidemia # h/o TIA   Social History: He is a retired civil engineer.
Family History: No strokes.
No malignancy.
Nonspecific ST/TW changes.
No acute intrathoracic pathology is identified.
Stable appearance of pulmonary arterial congestion.
No hemorrhage.
Abnormality in the left medial temporal lobe and left cerebellum, unchanged and corresponds to the previously described changes on prior MRA examination.
Stable right parietal white matter lesion that was previously described as a cavernoma.
ATTENDING NOTE: There is hypodensity in the superior cerebellum with mild compression of 4th ventricle due to leptomeningeal disease seen on previous MRI.
No hydrocephalus seen.
MRI Head [**7-19**]: 1) Extensive signal abnormality involving the left temporal lobe, left superior cerebellum, and left lateral mid brain.
Given the additional history provided of several months of ataxia and gait difficulties, differential considerations include a low-grade neoplasm (i.e.
glioma), subacute infarction, or an infectious encephalitis (viral, Listeria), though the latter would be somewhat atypical without a more acute presentation.
2) Right parietal white matter lesion, corresponding to the CT finding is consistent with a cavernoma.
3) 2-mm outpouching from the right supraclinoid ICA, at the origin of the PCOM; this could represent an infundibulum or a very tiny aneurysm.
4) Mild stenosis of the origin of the right vertebral artery.
Extraluminal collection identified within the left lower quadrant as noted above with dissection of air into the retroperitoneum.
At the time of dictation, the patient had undergone operative intervention.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with areas of adjacent passive atelectasis as noted.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yoM with recently diagosed infiltrative glioma p/w decreased po intake, fatigue, and tachycardia found to be in Aflutter, admitted to MICU for hypotension.
Blood cultures from [**9-3**] grew out Corynebacterium species.
Abdominal XRay demonstrated free air and CT abdomen/pelvis on demonstrated extraluminal collection in LLQ w/dissection of air into retroperitoneum and small B/L pleural effusions.
Pt was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy where it was found that he had perforated sigmoid diverticulitis.
