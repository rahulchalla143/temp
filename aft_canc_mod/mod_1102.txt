[**Month/Day/Year **] stress test to determine his functional capacity, d/t cardiologist concerned if his Parkinson's could be masking symptoms of aortic stenosis.
No EKG changes, but after 46 seconds his BP dropped from 110/70 to 98/70 and the test was stopped.
Echo did reveal severe aortic stenosis with a bicuspid valve.
In terms of symptoms he does feel fatigued with dyspnea on exertion occuring after [**1-12**] block.
Past Medical History: Aortic Stenosis, Parkinson's Disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma s/p chemo and stem cell transplant (in remission), Anxiety, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy s/p TURP  Social History: Married, does not work.
This is consistent with no stenosis.
This is consistent with no stenosis.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated a two vessel CAD.
The LCx was patent but there was an 80% stenosis in the OM1.
The RCA had mild nonflow limiting disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 8 mm Hg and a mean PCWP of 10 mm Hg.
There was a severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 45.89 mm Hg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62 cm2.
Peripheral angiography demonstrated no right iliac disease.
Short run of SVT during the case that terminated spontaneously.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No significant perivalvular gradient.
Trace central valvular AI is noted, no perivalvular leak seen.
Intraluminal thrombus is not identified.
Cardiac cath revealed severe aortic stenosis along with 2 vessel coronary artery disease and a dilated ascending aorta.
He did have significant amount of post-op bleeding that required multiple blood products.
On post-op day one there appeared to be left arm edema with bluish discoloration and left-sided neck bulge.
All left arm peripheral IV's and arterial line were removed, vascular surgery was consulted and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
Left arm swelling and neck bulge has resolved.
