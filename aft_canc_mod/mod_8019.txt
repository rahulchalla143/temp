2) Slight possible gallbladder wall thickening, which is nonspecific, but contracted gallbladder.
3) Major hepatic arteries and veins and main portal vein and its major branches, with appropriate directional flow.
4) Extensive involvement of the liver with metastases   Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo M with newly diagnosed liver masses (primary vs mets from unknown primary (?colon)) s/p xeloda, avastin, oxaliplatin who present with diarrhea, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and an anion gap acidosis.
#Diarrhea - etiology includes c.diff (recent course of augmentin for elevated wbc), infectious diarrhea, malabsorptive diarrhea, chemo related.
He was also started on octreotide/cholestyramine for a question of malabsorptive/chemo related diarrhea that was resistant to immodium.
#Anion Gap Acidosis - On admission the patient was found to have a primary gap acidosis with an insignificant delta-delta.
He was started on IVFs with bicarb for his bicarb of 13 and shortness of breath associated with the acidosis.
His lactic acidosis was thought to be secondary to infection vs extensive tumor burden vs possible bowel ischemia.
Vanco/Levo was started for a question of SBE in the setting of a new holosystolic murmur and flagyl was started for a question of c. diff.
#Acute Renal Failure - BUN/Creatinine ratio and history were consistent with prerenal etiology.
UA was notable for granular casts.
It was felt his diarrhea had led to hypovolemia and this in combination with his hypotension had caused ATN and acute renal failure.
IVFs were instituted for supportive care.
#Liver Failure/Hyperbilirubinemia - The patient had an elevated INR and low albumin.
The rest of his labs were not consistent with DIC, thus both his coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia were felt to be [**3-12**] extensive tumor burden of his liver.
He was transferred to the unit for a central line  and possible pressors in the setting of his repeated hypotension.
