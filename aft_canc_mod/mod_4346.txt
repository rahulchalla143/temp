This patient is well known to the surgical service following recent hospitalization for workup of his renal cell cancer following a GI bleed.
Last year he was evaluated and the tumor was abutting but not invading the duodenum and the hepatic flexure and at that time he did not proceed with surgery.
Now following extensive workup it was presumed that the GI bleed was due to tumor erosion into the duodenum.
He was afebrile throughout his post-op course.
NGT was d/c'd on POD 7, prior to the tube being discontinued he had an upper GI study showing: -Approximately 100 cc of Conray was first injected through the NG tube which passed freely into the loops of jejunum with no extravasation.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of the extrinsic duodenal mass with no evidence of leakage or obstruction.
The CT showed post-surgical changes and normal caliber loops of bowel.
No free fluid or air seen in the pelvis.
He had intermittent c/o nausea with occasional vomiting reported.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma invading and obstructing the duodenum with the vena caval encasement by a tumor.
