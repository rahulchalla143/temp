Admission Date:  [**2109-12-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-1-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-3-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 73-year-old gentleman who was referred to the Urology Service after a workup for hematuria prompted a pelvic MRI on [**12-20**].
Findings on that study were significant for a large mass on the left side of the bladder consistent with a primary neoplasm extending into the muscle without definite evidence of extension into the pelvic-floor fat.
There were also multiple bony metastases noted in the pelvis along with a small lymph node in the right external iliac chain.
On the evening of [**2109-12-22**], the patient's family contact[**Name (NI) **] the GU resident on call with concerns of Mr.  [**Known lastname 25823**] profound weakness and pallor.
In the emergency department the patient was found to be in severe diabetic ketoacidosis with INR of 7; potassium of 7.5, blood glucose of 800 and hematocrit of 25.
The EKG done at that time was notable for peak T waves and a prolonged PR interval.
The patient was promptly admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of his diabetic ketoacidosis.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline CR 1.3 to 1.7).
A left jump bypass with femoral to posterior tibial to dorsalis pedis bypass graft.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nondrinker and a former smoker, who recently began smoking again.
ABDOMEN:  His belly was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
He had a chest x-ray, which was notable for mild cardiomegaly, but without evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
He was placed on an insulin drip and he was aggressively hydrated for the metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure.
Cardiac enzymes were subsequently sent, which ultimately ruled him out for a myocardial infarction.
His coagulopathy resolved as did his diabetic ketoacidosis.
The Renal Service was consulted to make recommendations regarding the patient's acute renal failure.
On [**2109-12-25**], the patient underwent a renal ultrasound, which was notable only for small cysts in the left kidney with no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Both his blood and urine cultures had no growth.
On the 25th, he had a bone scan, which was notable for multiple bony metastases, as well as numerous small foci of increased uptake consistent with metastatic disease.
The oncology service was consulted and among their recommendations was a request for plain films of the hip to rule out impending fracture.
Findings during that procedure were significant for a large apparently invasive bladder tumor mostly on the left lateral wall of the bladder.
The left ureteral outlet was identified and it was believed that there was tumor growing into the left UO.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the entire course.
After ensuring that there were no clots, and that the patient was not in retention, the heparin was continued.
After three days of anticoagulation with 10 mg of Coumadin, the patient's INR still remained subtherapeutic at around 1.8.
