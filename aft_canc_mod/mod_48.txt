There is no evidence of fracture.
A large mucous retention cyst is noted in the right maxillary sinus.
No acute intracranial process.
Similar 1.6 x 1.9 cm spiculated right upper lobe lesion with associated right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, highly concerning for malignancy.
2-mm left upper lobe nodule, apparently new.
Bibasilar atelectasis and left lower lobe discoid atelectasis.
No definite focal airspace consolidations.
Multifocal large hypodense lesions in the liver, incompletely assessed without IV contrast but compatible with widespread hepatic metastases.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
Large fibroid uterus.
Similar significant T11 and T12 compression fractures.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 88 yo female that presented with altered mental status, hypotension, a right upper mass concerning for lung cancer and evidence of metastatic spread.
Hypotension:  The patient presented with hypotension likely due to a combination of hypovolemia (poor PO intake for the preceeding days) and distributive/septic shock (given a WBC 24).
Altered mental status from toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the context of multiple insults including hypotension and infection.
A CT of her head was negative for an obvious cause of altered mental status.
Right Upper Lung Mass- The patient presented with a right upper lung mass concerning for malignance with evidence of an 8th rib fracture and hepatic metastases A further work up was deferred after the patient was made CMO.
hypercarbic respiratory failure-  The patient presented with metabolic acidosis (likely from sepsis) with inappropriate respiratory compensation.
She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Acute kidney Injury.
The patient presented hypovolemic and labs consistent with  pre-renal/ATN.
Microcytic anemia: Likely from anemia of chronic inflammation given labs results.
