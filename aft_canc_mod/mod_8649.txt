Initially presented in [**Month (only) **] with a 10 month h/o post-menopausal bleeding.
At that time was found to be supra therapeutic on Coumadin for her h/o atrial fibrillation (INR of 7) and was also anemic.
CT on [**12-9**] showed a 24 x 14 x 14cm pelvic mass.
An endometrial/cervical mass biopsy was performed during this initial hospitalization, which was consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
She was re-admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] [**1-1**] for weakness and bilateral LE edema, and was found to be hypotensive and with bilateral DVT as well as acute renal insufficiency.
In the Intensive Care Unit, she received vasopressin for blood pressure support as well as vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl for presumed urosepsis due to her initial hypotension and a leukocytosis of 18.7 with 6 bands, although U/A showed only [**2-20**] WBC.
Hyperkalemia was treated with Kayexelate, after which she developed loose stools (C. diff.
She was also placed on a heparin drip for anti-coagulation both for atrial fibrillation and her bilateral DVT.
She currently reports some abdominal pain, but otherwise has no complaints, and is tolerating a regular diet.
She denies CP/SOB/palpitations, although she does endorse some mild dysuria.
Per her report, her vaginal bleeding is at baseline, and her yeast infection (groin area) has improved.
Past Medical History: OBHx: G1P1, SVD x 1 GynHx: benign per patient SurgHx: ankle surgery MedHx: DM type 2 Atrial fibrillation Anemia Hyperlipidemia HTN Arthritis Depression   Social History: She is a nonsmoker.
Family History: She reports an aunt had breast cancer at the age of 64.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
stage II sacral decub ulcer with dressing C/D/I.
L a-line intact.
Pertinent Results: IMAGING: [**2194-1-4**] CXR: There are no old films available for comparison.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is no focal infiltrate or effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2194-1-7**] CXR: ET tube terminates with tip 40 mm above the carina.
Low lung volumes, but no focal areas of consolidation or pulmonary edema.
No evidence of right-sided pleural effusion (left costophrenic angle was cut off from  view).
[**2194-1-9**] CXR: A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates similar cardiomediastinal contours to that seen on [**2194-1-4**] and [**2194-1-7**].
No consolidation is evident.
No effusion detected.
No pneumothorax.
[**2194-1-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the lung volumes have minimally decreased.
There is no focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
No pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
[**2194-1-11**] CXR: A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates no change in the support lines when compared with [**2194-1-10**].
No pneumothorax.
No effusion detected.
Overall, there is little interval change.
[**2194-1-12**] CXR:   A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates no change in the cardiomediastinal contours when compared with [**2194-1-11**].
Slight worsening of atelectasis at the left lung base, but no substantial change in linear right perihilar atelectasis.
Questionable small layering left pleural effusion versus technical artifact related to lack of centering of the patient.
At [**Hospital3 3583**] she was intubated in the ICU for several days secondary to urosepsis.
Her hypotension was likely secondary to large fluid shifts and hypovolemia, however there was concern for cardiogenic shock.
She did not require pressors for the remainder of her hospitalization and was subsequently transferred out of the ICU on POD#6     *) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
It was noted that her Lopressor dose had been held secondary to mildly low blood pressure.
She was extubated on POD#5 without difficulty.
*) HEME: On initial presentation to [**Hospital3 3583**], the patient was noted to have bilateral lower extermity swelling.
Lower extremity dopplers revealed bilateral deep venous thrombosis.
V/Q scan at [**Hospital3 3583**] was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
Her heparin drip was restarted POD#3 with no evidence of bleeding.
She received 4 units PRBCs intra-operatively, 1 unit PRBCs on POD#0 in the ICU and 1 unit PRBCs on POD#1 in the ICU for blood loss anemia.
She never had any signs of DIC and her platelet count remained stable.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was afebrile and her WBC count was 12.
Urine culture at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed no growth.
She remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization and her leukocytosis normalized.
Her blood culture revealed no growth.
*) RENAL: Upon presentation, that patient was noted to be in acute renal failure, with a creatinine of 3.0.
Her CT scan revealed bilateral hydonephrosis secondary to tumor compression, also likely the etiology of her renal failure.
*) ENDOCRINE:  The patient is a Type II diabetic.
*) GYN: The patient complained of some vaginal itching on POD#12.
*) WOUND CARE: The patient is noted to have a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer, as well as bilateral ankle pressure ulcers.
The patient is also noted to have a small ulcer on her right lateral abdomen with some serous drainage.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
