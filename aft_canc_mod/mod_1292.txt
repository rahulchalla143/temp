ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -- [**2-/2201**] cough and decreased stamina.
-- [**2201-4-24**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where chest x-ray disclosed right middle lobe opacities.
-- [**2201-4-24**] Chest CT revealed a 3.6 x 3 x 3.7 cm rounded hypodense mass obstructing the right middle lobe bronchus causing near complete right middle lobe collapse.
There was also associated bronchial wall thickening and enlarged right hilar nodes up to 13 mm.
Given the concerning lung finding, he also underwent CT abdomen and pelvis on the same date, which disclosed innumerable  peripherally enhancing liver lesions as well as multiple small lytic osseous metastases throughout the skeleton without evidence of pathologic fracture.
-- [**2201-4-25**] MRI brain for seizure revealed multiple foci of abnormal enhancement within the supra and infratentorial region,  with the largest lesion in the right frontal lobe measuring 1.5  cm.
-- [**2201-4-28**] liver biopsy with metastatic adenocarcinoma staining positive for CK7 and TTF-1 with focal CK20 positivity and was negative for CK5/6.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2201-5-22**] 2:41 PM FINDINGS: A central right middle lobe lung mass is again demonstrated and has been more fully imaged on prior CT imaging.
Adjacent to this area are poorly defined parenchymal opacities as well as interstitial septal thickening and reticulation throughout the right lung.
A questionable area of confluent opacity is also identified below the right clavicle.
IMPRESSION: Worsening opacities in the right lung, many of which are in close proximity to a known right middle lobe lung mass.
Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary infection, aspiration and lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 y/o male with non-small cell lung cancer with brain, bone and spinal metastases, hypercalcemia who presented on [**5-22**] with acute on chronic back pain and altered mental status initially admitted to the intensive care unit, later transferred to OMED for continued management.
There reports of dysuria and headache on review of systems, both new symptoms.
There is no focality on exam to suggest infectious source.
Patient had rash on anterior chest, likely from Bactrim, which could represent source of fever, although it would be atypical that this started this far from ceasing the medication.
Other etiologies include deep venous thrombosis and underlying malignancy.
# Altered mental status: According to wife, on admission patient was far off from baseline, although patient does seem reportedly have some baseline confusion.
Possible etiologies include fever, infection, hypovolemia, hypercalcemia, medication effect, given the narcotics and benzodiazepines that were given while in the ED, and brain metastases related to his underlying malignancy.
Pain control: As outpatient pain regimen included MS Contin and Morphine IR however dosing insufficient and pain poorly controlled.
At time of discharge patient on Morphine SR 45mg TID with IR 15-30 for breakthrough control with pain well controlled.
# Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with known brain mets.
# Hypercalcemia: Likely related to malignancy.
Hypercalcemia improved, and ultimately normalized by time of discharge after bisphosphonate treatment and aggressive IV hydration.
# History of deep venous thrombosis.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
