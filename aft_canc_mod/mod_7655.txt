Per patient, he reports that he was having worsening lower extremity edema over the last 3 months.
No pain in his legs.
He had no recent travel.
No cough, pleuritic chest pain, or chest pain.
Dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion developed over the course of last 2 days.
Patient thought it was similar to his prior episode of PE but milder symptoms; therefore, presented himself to the ED.
Of note, he stopped his Revlimid .
Per report EKG showed evidence of right heart strain, new TWI III, avF, V2-3, and troponin was mildly elevated to 0.04  Given his symptoms, patient underwent CTA (after receiving IVF) of the chest which showed PE straddling the bifurcation of the left pulmonary artery that extends segmental branches.

Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

Physical Exam: On Admission:  Vitals: T:96.9 BP:121/75 P:83 O2: 93% on 3L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated CV: RRR, no m/r/g Resp: diminished lung sounds at the basis, no wheeze or rhonchi Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS+ Extremities: cool, dry, barely palpable DP bilaterally, edematous up right below the knees, no cyanosis or clubbing GU: no Foley Skin: without rash  On Discharge: VSS No change in physical exam other than swelling which was very promienent bilaterally but R>L, had decreased.
Lungs CTA Heart RRR with no m/r/g.
Presence of premature beats.
Right posterior tibial deep venous thrombosis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right ventricle is at least moderately dilated with evidence of pressure/volume overload.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-9-4**], the right ventricle is now dilated and hypokinetic with evidence of RV pressure/volume overload.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo M with IgA myeloma s/p velcade (incomplete course) and recent Revlimid, history of PE ([**2169**]) on warfarin, presented with shortness of breath with minimal exertion x 2 days found to have left pulmonary artery PE.
# Pulmonary Embolism  Patient was initially admitted to the medical ICU for close monitoring for saddle PE as found on CTA.
Pt was started on heparin gtt in setting of thrombocytopenia given clot burden.
Echo revealed new right heart strain.
Swelling in lower legs decreased dramatically and patient denied chest pain and endorsed improvement in breathing.
Because pt will be on life-long anticoagulation, it may be safe to keep in the IVC filter in the hopes of preventing large clots from entering the pulmonary bed, however, if patient is to have more chemo or has other reason for withholding anticoagulation, this will serve as a nidus for future clots.
# Fever: Pt developed a fever x 1.
Fever was most likely [**1-27**] to inflammatory response from DVT and PE.
# Thrombocytopenia.
# IgA Myeloma.
Will need to discuss future treatment options with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] given propensity to develop clots on this medication.
# Hypertension.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pulmonary Embolism, Bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses  Secondary: Multiple Myeloma, Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for shortness of breath and found to have a pulmonary embolism.
You were also found to have bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses.
A temporary inferior vena cava filter was placed to help prevent further embolism from your legs to your lungs.
You also had a fever while you were here and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
No infectious source was found and you were afebrile after discontinuation of antibiotics.
It was felt that this fever was most likely from your DVT and PE.
