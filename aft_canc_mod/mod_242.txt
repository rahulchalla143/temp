Admission Date:  [**2166-10-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-10-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2102-4-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 64-year-old female with CRS of tobacco, age, hypertension, who was admitted electively [**2166-10-7**] for resection of left lung mass when upon induction of anesthesia, she was noted to be hypotensive and telemetry showed ST elevations.
A 12-lead electrocardiogram was done at that time, but intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram showed inferior hypokinesis.
Patient had findings of large left hilar mass extending into the mediastinum.
CT appearance of the lesions suggested T4 primary, but no evidence of mediastinal lymph nodes spread or peripheral metastases.
Cervical mediastinoscopy was done on [**2166-5-17**] and frozen section analysis demonstrated it was poorly differentiated nonsmall cell lung cancer, mast cell was not adherent to the trachea or left main stem bronchus at that level.
Poorly differentiated large cell lung carcinoma, involvement of left laryngeal nerve.
Hiatal hernia diagnosed by endoscopy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with MI at 60.
Generally she is an elderly female in no acute distress.
Neck is supple without bruits or adenopathy.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes.
Heart was regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
EKG on admission showed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, LAA 0.3 mm, ST elevations in II, III, and aVF, T-wave inversions V1, V2, and aVL.
Chest x-ray on [**2166-10-1**] showed interval decrease in size of left aortopulmonary window mass with residual irregular opacity remaining.
Heart size and pulmonary vasculature appeared within normal limits without cardiac failure.
No pleural effusions or areas of focal consolidation or evidence of metastatic disease visualized.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
MR of the chest on [**2166-4-22**] with and without contrast showed no clear invasion of the major airways and pulmonary vasculature by AP window mass and a clear fat plain was defined between mass, left main bronchus, and mass could not be clearly separated, however, from the adjacent proximal descending aorta, left main pulmonary artery, and proximal left upper lobe pulmonary arteries.
Patient was taken to the operating room on [**2166-10-9**] with a preoperative diagnosis of Stage T4 nonsmall cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe and procedures that were done were: 1) median sternotomy with interpericardial left pneumonectomy, 2) radical mediastinal lymph node dissection under general endotracheal anesthesia.
Renal team was consulted on [**2166-10-12**] for perioperative acute renal failure secondary to transient decreased renal perfusion, and recommended avoidance of further nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs, contrast, and recommended starting erythropoietin.
On postoperative day three, patient continued to do well on no drips, and was transferred to the floor on postoperative day four.
The patient was discharged on postoperative day five in no acute distress without event to home.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Stage T4 nonsmall cell lung cancer left upper lobe.
Diagnostic left thoracoscopy.
Diagnostic esophagoscopy.
Radial mediastinal lymph node dissection.
