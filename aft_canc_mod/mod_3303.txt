Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old man with metastatic esophageal cancer to liver and lung presents from clinic with dehydration and severe mucositis.
Since his treatment, he has been feeling fatigued and developed a sore throat and mouth sores.
Patietn also states that he feels confused sometims and with a slow mind.
He denies any sick contacts or exposure to people in nursing homes, children or other infectious agents.
In clinic, he was found to be orthostatic and appeared dehydrated on exam.
He was noted to have oral thrush.
He is now being admitted for rehydration and treatment of his mucositis and thrush.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: ====================== He initially presented in [**11/2142**] due to dysphagia and weight loss.
At that time, he had a barium swallow, which showed a pinpoint narrowing of his distal esophagus.
He did not have much improvement with the dilatation and in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year underwent a second dilatation once again with no improvement.
He had motility tests, which were most consistent with achalasia.
He had a CT scan after this which showed a 1.5 cm gastrohepatic lymph node.
Of note, they saw some ulceration in the GE junction and a thick abnormal fold concerning for esophageal or gastric cardia cancer.
The biopsy showed moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
He was admitted from [**2143-11-26**] to the [**2143-12-3**] with febrile neutropenia and dehydration.
Pathology from this showed a metastatic adenocarcinoma with 4/6 perigastric lymph nodes positive, and a separate foci of tumor in the adjacent adipose tissue.
He had liver lesions noted on a CT scan [**2145-1-16**].
He had these biopsied on [**2145-1-27**] and the pathology came back as consistent with metastasis from esophageal cancer.
- h/o atrial fibrillation - h/o S. viridans bacteremia - Sinusitis, status post surgery - Hypertension - Vocal cord paralysis  Social History: He originally moved from [**Country 6171**] 17 years ago.
Family History: He has a father with pancreatic cancer who died at the age of 70.

No evidence of diverticulitis, abscess, or any acute pathology to explain LLQ pain.
New wedge-shaped hypodensities within the spleen, likely infarcts given relatively rapid appearance from the prior study.
Although incompletely assessed due to collapsed bowel, apparent wall thickening of the ascending colon which may represent bowel wall edema.
No secondary signs of inflammation (ie no fat stranding).
CXR [**6-3**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing opacity at the left lung base, combined with a newly appeared blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, presumably due to effusion.
New diffuse transverse colon wall thickening and surrounding inflammatory change consistent with colitis, only partially visualized.
New, small left, and trace right, pleural effusions.
New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right lower lobe with mild improvement in right upper lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.
These findings may be due to aspiration.
TTE [**6-8**]: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
RUE U/S [**6-8**]: DVT involving the right distal brachial vein, as well as the cephalic vein.
CXR [**6-9**]: Compared to [**6-3**], there is more opacification in the left lower lobe, which could be worsening atelectasis or pneumonia particularly due to recent aspiration.
There has also been increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette and the azygos vein which may indicate volume overload but there is no pulmonary edema.
TTE showed no vegetations.
However, the resultant increase in secretions caused respiratory distress and hypoxia, requiring ICU transfer for frequent deep suctioning and nebulizers.
Neutropenia: Secondary to chemotherapy.
His ANC continued to trend down during admission until he became severely neutropenic.
Thrombocytopenia: Also secondary to chemotherapy.
Colitis: Early on, paient complained of LLQ pain, associated with hematochezia and then dark stools.
He required 2 units RBCs for this, but endoscopy could not be done due to his neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
CT abdomen showed some bowel edema, but no diverticulitis.
Later on, in the setting of starting enoxaparin for DVT, he had dark guaiac positive stools.
GI was consulted and felt bleeding was related to mucositis vs colitis/inflammation in setting of anticoagulation and did not feel there was indication for scope as an inpatient.
He also had an elevated INR that was likely nutritional, and improved with vitamin K.
