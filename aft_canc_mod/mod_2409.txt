Admission Date:  [**2195-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-4-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-2-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Elevated LFT's, admitted for PTC   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - [**3-16**]: IR biliary drainage / PTC placement - [**3-21**]: IR removal of R biliary drains after balloon angioplasting stents, tracts plugged with gelfoam, angioplasty of L drain with replacement of L biliary drain, placement of R pleural pigtail drain - [**3-30**]: L chest pigtail placed at bedside - [**4-4**]: Open Tracheostomy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 M s/p Whipple [**2186**] for low grade ampullary adenoCA c/b biliary strictures s/p stenting recently found to have now w/ elevated LFTs.
Pt had an excision of subcutaneous nodule in R posterior chest wall [**2195-2-12**] which showed adenoCA.
On [**2195-2-24**] a PET CT demonstrated multiple FDG avid liver masses as well as an enlarged FDG avid gastrosplenic lymph node and uptake in the left adrenal gland.
A follow up MRI did not show any discrete hepatic masses but a mass could not be exclude.
There are areas of peripheral peribiliary enhancement within the liver which correspond to the areas of FDG avidity more suggestive of inflammation or infection.
There is severe atrophy of the R hepatic lobe with severe biliary dilation and moderate biliary dilation of the L hepatic lobe.
The MRI again demonstrated the enlarged 2.1-cm gastrosplenic lymph node, concerning for metastasis as well as a 11-mm subcu nodule within the anterior abdominal wall along the previously placed left biliary catheter which may represent scar tissue or metastasis.
On [**2195-3-13**] the patient had elevated LFT's (Bili 5) and he was jaundiced.
The patient reports intermittent fevers/chills over the past 2 weeks with a decrease in energy level over the past 3 months.
He has had no new nausea or emesis, but reports [**1-22**] loose stools per day.
He denies BRBPR or melena.
Past Medical History: pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy on [**2187-5-3**] for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ampulla benign prostatic hypertrophy, schistosomiasis, Past surgical hx: pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and cholecystectomy [**2194-9-12**] L biliary duct dilation and stent placement  Social History: He has an occasional social alcoholic beverage.
He has no history of smoking, IV drug use, marijuana use, tattoos, hepatitis, or piercing.
He does have a history of blood transfusions.
He had a brother who died of pancreatitis in his 40s and a sister who died of liver cancer in her 60s.
MMM, neck supple, non-tender, trachea midline.

Multiple mass-like areas of FDG uptake in the liver, highly concerning for metastases.
Biliary dilation and vessel patency cannot be assessed on this noncontrast study.
2.3 cm FDG avid gastrosplenic lymph node,concerning for metastasis.
Non-FDG avid 8mm right lower lobe nodule, probable 4mm left upper lobe nodule and small left pleural effusion.
Focal right posterolateral chest wall FDG uptake, likely corresponding to the site of chest wall nodule excision.
Areas of peripheral peribiliary enhancement within the liver correspond to the areas FDG avidity and are more suggestive of inflammation/infection rather than tumor.
No discrete hepatic masses are seen though cannot be excluded.
The area of FDG avidity within the right lobe corresponds to the region of severe biliary dilation and more [**Location (un) 21851**] is not excluded, though no mass is discretely visualized.
Severe atrophy of the right hepatic lobe with severe biliary dilation and right metallic hepatic biliary stent in place.
Moderate biliary dilation of the left hepatic lobe.
Enlarged 2.1-cm gastrosplenic lymph node, concerning for metastasis.
11-mm subcutaneous nodule within the anterior abdominal wall along the previously placed left biliary catheter.
9-mm hypoenhancing focus within the interpolar region of the right kidney which may represent a small focus of inflammation or infection.
He was found to have elevated bilirunbin (5.3).
Patient was afebrile with normal vital signs on admission.
However, later that evening, patient became febrile with elevated WBC (18.7K, from 8.2K).
On [**2195-3-16**], patient was given FFPs for INR 1.8 and underwent PTC with placement of R anterior, posterior and L biliary drains.
Patient remained hypotensive after the procedure.
He was briefly weaned off Levophed on the next day, however, his bilirubin continued to increase and patient returned to IR for cholangiogram, which showed hemobilia and obstruction of the drains that was resolved with aspiration/flushing.
His drains continued to put out ~200-250ml of bilious material.
What follows is a summary of this patient's complicated SICU course:  [**3-17**]: lactate trending down, weaning levophed, weaning vent, switch to D5W [**3-18**]: Rec'd 25g albumin, weaned off pressors, biliary drains checked & cleared of clots by IR [**3-19**]: 1 U PRBC's, start TPN [**3-20**] :started on 25g albumin q8h,continued advancing TPN,laxix 10mgiv, us liver shows patent vessels, cx swann to triple lumen; failed decreasing PEEP fto 8 (desatted) & failed decreasing PS to 8 (desatted) [**3-21**]: R PTC began pouring out serosanguinous fluid, hct stable, thought to be pleural effusion through sidehole.
Bp somewhat labile with fluid shifts requiring some levo intermittently.
Added Flagyl for c. perfringens in bile, d/c'd zosyn & started meropenem.
sputum from [**3-21**] grew 2 types of GNR & sparse growth of yeast.
[**3-24**]: Increased sedation to help with vent compliance as changed over to pressure control ventilation.
Required increasing pressors due to propofol.
Started cisatricurium drip to improve vent synchrony and decreased sedation.
US shows large pleural effusion but primary team does not want to tap.
[**3-27**]: Persistent b/l plueral effusions.
[**3-28**]: episode of hypotension when levophed decreased 0.09; increased, then BP stablized at 0.1; hyperK - tx w/ insulin/glucose x2 and bicarb; renal to eval for CVVH - per their recs, can start when hyperK worsens; no ST changes [**3-29**]: K 6.3 - more ins/glucose, HCO3; albumin 12.5g TID, lasix 40mg x1=400 urine above baseline but pt also turned in am so actually decreased in pO2 & cxr, creatinine bump to 2.1; repeat dose lasix yielded another 440 urine above baseline.
Continued discussion re: CVVH; discussed w/ T-plant CT chest to look for loculations (right pleural pigtail not draining for ~ 24 hrs but overnight started draining for total 200cc), not agreed upon.
L and R chest tubes continue to drain.
Pt has withdrawl to pain response now that propofol off for 18 hours.
Urology c/s w/wound recs for penile necrosis.
Cholangiogram shows left biliary duct is patent, R not patent.
Two units RBC's given for decreasing SBP & decreasing crit.
Pt later developed hypotension, sinus rhythm.
Given fluid boluses.
Developed bleeding from central line site, so coags and fibrinogen sent.
R sided whiteout.
Consulted renal - ATN vs prerenal vs obtruction from mets.
Minimal UOP, but Cr and BUN mildly improved.
[**4-20**]: renal US showed no hydronephrosis or stone.
BP did not respond to last albumin [**4-23**]: family meeting planned for [**4-24**], [**Last Name (un) 2830**] spaced to Q24H secondary to renal failure [**4-24**]: Moving towards CMO, DNR/DNI confirmed.
No further lab tests or blood draws.
started morphine gtt for agonal breathing.
