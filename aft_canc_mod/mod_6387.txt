She does not have a history of migraines, and she does not usually get headaches.
While the imaging, which was detailed below was normal, the LP was grossly blood and it is not clear if it was secondary to a traumatic tap.
Her headache has improved while she is in the ED, and now had worse neck muscle spasm then headache.

Wet Read: RSRc MON [**2116-5-4**] 12:13 AM No aneurysm or vascular occlusion.
HISTORY: A 29-year-old female presents with severe headache.
TECHNIQUE: Angiographic phase images through the head were obtained following administration of intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: The high cervical and intracranial internal carotid arteries are asymmetric, with the left side being smaller than the right, likely secondary to the hypoplastic left A1 segment.
The intracranial veins are patent with no evidence for venous thrombosis.
Again noted is a well-defined 18 mm mass within the right parotid gland, better visualized on the preceding MRI.
There is mucus retention cyst within the posterior nasopharynx.
There is no territorial hemorrhage or evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
18 mm right parotid mass, which was better visualized on the recent MRI, most likely representing pleomorphic adenoma, with a variety of less likely differential considerations.

There is no acute infarct.
There is no abnormal intracranial enhancement, though there does appear to be a 5 mm inferiorly oriented anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
There is a small mucus retention cyst within the nasopharynx.
There is an 18 x 13 mm mass within the right parotid gland which is T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense and homogeneously enhancing.
MRV: There is preferential drainage of the superior sagittal sinus into the right transverse sinus, with a relatively hypoplastic left transverse sinus, normal variant.
There is no evidence for venous thrombosis.
No evidence of venous thrombosis.
18 mm right parotid mass with imaging findings most compatible with a pleomorphic adenoma, with a variety of less likely differential considerations.
Sella findings most likely representing a 2 mm pars intermedia cyst.
If there are any clinical findings concerning for a pituitary lesion, dedicated MRI of the sella could be obtained in further evaluation.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 29 year-old right-handed female with history of neck pain and spasm who presents with sudden onset of severe headache two times in the last 5 days.
The headache is throbbing, sudden-onset, with nausea and vomiting and photo/phonophobia, not clearly positional, and in both case occurred after an emotionally excitable event.
The patient exam is notable for some cervical muscles tenderness and otherwise has a normal neurological exam.
She underwent angiography on [**5-5**] which showed an acomm aneurysm which was coiled without incident.
In addition to the above complaints, she does note neck pain related to her work, and was given a soft cervical collar to be worn while sleeping.
# ENT: She was incidentally noted to have a right parotid mass on MRI, for which she should undergo evaluation by ENT as an outpatient.

Bleeding from groin puncture site  *SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) Lie down, keep leg straight and have someone apply firm pressure to area for 10 minutes.
For your parotid gland mass - you need to call the [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] to be seen in 2- 4weeks by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]    Completed by:[**2116-5-6**
