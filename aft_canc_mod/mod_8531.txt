No focal or textural hepatic abnormality is identified.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
IMPRESSION: No hematoma found to explain the patient's falling hematocrit.
Right hepatic artery not well visualized due to technical scanning difficulty.

The liver transplant and umbilical hernia were performed first.
There were no complications.
At the completion of the liver transplant the patient was re-prepped and draped for the kidney transplant.
There were no complications, and the patient was transfered to the SICU intubated and sedated.
A routine post-op duplex revealed normal liver and renal grafts.
This area protruded like a softball from his abdominal wall.
A US of the Right leg was performed secondary to unilateral swelling and was negative for DVT.
The patient slowly became disoriented and fussed with his tubes/lines/drains.
An Echo showed no change in cardic function and enzymes were nl.
He was started on Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia though a sputum sample could not be obtained.
A nuclear renal scan was obtained on [**6-25**] which demonstrated the graft to be performing 100% of his renal function.
[**Last Name (un) **] contined to aid in management of blood glucose.
He is slightly disoriented to others, but is very cooperative.
