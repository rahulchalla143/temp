Final Report INDICATION: 49-year-old male with end-stage gastric cancer and acute mental status change.
No comparison studies available.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarctions.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
No acute fracture is present.
The included views of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 y/o M with end-stage gastric cancer, admitted for acute alteration in mental status, s/p seizure in ED.
Pt was initially admitted to the ICU for concern of altered mental status and seizures.
The initial Ddx for his seizures included brain metastasis of known malignancy, infection (given 91% PMNs on WBC), hyponatremia, or adverse effect of unspecified herbal medications taken in [**Country 651**].
Head CT was performed, and was negative for metastatic lesions or other etiology of seizures.
The etiology of his seizure remains unclear, but it is thought that morphine may have contributed to his confusion, which was being used to treat his discomfort.
His oncologist confirmed that there were no remaining therapeutic options available to treat his progressing gastric malignancy.
The patient primarily complained of his abdominal distention causing discomfort, and he felt that he was unable to eat or drink.
There was initial consideration of malignant ascites causing his distention and discomfort, however ultrasound only showed a "less than moderate" amount of ascites.
KUB then revealed that the patient had a small bowel obstruction.
An NGT was not placed due to concerns of his gastric malignancy and his recent severe GI bleed (while in [**Country 651**]) that required transfusion.
Furthermore, the KUB did not show air-fluid levels, and even if placed, it was not thought that NGT suction would likely be beneficial as he was not experiencing nausea or vomiting.
He was made NPO and all of his medications were converted to IV initially, however, palliative medications were administered in concentrated or sublingual forms ultimately (morphine and lorazepam), and he was ultimately able to tolerate sips of liquids.
He developed penile edema and urology was consulted.
They were able to reduce his paraphimosis and his pain improved.
Pt also has a large iliac DVT for which he was previously being treated with Lovenox.
After his GI bleed in [**Country 651**], his oncologist took him off of anticoagulation, as the risk of severe bleed was too high.
This was treated with hot packs with some symptomatic relief.
He also has severe mucocytis and esophagitis.
On the day before he was scheduled to leave, his pain worsened and was started on a dilaudid PCA.
he did have recurrence of paraphimosis from his penile edema, but this was reduced again by urology.
