She remained afebrile in the ED.
Patient was oriented and had no acute complaints.

#1: Anemia, GI bleed.
Patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a GI bleed.
There is no source of bleeding visualized on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis upon admission.
Laboratory evaluation was not significant for hemolysis.
GI consultation felt that she was mostly suffering from a GI bleed however did not feel that an EGD or colonoscopy was indicated due too severe to clinical status.
The patient had a second episode of melena with a drop in her hematocrit 2 days prior to death.
#2: Sepsis patient presented with leukocytosis as well as elevated lactate and hypotension.
Patient does have a history of known C. difficile infection.
This course was complicated by continued elevations of her lactate as well as white [**Month/Day/Year **] cell count after initial improvement.
Repeat [**Month/Day/Year **] culture showed gram-negative rods.
As for source of her sepsis it was not initially clear.
Patient has possibly an intra-abdominal infection although there was no source of infection found on CT of the abdomen.
#3: Altered mental status the patient's mental status was altered throughout her stay.
She does have underlying dementia however per her family her mental status is worse.
And neurologic consultation was obtained and they were unable to give a clear etiology as she has multiple medical problems currently.
[**Name2 (NI) 6**] EEG was performed showing diffuse lower legs but no specific evidence of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
#4: Direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Was suggestive of obstructive or cholestatic process.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and did not show any intrahepatic obstruction but the CBD was not visualized.
Possibly secondary to the mass effect of her pseudocyst.
Surgery evaluated the patient and stated that a HIDA scan would most likely not be useful due to her severe clinical condition that would prevent any surgical intervention.
After her second episode of GI bleed the patient was given fresh frozen plasma to improve her coagulation status.
#6: C. difficile colitis.
Patient has a known history of C. difficile colitis.
A KUB was obtained and did not show evidence of toxic megacolon.
#7: Pancreatic pseudocyst on initial CT of the abdomen the patient was found to have a large pancreatic pseudocyst with questionable hemorrhage versus infection.
They did not perform any intervention secondary to her severe clinical status.
#8 hypoxic respiratory failure the patient required intubation due to 2 persistent hypoxia.
Respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pulmonary edema.
There was some evidence later in her hospital course a ventilator associated pneumonia and she was treated for such.
#9 hypothyroidism patient has a known history of hypothyroidism.
#10 adrenal insufficiency Patient has a known history of adrenal insufficiency.
We discontinued her allopurinol and colchicine in the setting of acute kidney injury.
#12 acute kidney injury Patient was admitted with acute kidney injury.
#14 coronary artery disease Patient has no history of coronary artery disease.
We discontinued her [**Name2 (NI) **] secondary to GI bleed.
