[**10-22**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Mild interstitial edema.
Left lower lobe mass as seen on recent CT with new left-sided pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis and/or pneumonia (likely post-obstructive).
[**10-23**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema is unchanged.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
There are low lung volumes.
Left lower lobe opacity consistent with a lung mass, better visualized in prior CT from [**9-6**], and post-obstructive pneumonitis is stable.
No other change.
No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Marked enlargement of left lower lobe mass and left hilar lymphadenopathy.
The left lower lobe mass obstructs adjacent bronchi, resulting in post- obstructive atelectasis and/or consolidation within the lower lobe and inferior segment of the lingula.
New small pericardial and small left pleural effusion.
No significant change in right apical and superior segment right lower lobe pulmonary nodules, with morphology concerning for possible synchronous neoplasms.
Slight increase in left paratracheal and right hilar lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76 yo M with PMHx of stage IV NSCLC who presents with 3 wks of productive cough and now with hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypertension.
# PNEUMONIA: Clinical picture and chest xray most suggestive of LLL pneumonia, possibly post obstructive.
Other considerations in the differential of shortness of breath include pulmonary embolism, ACS.
He was evaluated by IP via bronchoscopy; there was no stent placed.
# Renal Failure: baseline Cr 1.4-1.7.
# Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia.
Likely related to fever and pneumonia.
# Pain: had pleuritic chest pain on admission.
CTA negative for PE; thought secondary to pleural proximity of pneumonia.
