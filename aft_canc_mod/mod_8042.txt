No superimposed edema is evident.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may be due to a small effusion.
There is no definite right effusion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:  No clear consolidation or superimposed edema.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no mass effect or CT evidence suggestive of underlying vasogenic edema.
Additionally, no intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute cortical stroke is noted.
No secondary evidence to suggest underlying metastatic disease.
Renal U/S [**2129-3-24**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo male with PMH newly diagnosed metastatic small cell cancer presents with severe neutropenia and ARF with electrolyte abnormalities.
ARF: Most likely of multifactorial etiology including pre-renal, and intrinsic renal dysfunction (FeNa 8.5%).
Intrinsic renal may be [**1-7**] cisplatin toxicity, tumor lysis syndrome, on top of CKD from HTN (baseline unknown).
Post-renal etiology seems less likely, as pt is urinating and renal U/S with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
The renal team did not feel that the patient had tumor lysis syndrome.
The patient does not wish to have hemodialysis, and the renal consult did not feel this was appropriate.
Hypocalcemia: DDx includes precipitation into CaPo4 in setting of hyperphos, tumor lysis syndrome.
His cardiac status was closely monitored and he did not develop any cardiac symptoms.
Fever and Neutropenia: The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions.
He had new infiltrates on CXR.
Respiratory symptoms improved.
Lung cancer with bone metastasis: Resulting in diffuse bony pain.
This worked well and at rest he had no pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] Care & Rehabilitation  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Acute renal failure Staph and ecoli pneumonia Neutropenia  Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Return to the hospital if you are unable to urinate, have palpitations, fever/chills, cough productive of sputum  Followup Instructions: 1.
