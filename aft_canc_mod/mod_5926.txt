Bronchoscopic approach to biopsy was nondiagnostic but there was no evidence for any disseminated disease.
I felt this was highly likely to represent lung cancer.
Past Medical History: Asthma breast cancer chronic sinusitis  Social History: 40 pack-year smoking history who quit a number of years ago  Family History: non-contrib  Physical Exam: On discharge: vitals: wd, wn, nad alert and oriented x3, mae rrr, no m/r/g lung: soft, nt, nd, nabs bilateral extrem warm, no c/c/e incisions clean, dry, and intact; no erythema or discharge  Pertinent Results: [**2167-5-11**] 03:00AM BLOOD WBC-9.9 RBC-3.49* Hgb-10.9* Hct-32.2* MCV-92 MCH-31.2 MCHC-33.8 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-242     RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2167-5-12**] 10:14 AM IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**5-11**]:  Postoperative left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural thickening extending over the apex of the aortic arch is unchanged.
Also stable following removal of left basal pleural tube is a small locule of air along the left lower costal pleural surface and a second small air collection at the left apex medially, now containing a very small volume of pleural fluid.
Level 5 lymph nodes (A): Nine lymph node(s) with no carcinoma seen (0/9).
Left upper lobectomy (B-J): Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; see synoptic report.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Squamous cell carcinoma with focal clear cell change.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main bronchus).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Emphysematous change and chronic hemorrhage.
Comments:  Immunostains of the tumor are strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, and negative for cytokeratin 20, supporting a pulmonary origin.
An epidural was in place for pain control.
A CXR late that evening revealed a large left opacity possibly consistent w/ a hemothorax.
A large amount of clot was removed and small areas of generalized oozing were cauterized but no definitive source of bleeding was isolated.
CXR revealed a large gastric bubble and dilated loops of bowel -pt did c/o fullness, was belching, passing flatus and [**Last Name (un) 1815**] clears.
A CXR did reveal mild volume overload and a right mid-lung infiltrate consistent w/ possible aspiration PNA.
A CT angio was ordered to r/o PE however, pt resp compromise worsened and requiring CTA to be post-poned and pt to the transferred to the SICU.
Bronch after intub revealed copious secretions and multiple mucous plugs.
