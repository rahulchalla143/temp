Admission Date:  [**2125-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-8-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress, "coffee ground" emesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 76 y/o male with PMHx (detailed below) significant for traumatic brain injury with [**Hospital 56102**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2125-12-13**] with nausea and vomiting, fever to 101, coffee ground emesis, markedly increased secretions, hypoxia, and hypotension.
The patient required intubation during this first hospital stay secondary to respiratory failure.
The patient developed a MRSA bacteremia and was started on Vancomycin.
On [**2125-10-27**] the patient returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for headaches and fevers.
The patient was found to have a reaccumulated subdural hematoma, a temp to 103.8, and was started on vanc, ceftriaxone, flagyl, (having had completed a fourteen day course of vancomycin on [**10-28**] for MRSA pneumonia) switched to vanco, ceftaz, flagyl on [**11-1**] to better cover pseudomonas after subdural hematoma evacuation.
The patient was subsequently found to have high grade Vancomycin resistent Enterococcus facecium bacteremia and was started on linezolid.
Urine was negative for infection, chest x-ray showed likely failure and possible pneumonia.
The patient was brought to the ED via EMS and transferred to the ICU, where he remained until [**12-12**], undergoing treatment for respiratory failure most likely related to a LLL aspiration PNA.
He was treated with a full course of Levaquin for his PNA and 5 days of Zosyn for a line infection.
When the patient returned the next day, he was febrile to 103, hypotensive with SBP<80, and had coffee ground emesis from his tracheostomy tube.

Sepsis: Patient was admitted with hypotension, elevated lactate(4.6), fever to 103, after an episode of nausea, vomiting and witnessed aspiration at [**Hospital3 **].
He was treated for presumed sepsis with aggressive IV fluids and antibiotics and defervesced.
His blood pressure stabilized overnight and elevated lactate resolved.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3805**] had no further episodes of hemodynamic instability throughout the remainder of the hospital course.
It was presumed his sepsis was secondary to the Klebsiella in his urine and sputum.
He remained afebrile throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure secondary to Aspiration Pneumonia s/p tracheostomy.
On admission, it was felt the patient had a recurrent aspiration pneumonia as he was witnessed to vomit through his tracheostomy tube.
Chest X-Ray supported the diagnosis of LUL and RLL aspiration PNA.
On admission, his prior sputum cultures were reviewd and a culture from [**12-8**] was noted to have grown Klebsiella pneumonia sensitive only to Meropenem.
Repeat sputum culture on [**12-14**] also grew Klebsiella pneumonia with multiple resistances, sensitive to meropenem.
Frequent suctioning requirement of thin clear sputum was prominently helped by application of a scopolamine patch, which decreased suctioning requirement to approximately q4-6h.
Urinary Tract Infection with Klebsiella:  Urine culture from [**12-13**] grew Klebsiella pneumonia.
History of VRE bacteremia:  The patient was continued on linezolid for empiric treatment of VRE endocarditis for 6 week course of antibiotics, given family declined TEE during his [**Month (only) 359**] admission to fully exclude endocarditis.
Fevers:  The patient was treated for his Klebsiella pneumonia and urinary tract infection with Meropenem and his fevers resolved.
The patient remained afebrile for the remainder of his hospital course after his initial febrile period.
Cardiovascular:  Blood Pressure:  Pt was hypotensive on admission in the Emergency Department with BP 90/60s.
He was managed with agressive fluid resuscitation and transient pressure support with Levophed .
Atrial Fibrillation with history of rapid ventircular response s/p IVC filter placement:  The night of admission, the patient had one episode of a fib with conversion to NSR after IV metoprolol was administered.
No anti-coagulation was indicated given his history of multiple intracranial bleeds.
He did have an enzyme leak with a peak of troponin of 0.19 and CK of 293.
It was felt the leak was secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension on admission.
Upper GI bleed:  The patient was noted to have coffee ground emesis on presentation to the ED.
Prior to transfer to the floor the pt was started on sucralfate and the PPI was discontinued because of possible bone marrow suppression influencing the patient's platelet count.
Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and has a history of low platelets.
