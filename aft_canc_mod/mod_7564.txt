Bilateral tremor to BLE.
Diffusion restricted, peripherally enhancing mass, centered in the choroid plexus of the left trigone and infiltrating the subependyma and possibly the adjacent left brain parenchyma.
Thickening and increased enhancement along the left sided choroid plexus towards the choroid fissure which harbours a second more solid focus (7 mm) of enhancement.
Extensive vasogenic edema involving the left parietal and temporal lobe with significant mass effect, midline shift of about 15 mm and subfalcine herniation.
In the presence of a recently diagnosed lung mass, the finding most likely respresents metastatic disease, while a primary plexus tumor is not entirely excluded.
2.6 x 1.4 cm lobulated mass in left upper lobe of lung concerning for malignancy.
No other pulmonary nodules or evidence of metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Mild distal aortic ectasia and atherosclerotic calcification.
1.3-cm left adrenal mass with imaging findings consistent with adenoma  [**2188-4-21**] CTA head IMPRESSION: Edema and rim-enhancing lesion in the left periatrial region.
No abnormal vascular structures are identified in the region or abnormal draining veins are seen.
Calcification of the choroid plexus is seen adjacent to the enhancing mass, but no ependymal enhancement is appreciated on the CTA examination.
No evidence of occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm noted on the CTA examination in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation.
No significant activation areas are noted adjacent to the lesion.
[**2188-4-25**] MRI brain Unchanged lesion in the left temporoparietal lobe adjacent to the left trigone, with likely intraventricular extension and extensive surrounding vasogenic edema.
The second lesion in the left cerebellum is also unchanged.
[**2188-4-26**] CT head Expected postoperative changes status post craniotomy for left parietotemporal lesion.
Postoperative pneumocephalus and small amount of hemorrhage within the postoperative bed.
There is appearance of residual abnormal soft tissue in the left periatrial region and within the left lateral ventricle.
Post-surgical changes in the left parietal region and in the left parietal lobe.
Mild decrease in the size of the previously noted lesion with presence of blood products and gas in the surgical bed.
Significant moderate to marked vasogenic edema, with effacement of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle and rightward shift of midline structures by approximately 9 mm, mildly increased since the presurgical study.
No new lesions noted.
Increased signal in the right mastoid air cells from fluid or mucosal thickening.
[**4-28**] head CT: post surgical changes with pneumocephalus and vasogenic edema.
Scant amount of hemorrhage in the L lateral ventricle and surrounding the forth ventricle.
[**4-29**] Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung parenchyma has increased transparency.
There is no evidence of pneumonia, but atelectases are seen at both lung bases.
Post-surgical changes and blood products in the left parietal lobe and the adjacent bone.
Moderate surrounding edema with effacement of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
2. decrease in size of left cerebellar enhancing lesion measuring approximately 6.6 mm with mild surrounding edema.
Diffuse fluid and mucosal thickening in the right mastoid air cells.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service for further workup of his L parietal mass.
A CT torso revealed a large lung mass and an adrenal mass.
An MRI head showed a single mass with extensive edema that is not proportionate to the size of the lesion.
CT showed minimal hemorrhage.
Head CT showed post surgical changes with minimal pneumocephalus.
A repeat MRI postop on [**4-29**] demonstrated decreased tumor burden.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-19**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
- You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the Oncology team for follow up of your Lung and adrenal mass with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**].
