Final Report INDICATION: 46-year-old male patient with left occipital tumor with brain lesions, history of cutaneous melanoma, to evaluate further.
FINDINGS:  There are two enhancing lesions in the brain, one in the right frontal lobe at the vertex and another one in the left occipital lobe, parasagittal in location.
The right frontal lesion measures 1.5 x 1.7 x 2.0 cm with mild surrounding edema.
The left occipital lesion measures 3.5 x 3.1 x 2.6 cm.
There is effacement of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and part of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle from the mass effect and surrounding edema around the left occipital lesion.
There are also a few cystic areas noted in the left occipital lesion.
The major vascular intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.
Evaluation for bony lesions is limited MR study.
There is a prominent extra-axial CSF space, noted in the superior part of the posterior fossa, causing indentation on the superior aspect of the cerebellar hemisphere, best seen on the sagittal reformations and measures 1.7 x 3.2 cm in the AP CC dimensions.
Two enhancing lesions in the brain, one in the right frontal and another one in the left occipital lobe as mentioned above, representing metastatic lesions.
Moderate surrounding vasogenic edema with effacement of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and part of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
Prominent extra-axial CSF space in the superior aspect of the posterior fossa causing indentation on the superior part of the cerebellum as described above, which can represent prominent CSf space with a differential diagnosis of arachnoid cyst in this location.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  There has been an interval left parietooccipital craniotomy and resection of a left occipital mass.
There is pneumocephalus overlying the left temporal lobe and along the left parietal lobe.
Increased opacification consistent with blood products are seen at the resection site as well as air within the tissues.
Otherwise, there is no new hemorrhage, loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter junction differentiation, there is no significant mass effect.
Mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes status post resection of left occipital mass with no significant midline shift.

Expected postoperative changes status post resection of occipital mass.
New hemorrhage and right frontal lesion.
Final Report INDICATION: Status post resection of occipital mass, metastatic melanoma, evaluate for postoperative changes.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo images were obtained through the brain.
Axial, coronal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was repeated after intravenous administration of gadolinium contrast.
FINDINGS: Left occipital lobe postoperative changes are seen with high T1 signal material with negative susceptibility suggestive of blood.
Moderate edema surrounds this postoperative site and the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is again effaced.
The right frontal lesion (series 6, image 23) demonstrates a new negative susceptibility suggestive most suggestive of a hemorrhage.
Edema about this lesion seems grossly similar to prior with no obvious mass effect proximally.
Expected postoperative changes in the left occipital lobe.
Apparent new hemorrhage of the right frontal metastasis without edema or significant mass effect.
