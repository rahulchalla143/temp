She recently underwent exploratory laparotomy with tumor biopsy [**2146-5-25**] for evaluation of a pelvic mass with placement of bilaterel ureteral stents.
The surgery was complicated by acute renal failure with creat up to 2.6 from baseline 1.5 suspectedly due to ATN from ureteral obstruction although renal US revealed no clear obstruction and she was discharged [**5-29**] with creat improved to 1.9.
She initially was feeling well but over the next 2 days developed worsening fevers, nausea w/o vomiting and decreased urine output.
On the day of admission she developed a fever to 102 with night sweats on the night prior with worsening confusion and was brought to the ED.
She denied cough, has mild abdominal discomfort and had no BM.
She denies dysuria but did report some mild bilateral flank pain.
In the ED she was found to be in acute on chronic RF with elevated lactate to 7.6 and positive UA.
Abd CT revealed left sided mild hydronephrosis with no asymmetric stranding and diffuse lymphomatous involvment of the retroperitoneum extending up the ureters and involving the renal pelvises as well.
Sepsis line placed and she was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl and given 3l NS for hydration with vital signs stable.
She was also evaluated by Ob/gyn who agreed that admission to ICU for sepsis was appropriate.
CT scan performed on [**2146-5-6**] revealed extensive ascites and peritoneal masses concerning for ovarian cancer.
Also, noted were bilateral ureteral irregularities close to obstruction, both on the left and the right.
CVA- no residual deficit R carotid artery occlusion Melanoma- (~[**2140**]) Left eye localized involvement, s/p proton beam tx without evidence of recurrence hypertension hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism gout .

CXR ([**2146-6-5**]): There has been interval withdrawal of the right IJ line, with the tip now in the distal SVC.
Left proximal NU stent is in the proximal left ureter, and there is associated hydronephrosis.
There is extensive soft tissue around both ureters, which may reflect extension of the patient's known lymphoma.
Additionally, there is soft tissue stranding around the left ureter, and associated forniceal rupture cannot be excluded.
Extensive soft tissue in the pelvis, which likely reflects a combination of the uterus, the known lymphoma, and unopacified loops of bowel, though subacute hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Tiny foci of air within this, and also likely small extraluminal air, likely reflect changes related to prior biopsy and recent surgery.
These findings are consistent with patient's known lymphoma.
Small amount of fluid along the anterior abdominal wall incision.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Small volume ascites.
She received cytoxan, prednisone, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate.
She developed tumor lysis syndrome which was treated with high rates of IVF and diuresis to keep her urine output up.
She did not develop complications, and tumor lysis resolved.
She continued to have hematuria, the etiology of which was felt to be ureteral irritation by both the tumor mass and the several urologic procedures for stenting of her occluded ureters.
A renal ultrasound was performed on the day prior to discharge to eval for resolution of hydronephrosis.
It showed no evidence for hydronephrosis.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
