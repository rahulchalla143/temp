[**4-25**] CT NECK Small fluid collection just anterior to the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and deep to the platysma muscle now measures 1.1 x 0.9 cm, previously 2.1 x 1.1 cm (2:47).
There is continued improvement in the small fluid collection abutting the posterolateral aspect of the cricoarytenoid cartilage, which now only measures 0.4 cm, previously 1.2 x 0.4 cm (2:56).
Mild soft tissue stranding and thickening surrounds common carotid and internal jugular vessels decreased from initial study; vessels appear patent.
Extensive cervical lymphadenopathy seen on [**2159-4-28**] exam has decreased and stable comapred to [**2159-5-10**].
No flow-limiting stenosis is noted.
Near complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus has resolved with only mild mucosal thickening of its posterior wall remaining (2:24).
Inspissated secretions of the left sphenoid sinus persists.
Otherwise, paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
There is no pneumothorax.
C5/6: Disc-osteophyte complex indenting the ventral thecal sac; mild foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION:  Continued improvement of left cervical inflammatory changes when compared to [**2159-5-10**] exam with details as above with some residual abnormalities.
[**5-10**] CT NECK Overall, much improved appearance of the inflammatory and necrotic changes from the prior study.
There remain two small fluid collections which still exert some regional mass effect on the esophagus, but no airway compromise at this stage.
Although incompletely evaluated, multiple necrotic lymph nodes are again noted in the left neck, better delineated on dedicated neck study from [**2159-4-28**].
Nodularity is also noted at the left thyroid lobe, and a focal lesion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of malignant disease in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis otherwise.
#Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for airway protection after a large left sided neck mass was noted on exam and on CT of the neck.
She was intubated on [**2159-4-29**] with ENT and anesthesia present for airway protection given the extrinsic compression from this mass as well as concern for laryngeal edema.
The biopsy of the neck mass showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma and she was started on R-CHOP therapy by the hematology/oncology team.
Her neck mass was markedly reduced in size with this intervention.
She was noted to have a cuff leak and was successfully extubated on [**2159-5-7**], again with ENT and anesthesia present.
She was subsequently transfrred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] a second time for worsening hoarseness and dysphagia after extubation.
She had a CT neck on [**2159-5-20**] which showed no airway compromise and markedly improved edema compared to the prior study.
She was also seen by ENT who also say no evidence of airway compromise during laryngoscopy.
Her pain improved as the mass continued to recede.
# TMJ: She complained of significant left ear pain.
ENT was consulted and felt her pain was most consistent with TMJ dysfunction.
#Pneumonia: There was an equivocal LLL infiltrate on her CXR and the decision was made to treat her for pneumonia given that she was to be started on chemotherapy and would be immunosuppressed.
# UTI: Pt complained of dysuria and UA revealed UTI.
Cultures grew pan sensitive E Coli and she was given a 5d course of Ciprofloxacin.
# Hypothyroidism Continued on levothyroxine.
# Crohns disease Continued asacol (held while intubated) .
# Seizure disorder Continued trileptal .
# Depression/anxiety Continued seroqual and clonazepam.
# HTN Continued clonidine .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Patient has endorsed decreased hearing in her left ear, likely due to compression from the mass.
She was afebrile and HD stable at the time of discharge.
