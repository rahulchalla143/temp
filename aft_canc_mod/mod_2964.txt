Admission Date:  [**2128-12-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-1-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-3-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old female with multiple medical problems who was brought to the Emergency Department on the day of admission from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Facility for evaluation of a cold left foot.
The patient had recently been discharged approximately one month prior to this visit from [**Hospital6 2018**] after having a low anterior resection for rectal cancer.
Her postoperative course has been complicated by deep venous thrombosis for which the patient remained on Coumadin.
She reported left leg swelling and pain intermittently since that operation but reported increasing pain, changing color, and temperature over the prior 24 hours.
The patient denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or change in her fingerstick blood glucose.
DVT, status post [**Location (un) 260**] filter placed in [**2109**] with recurrent extensive left lower extremity DVT seen on admitting ultrasound.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin.
Iron sulfate.
General:  The patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly lady in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Chronic venous stasis changes of the bilateral lower extremities to the shin.
Cool left foot, decreased sensation in a stocking-like distribution of the bilateral feet.
No palpable or Dopplerable pulses bilaterally in the Emergency Department on the dorsalis pedis.
There was 3+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound revealed large clot burden in the left lower extremity venous system.
She was placed on a heparin drip for the deep venous thromboses and conservative measures were utilized to improve the bilateral lower extremity edema.
Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital 1739**] Medical Service on [**2128-12-16**] and an arterial Doppler of the lower extremities on [**2128-12-17**] revealed a significant flow deficit to both ankles.
Subsequently, the patient was known to have decreasing platelet counts and was switched from heparin to lepirudin on [**2128-12-18**].
On the following day, [**2128-12-19**], the patient was found hypotensive in respiratory distress and was intubated on the floor and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Her initial ICU course was notable for CT of the chest revealing right lower lobe consolidation, bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage yielding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus for which she was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
The patient was transferred back out to the general medical floor on [**2128-12-26**] for continued management of her pneumonia and deep venous thromboses.
However, the patient was again transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the following day for hypercarbic respiratory distress that was initially responsive to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
On [**2128-12-29**], the patient again required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for an additional attempt for persistent desaturations.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit course was significant for repeat bronchoscopy that yielded similar findings to prior with Staphylococcus aureus islet.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacifications.
The patient's ICU course was further complicated by acute renal insufficiency and GI bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells while anticoagulated for the previously identified deep venous thromboses.
Acute renal failure.
Deep venous thromboses.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
