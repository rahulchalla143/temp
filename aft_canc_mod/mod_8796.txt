Per Emergency Department report, she apparently had fallen 24 hours to 36 hours before being found and was unable to rise secondary to weakness.
She denied any loss of consciousness or focal pain.
On initial presentation, the patient was alert, weak, conversant, but hypothermic with a rectal temperature of 92.9.
Transitional cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver and pelvis, bilateral hydronephrosis.
Right infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast diagnosed in [**2186-5-30**], status post lumpectomy and radiation therapy.
Hypothyroidism after ablation.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Bilateral hydronephrosis (as previously described).
She was an elderly-appearing, thin, chronically ill-appearing woman in no acute distress.

Her mucous membranes were dry.
No lymphadenopathy was noted.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound were noted; however, there was a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base.
Her extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She had chronic venous stasis changes in her shins bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with normal axis, first-degree anterior vesicular block delay with an increased QTc of 515.
A head CT without contrast did not show any acute intracranial pathology.
By hospital day four, the patient was weaned off pressors; however, she subsequently developed left upper extremity paralysis and a leftward gaze and was unresponsive.
