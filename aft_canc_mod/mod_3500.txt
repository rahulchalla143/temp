He has a lab MELD of 27 and a MELD of 31 with exception points and is admitted for liver transplant today.
He has no significant cardiac history and his most recent ([**4-21**]) Echo showed normal [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular activity with LVEF >55%.
He has a history of medically refractory ascites and is on Lasix and Aldactone daily.
He had a hernia repair that was complicated by MRSA SBP in [**2167-3-14**] and finished a 4 week course of vancomycin.
He was also recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 75820**]) for cellulitis at the prior umbilical hernia site and was also empirically treated for MRSA SBP due to elevated WBC of 1000 on paracentesis.
Fortunately, the ascitic fluid has since proved no bacteria growth.
Swab cultures from the umbilicus grew VRE and E. coli resistant to Cipro and the patient was sent to rehab on a 11 day course of daptomycin and Bactrim for SBP.
He finished his daptomycin course and remains on Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis.
His most recent paracenteses performed on [**5-23**] and [**5-30**] where 4L was removed each time, were negative for SBP and had no growth on cultures.
The patient has been afebrile and his cellulitis has resolved.
He has been doing relatively well at [**Name (NI) **] rehab and has been on continuous tube feeds due to history of failure to thrive.
