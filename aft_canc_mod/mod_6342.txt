80-M s/ MMP incl dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and diverticulosis, p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR with dropping Hct and HD instability manifesting as hypotension.
Now s/p 4units PRBCs, 2units FFP, Vit K, 3.5L NS, with continued drop in Hct to 30. .
GI bleeding - Pt p/w BRBPR w/ dropping Hct and hypotension.
Anti-hypertensives were held initially given hypotension and patient was given gentle hydration given CHF history.
He had no further episodes of bleeding and his HCT remained stable until discharge.
Unclear reason for elevated INR (?nutritional) but came down slowly throughout admission.
# CAD - Pt w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2173**], cardiac stents x2, unclear [**Name2 (NI) 79461**].
Most recent TTE done in [**2178**] per PCP who state EF 45%, last persantine study [**2181**] with EF 55%, patient not currentyl on ASA or plavix, has been very stable recently from CV perspective.
Patient has hx sternal infection, s/p sternal resection.
Quinapril was held due to low blood pressures and will continue to be held until seen in outpt follow-up.
# Chronic atrial-fibrillation - Pt's ECG afib, rate-controlled w/BB but not on any anti-coagulation.
# Congestive heart failure - Pt maintained on BB and ACE-I at home.
On exam, with rales e/o fluid overload.
# AAA s/p endovascular repair - Pt had CT at OSH to eval endovascular repair of AAA, which was negative, no leak.
Hypertension - Home medications include quinapril and metop.
Hyperlipidemia - continued on statin .
Chronic renal insufficiency - Baseline Cr per PCP 1.9-2, on admit was 1.8, currently at baseline through hospital admission, no changes or interventions done.
