Admission Date:  [**2158-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-4-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Penicillins / Chocolate Flavor / Erythromycin Base / Tape [**12-18**] / Monosodium Glutamate / Mold Extracts / Oxycodone / IV Dye, Iodine Containing Contrast Media / Iodine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left sided thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 57yo woman with RCC metastatic to lungs with recent progression of disease in the area of the right mainstem bronchus, s/p mechanical debridement of endobronchial exophytic lesion, now being transferred from [**Hospital6 15083**] with SOB.
She has a h/o recurrent pleural effusions and has baseline DOE.
She was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 17949**] with dyspnea at rest, cough, and chest pressure, and was found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Yesterday, she was experiencing worsening of her respiratory distress, so she was taken to [**Hospital6 15083**] ED and was admitted.
Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial, related to pleural effusion, atelectasis, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary masses.
TTE showed a moderate pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance.
V/Q scan was low to intermediate probability for pulmonary embolus, and CXR and CT revealed progression of large soft tissue mass with atelectasis and increased loculated right pleural effusion.
She endorses chest congestion and cough that is sometimes productive of a yellow sputum.
Denies chest pain, abdominal pain, or vomiting, but endorses nausea.
Reports weight loss over the last six months.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**9-/2151**] CT scan showed  Large left renal mass.
MRI/MRV demonstrated a large 7.5 cm left lower pole mass, with no filling defect of the left renal vein.
Bone scan negative for osseous metastases.
Venous invasion was present; the renal vein margin was negative.
(pT3a Nx Mx) - [**2154-2-8**]:  A CT scan demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, the largest 7 mm in diameter.
- [**2154-3-4**] PET scan: Multiple pulmonary nodules and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.
- [**2154-4-5**]: Video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobe and right middle lobe wedge resections and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
Pathology confirmed the presence of metastatic carcinoma of renal origin in the two wedge resections and in the level 8R paraesophageal lymph node.
Decrease in size of numerous small pulmonary nodules.
Stable tiny pulmonary nodules as well as nodular scarring in the right lower lobe.
- [**2154-12-18**] CT torso showed slight increase in dominant right infrahilar mass when measured in the axial plane compared to the prior two exams.
- [**2155-1-2**]: Flexible bronchoscopy revealed extrinsic compression, with near complete occlusion of the anterior segment of the right lower lobe bronchus and mucoid secretions emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed x3 with pathology revealing atypical clusters of epithelioid cells suspicious for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
In addition, bronchial washings and brushings were obtained, revealing atypical cells in scattered clusters.
- [**2155-1-29**]:  Flexible bronchoscopy and video-assisted thoracic surgery with right lower lobe wedge resection and intralobar pulmonary artery lymph node excision.
Pathology revealed lymph node fragments with metastatic carcinoma consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
The excised fragment of the right lower lobe demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.
- [**2156-7-19**]: Began therapy with MDX 1411 on Phase I protocol 08-209 - [**2156-10-18**]: Began palliative sunitinib after scans showed disease progression with MDX 1411; needed to terminate first cycle one week early due to severe thrombocytopenia (platelets 27k).
- [**2157-3-19**]: Switched to pazopanib because of progressive difficulties tolerating sunitinib (and progressing disease on lower doses of sunitinib); dose reduced to 600 mg daily due to side effect.
- [**2157-7-25**] CT TORSO shows overall improvement of pulmonary nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy - [**2157-9-8**] CT TORSO shows disease progression - [**2157-9-12**] bronchoscopy showed tumor infiltration of the endobronchial mucosa throughout the right main stem and bronchus intermedius.
Endobronchial exophytic lesion partially obstructing the opening of the right main stem, which was mechanically debrided.
- [**0-0-**] external beam radiation to the lesion in the R hilum.
[**0-0-**] additional palliative XRT - [**2158-9-16**] everolimus - [**2157-12-7**] - [**2158-3-27**] Avastin, d/c due to worsening symptoms - [**2158-3-30**] CT torso shows disease progression - [**4-18**] start Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 D1 and D8 q21d, [**4-20**] start Sutent 25 mg 2 weeks ON 1 week OFF - [**7-3**] - Progression of pulmonary disease on gemcitabine/sutent, but patient experiencing symptomatic improvement.

Right pleural effusion has slightly increased.
Left pleural effusion is not significantly changed.
Dense consolidation and partial collapse of the right lung along with bilateral pulmonary masses.
The extent of disease has significantly increased since the prior exam.
Loculated pleural fluid on the right.
Small pericardial effusion.
Small left pleural effusion.
Low to intermediate probability for PE in the left lung (approx 20-30%).
Large matched defect in the right lung which corresponds to prior imaging.
A moderate pericardial effusion was identified circumferential to the heart.
There is no clear hemodynamic effect seen in by respirophasic change in mitral inflow velocities.
In addition, the IVC appears to be normal in size with respirophasic change.
However, the RV appears small, markedly so in the subcostal view, which would be consistent with increased intrapericardial pressures.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion, predominantly around the apex.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is minimal respiratory variation in intracardiac flow velocities that does not meet criteria for tamponade.
Mild elevation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The study is of suboptimal technical quality and regional dysfunction, particularly in the anterior septum, cannot be fully excluded.
Small pericardial effusion predominantly around the apex with evidence of stranding.
There is no definitive evidence of pericardial tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-9-22**], there appears to be a slight increase in the size of the pericardial effusion, also evidence of stranding and echo density suggestive of blood, cellular elements.
CXR [**2158-10-6**]: Moderate left pleural effusion is larger.
Combination of large central masses and right pleural or extrapleural abnormality and severe atelectasis in the right lung is unchanged.
Progressive rightward mediastinal shift suggests combination of worsening right-sided atelectasis and the influence of the enlarging left pleural effusion.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No overt right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (RV not well visualized in some views).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-6**], no clear change.
There has been progressive accumulation of pleural fluid at the left lung base, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, through the effusion remains relatively small.
Left hilum again appears slightly prominent.
Diffuse opacity in the right lung is essentially unchanged.
Progressive slight increase in a small left effusion at the left lung base, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
TTE [**2158-10-9**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo woman with RCC metastatic to lungs, with progression of disease in the area of the right mainstem bronchus, s/p mechanical debridement of endobronchial exophytic lesion, also with recurrent pleural effusions and recent admission for pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology requiring pericardiocentesis and [**Year (4 digits) 19843**] placement, now admitted with dyspnea.
OSH evaluation revealed progression of underlying pulmonary disease with increased volume loss and atelectasis as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
Additionally, TTE revealed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade physiology.
On hospital day 2, pt developed sudden worsening of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing for which she was transferred to the intensive care unit.
She was treated for COPD exacerbation with IV Solu-Medrol initially that was transitioned to oral prednisone taper.
Repeat TTEs did not show enlarging pericardial effusion or tamponade.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted who felt that acute episode of dyspnea was likely from mucus plug.
She improved dramatically overnight and was no longer feeling dyspneic by the next morning.
