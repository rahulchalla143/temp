His wife tried taking his BP without any success.
EKG showed wide complex tachycardia.

Pertinent Results: EKG [**2130-11-25**] Wide complex regular tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia.
Compared to tracing of [**2130-8-15**] ventricular tachycardia is new.
EKG [**2130-11-27**] Demand ventricular pacing with ventricular premature depolarizations and underlying atrial fibrillation.
PLEURAL FLUID- LEFT THORACENTESIS- GRAM STAIN NEGATIVE, CULTURE PENDING UPON DISCHARGE, SENT FOR CYTOLOGY, PENDING UPON DISCHARGE, SENT FOR CHEMISTRIES WHICH REVEAL THIS AS A TRANSUDATIVE EFFUSION BY LIGHTS CRITERIA.
No evidence of DVT.
Non-occlusive thrombus involving the left median antecubital vein, not part of the deep venous system.
[**12-5**] CHEST X RAY S/P THORACENTESIS ON LEFT: In comparison with the study of [**12-4**], there has been removal of a substantial amount of pleural fluid on the right.
Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.
ECHO [**11-27**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/infero-lateral akinesis (basal to mid infero-lateral wall thinned c/w with prior infarct/scar).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
URINE CULTURES: NO GROWTH.
Found to be in V tach and was slightly symptomatic (fatigue, lightheadedness) he was given an amiodarone load of 150mg over 10 minutes IV and became hypotensive (initially thought to be due to amio however the determined that patient was septic).
He became unresponsive and was shocked with 200J and regained a normal rhythm.
He was then taken off of the drip as the VT had been related to his ongoing sepsis and when his blood pressure was stabilized and his infection was being treated the thought was his VT would not recur in the immediate sense.
Given his infection a decision was made by EP not to exchange his pacer for an ICD on this admission and to possibly perform this as an outpatient.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: persistently elevated WBC count, ESR 5, unlikely still related to C diff as C diff is being treated well.
Patient also has seen Heme onc inpatient as he has a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and has multiple elevated WBCs in the past.
CHF: given initial sepsis, he was volume resuscitated with 6 liters of normal saline, eventually he was slowly diuresed and had a thoracentesis which relieved 1.5 liters of fluid from his pleural space, transudateive.
The pleural fluid culture and cytology are still pending upon discharge, gram stain negative for organisms.
DM- insulin regimen adjusted to NPH 9 qam and 9 qpm with a sliding scale as inpatient, after patient's acute illness fully resolves he may need to go back to his home regimen of NPH 7 qam and 7 qpm with a sliding scale.
HYPERCOAGULABILTY: Patient hypercoagulable, despite coumadin he had spontaneous clots to his SMA and R lower extremity.
LOWER L FOOT ULCER: Pt seen by podiatry, they are not concerned for osteomyelitis at this time.
CHRONIC PAIN: Continued outpatient pain regimen.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Clostridium Difficile Colitis Ventricular Tachycardia  Secondary Diagnosis GERD DM II CHF Hypercoagulability BKA R leg Short Gut syndrome Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, with out Ventricular Tachycardia.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 21212**] you were admitted to the hospital because of weakness, low blood pressure and an abnormal heart rhythm known as ventricular tachycardia.
In the emergency room you became unresponsive and you were shocked in order to convert your heart into a ventricularly paced rhythm.
You were given several liters of fluid and started on medication to keep your blood pressure up.
It was then noted that you were having large amounts of diarrhea, larger than what normally occurs with your short gut syndrome.
Tests confirmed that you had an infection in your colon known as clostridium difficile.
During your hospital stay you developed a 15 hour run of ventricular tachycardia.
None of these things kept you in a normal heart rhythm for very long.
You were taken by the electrophysiology team for an ablation of the part of your heart causing the abnormal rhythm known as VT or Vtach.
During your care you were also found to have a persistently elevated white blood cell count.
You were evaluated by the hematology service who thought that your white blood cell elevation may have been secondary to infection or an abnormality in your specific type of white blood cell.
You were also noted to have a small ulcer on the largest toe of your L leg.
Podiatry was consulted and felt that the infection was superficial and that the infection had not moved into the bone.
You were noted to have a large effusion on CXR.
It was felt that you would benefit from having this fluid removed from your lungs.
The preliminary results showed no bacterial infection in your pleural fluid.
The fluid was sent to look for any type of abnormal cells.
During your stay you developed some impaired renal function this was likely due to your dehydration in the setting of your infection.
You developed an infection in your left eye.
If you develop chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, worsening diarrhea, fever, chills, palpitations, weakness or any other worsening of your condition please call your doctor and go to the emergency room immediately.
