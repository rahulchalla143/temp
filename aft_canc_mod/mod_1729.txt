Since previous tracing, no significant change.
There is slight blunting of both costophrenic angles with minor atelectatic changes seen at the lung bases.
There is no focal consolidation.
Pulmonary vasculature appears slightly prominent, but there is no CHF.
No definite CHF.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium.
4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, in the aortic arch, and in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or mobile vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, however cannot exclude a sessile vegetation (the valve leaflets are severely calcified).
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
There is probably moderate aortic valve stenosis (recommend transthoracic echo for complete evaluation of the aortic stenosis if clinically indicated).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
No prior strudy available for comparison.
[**2113-1-17**]: LIMITED ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: There is a tiny amount of fluid adjacent to the liver.
There are no loculated fluid collections.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old male with MMP including CAD, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and recent admission to OSH with enterococcus fecalis UTI and bacteremia, complicated by presumed enteroccus endocarditis (negative TEE but recurrent positive blood cultures and ongoing fever), treated with Ampicillin IV (1 gm IV q 6 hours) and Gentamicin IV (started on [**2113-1-5**]), now admitted with fever, hypotension and respiratory symptoms.
1) Hypotension/fever: Given the hypotension in the setting of recurrent fever and recent enterococcal bacteremia, the most likely etiology was felt to be septic shock +/- cardiogenic component.
A bedside echo on admission showed relatively preserved EF, no pleural effusion.
It was unclear whether his fever/hypotension were related to persistent enterococcal infection or a new nosocomial infection.
CXR was without PNA and U/A clear.
The antibiotic regimen was changed to Vancomycin IV and Gentamycin IV for Rx of enterococcus +/ line infection.
However, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fever up to 102.3 on Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
A repeat TEE was performed on [**2113-1-16**], which revealed normal LVEF 60-65%, and no vegetation although a sessile vegetation could not be ruled out given severe calcification of aortic valve.
An abdominal U/S was also performed, which revealed a small amount of ascites and no fluid collection.
Given his respiratory symptoms, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO QD was added to cover for pulmonary organisms.
A nasal wash was also sent to rule out Influenza, which came back positive for Influenza A.
In retrospect, his acute presentation was felt likely secondary to Influenza.
Given the duration of his symptoms and clinical improvement, decision was taken not to treat.
Respiratory symptoms resolved at the time of discharge.
Of note, sensitivities were repeated on the OSH isolate and Ampicillin sensitivity was confirmed, MIC <=2.
CXRs in hospital revealed progressive fluid overload, and Lasix dose was titrated up to maintain negative fluid balance.
Low threshold to increase Lasix if increasing edema on exam, or >=3lbs weight gain as creatinine tolerates.
3) CAD: Troponin 0.09 (peak) on admission, felt likely troponin leak in the setting of infection and renal failure.
EKG without acute ischemic changes.
History of adverse reaction to ACE.
Coumadin dose decreased to 1 mg PO QHS given elevated INR in hospital (out-patient dose 2mg PO QHS).
5) Diabetes mellitus type 2: Poor glycemic control in hospital.
Gentamicin levels monitored carefully in hospital given risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
Of note, patient noted to have mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and GGT in hospital, also elevated at OSH.
Abdominal U/S at OSH negative for CBD dilatation, no GB wall thickening, no pericholecystic fluid.
No acute issues in hospital.
