This morning he awoke with a [**Month/Year (2) **] and states he developed some chest pain after a coughing spell "like a pulled muscle, not cardiac" after coughing.
He also notes feeling short of breath, but not much more than he has in the past.
Pt attributes SOB to pain during inspiration.
An echocardiogram performed earlier today showed a moderate effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Pt he felt dizzy earlier in the week but currently denies any dizziness or lightheadedness.
CXR was notable for stable L pleural effusion with pleurx in place and R pleural effusion, unchanged from [**9-18**].
The patient was given iv dilaudid and tachypnea improved.
Barium swallow demonstrated a stricture in the distal esophagus.
ECG demonstrated circumferential narrowing and thickening at the GE junction (40 cm), and extended proximally to 35 cm.
Biopsies were performed and pathology demonstrated adenocarcinoma, mucin-producing with few signet ring cells, moderately differentiated.
He underwent PET/CT scan [**2113-12-31**], which showed FDG uptake in the GE junction but no evidence of regional or distant metastases.
He was referred for EUS staging, performed on [**2114-1-5**], which demonstrated a mass at the distal esophagus/GEJ consistent with known adenocarcinoma, maximum depth 1 cm, with extension beyond the muscularis propria.
There were no concerning lymph nodes identified.
By EUS, the tumor was staged as T3N0Mx, Stage IIB esophageal adenocarcinoma.
He underwent [**Month/Day/Year 12351**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy [**2114-4-25**] which demonstrated residual disease, including a positive proximal margin.
Surveillance endoscopy demonstrated friable and nodular distal esophagus and biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma.
[**2114-9-3**] C1D1 Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU given by continuous infusion pump Mon-Fri x96 hours given his difficulty swallowing pills) [**2114-9-24**] C2D1 Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil .
He works in software and customer teaching for an electronic access device maker.
He has a sister who has had breast cancer twice and a brother with diabetes.

However, the inferior and posterior walls appear dyskinetic, and the overall left ventricular ejection fraction is depressed (?
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-7-18**], the overall left ventricular ejection fraction appears lower secondary to increased dyskinesis of the inferior and posterior walls  CXR: IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of esophageal stent, bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and bibasilar opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis  MICRO: None  Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo male with advanced esophageal ca s/p palliative chemo/XRT, recurrent pl effusions s/p L pleurex, CAD s/p POBA/PCI [**2101**] who was sent in from cardiology clinic for hypotension and tachypnea.
#Respiratory distress:  Pt found to be tachypnic in ED and was started on nasal canula.
Most likely secondary to poor tidal volumes in setting of chest wall strain from coughing yesterday.
Pt notes acute onset of pain after coughing last night and physical exam notable for reproducable pain.
ECG unchanged from baseline and echo unremarkable for new wall abnormalities this morning.
While pleural effusion may be contributing to dyspnea, CXR is largley unchanged from yesterday with stable R effusion and drained L effusion with pleurex in place.
No signs of pneumothorax on CXR.
He was discharged with a prescription of dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
#Hypotension: Most likely secondary to poor po intake.
No signs of tamponade or MI on cardio workup.
No signs of pneumothorax on CXR.
Pt does promote poor po intake over recent weeks with 25lbs weight loss.
Pt's hypotension has resolved thus far with hydration.
Furthermore, hypotension resolved with fluids and no appreciable JVP on PE.
