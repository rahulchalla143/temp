CXR ([**11-30**])In comparison with the study of [**11-29**], there is a decrease in the right basilar consolidation, consistent with resolving aspiration pneumonia.
The left base now is essentially clear.
No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
Exuberant ossification of the ALL, from C5/6 through C7/1, likely related to underlying DISH (based on limited single AP radiograph of the chest); though this is interrupted, there is no evidence of acute fracture.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction.
Chronic sinus inflammatory disease.
No evidence of acute vertebral compression fracture or other injury involving the thoracolumbar spine.
Prominent Schmorl nodes in the L1 and L2 superior endplates, with associated chronic-appearing compression and anterior wedge deformity, but no spinal canal compromise.
L4-5: Multifactorial severe spinal canal and left more than right neural foraminal stenosis, with significant compression of the thecal sac and likely impingement upon the exiting left L4 nerve root.
Paraseptal emphysema at the left lung apex and evident bibasilar dependent atelectasis, chronic bronchiectasis and scarring, which may relate to prior aspiration episodes, and apparent interlobular septal thickening, of unclear significance; these findings are incompletely imaged.
MRI Cspine ([**11-28**]): Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligaments with associated degenerative chagnes, but without evidence of ligamentous injury or an acute fracture or dislocation.
There is no evidence of spinal cord compromise.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o M w/ h/o hep c, polysubstance abuse multiple previous admissions for etoh abuse/seizure p/w grand-mal seizure and etoh withdrawal requiring ICU stay.
# Encephalopathy, due to benzodiazepine toxicity: On the morning of transfer to the general medical floor, patient was found to be extremely sedated.
Given the large amount of diazepam patient received over the past few days, it was thought to be secondary to benzo toxicity.
After developing benzo toxicity diazepam was held and CIWA continued to be monitored.
# Suicidal Ideation: After transfer out of the ICU.
Pt vocalized suicidal ideation to the night float resident during a period of agitation.
Pt had no plan.
Further psych evaluated and patient denied suicial ideation.
No known seizure history.
Head CT without acute process.
No seizure acitivity after transfer to the floor.
Culture positive for moraxella.
At discharge patient afebrile with CXR showing resolution in pneumonia ([**11-30**]).
Pt asked to follow up with PCP regarding pneumonia or return to the hospital if symptoms recur.
# Trauma: C spine cleared by MRI.
No other acute fractures identified.
# Hep C: Stable, no prior EGD's to suggest varices.
No portal HTN by USD [**2175**] .
Evaluated by psychiatry who felt patient had no continued suicidal ideation and did not need to be restrained.
He was warned that we did not feel that he was ready to be discharged and that leaving AMA would put him at risk for further EtOH withdrawal symptoms.
He was reminded that he could always return to the ED if he developed chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, or any other concerning symptom.
