Pt had no HA, neck stiffness, abd pain.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 1474**] admission note ROS pos for loose stool, rinorrhea/cough and increased L arm weakness.
Pt was roncherous on exam and CXR revealed a RML infiltrate.
Head CT was perfomed and was neg for mass effect or bleed.
Repeat CXR was read as "bibasilar airspace dz, no CHF."
MRI was negative for new infarct.
LP was attempted on [**6-11**] unsuccessfully due to body habitus.
Leukopenia 2.
initially diagnosed in [**9-1**] when he developed a cough, and then in [**12-2**] when he developed dyspnea and weight loss.
A pleural effusion was found and drained.
Pathology showed malignant cells consistent with B-cell clonal lymphoproliferative disorder.
CT showed splenomegaly; bone scan apparently showed diffuse uptake in sternum, pelvis and lumbar vertebral bodies, suggestive of diffuse bone marrow involvement.
The patient had a splenectomy, and the pathology was consistent with marginal zone lymphoma.
CVA [**12-5**] likely watershed infarct from hypotension during sepsis of unclear source.
HTN 6.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 102.4, HR 111, 125/57, RR 27, 99% RA Gen: ill appearing, sedated, not arousable to voice HEENT: sclera non-icteric.
membranes dry NECK: stiff PULM: decreased BS b/l bases with crackles at RLL CV: RRR.
L knee tenderness to palpation w/ effusion.

No acute ischemia is identified.
There is no meningeal enhancement or focal abscesses identified.
Small-bowel obstruction with dilated, edematous proximal small bowel loops.
Distal small bowel and colon are collapsed.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with compressive atelectasis.
The patient was also noted to have swelling of his knees R > L. Due to suspicion for septic joints the patient has bilateral arthrocentesis which inflammatory rather than septic arthritis.
An MRI head was obtained due to concerns of lethargy and slow movement.
The study showed evidence of old emboli but no acute changes.
[**6-19**] ENT consult was called to evaluate the patient for his soft voice and proper closure of his vocal cords.
ENT saw evidence of bowing of the cords w/ phonation as well as evidence of larygopharyngeal reflux.
[**6-21**] the patient spiked a fever to 100.8.
[**6-23**] pt spiked a fever to 100.1 and also had three bouts of emesis after eating lunch.
Abd plain film showed dilated loops of bowel.
CT abd showed SBO vs. partial SBO.
2) L knee pain: Felt to be secondary to trauma of the left knee.
Arthrocentesis consistent with inflammatory joint.
No evidence of septic joint or crystal deposition.
Pain was controlled with tylenol prn.
3) L arm weakness: Likely manifestation of old infarct.
4) Anemia and hyperbilirubinemia: Initially he had an indirect bili concerning for hemolysis, however T bili was down-trending and hapto/LDH were within normal limits suggesting against ongoing hemolysis.
Iron studies were consistent with AOCD + retic count low suggestive of hypoproliferative state (likely secondary to underlying MZL).
6) phospholipid antibiody - His coags were persistently elevated consistent with his history of IgM antiphospholipid antibody.
8) Swallow - He failed two swallow evaluations and a dobhoff tube was placed at bedside and he was started on tubefeeds.
9) Hoarseness - He had a persistently hoarse voice and was evaluated by ENT who felt that he had some reflux, so he was started on protonix.
