[**2187-6-27**] 01:00PM   TSH-3.2 [**2187-6-27**] 01:00PM   FREE T4-1.5  Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 48168**] is a 56 year old with myelofibrosis who presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and relatively new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE With this shortness of breath and a.fib, and concern for his cardiac well-being and hemodynamic stability, he was admitted on the [**2187-6-27**].
In the ED he had ruled out for PE by CTA, although CT did show findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
He got an echocardiogram; in summary it showed global wall motion abnormality and reduced ejection fraction of 30-35%.
He remained short of breath and had an 02 sat of 98% on 4L.
On [**2187-7-1**] after some success in diuresis, he was started on lasix 60 mg PO BID, but this was not uncommonly held for low blood pressures over the next few days.
Their overall recommendation was to attempt to increase metoprolol and continue diuresis while titrating down diltiazem dose, as diltiazem was less likely to have a direct benefit for the heart failure element of his cardiac picture.
We did not anticoagulate Mr [**Known lastname 48168**], after discussing with him the relative risks of splenic injury while anticoagulated versus the ongoing risk of embolic stroke as a result of atrial fibrillation.
Cardiology suggested the possibility of TEE and cardioversion as a later consideration; this was deferred during this admission, again because of concerns about anticoagulation.
We considered viral causes but his history was not easily consistent with this explanation; most such viral sources would again only be able to be conclusively diagnosed by tissue, and it was not clear how we might intervene even in the event of a positive tissue diagnosis.
We considered the possibility that Revlimid might have caused this decline in cardiac function, and removed the drug; we were unable to find support in the literature for other reports of similar phenomena associated with this drug.
His thyroid function tests were normal and we detected no clear signs of ongoing infection.
As his cell counts rose, we increased his hydroxyurea dose to 500 mg daily from an every other day schedule, and his white blood cell count declined accordingly; he was discharged on this regimen, and instructed to follow up further as an outpatient.
LOCULATED EFFUSION X-ray and CT showed a loculated effusion on the right with fluid extending into the major fissure.
We consulted the pulmonary interventionalist on call as well as IR; IP felt that they would be unable to do a bedside procedure; discussed with IR, felt that improvement in clinical symptoms would be unlikely to be considerable.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough .
() as needed for diarrhea.
Disp:*2 tubes* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation can cause your heart to beat too fast.
If you have light-headedness, feel as if you are going to pass out, have an episode of fainting, have difficulty thinking, have shortness of breath or new cough, feel your heart fluttering in your chest, or feel your heart beating very fast, contact your physician's office or come into the emergency department.
