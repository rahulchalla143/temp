Atypical R wave progression suggests suboptimal lead placement.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise identified.
-CT C-spine (prelim): 1. no fx or malalignment 2. prominent posterior osteophytes @ C3-C4 with neural foramina narrowing and moderate spinal canal narrowing, placing pt @ increased risk for cord injury - if clinical concern for such exists, MR would be recommended -CT head (prelim): 1. no ich.
2. old L PCA infarct -CT abd/pelvis (prelim): 1. cirrhotic liver w/ gastroesophageal varices, patent umbilical vein, and perihepatic/splenic ascites 2. no colitis, obstruction, or abscess  EGD --> nonbleeding varices (grade I- III), 3 duodenal ulcers with one visible vessel in the ulcer.
Cauterized the biggest ulcer and injected epinephrine into the visible vessel  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated paracentesis with removal of 1.1 liters of fluid.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage, acute infarct, or mass effect.
Large, chronic left PCA infarct, similar to prior.
There is a small amount of free fluid seen in the right upper quadrant, without significant fluid seen in the remaining quadrants.
Brief Hospital Course: # Altered mental status: Likely chronic advanced microvascular disease as demonstrated on MRI with superimposed hepatic encephalopathy due to acute GI bleed.
Patient was treated with lactulose and rifaximin and his asterixis resolved.
His mental status however, has not returned to his baseline, likely due to microvasculature insults to his brain.
Seroquel, opiates, benzodiazepines and his home trazodone were held/avoided to prevent further confusion.
# Abdominal discomfort:  He was initially treated with ceftriaxone 1g daily for SBP prophylaxis, but due to persistent abdominal discomfort, he received a diagnostic paracentesis on [**2162-2-25**].
Peritoneal fluid cultures were negative, but he was empirically treated with ceftriaxone 2g daily for 8 days due to high suspicion for SBP and potentially negative cultures while on prophylactic antibiotic dosing.
RUQ ultrasound [**2162-3-3**] revealed a small amount of ascites and with mildly increased LE edema, his diuretics were increased to furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone 100mg daily.
# Upper GIB: Patient presented with melena and had known varices.
Hct was initially stable but in setting of NGT placement he was noted to have bright red bloody emesis.
Intubated successfully and EGD revealed nonbleeding varices (grade I- III), 3 duodenal ulcers with one visible vessel in the ulcer.
Required another 2 units PRBCs for emesis following EGD.
# Hep C cirrhosis: LFTs initially mildly elevated, but trended down.
Elevated INR suggests impaired synthetic function.
He will need ferritin checked as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and potential genetic testing for hemochromatosis if suspected.
# Diabetes mellitus: Good glucose control on ISS.
9. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB/wheezing.
10. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO QID (4 times a day): Please titrate to [**4-9**] bowel movements daily to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
17. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day): Please continue until erythema in mouth resolves.
18. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical DAILY (Daily) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Duodenal ulcer bleed with acute blood loss anemia H. pylori Hepatic encephalopathy Advanced intracerebral microvascular disease Cirrhosis - secondary to chronic Hepatitis C virus and previous alcohol use Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Hypertension Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
At high risk for falls.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 805**],  You came to the hospital because of bleeding from an ulcer in your small intestine.
The bleeding was stopped during an urgent endoscopy.
You were noted to have esophageal varices during your endoscopy, which will need to be monitored periodically by your liver doctor.
You will need a repeat endoscopy in 2 weeks to ensure the ulcer has healed and monitoring of your esophageal varices.
You had an MRI of your brain which showed that you have "advanced microvascular disease" which likely explains your residual confusion.
Please continue taking rifaximin and lactulose to prevent worsening confusion due to your liver disease.
We made the following changes to your medications: INCREASE Furosemide to twice a day and START Spironolactone to decrease fluid retention and ascities.
START Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin to treat H. pylori infection.
START Lactulose and Rifaximin to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
START folate, thiamine, and multivitamin START humalog insulin sliding scale (see attached scale) START nystatin swish and swallow until thrush in mouth disappears.
START sarna lotion to help with itching skin.
