FINDINGS: The right occipital lobe mass is similar in size to the [**2119-11-28**] MRI, measuring today 24 x 27 x 26 mm (AP x ML x SI).
The mass has a thick rind of enhancement and a T1 hypointense center.
The adjacent edema has decreased slightly, with slight interval expansion of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and atrium of the left lateral ventricle and better definition of adjacent sulci.
No new lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: Left occipital lobe mass, necrotic-appearing.
This can represent a metastasis from the patient's lung cancer or a primary neoplasm.
There has been slight interval decrease in the adjacent vasogenic edema and slight interval decrease in mass effect.
Post-surgical changes in the left occipital surgical resection cavity, with small areas of linear nodular enhancement within, which may relate to post-surgical changes/residual tumor or a combination of both.
Areas of decreased diffusion in the periphery of the left occipital lobe posteriorly and medially, may relate to acute infarction.
Persistent surrounding vasogenic edema and partial effacement of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle and the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
