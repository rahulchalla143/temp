History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 60 year old female with a history of neurofibromatosis, COPD on 2L home O2, systolic HF 40-45%, PE, adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroids, who was transferred to the MICU from the ED for management of dyspnea and evaluation of high lactate.
This am she reports chest heaviness/pressure, no radiation.
Also with SOB and difficulty expiring air.
The morphine was administered for chest pain that occurred at some point in the ED, first set of troponins were negative and EKG was unremarkable.
Due to difficult stick and elevated lactate, a RIJ CVL was placed.
She had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2172-4-15**] to [**2172-4-17**] for evaluation of chest pain and presyncope, which were thought to be non-cardiac in origin -- COPD vs musculoskeletal.

Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: 98.3 p99-103 116/75 11 97% 2L NC Short obese woman in no distress, conversant and speaking full sentences without difficulty.
Has obvious fleshy colored papules covering her entire body, consistent with known NF.
Can't guage JVD Poor air movement but no obvious crackles, wheezes or rhonchi Almost inaudible S1/S2, likely due to habitus, no m/g Abd obese, NT ND, benign No BLE edema noted, extrems are warm well perfused CN 2-12, no focal neuro deficits noted.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: 97.6 93 105/75 20 96% 2L NX GENERAL: Obese woman, sitting in bed, conversant and speaking in full sentences NECK: No JVD appreciated, neck is supple and without LAD RESP: Good air movement, faint inspiratory bibasilar crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi CARDIO: Nml S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated ABDOMEN: Obese, non-tender, non-distended.
EXTREMITIES: Mild, non-pitting upper and lower extremity edema Skin: Flesh-colored, 0.5-1 cm nodules over entire body (consistent with known NF-1), ecchymoses over sites of trauma and injections on all 4 limbs.
No acute pulmonary process identified within limitations.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Bibasilar areas of opacification could reflect merely atelectasis and small effusions.
In the appropriate clinical setting, however, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left lower extremity.
Slightly dampened respiratory variation within the left venous system, however, this is likely due to compression from the patient's pannus which was asymmetrically positioned overlying the left groin.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year-old female with a history of COPD on 2L home O2 (with multiple recent admissions for COPD exacerbation), neurofibromatosis, systolic HF with EF 40-45%, PE, history of adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroids, initially transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and elevated serum lactate, transferred to floor without intubation and O2 sat 96-98% prior to discharge with normalized lactate.
Her last outpatient PFTs on [**2172-4-27**] with FEV1/FVC of 66% and FEV1 of 41% predicted with DLCO 27%, indicating moderate to severe disease.
On HD #7, per the request of her outpatient pulmonologists, she underwent supine and upright spirometry to evaluate for diagphragmatic weakness given previous reduced MIPs/MEPs, but the session was terminated prematurely due to chest pain, later felt to be musculoskeletal.
#) UTI: Patient treated for UTI with symptoms of polyuria and dysuria, started on 7-day course of Levofloxacin for complicated UTI given history of immune suppression.
#) Elevated Lactate: Serum lactate with high of 4 on [**2172-4-30**] which normalized with IVF.
Initial elevation was likely secondary to dehydration.
#) Low [**Date Range **] pressures: Patient with SBP in low 100s and remained in 105-120 range with holding home lisinopril and metoprolol.
On discharge, SBP 105; not orthostatic by vitals nor symptomatic and Hct stable.
Has h/o adrenal insufficiency but already on higher dose prednisone.
#) Recurrent chest pain: The patient endorsed chronic chest "tightness."
Myocardial infarction was ruled out with no EKG changes and negative cardiac enzymes x3.
Repeat EKGs at time of pain showed no change from baseline.
Given reproducible tenderness to palpation, this was felt to be musculoskeletal v. tightness from COPD exacerbation.
#) History adrenal insufficiency [**12-18**] chronic steroid use for COPD exacerbation: Patient was begun on steroid taper with 40 mg x3 and 20 mg x1, then dose increased to 40 mg qday given worsening of symptoms with plan for prednisone taper.
#) Coronary artery disease s/p revascularization, with STEMI [**3-19**], BMS x 2 in [**2165**], [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2, in [**2165**] and [**2170**] (RCA): Patient was continued on home anticoagulants, [**Year (4 digits) **] 325 mg qday, Rosuvastatin 5 mg qday, and Clopidogrel, 75 mg qday.
#) Congestive heart failure with LVEF 40-45%.
Home Metoprolol and Lisinopril were held in the setting of relative hypotension (SBP 105-120).
She was started on PO vancomycin for prophylaxis secondary to receiving Levofloxacin as risk factor for recurrent infection.
#) Ambulation: Patient is ambulatory at home, was evaluated by PT during admission, and was found to be weak and at times have right knee pain that limited ambulation.
She states that she fell from bed approximately 1 month ago and has had knee pain that has not limited ambulation since she fell.
Physical exam was notable for positive right knee medial joint line tenderness without swelling, erythema, or effusion.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule PO TID prn diarrhea 9.)

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: COPD exacerbation  Secondary diagnoses: Urinary tract infection Systolic heart failure exacerbation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for shortness of breath.
You were also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, and treated with antibiotics for this.
You had several episodes of chest tightness with shortness of breath, which we evaluated with imaging of your chest (chest x-ray), and heart (EKG and telemetry), which were negative for heart attack.
We STARTED Nitrofurantoin (ends [**2172-5-10**]) for urinary tract infection 5.)
