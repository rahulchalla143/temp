Brief Hospital Course: This is a 68 year-old man with high grade follicular lymphoma dx 9 months ago s/p multiple chemotherapeutic regimens currently day #8 of cycle 1 R-CHOP, known epidural mets-thoracic chord compression, pancytopenic, on levoquin, fluconazole, acyclovir prophylaxis admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] septic, likely secondary to multi-focal pneumonia.
# MRSA Sepsis: Likely source of bacteremia leading to sepsis was pneumonia vs. PICC line infection.
Patient recovered from sepsis and was transferred to BMT floor where broad spectrum antibiotics were continued.
# PNA - Felt to have PNA by CXR.
# HEME/ONC: Patient recieved r-chop as above, but had extremely poor prognosis.
He was given decadron for chord involvement (no new acute sxs during this admission) as well as frequent transfusions for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
