Admission Date:  [**2137-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-5-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-10-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine / Diazepam / Benzodiazepines / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis, Right heart catheterization   History of Present Illness: This is a 75 yof with hx of CAD s/p cardiac cath with RCA stent in [**2-/2136**], HTN, Hyperlipidemia, GERD, Afib, diastolic dysfunction, pericardial effusion, pulmonary HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 **] after 7 days of increasing SOB, 3lb weight gain.
Upon review of [**Hospital1 **] records it appears pt was treated for CHF exacerbation, an Echo was performed which showed significant pulmonary HTN in the 90s, preserved EF and moderate sized effusion in the posterior aspect, small anterior pericardial effusion.
Following her Echo findings of an effusion as well as pulmonary HTN pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for right cardiac catheterization and evaluation for possible pericardial effusion.
She does endorse some shortness of breath which is worse than when she was at home but the same as it was in [**Hospital1 2519**].
She endorses diarrhea which she has had for months, usually watery.
She denies any n/v/f/c, abdominal pain, focal numbness and tingling.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Atrial fibrillation S/P TIA Depression Bilateral cataract surgery Angina Pneumonia/ Bronchitis GERD Anemia Arthritis Irritable bowel syndrome Chronically elevated WBC for past 8 years s/p TAH/BSO - also reports history of R "ovary explosion" as a young adult Hx cholecystectomy and appendectomy  Cardiac Risk Factors: Hyperlipidemia, Hypertension  Percutaneous coronary intervention - reports previous cath, unsure of date and location   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
LUNGS: Crackles noted b/l mid thorax down.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ mixed edema to the knees b/l.
Pertinent Results: IMAGING of RELEVANCE:  [**2137-4-29**] ECHO The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
The right ventricular cavity size appears enlarged with global hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a moderate sized, echo dense inferior and inferolateraly pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
In retrospect, a smaller echo dense pericardial effusion may have been present on the prior study, but if so, the effusion is larger and much more apparent on the current study.

Do not suspect current ichemia given lack of ST changes during hospitalization.
Pt was continued on home regimen of Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, ASA  # PUMP: During admission pt was noted to be hypervolemic on examination with diffuse crackles on pulmonary auscultation, mixed 2+ edema in b/l lower extremities.
# RHYTHM: During hospitalization pt was noted to be in A. fibrillation initially with rapid ventricular response of 120-130.
On day of transfer pt was noted to have SOB with a rate in the 140s after which she received IV Metoprolol 5mg Tartrate with response of heart rate within 100-120.
# Pericardial Effusion: Pt was noted to have 2 pericardial effusions, moderate size in the posterior aspect, small effusion in the anterior portion.
Gram stain also nowed no microorganisms and 2+ Polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Cytology was also negative, an autoimmune panel of [**Doctor First Name **], double stranded DNA were still pending at time of discharge but unlikely to be positive given her lack of symptoms in the past.
Following pericardiocentesis pt was noted to have an echodensity collection thought to be clot formation.
Re-examination with repeat Echos showed no changes thus indicating no unstable bleed into the pericardium.
- Recommend pt undergo repeat Echo in 1 week to again reassess pericardium, specifically possibility of constrictive pericarditis.
# Psych: During hospitalization pt was noted to be intermittently confused primarily with delusions of being tied up or mistreated.
Psychiatry were consulted and determined pt may have been having delirium super imposed on mild dementia.
Alprazolam was discontinued due it's increased risk of Delirium.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pt has a history of Pulmonary HTN per transfer summary, it appears she was started on oxygen last [**Month (only) 359**] for it but has never been worked up.
From her right heart cath results it is likely that there is a cardiac component superimposed on a pulmonary one given the elevated Wedge with an even greater PA diastolic pressure.
Her diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload state are likely the acute causes of her pulmonary HTN.
I do believe though that she does have a chronic underlying pulmonary HTN that is due to a pulmonary process.
Pt has OSA and is intermittently non-adherent to it which is likely a component, pt also has a smoking history and may have a COPD component too (no PFTs available).
Pt also has a history notable for numerous pneumonias as a child and adult, it is possible that with recurrent infection that may be some pulmonary fibrosis which may be working in addition to the aforementioned OSA and COPD.
Arthritis, Lupus may also cause pulmonary HTN particularly given her pericardial effusion, pleural effusion.
She does not though have any prior history of autoimmune symptoms and it would be atypical for her first presentation to be at this age.
- Recommend pt set up Pulmonary appointment for Pulmonary HTN work up - pt discharged onb home regimen of 2l NS to be worn at all times - encouraged pt to continue her CPAP at home  # Leukocytosis: Pt has history of leukocytosis from her myelodysplastic syndrome.
Likely due to her MDS as she did not show any signs of infection during admission.
# Myeloproliferative d/o: Pt has JAK-2 mutation with a history of leukocytosis.
Following a decrease in her Hct she was then transitioned briefly to Procrit.
No [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] or anemia noted during hospitalization.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pericardial Effusion, Pulmonary Hypertension, Delirium, CHF exacerbation, A. Fib, delirium Secondary: Mild dementia, Hypertensionm Hyperlipidemia, Myelodysplastic syndrome   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile on 2l oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital for evaluation of your difficulty breathing, heart failure as well as a fluid collection around your heart.
Whilst in the hospital you underwent a pericardiocentesis to drain the fluid around your heart, we also started you on a medication to get rid of the excess fluid from your heart failure.
If you experience any further chest pain, difficulty breathing please return to the ED.
