The patient initially presented to OSH on [**2139-8-3**] with weight loss (19 lbs in last month, 40 lbs over past year), cough and emesis with injestion of liquids and solids, and progressive weakness.
The patient was also evaluated by thoracic surgery, and after discussion with the patient's HCP, surgical intervention with thoracotomy, bilobectomy, [**Last Name (un) 72148**] window, esophagectomy with cervical espophagogastrostomy and J tube was declined.
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemaia Diabetes, type 2 Previous PNA Asthma Bronchitis TB as a child.
On [**Last Name (LF) 31500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] friend, for a mental disorder.
Decreased breathsounds with rales at right base.

- Foreign material and amorphous debris, consistent with food particles.
The immunophenotype is suggestive of a lung primary.
Imaging:  CT of the thorax ([**8-8**]): FINDINGS: A large poorly marginated soft tissue mass is seen in the subcarinal region and right lower lobe of the lung.
Optiray has been instilled and outlines portions of the proximal esophagus.
In the mid to distal esophagus, there is a linear track of Optiray extending outside the normal esophageal contour (2:27).
The mass narrows the right middle lobe bronchi, which remain patent.
A small pleural effusion has increased in size.
Patchy parenchymal opacification throughout the remainder of the right lung likely represents aspiration or infection.
There also are patchy airspace opacities within the lingula.
IMPRESSION: Subcarinal and right lower lobe cavitary mass encompassing the esophagus.
Direct communication of the cavitary portion with the esophagus and right lower lobe bronchus.
Findings are concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma or alternatively esophageal cancer.
Her pressure requirements were weaned, however, the patient remained ventilator dependent.
The extensive nature of the bronchoesophageal fistula seemed to be malignant.
They biopsied some areas and the pathology revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung origin.
