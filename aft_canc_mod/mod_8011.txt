Admission Date:  [**2105-2-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-3-7**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service: CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding from ileostomy.
He also had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia which was diagnosed in the setting of Remicade use, ankylosing spondylitis which was led to a mild restrictive lung disease.
He has had additional congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
He has been seen in the past at [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1029**] at an outside hospital approximately one month ago for increasing lower extremity edema.
He was seen there by their Pulmonary Service, and thought to have restrictive lung disease greater than congestive obstructive pulmonary disease with a gas in the setting in some sort of congestive obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation of 7.2/70/70.
He was doing well at rehabilitation, although he was put on prednisone 60 mg q day for further obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation at an unknown date in the rehabilitation.
He was found at the rehab to have a dropping hematocrit.
He then was found to have a hematocrit drop from 30 to 20 with small blood in the ileostomy bag.
He received 6 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 2 units of platelets, and fluid resuscitated briefly on Levophed.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 liters home O2.
History of restrictive lung disease secondary to ankylosing spondylitis.
Fistulizing Crohn's disease status post partial colectomy and ileectomy with ileostomy.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia plus splenomegaly with sequestration.
Bilateral lower extremity edema.
Pulmonary hypertension secondary to his chronic lung disease which has led to some degree of right heart failure.
Thrombocytopenia which is secondary to splenic sequestration in the setting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Extremities:  [**12-18**]+ lower extremity edema, no rashes and no icterus.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, no ST-T wave changes.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed bibasilar atelectasis and a small pleural effusion, no pneumothorax.
His stool was guaiac positive, but there was no frank blood.
In the setting of changing his ileostomy bag, an arterial bleed was opened up from the skin connection from his ileostomy at the surgical site.
Since that time, he has had no further bleed.
No frank blood.
It is felt that GI bleed was secondary to this arterial lesion, which was probably a surgical site ulcer.
It was switched to azithromycin and the patient recovered well late in the hospitalization with blood pressures stabilizing off pressors and becoming afebrile with a white blood cell count decreasing from a peak in the 30's to 6.7.
On the second day of hospitalization, he was briefly extubated, but became tachypneic and had a hypercarbic respiratory dysfunction despite non-invasive ventilation, requiring reintubation.
He remained intubated until [**2105-3-6**] when after a very slow weaning process, it was felt that his clinical condition had improved to the point that he would tolerate extubation well.
He also on CT scan, was found to have a large bilateral pleural effusions.
An ultrasound was performed and there was only a small left pleural effusion which was not tapped, however, the right pleural effusion was tapped which removed 600 cc of serosanguinous transudative effusion.
It is assumed that this patient's normal pCO2 is in the 50's as he has chronic lung disease.
Heme:  The patient has known chronic lymphocytic leukemia with thrombocytopenia.
He did require multiple transfusions to maintain his hematocrit above 28 in the setting of congestive obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease.
He is a difficult crossmatch, however, transfusions proceeded without complication.
He was also given 40,000 units of epo for a low retic count.
Best we can learn from records was that he was started for feeling of a high risk for deep venous thrombosis due to his underlying diseases.
Renal:  The patient developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.3, and urine sediment with multiple white blood cells.
It was felt that this renal failure was secondary to a combination of prerenal failure with an amount of ATN as well as AIN from the ceftriaxone.
The patient was transiently put on calcium carbonate for phosphorus control as was phosphorus was elevated during his renal failure.
There was no signs of ischemic changes.
