Admission Date:  [**2175-7-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-7-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-8-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Codeine / Compazine / Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, Confusion   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VP Shunt Placement Central Line Placement  History of Present Illness: 75 yo M that presented with weakness, confusion, and difficultly urinating today to [**Hospital6 1109**].
Foley at that time with 300cc urine in bladder, but exam showed normal normal rectal tone and no saddle anesthesia.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for MRI to r/o cord compression and for further evaluation of weakness.
He now denies pain and can not recall the events leading to hosptialization.
He states that he has had some back pain recently.
No fever, chills, SOB, or chest pain.
Past Medical History: PAST ONC HX: He was dx'd with melanoma in [**7-13**] and underwent parotidectomy, functional neck dissection, post neck dissection and sentinel node bx, which were positive in [**8-13**].
He felt well after this until he developed L groin pain in [**10-14**].
Rpt imaging was significant for extensive metastatic lesions in the bone and liver.
PMH: Metastatic Melanoma, as above HTN Hypercholesterolemia  Social History: He is married.
Family History: Significant for DM and CAD, but not cancer.
Physical Exam: PE: VS T99.1 BP130/80 HR65 RR18 97/RA GEN: comfortable in no acute distress.
NECK: Supple, no JVD or thyromegaly.
LYMPH NODES: no LAD in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal nodes HEART: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.
CHEST: CTA ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS, no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly.
MRI BRAIN/SPINE w and w/o contrast IMPRESSION: Findings indicative of leptomeningeal metastasis enhancement along several of the sulci in both cerebral hemispheres.
Increased size of ventricles compared to the previous MRI with increasing temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] size and periventricular edema indicative of communicating hydrocephalus.
No evidence of acute infarct.
MRI Spine [**2175-7-14**]: -Multiple Thoracic and lumbar vertebral mets, no cord compression.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2175-7-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a small area of pneumocephalus present within the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
There is a small amount of acute hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles which is new compared to the previous examination.
There is lower attenuation material within the most posterior aspect of the occipital horns bilaterally indicative of remote hemorrage.
Of more concern and note, there are new areas of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage within the parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally.
A small amount of hemorrhage is also noted within the fourth ventricle.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
The soft tissues, osseous structures, visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are overall unremarkable.
Status post new ventricular catheter from a right-fronto-parietal approach compared to CT from 2 days prior.
New intraventricular blood status and extensive bilateral parieto- temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Multiple evolving foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are again noted with persistent hemorrhage in the left posterior temporal lobe and right fronto-temporal lobe sulci.
No new hemorrhages identified.
Evolving hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles is again noted bilaterally.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Evolving areas of intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage with no change in the size of the ventricles compared to two days prior.
CEREBROSPINAL FLUID CYTOLOGIC EXAM [**2175-7-15**] - Large atypical cells with round nuclei, variably present nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm.
In a patient with known melanoma, findings are suspicious for metastatic involvement.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 59837**] is a 75 year old male with widely metastatic melanoma who presented with confusion/delirium.
Found to have leptomeningeal metastasis of presumably melanoma and communicating hydrocephalus.
Postoperative course was complicated by subarachnoid hemmorrhage.
He was monitored in the Surgical ICU with evidence for improved mental status and no further extension of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MRI of spine revealed multiple spinal metastasis without evidence for cord compression, pathologic fractures of T12, L3.
Head MR revealed new communicating hydrocephalus, diffuse leptomenigeal disease.
The patient was stable post operatively, with baseline mental status and motor exam.
The following morning the patient developed an expressive aphasia.
Head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular collection.
Pt was monitored in the ICU, and started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
His mental status steadily improved with interval CT scan without evidence for further hemorrhage.
3) Metastatic melanoma - Pt will undergo whole brain radiation for palliation of leptomeningeal disease as an outpatient.
4) low voltage on ECG- An echo was obtained to rule out malignant effusion, it revealed LVEF 70%, 1+AR, trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] effusion.
4) Hypertension -continued avapro -added metoprolol  On [**7-21**] patient had further deterioration of mental status, from less responsive to unresponsive, also tachycardic, hypertensive and tachypneic.
