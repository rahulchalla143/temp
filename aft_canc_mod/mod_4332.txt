He could not tolerate his shortness of breath anymore and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
CXR showed no acute process, but with severe emphysema.
Patient was given 500mg azithromycin and 60mg prednisone and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia and significant O2 requirement.
Patient is without complaints.
Notes some abdominal pain and constipation with bowel movements.
Notes left hand pain that is improving with time, and managed with tylenol.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies current chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Severe emphysema.
Mild LVH.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets without stenosis.
Mild aortic and mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No evidence of intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting on bubble study.
However, the patient's underlying atrial fibrillation during this study may underestimate true pulmonary pressures.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities likely represent an atypical infection.

Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, OSA, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, anemia, h/o TIA and COPD on 3-4L home O2 who is admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and presumed COPD exacerbation with four days of worsening dyspnea on exertion and non-productive cough.
# Shortness of breath: Most likely an exacerbation of patient's known severe COPD (on home O2 3.5-4L NC).
Differential diagnosis of common causes of shortness of breath includes pulmonary and cardiac etiologies: COPD exacerbation, MI/CHF, PNA, asthma, PE, anemia.
Patient has had URI like symptoms with a dry cough.
No evidence of CHF on exam despite 10lb weight gain (no significant rales or pedal edema) or CXR (does not appear fluid overloaded), echo several months ago with EF>55%, troponin neg x2, ECG similar to previous.
No evidence of acute infectious process on CXR and WBC WNL (however Neut 90%).
No history of asthma.
Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60mg, tapering down to 20 per Pulmonology recs and azithromycin 500mg initially and then 250mg for a total of 5 days.
Albuterol and ipratropium nebs given PRN for symptoms.
He was at or below his baseline oxygen requirement during his stay.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was established and we decided that sending the patient out on no prednisone was appropriate given that he is at his baseline oxygen requirement and has no symptoms.
# Anemia: Hct on admission was 30.6 (baseline 35-37), with no active signs of bleeding.
Per recent PCP note, patient was noted to have small amount of blood in stool and GI endoscopy is being planned as an outpatient.
No evidence of bleeding.
Stool was guaiac negative, but given anemia and difficulty in obtaining GI studies in the past (due to lung status), GI was consulted.
EGD showed gastritis, hiatal hernia and a small angioectasia in the duodenum which was an unlikely source of the anemia.
Colonoscopy showed polyps (removed) diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
The patient should follow up with GI regarding a possible evalaution of the patients small bowel.
Clinically, patient is with mild pain to palpation over the 2nd metacarpal bone.
Denied any trauma and states the pain has been improving with time and Tylenol.
No erythema or warmth on exam, ROM intact.
Symptoms monitored and pain was managed with Tylenol.
# Low Vitamin D: Patient's vitamin D level is 17 (<30) on recent labs.
# Mild depression: Denied symptoms of depression currently, has been maintained on venlafaxine chronically.
