Patient is admitted for surgeries decompression of spinal metastatic tumor, posterior thoracic spine stabilization using spinal instrumentation, titanium hooks, rods, and cables.
Breast cancer diagnosed in [**2114**] with metastasis to the lung, liver, and spine.
Pleural effusions and last effusion was [**Month (only) **] of '[**16**].
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Crackles in her left base, decreased breath sounds in her right base, carotid bruits.
Patient was admitted to the hospital on the [**11-11**], where she had decompression of spinal metastatic tumor, posterior thoracic spine stabilization using spinal instrumentation.
Postoperatively, she was alert, awake, oriented, fluent speech, following commands, had some orbital and peripheral edema noted.
She had become tachycardic and hypotensive with decreased urine output while in the PACU.
Was given fluid boluses, also had pleural effusions, and received pulmonary consultation on admission to the SICU.
Patient is intubated at approximately 3:30 a.m. on [**2116-10-13**] due to worsening respiratory distress.
She was ruled out for MI and a figure-of-eight brace was ordered for her.
No true drainage.
A right sided chest tube was placed due to larger effusion on that side.
Postprocedure chest x-ray showed that chest tube looked good, but they also felt that the left sided effusion would also limit her ability to extubate and that it was also a significant effusion, so a left sided chest tube was placed also.
Pulmonary consult was also done on [**2116-10-13**], who continued to assess the bilateral pleural effusions thought were related to her metastatic breast cancer.
The next days continued to have excessive output out of her chest tube.
On the [**10-19**], the patient continued to have decreased urine output and decreased blood pressure problems despite IV fluids and 5% albumin.
The Neuro ICU team discussed with patient's family that it did not appear that her pleural effusions were getting any better.
