ED course: He was initially afebrile on presentation, and then spiked to 102.6.
He had a distended though benign abdominal exam.
During his ED course, he developed more abdominal distension and a CT abd / pelvis was done which showed a partial SBO and likely bibasilar infiltrates.
Past Medical History: Multiple Sclerosis Neurogenic bladder Myelodysplastic syndrome DM - PVD - non-healing bilateral ulcers  Social History: Married with three children.

0.5mm STD in lateral leads.
Patchy bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with probable small adjacent pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion.
Dilated jejunum measuring 3-4 cm with air-fluid levels and non-abrupt tapering transition point within the left lower quadrant.
These findings are most suggestive of an early mild partial small-bowel obstruction, although  atypical appearing ileus is also within the differential.
Consider serial radiographs to assess for change and contrast progression.
Large fusiform infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a large amount of intramural thrombus as described above.
Moderate atherosclerotic disease involving the intrathoracic aorta and its branches.
Left renal cyst.
CXR: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
Appropriately-positioned left subclavian catheter without evidence of pneumothorax on the supine film.
Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia is better appreciated on concomitantly performed abdominal CT examination.
PICC LINE PLACEMENT  INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
There were no immediate complications.

UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED After sepsis was stabilized in the MICU, the patient was transferred to the floor, where he was found to have an increasing heart rate.
Suction on the NG tube revealed bloody return, and the patient was found to have a falling hematocrit.
EGD [**12-2**] showed marked friability of the stomach mucosa with contact bleeding, multiple non-bleeding ulcers were found in the stomach and a single bleeding ulcer was found in the cardia near the GE junction s/p electrocautery for hemostasis.
Combination of recovery from pneumonia and volume overload from fluids given in ICU during GIB.
Continue with gentle diuresis and monitor electrolytes.
NUTRITION Due to concern of aspiration patient was evaluated by speech and swallow on [**12-6**], his diet was advanced to thin liquids and ground consistency solids.
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM Noted on CT scan was a 4.7 infrarenal AAA in the setting of profound atherosclerotic disease.
DIABETES Placed on regular insulin sliding scale.
