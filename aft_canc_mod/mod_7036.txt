Admission Date:  [**2197-1-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-1-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-2-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Procainamide / niacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-1-6**] 1.
History of Present Illness: Delightful 79 year old gentleman with a history of mitral valve regurgitation diagnosed in [**2192**] and followed by serial echocardiograms.
Over the past year, he has been admitted to the hospital 6 times for congestive heart failure and has also required a continuous infusion of lasix.
Because of his chronic myelogenous leukemia, advanced chronic kidney disease and low EF, he has been considered a poor surgical candidate for corrective intervention on the mitral valve.
However, because of repetitive hospitalizations over the past year, it is felt to be time to consider a high-risk corrective surgery.

A secundum type atrial septal defect of approximately 8mm is present.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the basal inferior wall, severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral wall and inferoseptal walls and mild hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral and anteroseptal walls.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
An epiaortic scan showed and anterior rim of calcification and the canulation and cross clamp site were adjusted accordingly.
There is trace valvular MR.
There is a ring prosthesis in the tricuspid position.
There is trace valvular TR.
An agitated saline bubble study revealed no intraatrial shunt at rest of with Valsalva and release.

Workup demonstrated severe mitral regurgitation, as well as moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and single-vessel coronary disease.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Per renal recommendations, he is to stay on Lasix 40 IV BID until edema decreases and then go to Lasix 40 IV daily with renal follow up in 6 weeks.
He was anticoagulated for post operative atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA due to LV thrombus.
By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing well (well healing tape burns surrounding sternal incision) and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
