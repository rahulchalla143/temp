Admission Date:  [**2197-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-1-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-2-22**] Resection of left atrial mass with repair of inter atrial septum with dacron patch  History of Present Illness: This is a 63 y.o woman with past medical history significant only for hypertension who presents with a 4 month history of periodic chest pain.
The patient reports that she has been having a "tightening" chest pain that comes and goes over the past several months.
This pain radiated up her neck and down her right arm, and significantly worsened yesterday night, waking her up from sleep.
Her symptoms were concerning enough that they came to the emergency room today, where a CTA of the chest was performed to rule out dissection.
The CTA found that the patient had an extremely large left atrial myxoma that occupied nearly the entire left atrium, measuring 3.7 x 3.3 cm on CT. A bedside TTE performed by the cardiology fellow showed the same mass but normal ejection fraction.
Past Medical History: hypertension h/o sinusitis hysterectomy for "fibroids"  Social History: Originally from [**Country 2045**], moved here in [**2177**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Mild RUQ tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Strength 5/5 in biceps, triceps, deltoids, hip flexors, plantar and dorsiflexors of ankles bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: [**2197-2-22**] Echo: Pre-Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
The mass was approximately 3.5 x 3 cm.
The mass was attached to the interatrial septum by a short stalk.
During diastole the mass did have movement toward the mitral valve without evidence of significant obstruction to left ventricular inflow.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No significant aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.Trace to mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-Bypass: The patient is being A-paced without inotropic support.
The left atrial mass is now absent.
There is no evidence of left to right shunt across the interatrial septum.
Mitral regurgitation is improved post-bypass, now with trace mitral regurgitation.
Normal coronary arteries with evidence of microvascular dysfunction.
Diastolic hypertension.
Left atrial lesion measuring up to 3.8 cm with apparent thin attachment to the interatrial septum, most likely an atrial myxoma.
Correlation with echocardiography and cardiac MR is recommended.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty.
Pathology revealed the mass was an atrial myxoma with large fibrin thrombus.
