Admission Date: [**2152-8-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2152-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-4-30**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old man who 12 years ago had a lung metastasis from lung CA, resected in the left temporal area.
Following the resection, he had a left frontal metastasis resected.
Postoperatively, he had had some language difficulty and hemiparesis that resolved on its own.
After the second resection, he had stereotactic radiosurgery.
Last visit in this past [**Month (only) 216**], his wife noted that he was not keeping up with the rest of the family with walking and he was complaining of some heaviness and difficulty with his right side, and he would try to use his right hand to hold on to the door but was not able to do that and the dexterity in his right hand also seemed to have worsened over the past month previous to that.
He had a follow-up MRI scan in [**Month (only) 216**], which shows a cystic lesion in the previous left frontal resection cavity with an irregularly enhancing lesion in the anterosuperior aspect of the cystic cavity, and there was some hyperintensity around this lesion, either from previous treatments or from the lesion itself.
He also has a spastic right hemiparesis with decreased rapid alternating movements and dexterity in the right hand.
He walks with a spastic gait.
Sensory exam revealed some abnormal sensation on the right side, which he cannot fully describe to me compared to the left.
The procedure was without complication.
