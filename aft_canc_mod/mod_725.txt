In summary: "the patient was noted to have macronodular cirrhosis, but no evidence of portal hypertension or ascites.
Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated a mass involving the left hepatic duct, but was confined to the left lobe and did not extend into the right lobe.
The tumor did extend down to the bifurcation and the common hepatic duct appeared abnormal by ultrasound.
There were no pathologic lymph nodes noted.
Frozen section of the distal common bile duct was negative for malignancy and frozen section of the right hepatic duct margin was also negative for malignancy."
On pod 6, a cholangiogram demonstrated patent ducts with slight narrowing of the anterior and posterior ducts at the anastomotic site likely representing postop edema.
