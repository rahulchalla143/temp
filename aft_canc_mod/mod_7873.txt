The patient was reportedly in her normal state of health until approximately 10 days ago, when she began to experience nasal congestion which is like her usual ANCA vasculitis flare.
She improved over next few days but started worsening five days ago with cough, pleuritic chest pain and worsening shortness of breath.
Last night at dinner, she had acute worsening of her shortness of breath which prompted her to call EMS.
Of note, she describes this episode of acute SOB/cough/congestion as similar to past "flares" of her vasculitis.
Her symptoms were not responsive this time to this regimen.
She does not take Bactrim for regular PCP pneumonia prophylaxis.
No sick contacts or travel out of the country.

STUDIES: CXR ([**12-2**]): Fullness of the hila and prominence of the interstitial markings, suggest mild pulmonary edema.
CXR ([**12-4**]): Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Increased density in the left lower lobe suspicious for underlying pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old female with ANCA vasculitis on chronic prednisone, essential thrombocythemia and hypertension who presents with a 10 day history of congestion, 5-day history of cough, pleuritic chest pain and worsening dyspnea admitted on [**2157-12-3**] and discharged on [**2157-12-4**].
# Worsening dyspnea, multifactorial.
Likely flare of vasculitis in the setting of possible community acquired pneumonia.
This is also complicated by pulmonary edema seen on CXR, elevated BNP, and plateaued troponin values.
Her initial symptoms were similar (rhinorrhea, post-nasal drip, ear pain) to prior vasculitis flare.
Because of her requirement of NRB, she was transferred to the MICU for respiratory status management.
She was ruled out of MI given unchanged EKG and initial negative troponin.
Repeat troponins were mildly elevated, but likely in the setting of her CKD and possible demand that she had initially.
PE was considered given her underlying ET and sudden onset, but her symptoms improved with treatments of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and vasculitis.
Patient's symptoms improved with antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin in the ED and then levofloxacin for the rest of her stay), prednisone, as well as diuresis with IV lasix.
Her O2 requirement improved to 1-2L NC at the time of discharge.
There was no clear source of bleeding and BUN was not elevated above baseline to suggest any underlying GI bleeding.
It could also be a part of her underlying myelodysplatic syndrome and therapy.
She was continued on home Levothyroxine 50 mcg po qdaily  # Chronic kidney disease.
11. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release Sig: [**11-20**] Tablet Sustained Releases PO once a day as needed for pain or fever.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Pneumonia - P-ANCA vasculitis flare  Secondary Diagnosis: - Essential Thrombocytosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital by ambulance for worsening shortness of breath after a 10 day history of congestion and a 5 day history of cough and pleuritic chest pain not responsive to increased steroids and z-pack use.
On chest X-ray, you were found to have fluid in your lungs and pneumonia.
You were treated with oxygen for your shortness of breath, a diuretic to clear the fluid in your lungs and an antibiotic for your pneumonia.
Over the course of your stay, you also developed a post-nasal drip and ear pain, thought to likely be due to a flare of your vasculitis.
