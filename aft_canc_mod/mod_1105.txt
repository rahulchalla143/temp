Admission Date:  [**2162-7-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-7-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-6-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 71-year-old man with history of metastatic carcinoid tumor of bronchial origin (metastatic to bone and liver) status post multiple chemotherapy treatments, resection of tumor from left upper lobe of lung in [**2146**], chemoembolization of liver metastases ([**2152**], [**2153**]), and is currently on a clinical trial of an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor affecting VEGFR/PDGFR families, SU011248, also known as Sugen and concurrently taking Sandostatin.
Over the years he has had multiple episodes of flushing/diarrhea with carcinoid crises.
The patient was in his usual state of health until five days prior to admission when he developed facial and upper thoracic flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
Over the course of the few days, the emesis became bloody and the patient developed maroon-colored stools.
He was given fluid boluses, had a single episode of syncope with a blood pressure of 56 systolic/palp.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother with hepatic and pancreatic cancer.
Mother abdominal cancer and grandparents both died of cancer.
Generally, patient was pale, pleasant, and lethargic gentleman in no apparent distress.
HEENT revealed no oral lesions, but dry oral mucosa.
Neck was supple with no jugular venous distention and no lymphadenopathy.
Heart sounds were regular, but tachycardic, no murmurs.
Extremities showed no edema.
Patient had no rashes.
Neurologic examination:  Patient was alert and oriented times three, full strength, 1+ deep tendon reflexes at patella, but absent ankle jerk reflexes.
Atrial fibrillation:  On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was converted to normal sinus rhythm with 5 mg of IV Lopressor, and he has remained in normal sinus rhythm ever since.
GI:  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on the morning of [**7-9**], and revealed severe esophagitis, mild antral gastritis, but no site of active bleeding.
With regards to his maroon-colored stool, it was felt that although this could be secondary to the upper GI bleed, a lower source of bleeding should be ruled out and a colonoscopy is recommended as an outpatient.
As patient had a history of candidal esophagitis, he was also started on an empiric course of nystatin swish and swallow this admission, however, no biopsies were obtained during the EGD to confirm this diagnosis.
Elevated liver function tests:  These were likely secondary to shock liver from the hypotensive episode the patient had the outside hospital.
Anemia:  Patient was found to have a very low hematocrit of 23 on admission.
Infectious disease:  Once transferred out of the unit onto the floor, the patient complained of a chest pain across the lower right aspect of his sternum and he developed a fever of 101.2.
A CT scan was performed which showed left lower lobe pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and by the day of discharge had an ambulatory oxygen saturation greater than 95%.
Pneumothorax:  On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, a right sided triple lumen catheter was placed, which resulted in a small pneumothorax, which was stable throughout his hospital per serial chest x-rays and CT scans.
Rule out myocardial infarction:  When patient first presented to the Intensive Care Unit, he had elevated CKs and an electrocardiogram showing ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.
He proceeded to rule out for myocardial infarction via serial enzymes and follow-up electrocardiograms.
This is most likely secondary to demand ischemia from hypovolemia.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to esophagitis.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
He was also instructed to avoid caffeine, smoking, or any other stomach irritants.
