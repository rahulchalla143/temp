Admission Date:  [**2138-7-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-9-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Fever, diarrhea, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 26M with history of hypoplastic MDS s/p single cord transplant with post transplant course c/b mucormycosis, CMV infection, Cdiff, and VRE bacteremia with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals.
The patient has been in and out of the hospital with recurrent episodes of sinusitis and pneumonia, most recently discharged on [**2138-7-18**].
During this most recent admission, the patient was treated for pneumonia and respiratory cultures grew pan-sensitive Step pneumo.
He also had CT chest and sinues which showed acute on chronic changes that were more concerning for bacterial infection, not fungal infection.
The patient was seen in clinic yesterday, and was found to have low grade temperature to 100.3; he was transfused 1U PRBC and platelets.
The patient reports having rigors and felt sick, which he why he went to OSH and as per report had temperature 103.
The patient also reports having a worsening cough; also notes having increasing nasal secretions.
Notes increasing nasal secretion.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a hypocellular marrow with cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13).
MDS course complicated by mucor infection with infiltration into base of the tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation of bleeding artery.
Recent course complicated by low grade temperature and +CMV viral load with proloinged admission for IV ganciclovir.
- C. difficile infection [**10/2136**] - pericoronitis s/p extraction 4 teeth [**2137-1-24**] - peri-rectal abscess s/p drainage [**2137-2-27**] - Hemochromatosis - Transaminitis (felt most likely multifactorial; contributions by medications and hemochromatosis) .
Pertinent Oncologic history (include past therapies, surgeries, etc): diagnosed with hypoplastic MDS in the fall of [**2136**]; transfusion dependent; mucor infection with infiltration into base of the tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation of bleeding artery; single cord allo [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG conditioning; CMV + CURRENT TREATMENT PLAN: allo assessment.

No known family history of cancer or bleeding disorders.
Physical Exam: Admission PE: VS: 97.4 97/62 70 16 98RA General: pleasant, well appearing young gentleman, NAD, laying comfortably in bed HEENT: EOMI, PERRL CV: RRR, S1, S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs appreciated lungs: coarse breath sounds throughout, with inspiratory crackles throughout abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS extremities: warm, well perfused, no LE edema; L arm PICC with no erythema, no tenderness to palpation Neuro: moving all extremities spontaneously, muscle strength and sensation throughout  Discharge PE: Called to bedside in early morning of [**8-19**] to pronounce patient.
Neutrophils (subset: 67%) show loss of GPI-linked protein.
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: An atypical granulocytic population (subset) with loss of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 (MIRL).
These findings (in a patient with a history of cord transplantation and transfusions) while suggestive of GPI-linked antigen loss need to be further ratified in the context of his original disease recurrence or donor related (cord blood transplant).
Further confirmatory testing with FLAER (send-out) can be considered, if Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria is a differential diagnostic consideration.
KARYOTYPE ([**8-1**]: 46,XY[30])  Imaging: CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILIMPRESSION [**7-23**]:  Persistent opacities at the maxillary sinuses, ethmoidal, sphenoid and frontoethmoidal recesses as described above, with minimal improvement in the pattern of aeration, the attenuation in the paranasal sinuses is slightly heterogeneous, likely indicating inspissated secretions, the possibility of fungal colonization is also a consideration.
Ground glass opacity and centrilobular nodules in the left lower lobe, more characteristic of infection, have nearly completely resolved.
Given the stability of the right upper lobe finding and resolution of other infection, the right upper lobe ground-glass opacities are less likely to be infectious and may be inflammatory or drug related.
Evidence of third spacing is evidenced by a moderate amount of pelvic ascites and trace pericholecystic fluid, both new from prior.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess, however, attention on followup should be paid to a small hypodensity seen in the right pelvis, which most likely represents bowel.
Equivocal patchy increase in hepatic parenchymal echogenicity suggestive of fatty infiltration.
Gallbladder wall edema, a nonspecific finding which could relate to third spacing, particularly in the setting of low serum albumin.
No gallstones.
Brief Hospital Course: PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 26M with history of hypoplastic MDS s/p single cord transplant with post transplant course c/b mucormycosis, CMV infection, Cdiff, and VRE bacteremia with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals, recently discharged from hospital for PNA, now presenting with fevers and rigors in the setting of recent blood transfusion on [**2138-7-22**].
His fevers persisted despite antibiotics and the patient ultimately had a bone marrow biopsy that showed evidence of HLH.
He was started on HLH [**2130**] protocol, and unfortunately became lethargic and tachycardic with severe metabolic acidosis anc respiratory alkalosis in the setting of severe diarrhea.
Head CT was concerning for subacute ischemic stroke.
Patient's metabolic disturbance worsened and he eventually became hypotensive and passes away the morning of [**8-19**].
ACTIVE PROBLEMS # Hypotension: On [**8-18**] and into the morning of [**8-19**] the patient became hypotensive with MAPs into the 40s.
He continued to have significant metabolic derangements, most notably an AGMA.
# Lethargy: Transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**8-17**] due to new onset tachycardia, hypertension, and worsening metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis.
Due to increased lethargy, a head CT was obtained which showed R sided hypodensity in the internal capsule/basal ganglia.
The differential for this finding included stroke, infection or mass.
Because this would require intubation and would not significantly alter management in the acute setting, MRI was deferred and blood pressures were monitored in the setting of a presumed infarct, initially allowing for permissive hypertension with SBPs into the 180s.
As noted above, the patient progressively became hypotensive in the setting of a triple acid base disturbance, and eventually expired.
# Diarrhea: The patient initially had diarrhea in the setting of his antibiotics.
Diarrhea became persistent on [**8-13**], and he developed a non-anion gap acidosis with Cl to 122 on [**8-16**].
After developing nausea on [**8-17**] and having a bicarb of 12, he became unresponsive to IVF boluses as above.
# Metabolic derangements: Pt.
He was found to have a triple acid base disturbance consisting of the following: AGMA likely due to lactic acidosis [**3-20**] hypotension, NGMA likely [**3-20**] diarrhea and respiratory alkalosis of unclear etiology.
The respiratory alkalosis was later attributed to a central process given the findings on head CT noted above.
Ultimately the patient became unable to maintain systemic BPs in the setting of severe metabolic derangments and he expired.
# Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: The patient was found to have HLH on bone marrow biopsy, which would account for his high fevers.
He also had an elevated EBV and it was thought that this was viral driven HLH in the setting of his elevated EBV viral load.
# Fevers: The patient initially presented with fevers in spite of being on ertapenum.
A transfusion reaction work up was initiated, and the patient was also started on empiric Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] in case infection was the underlying etiology.
He was ultimately found to have HLH and was started on dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporine.
# Hypoplastic MDS s/p single cord transplant: The patient was platelet and PRBC transfusion dependent.
#Nausea/Vomiting: Overnight on [**8-17**] pt developed intractable vomiting unresposive to phenergan, compazine, zofran, reglan.
# Tachycardia/Cardiac: The patient was been intermittently tachycardic throughout the admission, likely in the setting of intermittent fevers, vomiting, and his degree of anemia.
On [**8-17**] he became tachycardic to [**Street Address(2) 87418**] depressions in II, III, AvF.
# transfusion reaction:  The patient was noted to have labs consistent with hemolysis during this admission, with positive Coombs test.
Blood bank was involved in screening the patient's blood to identify which specific antibodies were causing him to have recurrent transfusion reactions.
