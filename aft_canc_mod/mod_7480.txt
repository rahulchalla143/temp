No evidence of acute aortic syndrome or acute pulmonary embolus.
Soft tissue density nodal mass surrounding the right lower lobe bronchus and [**Last Name (LF) 56207**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be infectious in nature or may represent a neoplasm.
Right lower lobe consolidation is present, which may represent post-obstructive changes, infection in the appropriate clinical setting or aspiration.
Markedely enlarged thryoid gland with multple hypodense lesions, consider thyroid unltrasound exam for further assessment.
Prominent centrilobular emphysema involving primarily upper lobes.
A 6-mm endobronchial lesion at the left main bronchus, may represent an endobronchial neoplasm, hamartoma and small mucous nodele.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Gallbladder is distended without gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid collection.
Left renal cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: 83F history of CAD CHF presenting from a nursing facility with hypoxia to the 70s, hypotension, fever of 101.4, and leukocytosis.
Initially admitted to the MICU, started on empiric treatment for HCAP and COPD exacerbation.
She showed some signs of improvement at times throughout her course, but experienced numerous setbacks, including intermittent tachycardia, hypotension, guaic positive stool concerning for an acute GI bleed, and acute encephalopathy.
She then had profound respiratory decompensation on [**2111-12-7**].
# Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure:  found around 11 AM on [**12-7**] to be unresponsive to sternal rub or nailbed pressure.
# Pneumonia: Presented with new infiltrates on CXR and CT chest, consistent with possible post-obstructive type pneumonia in RLL due to RLL bronchus mass vs. HAP/HCAP.
She was started initially on Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo in the ED, added azithromycin in MICU for atypical coverage.
Switched to linezolid [**12-1**] from vanco, given ?VRE UTI and persistently low vanco troughs.
# Severe COPD exacerbation:  Respiratory status worsened by presumed COPD exacerbation, which left her quite wheezy, "tight" and tachypneic nearly all the time.
# Lung mass: soft tissue mass suspicious for lung CA seen on CT on admission here.
Obtained records from [**Location (un) 1121**] with CT read-- can see the mass encasing the RLL bronchus and the endobronchial lesion in left bronchus.
Repeated non-contrast chest CT done [**12-1**], no significant changes to the mass or the degree of bronchus constriction.
Her family was originally interested in pursuing a diagnosis on this mass, but it was felt that a biopsy would not be worth the risk during her acute illness, especially given that she was on plavix for a recent medically-managemed NSTEMI.
