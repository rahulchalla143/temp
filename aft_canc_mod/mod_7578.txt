He does have baseline shortness of breath but this has worsened over the past couple of days, especially with exertion.
He denies orthopnea and PND and does not report ankle swelling.
There have been no new changes in his medications, just that he ran out of several of them recently.
Positive for weight loss.
Denies orthopnea or PND.
No abdominal pain or diarrhea.
Past Medical History: CAD--not a candidate for revascularization dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15% in [**2128-6-25**], with 3+ MR, 3+ TR, and pulmonary artery HTN) plasma cell dyscrasia - elevated IgG; also history of follicular lymphoma s/p XRT, followed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] pulmonary fibrosis [**2-27**] XRT gout hypercholesterolemia high blood pressure  Social History: Lives with wife in [**Location (un) 686**] with 2 cats.
No alcohol, no illicits.
Family History: No family history of early CAD or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
I-II/VI systolic murmur at apex.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Lower extremity U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, bilaterally.
Right basal opacity likely representing atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Chronic pulmonary changes, grossly unchanged.
ECHO:, [**9-17**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF=15-20%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with a regurgitant volume of 45 cc/beat.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial  effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular dilatation with severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
In this limited study, there are no signs of advanced bowel ischemia, although ischemia cannot be ruled out on this study.
No evidence for pneumonia or large abdominal abscess.
Moderate cardiomegaly, anasarca, ascites and right pleural effusion consistent with known congestive heart failure.
Progressive interstitial lung disease; the upper lobe predominance is not typical for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and suggests etiologies such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or silicosis.

The decision was made with him and his family to make him comfort measures due to his grim prognosis.
# Cardiac Ischemia: No evidence of active coronary ischemia.
Dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac catheterization demonstrated three vessel disease, but patient is not a candidate for surgical revascularization based on poor myocardial viability.
Pump - end-stage CHF, with dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe valvular disease.
Rhythm - Sinus rhythm with PVCs .
COPD, also restrictive lung disease post XRT: - no real benefit at this time for nebs, but pt may use for subjective relief - supplemental O2 as needed .
smoldering myeloma: at last visit, disease as stable, no active issues at this time .
# Elevated LFT's: most likely [**2-27**] to right sided heart failure and congestion - received PO Vitamin K for elevated INR .
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) NEB Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-10 mg PO Q1H (every hour) as needed for Pain or shortness of breath.
Hyoscyamine Sulfate 0.125 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual Q3-4H (Every 3 to 4 Hours) as needed for for respiratory secretions.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: # ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 15% # three vessel coronary artery disease not amenable to revascularization due to minimal myocardial viability # IgG plasma cell dyscrasia (smoldering myeloma) # pulmonary fibrosis   Discharge Condition: poor   Discharge Instructions: You have end-stage congestive heart failure.
