He had some soreness at site of insertion as well.
Past Medical History: Follicular Cell Lymphoma Hx Kidney Stones BPH s/p L hip replacement ~[**2111**] No history of cardiac disease.
No history of pulmonary disease No hx of hemorrhagic cystitis s/p Cytoxan  Past Oncologic History: 1.
Excisional biopsy of an enlarged submandibular lymph node on [**2106-11-3**] showing follicular lymphoma, histological grade 2 with positive BCL2 staining, bone marrow not involved.
Parotid mass noticed in [**2113**], which was biopsied on [**2113-6-21**] showed involvement with mixed small and large cell follicular lymphoma.
This was consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell with mixed small and large cell type of follicular center cell origin.
Clinical followup with serial CT scans showing enlarging lymph nodes over time in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis suggestive of recurrence.
Disease progression diagnosed in [**2115-11-24**] by a fine-needle aspiration of right preauricular mass.

He tolerated the initial preconditioning well with ATG, reacting with rigors/chills/fevers only on the first night.
He did have asymptomatic fevers on the second night of ATG, and blood pressures were noted to be lower than baseline in the 90s systolic, but the last three doses of ATG were tolerated well with no complaints.
Patient was, however, noted to be retaining significant amount of fluid and had gained over 40 lbs in fluid weight in the first two weeks.
In setting of fluid overload, diffusely erythematous skin, and renal failure, patient may have been experiencing a type of serum sickness secondary to the ATG remaining in his circulation.
The total lymphocyte irradiation (TLI) directed at his lymph nodes also led to increased erythema of his face, neck and back; because it was directed particularly at a large lymph node in right sided cervical chain, patient secondarily experienced increased pain in right cheek from radiation-induced mucositis.
Partial matched sibling donor stem cells were transfused on [**6-19**], after which he appeared to have mild hemolysis and had his first neutropenic fever.
# Neutropenic Fevers: Patient began having neutropenic fevers on [**6-19**] and was started on cefepime that evening.
# Acute Renal Failure: On presentation, patient's creatinine was 1.3, above his baseline of 1.0.
He may have been experiencing a serum sickness type of reaction secondary to the ATG still in his system, causing inflammatory changes and extravasation of fluids resulting in intravascular volume depletion.
# Elevated LFTs: Prior to stem cell infusion, patient's LFTs were noted to be rising slowly.
On Day 1 s/p stem cell transplant, a RUQ ultrasound without doppler was done to rule out obstruction, showing only gall bladder sludge and fatty infiltration of the liver.
Mild rise in T Bili after stem cell infusion was likely in setting of mild hemolysis.
# Hypoxia: Thought to be multifactorial initially- edema, engraftment, and infection.
He was grossly volume overloaded  in setting of pre chemo hydration.
A chest x ray obtained showed increased nodular/fluffy opacities.
He was started on vancomycin in addition to the cefipime he had been on for several days due to neutropenic fever.
He was also on steroids for possible engraftment syndrome and being treated for laryngeal edema.
He was ultimately found to have invasive aspergillis of the lungs, likely explaining his respiratory symptoms.
His blood and sputum tested positive for galactomannon.
His respiratory status was stable for a few days but then acutely deteriorated on [**2116-7-21**] with worsening opacities on CXR.
He was re-intubated, complicated with spontaneous pneumothorax on left side.
Patient continued to get aggressive anti-fungal treatment for a worsening aspergillis pneumonia which eventually cleared; per BMT, will continue micafungin.
Aspergillis was thought to be source of pulmonary infection given the positive sputum and blood galactomannon.
Voriconazole was then switched to micofungin since his LFTs increased thought to be possible due to voriconazole hepato-toxicity.
# Laryngeal Edema/Airway Protection: Patient had total lymph node radiation pre-transplant with resultant mucositis, causing edema and potential airway compromise.
He was initially placed on steroids for this issue, and is now continued on IV solumedrol.
# Hemoptysis: Superficial erosions seen on fiberoptic exam by ENT.
Likely hemoptysis from coughing/trauma in setting of low platelets.
No further episodes.
# Delirium: Patient developed altered mental status during ICU course and found to have parieto-occipital white matter changes suggestive of PRES syndrome possibly from cyclosporine.
Neuro was consulted and confirmed that PRES was the likely underlying condition since Video EEG and LP all returned negative.
He sporadically recieved Haldol PRN for agitation and delerium; however, has not needed it in a week.
# Follicular lymphoma: s/p ATG, TLI and allotransplant [**6-19**].
It was eventually stopped because of sinificant elevation of LFT's.
He was not able to take PO/NG meds due to ileus and Bactrim was not given due to renal failure.
#Abrnormal LFTs: Several weeks into hospital course, Mr. [**Known lastname 82035**] developed rising LFTs (in the 100s), rising amylase and lipase (in the 500s) and rising [**Female First Name (un) **]- total (peaked at 8.0).
Voriconazole was switched to Micogunfin to limit liver toxicity and we stopped TPN which is associated with liver failure.
# Trombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy.
# HYpertension: He had significant hypertension while being mechanically ventilated.
# Hemolysis: Likely secondary to A/B mismatch of patient and donor.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine steadily increased during admission.
A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstuction.
The renal team was consulted and felt the scenario was consistent with ATN.
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================  ICU Course from [**8-9**] - [**9-11**]:  Respiratory Failure: Patient was transferred from BMT for increasing respiratory distress.
On [**8-9**], he was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Bronchoscopy was completed to rule out PCJ pneumonia and was negative.
Cholecystitis/Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient had cholecystitis (diagnosied by RUQ u/s and elevated LFTs).
Patient was started empirically on antibiotics for possible cholangitis, and a PTC was placed.
Numerous RUQ ultrasounds indicated that the patient's biliary drain was in place, without any evidence of blockage or obstruction.
A transjugular hepatic biopsy showed pathology consistent with sepsis versus drug reaction, at which point the patient was DC'ed from several hepatotoxic drugs, without resolution of hyperbilirubinemia.
Kidney fucntion: Course was complicated by acute renal failure which was thought to be [**2-25**] ATN from either hypotension or from acyclovir.
Additionally, the patient had profound uremia and hyponatremia.
Hyponatremia was thought to be [**2-25**] hypervolemia and resolved with volume restriction.
Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient also remained thrombocytopenic and anemia and in the setting of acute renal failure, there was concern for a transplant associated thrombotic [**Doctor First Name **].
On [**8-11**] at 544 AM the patient passed away from hypoxic respiratory failure after being removed from the ventilator at the wishes of his family.
