for breast cancer diagnosed in [**11/2098**] s/p chemotherapy followed by Herceptin who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with seizures, was found to have metastatic brain lesion, and transferred for XRT of metastatic brain lesions.
Patient had a PET scan in [**8-20**] that was normal except a low attenuation lesion in R parietal lobe.
Outpatient brain MRI on [**2100-9-17**] showed 1.2 cm right parietal mass with extensive edema c/w sole metastasis.
On Sunday evening, she presented with new seizures.
She then developed slurred speech and L facial droop.
She was seen by Neurology and Oncology, who felt that the patient would be candidate for gamma knife or neurosurgical removal followed by XRT.
She is transferred for evaluation of these treatments.
She has had no seizures since being hospitalized at [**Location (un) **].
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.
No dysuria, urinary frequency.

MRI Brain [**9-24**] Right posterior frontal/parietal 2-cm lesion at the surface of the brain, likely dural-based metastatic lesions.
Surrounding edema is seen.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus.

Mild right cerebral hemispheric edema with effacement of the sulci.
No midline shift.
No diffusion images.
Blood products and postoperative changes in the right parietal region are as expected.
Post-surgical changes, similar in appearance with small amount of hemorrhagic products, edema and pneumocephalus as expected.
No new hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
No definite abnormal enhancement.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive for detection of residual disease.

# Metastatic breast cancer to the brain/Seizure: The patient was continued on decadron and phenytoin with a therapeutic level.
After long discussion with her two sons, the patient opted for neurosurgical treatment of her solitary brain metastasis and was transferred on the neurosurgery service on [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**9-23**].
# Encephalopathy, metabolic:  The patient was initially extremely lethargic, although arousable and able to follow commands, which was thought to be secondary to the large doses of ativan that she received for her seizure.
# Acute renal failure: - IVFs - monitor Cr  The patient was trasnferred to the neurosurgery service on the evening of [**9-23**] from the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] in order to undergo surgical resection of her brain mass.
Surgery was performed without complication.
She was admitted to the ICU post op for close neurological monitoring.
Post-op MRI revealed no evidence of new CVA or residual tumor.
Post operative imaging was performed which revealed post operative changes and no hemorrhage.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right parietal brain mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] if you have questions or problems related to your surgery.
