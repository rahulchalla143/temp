Admission Date:  [**2198-8-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-10-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2133-2-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Neuromedicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] who was diagnosed about one year ago when she presented with intermittent ptosis of the right eye.
She was treated with Mestinon and showed initial improvement, then in [**Month (only) 956**], last year she developed some slurred speech and her Mestinon dose was increased.
In [**Month (only) 216**] she developed increasing facial and bulbar weakness.
Over the month of [**Month (only) 216**] and [**Month (only) **], however, her symptoms progressively worsened until she was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] in [**2196-7-22**] with an inability to swallow her own secretions.
At that time she had proximal weakness in her arms, moderate proximal weakness in her legs and distally in her arms.
At that time she had a urinary tract infection which was thought possibly to have been the precipitants of the worsening of the myasthenia.
The urinary tract infection was treated and she started a five day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.
During the course of her hospitalization, she was found to have a thymoma.
She initially improved until the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**] when she developed weakness, neck flexion and extension as well as increasing weakness in her arms, also her negative respiratory force dropped to about -40.
She continued to do quite well and ended up undergoing a thymectomy which she tolerated fairly well, however, postoperatively she had bilateral chest tubes with some mild pleural effusions and continued to complain of some shortness of breath.
Her shortness of breath gradually improved after the chest tubes were removed and she was discharged to home.
However, at home, the patient noticed that she continued to have some shortness of breath and went to [**Hospital 41498**] Hospital where she was thought to have a right lower lobe pneumonia.
At that time she had no fever, no sputum, and no chest pain.
She remained stable there initially but then began to have difficulty swallowing her own secretions.
Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] as above.
Mild steroid-induced glucose intolerance.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not use tobacco or alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination on admission she was mildly distressed due to inability to handle her secretions.
On general examination she was normocephalic, atraumatic with moist mucous membranes.
Heartsounds were regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She had some mild dysarthria.
There was no relative afferent pupillary defect.
She had ptosis on sustained upgaze.
She had bilateral eye closure weakness.
Palate elevated symmetrically on both sides, she can protrude the tongue with good resistance in both cheeks.
She had symmetrical proximal muscle weakness in both the deltoids and both iliopsoas, around 4 out of 5.
She also had fatigable triceps weakness with minimal exercise bilaterally.
Coordination to finger-to-nose-to-finger was within normal limits considering her mild proximal muscle weakness bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Her initial chest x-ray showed a possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 65 year old woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], ten days status post thymectomy presenting with worsening dysarthria and difficulty handling secretions as well as some shortness of breath.
She was continued on intravenous Mestinon, intravenous medications initially because she had difficulty swallowing.
During her admission she continued to have mild ptosis on prolonged upgaze of over 60 seconds.
At the time of admission she also continued to have mild fatigable triceps weakness after approximately 30 to 45 seconds of exercise, however, her shortness of breath had improved.
Her dysarthria and dysphagia had essentially completely resolved.
Mild steroid-induced glucose intolerance 3.
