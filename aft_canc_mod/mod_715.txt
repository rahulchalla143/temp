Admission Date:  [**2199-12-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-1-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-12-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA to lungs, bone who presents with progressive altered mental status.
Family was concerned about dehydration and brought her into the ED for evaluation.
No leukocytosis but mild left shift.
CXR unchanged with partial lingular collapse, L hilar mass and associated streaky opacity.
She was given 5 IV metoprolol x 2 with minimal response (--> 180s/120s).
Head CT revealed new vasogenic edema in b/l occipital lobes as well as new hypodensity in the bilateral cerebellum, thalami and corona radiata.
She complained of pain "all over".
Complains of pain all over but cannot localize.
Past Medical History: Onc History (per prior notes): - Pt noted neck mass [**4-9**]; at this time also had mammogram (as had hx of breast lump 10 yrs prior) which demonstrated mass in left breast.
- Core needle biopsy disclosed infiltrating poorly differentiated carcinoma; histologic grade III; with necrosis, probably lymphatic invasion, and possible DCIS - ER neg, PR neg, Her-2/neu neg - CT torso showed multiple enlarged left axillary nodes, several right lower lobe lung nodules - Bone scan showed no evidence of bony metastases - FNA of left cervical node demonstrated malignant cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma (similar in morphology to those on her recent breast biopsy) - Commenced dose-dense Cytoxan/Adriamycin C1D1 [**2199-5-17**]; completed Cycle 4 [**2199-7-11**] - Taxol/Avastin started; last dose (C3D15) was [**2199-11-8**] - T8 transverse process biopsied [**2199-10-16**], demonstrated to have malignant carcinoma cells c/w primary  Additional Past Med Hx: 1. as above, recent admission for bronchitis 2. atrial tachycardia 3.
Her mother had one sister who may have developed breast cancer in her 70s.
The patient is not aware of any other family members with a diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.8 BP: 160/112 HR: 93 RR: 21 O2Sat: 97% on 2L-->96% on RA GEN: cachectic female, appears uncomfortable, intermittently lying still and then writhing on the bed, tachypneic HEENT: EOMI, PERRL (4-->2 mm), sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, dry MM, small tannish plaques on the hard palate, no thrush NECK: No JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: tachy, regular, 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: drowsy but arousable, oriented to person but not place or time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Pertinent Results: CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2199-12-26**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Allowing for patient position and rotation, there is no change in partial collapse of the lingula and an associated streaky opacity emanating from the left hilum.
There is diffuse interstitial abnormality most likely related to lymphangitic spread of carcinomatosis.
No other focal consolidation is identified, and there has been no interval development of pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No change in collapse of lingula most likely due to left hilar mass, and associated lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
New right greater than left occipital vasogenic edema.
Recommend evaluation with gadolinium-enhanced MR to exclude intracranial metastasis when patient is able to co-operate with an exam.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Worsening of sinus disease.
EEG Study Date of [**2199-12-27**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encelphalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
Multiple bilateral FLAIR hyperintensities that could represent PRESS given the patient's history and pattern of distribution.
Very limited MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrated questionable right MCA stenosis and poor visualization of the basilar artery.
Cannot evaluate for metastatic disease to the brain.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Progression of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Progressive infiltrative soft tissue in the left hilum with worsening distal atelectasis.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-12-28**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent lymphangitic carcinomatosis, unchanged.
Left hilar opacity, more prominent than seen previously.
Finding again represents lingular atelectasis and is likely slightly worse in the interval.

PRES was considered given patient history of recent hypertension in setting of receiving cisplantin, a possible trigger of PRES.
Neurology was consulted and felt that MRI/MRA would help to confirm PRES and possibly rule out metastatic disease to brain causing her AMS.
MRI would have also been useful to rule out a stroke cause by a hypercoaguable state.
MRI of brain on [**2199-12-27**] reveals inability to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging motion artifact.
No sign of infection.
?widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures??????.
On [**2199-12-31**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] (patient's primary oncologist) stopped by to see patient and family and outcome of his meeting was a request to reconsult neurology for further prognostic information for PRES as well as potential benefit for repeat MRI.
MRI tech revealed on [**2199-12-31**] that repeat MRI could not be re-attempted without intubation and sedation with anesthesia present as patient?????
