MATERNAL HISTORY:  Notable for astrocytoma resection in [**2093**] with shunt placement, thyroidectomy done in [**2099**].
Was discharged home and was readmitted on [**12-21**] with increased blood pressure.
S1, S2 no murmur.
Comfortable appearing initially with respiratory distress that evolved over the first few hours of life.
Nonfocal neurologic examination, age appropriate.
Of note on exam, is a small hemangioma on her head.
REVIEW OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Respiratory:  Baby had some mild respiratory distress, requires some continuous positive airway pressure for less than 24 hours.
By day of life one, the respiratory distress was resolved and the baby transitioned to room air.
She has had no further respiratory distress with baseline respiratory rates in the 30s-50s.
She did not require any methylxanthine treatment for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
Cardiovascular:  No issues.
She received 2/kg of D10W with subsequent dextrose stick of 86 and no further issues.
She has had no electrolytes drawn since then as she has been on full feeds without issue.
Gastrointestinal:  Baby had physiologic jaundice.
No further issues.
Infectious disease:  On admission, the baby had a blood culture and a CBC sent and because of her mid respiratory distress, was started on a 48 hour course of ampicillin and gentamicin.
No evidence of interventricular hemorrhage.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  1) Born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of three of the following: daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or with school-age siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Status post respiratory distress probably transient tachypnea as a newborn.
Status post rule out sepsis with 48 hours of antibiotics.
Status post apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
