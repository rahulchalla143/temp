Microbiology: Negative blood and urine cultures Negative Influenza DFA  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 100984**] is a 73 yo man with history of  CHF with EF 35%, DM2, ESRD on HD, follicular ymphoma, AS, and Afib who presented with chest pain and fatigue.
Lymphoma: He has a prior diagnosis of follicular lymphoma that had been stable for him over the last several years.
A CT torso revealed significant worsening of his lymphadenopathy diffusely and he began to complain of back pain thought to be related to retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
It was later decided not to pursue biopsy as it would not change his lymphoma management.
Given the rapid interval increase in his lymphadenopathy and elevated LDH there was concern for high grade transformation.
His chemotherapy was complicated by pancytopenia for which he was started on neupogen and tumor lysis syndrome for which he received allopurinol and rasburicase.
Patient spiked a fever while neutropenic and treated empirically with zosyn and vancomycin for febrile neutropenia.
Patient remained stable and neutropenia resolved and so antibiotics and neupogen were stopped.
NSTEMI x2: He was admitted with left-sided chest pain and had had a recent P-MIBI that showed an inferior wall reversible defect.
He was ruled out for MI with cardiac biomarkers and his ECG showed no changes from previous.
His pain was thought to be consistent with unstable angina and he was taken for cardiac catheterization.
He had a significant stenosis of the LAD and posterior descending artery and received a bare metal stent to the PDA, as this corresponded to his perfusion defect on stress testing.
While on OMED, patient suffered another ischemic event with positive troponins.
Hypotension: He was admitted overnight to the medical ICU during his hospitalization after an episode of hypotension with sytolic blood pressures in the 60's.
He also spiked a fever shortly after this episode and given his low white blood cell count, he was treated for sepsis and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Ultimately on further review it was felt that the patient hypotension was chronic, and as he remained asymptomatic he was closely monitored.
Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: His cardiac catheterization revealed severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as well as moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
Rhythm: He has a history of atrial fibrillation.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: He was managed with an insulin sliding scale and a diabetic diet.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Non ST elevation Myocardial Infarction End Stage Renal Disease Congestive Heart Failure Low grade non Hodgkin lymphoma  with possible high grade transformation Hypotension Neutropenic Fever  Secondary Diagnoses: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus    Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain.
You underwent a cardiac catheterization and were found to have a blockage in two arteries that carry blood to the heart.
You were also found to have progressive disease of your follicular lymphoma.
We think the lymphoma became very high grade and so we treated you with steroids and chemotherapy.
You also developed a side effect of chemotherapy called tumor lysis syndrome and we treated you with rasburicase and allopurinol.
You also developed low white blood cell counts and so we treated you with a medication called neupogen and antibiotics.
(5) Added nephrocaps for your kidney disease  (6) Added senna and colace for constipation as needed  (7) Added lisinopril 10mg daily    IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE PLAVIX EVRY DAY.
If you experience chest pain, fevers > 101, chills, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or any concerning symptoms please call your PCP or return to the emergency room.
