The patient has demonstrated a propensity for developing confluent opacities in a very similar distribution reference to series of chest x-rays on [**3-6**] and 24th of this year.
Therefore, this is most likely representing the patient's unique distribution of pulmonary edema in the setting of decompensated heart failure.
However, the appearance, in and of itself, is nonspecific and multifocal pneumonia or massive aspiration remain diagnostic considerations.
########################################################## Microbiology: [**2143-3-17**]: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2143-3-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2143-3-17**]: Blood Culture: PENDING   Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo f with hx of HTN, mitral stenosis and diastolic dysfunction presenting with repeat HTN urgency and likely flash pulm edema in setting of dietary discretion .
# Pulm Edema:  likely a combination of volume overload from dietary indiscretion and hypertensive urgency leading to pulmonary edema.
This is supported by crackles to mid field on exam, increased peripheral pitting edema, increased JVD, increased BNP.
She was instructed to limit her sodium intake and to weight herself every day, her Wt on the day of discharge was 58.9 Kg  # HTN: presented with hypertensive urgency that likely reflected her high sympathetic tone in setting of dyspnea and which contributed to her acute pulmonary edema.
# CAD:  no Chest pain currently, CE flat, no symptoms of ACS on this admission  # Abdominal pain: intermittent, chronic and mild and disappeared quickly after admissioin.
Quickly reverted to sinus in setting of diuresis and decreased afterload.
She had no significant arrythmias on tele.
