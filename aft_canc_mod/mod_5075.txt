Admission Date:  [**2111-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-12-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Nitroglycerin Transdermal  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Persistant vomiting, dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2111-1-20**]:Left Parietal Craniotomy   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 57 yo RHM with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, and renal cell carcinoma with lung mets on treatment with Sutent, and s/p left nephrectomy who is here with ~1 week of headache, nausea, and vomiting.
He was found to have a 2x1.8 cm mass in the left parietal lobe with significant edema and 6 mm of rightward shift.
There is no obvious uncal herniation.
He had been having a "swishing sound" in both ears for the last 6 weeks that was being followed as possible ear infection or inner ear dysfunction.
There, he had a Headache Mon-Wed that woke him at night but wasn't otherwise positional.
Wed. he started vomiting, was admitted to a hospital there and hydrated.
They came in and found the mass as above on head CT.  Past Medical History: Renal Cell Carcinoma, Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Hyperlipidemia, s/p Left Nephrectomy [**4-14**], Hemorrhoids   Social History: The patient was born in [**State 9512**].
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Subjective: reports right eye blurry with peripheral views.
Pain is being well controlled with oral medication Objestive: Vitals: 98.2, BP 141/77, HR 93, RR 16, O2 Sat 96% General: No apparent distress Neuro:  AOx3, eyes open spontaneously, follows all commands appropriately  Motor: 5/5 strength bilaterally of both upper and lower extremities.
Small amount of blood products and air are seen in this region secondary to recent surgery.
There is still edema identified in the left parieto-occipital lobe as before.
There is no significant midline shift seen.
There is no hydrocephalus.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2111-1-18**] 7:31 PM FINDINGS: The indistinct opacity of the medial left apex is again noted and consistent with the known metastatic disease.
Otherwise, no definite further pulmonary nodule or mass is seen.
There is no superimposed consolidation or edema.
There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
ROUTINE MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT & WITH GADOLINIUM [**2111-1-22**] FINDINGS: There are changes from a left parietal craniotomy for resection of left parietal occipital mass with subependymal spread.
There is an_operative cavity which contains T1 birght blood which limits evaluation for residual enhancing neoplasm.
There is mild linear enhancement along the anteroinferior aspect of the operative cavity which could represent post-surgical sequela.
No convincing evidence for residual neoplasm is seen but would recommend follow up imaging after resolution of T1 hyperintense hemorrhage in the operative bed to assess for this better.
There is no evidence for acute ischemia.
There is approximately 5 mm of midline shift to the right which has slightly improved compared to the prior study.
There is stable edema in the left operative bed and parietal lobe.
IMPRESSION: Presence of hemorrhage in the operative cavity limits evaluation for residual neoplasm.
Would recommend a follow up study in one to two weeks to establish a true baseline for possible residual neoplasm.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2111-1-18**] Patient presented to the ER with 1 week history of headache, nausea and vomiting.
He was evaluated and admitted to the surgical ICU for closer monitoring given his metastatic cancer history pending surgical intervention.
Findings were as follows: "There is a 21 x 18 mm hyperattenuating round soft tissue lesion within the left parietal lobe posteriorly, with significant associated vasogenic edema extending through the posterior aspect of the parietal subcortical white matter.
There is significant mass effect with left cerebral sulcal effacement and effacement of the occipital and frontal horns of the left lateral ventricle.
Additionally, there is subfalcine herniation and 6 mm of rightward midline shift.
No definite additional lesions are identified, though non- contrast CT is limited in evaluating for small lesions.
No acute hemorrhage.
There is mild effacement of the left supra- sellar cistern and mild rightward shift of the interpeduncular cistern, indicating very early uncal herniation.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the calvarium."
On [**2111-1-19**], he has a MRI performed with the following findings: "Again seen is an inhomogeneously enhancing left occipital mass with profound surrounding edema.
This edema extends forward into the internal capsule and enters the splenium of the corpus callosum.
It produces mass effect and left to right midline shift.
No other lesions are seen.
The findings are compatible with metastatic carcinoma with severe edema."
Due to his previous h/o sinus hemorrhage an ENT consult was obtained.
There was no immediate concerns but the team did recommend a hearing test and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He had some teaching with the nurse on [**2111-1-24**] and he was ready felt safe to be discharged on [**2111-1-25**].
