HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of metastatic melanoma admitted with acute renal failure, weakness, encephalopathy and hypotension.
He had recurrence in [**2103**], and underwent a left axillary node dissection.
After this, he was treated with interferon therapy which was discontinued in [**2105-3-2**] when hepatic and meningeal metastases were discovered.
This was discontinued in [**2105-12-2**], because of progression including involvement of the second portion of the duodenum and spleen.
The patient has not been noticed to be confused and disoriented except occasionally after doses of morphine.
The patient was admitted from [**4-29**] until [**2106-5-1**], on the OMED Service with acute renal failure.
At that time, a renal ultrasound revealed mild left hydronephrosis.
One day prior to admission, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, and weakness.
Between the time of arrival to the Emergency Department and transport to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient developed a decreased level of consciousness.
A CT scan of the head was negative for acute intracranial process.
Malignant melanoma with metastases to bone, liver, spleen, right kidney, adrenals, duodenum.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 1.2 to 1.5.
History of colonic adenomas.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Status post hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
In general, this is an ill appearing white male, somnolent, who opens eyes briefly and responds to verbal or tactile stimuli.
Neck with reduced jugular venous pressure at 20 to 30 degrees.
Lungs with decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.
III/VI systolic ejection murmur which was diffuse; no rubs.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities with no peripheral edema.
Liver function tests were within normal limits except for an elevated alkaline phosphatase at 435, amylase was 76 and lipase was 52.
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.020 with nitrites positive, 3 to 5 white blood cells, moderate bacteria.
Renal ultrasound showed a stable left mild hydronephrosis and right lower pole mass.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of heart failure or pneumonia, but was positive for a small right pleural effusion.
There was a small air fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient's initial hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 60s on arrival to the Emergency Department, was felt to likely be secondary to hypovolemia given the patient's recent history of decreased p.o.
intake, nausea and vomiting.
Also, in the differential was sepsis and adrenal insufficiency as well as cardiogenic process including pericardial tamponade.
for adrenal insufficiency which was likely secondary to metastatic disease.
As previously stated, a repeat renal ultrasound was done which showed stable mild hydronephrosis.
A Foley catheter was placed to rule out any contribution of obstruction due to the patient's acute renal failure.
At this time, per his primary oncologist, there are very limited options for further therapy.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  The patient was started on Levofloxacin for a urinary tract infection and will complete a seven day course as an outpatient.
RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION:  Chest x-ray from [**2106-4-9**], showed bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated compressive atelectasis on the right side.
The patient maintained good room air saturations throughout this admission and there was no evidence of respiratory compromise.
Metastatic melanoma.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
