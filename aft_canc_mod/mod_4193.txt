Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87457**] is a 44 year-old woman with metastatic lung CA, recurrent malignant pericardial effusion, recurrent DVT and PE s/p IVC, SVC and brachiocephalic filter placement who presented with cough and dyspnea for 1 week and was found to have CTA concerning for PE and pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
She was taken semi-urgently to the catheterization laboratory for pericardiocentesis with balloon pericardiotomy and subseqnetly required surgical creation of 2 pericardial windows with internal drainage.
# Malignant Pericardial Effusion:  She presented with her third occurence of malignant pericardial effusion with evidence of tamonade physiology that required drainage and balloon pericardiotomy.
However, later that day she again was noted to have an increased pulsus up to 32mmHg with doppler with recurrence of tamonade physiology with new RV collapse on bedside ECHO.
Overnight she was urgently taken to CT surgery for pericardial window with internal drainage.
In that surgery window was created draining into the L pleural space and a L chest tube was placed that initially drained 400cc of serosanguinous fluid.
Due to technical difficulties with window placement and concern that the window might not be effective, a pericardial incision was also made just righ of midline and 200cc of bloody fluid was drained from the pericardium and a pericardial drain was placed in that incision.
After 24hrs the L chest tube was removed as it had decreasing drainage but the pericardial drain was left in place due to very high output (1L over first 24hrs and 500cc/day each of the following 2 days).
As a result, the pericardial tube was clamped on [**2-3**] and the patient was monitored overnight without significant change in vital signs or symptoms.
On [**2-5**], the pericardial drain was removed after ECHO confirmed that there was constrictive physiology but no hemodynamically significant effusion 36hrs after the tube had been clamped.
An additional 200cc of fluid was drained at that time with process stopped as pt started to experience pain.
She was given morphine po for these drainages.
# Pulmonary embolism: She was first diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism in [**6-/2106**] along with BUE clots.
She was found to have an anti-factor Xa level of >2.0 consistent with therapeutic levels.
CTA on this admission identified a subsegmental PE in an artery to the left lower lobe.
Because of the reaccumulation of her pericadial effusion with solid pericardial mass component, it was determined that the heparin drip should not be resumed immedicately.
# R anterior/apical pneumothorax: on [**2-1**], daily PCXR noted small apical R pneumothorax.
This was confirmed by CXR Pa/Lat which also noted small anterior component to R apical pneumothorax.
Cause of this PTX most likely related to significant R pleural effusion/atelectasis due to underlying lung malignancy more than any of the operative proceedures that were done as none of them in theory should have involved the R lung pleura.
There was some concern for possible post-obstructive PNA in setting of known lung mass so initially started on vanco/cefepime for this on [**1-28**] and also knowing that pt would be going to OR and receiving operative instrumentation.
Abx were stopped Am [**1-31**] after 48hrs when it became apparent that there was no significant infectious process as the cause of pts symptoms.
# Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma of the lung was discovered in [**6-/2106**], metastatic to right temporal lobe and now s/p stereotactic radiotherapy.
Pt was kept on prednisone at oncology request due to her brain mets.
She also had 3 days of increased steroids (dexamethasone 8mg [**Hospital1 **] x 3 days) at the time of chemotherapy and also received neupogen to increase her counts after chemo.
She received increased doses at 8mg [**Hospital1 **] x 3 days around the time of chemotherapy and was discharged back on dexamethasone 2mg daily until she meets with her neuro-oncologist for the swelling around her neck secondary to SVC syndrome.
She also had Horner's syndrome with right eye ptosis and anhidrosis.
She will need an outpatient MRI head and C-spine for further [**Hospital1 2742**] of her horner syndrome.
# Access: Pt had known right upper extremity DVTs on admission with swelling around right arm for which she had been on lovenox.
Later, on the floor, RUQ ultrasound revealed right IJ and right cephalic DVTs.
Left UE US had small non-occlusive residual clot is seen in the lower IJ.
However, pt had very poor access and it was not guaranteed that access could be obtained in left arm given clot in left IJ as well.
Thus, it was decided to continue to use right PICC while pt was in house with close monitoring of right arm circumference.
She was scheduled for outpatient MRV to evaluate for access for future chemo sessions and will likely need chest port.
