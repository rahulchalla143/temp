Admission Date:  [**2199-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-3-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: Oropharyngeal bleed   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 61 year-old female with a history of aggressively invasive prolactinoma (followed primarily at [**Hospital1 3278**] and deemed inoperable, currently undergoing compassionate chemotherapy), hemorrhagic basal ganglia stroke in [**11/2198**] and nonverbal since, recent admission for epistaxis, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for acute onset oropharygeal bleeding today.
The patient woke up today with profuse bleeding from her oropharynx and was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
At one point, she also developed atrial fibrillation, which self-resolved.
Exam showed some oozing and dried blood in the oropharynx.
There was a report of possible esophageal varices from her nursing home although her husband was unaware of this.
CXR and CT chest with question of aspiration pneumonia.
ECG without ST-T changes and stable compared to [**Location (un) 620**] ECG.
The main concern was for bleeding from her from her malignant prolactinoma.
CTA head showed bony erosion into the skull base with extension into the ethmoids, nasopharynx, and middle cranial fossa.
CXR with a question of pneumothorax; CT chest confirmed a small left, non-tension pneumothorax.
She was also noted to have a left pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema tracking along her right upper chest into the neck.
These findings were thought to be related to positive pressure ventilation v. erosive tumor extension.
Neurosurgery spoke with husband who declined any surgical procedure due to her poor prognosis.
After discussion with the ED team, her husband/HCP decided to make her DNR again with no further invasive measures including chest tube placement (understanding risk of ventilation with pneumothorax) if she were to decompensate.
Past Medical History: Malignant pituitary tumor, s/p resection in [**2177**], and XRT in [**2177**], gamma knife XRT x 2 over ensuing years with progressive disease, treated with multiple rounds of chemotherapy including recent experimental chemotherapy protocol at [**Hospital1 3278**], with right eye CN VI palsy with chronic medial gaze and left eye CN III and VI palsies.
Hemorrhagic basal ganglia stroke in [**11/2198**] and nonverbal since; speech progression impaired by jaw dislocation Life-threatening epistaxis in [**1-/2199**] requiring transfusion of pRBC, plts, FFP secondary to tumor invasion Right eye keratitis treated with topical antibiotics Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes mellitus Hypothyroidism Chronic anemia Polymyalgia rheumatica Adrenal insufficiency Osteoporosis L1 compression fracture H/o PCP pneumonia and respiratory failure with sepsis in [**2196**] H/o H1N1 in [**10/2197**] H/o C. diff H/o low CD4 count, HIV negative  Social History: She was discharged to NE [**Hospital1 **] after her [**1-/2199**] admission and stepped down from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Location (un) 1036**] in [**Location (un) 620**] 1.5 weeks ago.
She has been nonverbal since [**2198-11-7**] but would respond to command and nod to questions and was able to fill out legal documents including power of attorney two weeks ago.

There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Note is made of bilateral apical pleural thickening.
There is no focal consolidation.
Incidental note is made of slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, new from the previous study, likely related to right lower lobe atelectasis.
[**4-10**] CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right and left basal parenchymal opacities, more extensive on the left than on the right, have slightly increased in extent.
The apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
Slight inferior lead ST-T wave changes.
Since the previous tracing of same date sinus tachycardia is absent and axis is shifted rightward.
Complex sellar mass eroding the central skull base with tumor extension anteriorly into the nasopharynx, left ethmoid air cells, left sphenoid sinus, left orbital apex, and possibly left maxillary and right sphenoid sinuses.
Entrapment of left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and dilated lateral and third ventricles.
Erosive bony changes in the central skull base involving sphenoid.
No evidence of active contrast extravasation.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital1 139**] [**Hospital1 **] Course 60F with aggressive prolactinoma compressing optic chiasm, carotids, and bone presenting with second episode of oral pharyngeal bleed with very poor prognosis.
.. # Goals of care: Very poor prognosis given extent of malignant prolactinoma invasion.
The patient passed away peacefully on a morphine drip, prednisone for laryngeal swelling from the tumor and a Scopalime patch MICU course # Oropharyngeal bleed: Related to bony erosion of malignant prolactinoma into the nasopharynx; appears to have spontaneously resolved for now with no evidence of underlying coagulopathy.
Per ENT, elective/urgent embolization of feeding vessels is only option to control bleeding but pt's HCP declined surgical intervention upon discussion with Neurosurgery.
Husband understands risk of developing tension pneumothorax with continuation of vent support but expresses a desire to avoid further invasive measures including chest tube placement although would consider needle decompression.
Right pneumothorax resolved, left apical pneumothorax unchanged.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be due to R subclavian line given evidence of air entry with respiration.
The patient had multiple repeat chest x-rays checked which showed resolution of the pneumothorax.
# Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema: Also likely related to positive pressure ventilation.
# Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile and could have component from inflammatory response.
She does have a left shift with concern for aspiration on CT chest.
The patient was originally started on vancomycin, Zosyn and azithromycin for broad coverage.
