Admission Date:  [**2123-4-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-4-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-2-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 79 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH ([**Hospital1 189**]) for concern for STEMI, with right upper quadrant pain, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.
Patient was at an outpatient visit for right upper quadrant pain (patient has an elevated total bilirubin s/p stenting procedure one week prior to admission), which had been increasing over the last few days, as well as a recurrence of jaundice, which she had last had previous to her biliary stent placement.
She has a history of bile duct mass, thought to be consistent with Klatskin's tumor and is s/p stenting [**2123-4-8**].
Patient presented to the OSH ED with 10/10 chest pain that awoke her from sleep.
There is no report of dyspnea, nausea, diaphoresis, no fevers or chills.
ECG at the OSH was concerning for STEMI, with diffuse ST-segment elevations, most prominant in I, II, aVL, V3-6, and ST-segment depression in aVR.
Bedside echo showed hypokinesis with EF 55% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
ECG was significant for similar ST abnormalities, and patient complained of [**11-17**] chest pain.
Patient was taken to catheterization due to concern for STEMI.
In the catheterization lab found diffuse coronary disease (20% LMCA, 40% prox LAD, 80% mid-distal LAD, diminutive LCx, and TO mid-RCA with collaterals from left).
Patient was agitated due to groin pain on the table, venous sheath was pulled, but did not have chest pain.
Given complexity of disease that would require extensive, high-risk stenting procedural risk was deem high and given normal flow in the arteries with preserved cardiac output, it was determined that medical management was the preferable strategy while the etiology of her lactic acidosis, leukocytosis and agitation were explored.
In addition, no intervention was performed as there was no culprit lesion, and diffuse ischemia was thought secondary to underlying supply/demand mismatch in context of other medical problems.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia,  + Hypertension  2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  - Biliary mass s/p ERCP and stenting [**4-8**], suspected cholangiocarcinoma with Klatskin tumor and biliary obstruciton  - Chronic renal insufficiency   Social History: - Tobacco history: extensive former smoker, quit about six months ago - ETOH: former social drinker - Illicit drugs: none Patient is originally from [**Country **].
Sclera icteric.
No pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
III/VI holosystolic murmur at apex.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No noted crackles, wheezes or rhonchi on anterior exam.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits, no groin hematoma.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Possible gallbladder fundal adenomyomatosis without evidence for acute cholecystitis.
6-mm avascular echogenic focus in the right lobe of the liver, which most likely represents a hemangioma, but correlation with recent prior MRI is recommended, since other types of liver lesions are not completely excluded particularly if there is prior maligancy or underlying liver disease.
There are bilateral pleural effusions and the right side has increased slightly.
There is persistent moderate pulmonary edema.
A left retrocardiac opacity is present; likely due to atelectasis and pleural fluid.
Central biliary obstruction.
Uncomplicated placement of 8 French internal-external biliary drainage catheter via the right intrahepatic biliary duct under ultrasound and fluoroscopic visualization.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo female with bile duct mass s/p biliary stent placement one week ago, presents with leukocytosis and lactic acidosis with bilirubin elevation, along with diffuse ST elevations.
Pt went to cath lab and had diffuse disease with good collateral flow.
Given her tenuous condition, relatively preserved cardiac output, and no concerning lesion for acute thrombosis or plaque rupture, she was not intervened upon.
The etiology of her [**Month/Year (2) **] and elevated lactate was sepsis from cholangitis.
# Septic [**Name (NI) 21020**] Pt presented with WBC 23K with neutrophilia and bandemia, lactate [**5-14**], with elevated anion gap and bilirubin >20 with RUQ pain.
In the setting of her known cholangiocarinoma with recent stent placement, this was felt to be ascending cholangitis.
Pts  lactate continued to uptrend reaching a peak of >20 with a severe metabolic acidosis which was treated with bicarbonate.
Despite these interventions, the pt continued to decompensate with worsening organ failure and the patient went into asystole.
# Respiratory distress: patient with O2 174-->70s post-catheterization with acidotic breathing pattern.
She was intubated for worsening respiratory status and airway protection.
# ST elevations: Patient presented to OSH with chest pain, troponin elevation and diffuse ST elevations.
She was taken emergently to the catheterization lab and found to have widespread disease, thought to be chronic in nature.
This was not intervened upon given the lack of an acute culprit lesion, relatively preserved cardiac output, and the patient's septic state.
Heparin and plavix were started then held in setting of hematocrit drop and coagulopathy.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Pt with ARF with oliguria.
Most likely due to patient's sepsis.
Pt developed multiple subsequent electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia which was treated with multiple rounds of calcium gluconate, dextrose and insulin, and sodium bicarbonate.
# Diabetes mellitus: Pt was on insulin .
