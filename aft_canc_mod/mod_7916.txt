There has been decrease in the left-sided pleural effusion following the thoracentesis.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal tip ends within the brachiocephalic vein as seen on the previous CT scan.
There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
Left peripheral subcapsular fluid collection exerting mass effect resulting in mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
This appearance could reflect hematoma from injury to the liver from retraction during surgery.
While replaced left hepatic artery was ligated for the purpose of gastrectomy this is unlikely to cause significant ischemic insult given the presence of in tact portal venous supply.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
