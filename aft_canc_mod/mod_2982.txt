Admission Date:  [**2122-5-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-4-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Diovan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Fever and malaise  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy [**5-29**]  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 50155**] is a very pleasant 75 year old man with past medical history significant for MDS-RAEB2 with AML features, wegener's granulomatosis (in remission), CKD stage V on HD.
He presented to outpatient clinic today with one week of increasing fatigue, intermittent fevers, cough with brown sputum, mild frontal headache, left-sided rib pain with coughing, and anorexia.
CT chest showed marked increase in previously described areas of consolidation.
He reports chronic DOE related to anemia, he has poor PO intake but increased gas.
His rash has resolved, his lower extremity edema has resolved with hemodialysis.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - MDS RAEB-2/AML overlap initiated treatment with lenalidomide [**2122-3-5**] - Essential Thrombocytosis with Jak2V617F mutation - ANCA + Vascultitis/Wegener's granulomatosis - Stage IV CKD re: GN; treated with Cytoxan.
- Pulmonary artery hypertension - PFO/ASD with right-to-left shunting - Hyperparathyroidism s/p resection - HTN - Gout.
- Glaucoma.
- Osteopenia.
No drinking, illicits.
Family History: Father: heart disease, CVA, died from liver cancer Mother: died from heart attack in 80s   Physical Exam: .
Soft, no LADts COR:    S1 and S2, no murmurs.
tenderness over 5th ribs in mid-axillary line.
ABD:    Soft, non-tender, + spleen tip EXT:    No edema, mild atrophy.
Multiple pulmonary consolidations as described, most of them are either new or significantly increased since [**2122-3-18**].
Similar, but smaller areas of consolidation have been seen back in [**2115-9-22**].
The differential diagnosis would include recurrence of known Wegener vasculitis, in particular given the presence of areas of ground-glass surrounding the areas of consolidation that might be consistent with hemorrhage.
The septal thickening surrounding the areas of consolidation might be consistent with clearance of the hemorrhage by the lymphatic system and lymphatic engourgment.
The other consideration would include opportunistic infection such as invasive aspergillosis given the known immunosuppressed status of the patient.
Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
Asymmetric sclerosis within the medial head of the left clavicle most likely consistent with degenerative disease or arthritis or SAPHO.
Dilated pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary hypertension, unchanged since [**2122-3-18**], and slightly progressed since [**2115-9-22**] (4.5 cm).
Upper chest/lower neck calcifications, 5:19, most likely representing prior surgery and given the known parathyroid adenoma most likely related to that reason.
Progression of dominant expansile consolidative opacity since the prior CT in the left upper lobe with some residual areas that remain partly aerated, evolving substantially over two weeks, referring to radiographs.
Major differential considerations include an expansile consolidation associated with pyogenic infection or hemorrhage.
Given immunosuppresion, atypical sources of infection including fungal etiologies could also be considered.
The density is intermediate, so while hemorrhage may represent a substantial component, specific areas of hematoma are not definable.
Progression of left upper lobe opacity noted in the background of resolving mass-like opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe.
New interval moderate pericardial effusion.
Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Course on the Onc Floor: Mr [**Known lastname 50155**] was on [**2122-5-27**] admitted patient with history of Wegener's granulomatosis, MDS/AML, recently on Revlimid therapy, pancytopenia, and poor functional status, presented on  with malaise, fever, and acute on chronic changes to his chest CT with increased size and number of areas of consolidation.
Given complex history, the differential was broad, and included regular and opportunistic infections, recurrent vasculititis, malignancy, and/or hemorrhage.
His hemodialysis was continued M, W, F. On [**2122-6-4**] pt developed increasing respiratory distress, progressive CXR consolidation and had continued hemoptysis.
ICU Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 50155**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on [**2122-6-4**] for worsening respiratory status and increased oxygen requirements.
Etiology was thought to be worse underlying infectious process in lungs with some additional edema as CXR showed worse LUL infiltrate and effusions.
For his stage IV CKD secondary to WG pt was continued MWF hemodialysis.
He was making very small amounts of urine at baseline  # MDS:  Pt was transfusion dependent with ongoing thrombocytopenias and severe anemia.
He also had an older history of essential throbocytosis as well.
#Wegener's: Unclear whether patient was having a wegener's flare.
He had been in remission for WG since [**2114**], although he has advancing stage IV renal disease felt to be from WG.
On [**6-6**] a repeat CT showed large lung lesions compressing mediastinum with a large pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion, large heart thought to be due to infection vs wegeners w/ hemorrhage.
Given his thrombocytopenia, risk of bleeding and poor functional status, it was felt that a biopsy carried a high risk of morbidity and mortality.
