The following morning, he complained of polydypsia and lower extremity weakness.
He had a large loose bowel movement and asked that his mother call EMS as he was unable to rise from a seated position.
Urine was positive for Ketones.
FAST  Bedside u/s showed no pericardial effusion.
Code STEMI was called, he was evaluated by cardiology who believed that that the EKG changes can be seen with electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis and recommended giving aspirin, sending troponins and repeating the EKG.
He was then observed to have a fixed gaze to the left, he was unresponsive and given ativan 2mg IV afterwhich his level of consciousness improved only to become unresponsive.
Vitals on transfer P:95 BP:127/57 100%  Fio2 100% 500/5  Of note, he was recently treated for a cellulitis involving his right lower extremity.

Studies CXR [**2133-2-10**] No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
A small residual fragment of the third proximal phalanx is noted.
No acute fracture or dislocation is detected.
No soft tissue foreign body or air is seen.
Soft tissue swelling is seen of the distal great toe, lateral greater than medial.
No focal bony lesion is detected.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Low lung volumes with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
No evidence of bowel obstruction, perforation or pneumatosis.
Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Nonobstructing 1-mm left intrarenal calculus.
Generalized mesenteric edema and fluid surrounding the gallbladder.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Ethmoid sinus disease.
Moderate amount of fluid is seen pooling at the level of the nasopharynx.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with near-hyperdynamic systolic function.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Small right subpulmonic pleural effusion.
Left basilar atelectasis or aspiration.
Moderate post-intubation subglottic edema.
EGD [**2133-2-16**] Erythema and erosions in the lower third of the esophagus compatible with Moderate esophagitis Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus Polyps in the second part of the duodenum Granularity and erythema in the antrum compatible with Mild gastritis A lot of retained food and mucus noted in the stomach body.
(biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Repeat EGD also needed to complete visualization of whole stomach as some lesion might have been missed underneath food and mucus.
If there is an ulcer, then repeat EGD to document ulcer helaing is required because of risk of malignancy.
The findings account for the symptoms Consider Carafate slurry 1 gm QID .
[**2133-2-17**] EXERCISE STRESS TEST:SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg/min.
No anginal like symptoms or ischemic ECG changes noted during the study.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Septic Shock: In the setting of pulmonary infiltrates and possible aspriation septic shock is the most likely explanation for hypothermia, hypotension and leukocytosis.
He was treated with vancomycin and pip/tazo at first but aspiration pneumonia but later narrowed to just vancomycin when sputum grew only MRSA.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: HbA1c is 11, patient is known to have poor understanding of disease and compliance with insulin.
He had diabetic teaching and voiced good understanding of how to do insulin and check blood sugars at home.
# Myocardial ischemia: EKG on admission was remarkable for ST elevations in the precordial leads with reciprocal changes in the inferior leads.
He has never complained of chest pain.
This is unlikely to represent acute plaque rupture and is most likely due to myocardial ischemic injury from severe acidosis and hyperkalemia.
His Cardiologist did not recommend further intervention or diagnostic work-up.
# Hypercapnic respiratory failure: ABG shortly before intubation for unresponsiveness showed 6.85/35/180/7 suggesting impending hypercapnic respiratory failure likely from fatigue in the setting of respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.
# MRSA aspiration/pneumonia:  He had [**Last Name (un) **] and Left base opacity on chest xray after extubation.
His sputum grew methicillin-resistant staph aureus.
# Acute renal injury: Patient with baseline Cr 1.5-1.7 related to diabetic nephropathy.
His acute renal failure was likely related to hypovolemia, sepsis, and osmotic diuresis.
The urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal dehydration, and he was given IV resuscitation with good response.
# Stress Gastritis: By report, patient had a large dark bowel movement prior to admission.
He had an EGD in house which showed gastritis and esophagitis.
# Seizure: Patient had non-convulsive seizure in the ED and has a history of seizure when hypoglycemic.
There was no indication for antiepileptics.
He did not have any further seizures after acidosis was corrected.
INACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Diarrhea: Patient with reports of chronic diarrhea according to his father he has had loose BM after most meals for years.
# Orthostatic hypotension: Related to diabetic neuropathy.
He remained normotensive during admission after DKA resolved.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Needs f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] for his diabetes.
- Please set him up with outpatient GI follow-up to have a repeat EGD and ensure that his symptoms are resolved.
