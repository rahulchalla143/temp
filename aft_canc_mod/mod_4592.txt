No definitive acute interval change.
no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease, however, MRI is more sensitive for the detection of such lesions.
Multiple pleural-based metastases in the left lung base, one abutting the left ventricle.
If there is concern for hemodynamic abnormalities, an echocardiogram may be considered to evaluate functional mass effect on the heart.
Large infrahepatic metastasis with interval growth causing marked mass effect on adjacent structures.

# Hypotension: SBP was initially in the 80s at admission and she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management.
Etiology was thought to be volume depletion given that she responded well to fluids and her BP improved.
No source of infection was identified, however given her abdominal pain we considered cholangitis as a source, as discussed below.
She likely does have biliary tract infection, but MRCP and RUQ US were technically unable to be done, so no definitive diagnosis was made.
# Sedation - She was initially sedated at admission, thought to be due to the large amount of oxycodone she was using prior to admission for her abdominal pain.
She improved with cautious narcotic use and volume resuscitation.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Her Cr was 5.1 at admission and rapidly improved with to 0.9 prior to transfer to the floor.
As discussed above, thought to be due to volume depletion at admission.
She also had a large amount of urine released after Foley placement and it is thought that she may have had a component of urinary retention from her heavy use of narcotics.
Foley was removed and she urinated without difficulty for the remainder of her hospitalization, with post void residual on bladder scan being O.
# RUQ pain and transaminitis: Patient had an elevated direct bilirubin with transaminitis at admission.
There was some concern for cholangitis given her RUQ pain, mild fevers, and elevated direct bilirubin and she was empirically covered with Zosyn at admission.
Another potential etiology was external compression of her biliary system from her abdominal malignancy with large intraabdominal masses.
# Synovial Sarcoma - Diagnosed in [**2159**], she is s/p chemo and XRT w/ tumor recurrence, metastases and large tumor burden.
Her pain was initially controlled with a Dilaudid PCA with fair control.
Her nausea was controlled with Zofran and PRN Haldol.
Palliative care was consulted and provided recommendations for her symptoms control.
--Chronic issues--  # Asthma - Continued on home Advair and albterol.
# DM II - Was continued on a lower dose of her home Lantus as well as a Humalog sliding scale.
# Depression - Continued on home citalopram  # GERD -Continued on home omeprazole  # Code status this admission: DNR/DNI (changed from Full at admission)  --Transitional issues-- PENDING STUDIES - Blood cultures pending - RUQ US final read pending - FMLA forms filled out for patients' sons to enable them to provide care at home.
