Pt was noted to have fever to 102 and tachypnea (vent was on PS) beginning ~1 day PTA so was sent to ED (initially [**Hospital3 **] Hospital then [**Hospital1 18**] @ family request) where CXR revealed PNA.
had been at his recent baseline (A&Ox2-3) earlier today but has been more somnolent x few hours.

Progressive enlargement of a spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe, concerning for recurrent lung cancer.
Unchanged centrilobular nodules in the dependent portions of the lower lobes, consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process.
No evidence of an acute pathologic process in the abdomen on limited non-contrast evaluation.
Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.

The left kidney demonstrates no evidence of stones or mass.
End-stage hydronephrotic left kidney consistent with chronic obstruction.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Most recent wound cultures from early [**Month (only) **] grew acinetobacter, MRSA and enterobacter.
He is felt to be at high likelihood for recurrence of resistant infections and at this point, will likely require life-long abx therapy.
His wound has improved in appearance since his most recent i/d from [**3-15**].
TTE & TEE without evidence of vegetations, and optho exam without lesions.
Most recently, developed Enterobacter bactermia with last positive cultures on [**3-9**].
Respiratory Failure: Pt has severe COPD at baseline with most recent FEV1 of 40% and is also s/p lung resection.
Etiology of respiratory failure thought to be mutlifactorial, including COPD, volume overload, ventilator associated PNA, severe anxiety/agaitation, and abnormal chest wall abnormality.
He often complained of dyspnea without objective evidence of impaired oxygenation/ventilation.
Traditionally thought to have steroid depedent COPD although steroids were progressively weaned during course and at times were completely off (see below).
Of note, he does have evidence of Pseudomonas in sputum which is sensitive only to amikacin.
It has been the strategy of ID and primary team, not to initiate amikacin unless there is evidence of fevers, increased sputum production.
Finally, pt thought to have severe anxiety and agitation inhibiting progress on vent.
Pt has had gentle increase in clonopin.
As mentioned above, pt has become increasingly trach depednent and there is some doubt as to whether patient will ever become independent despite lacking objective evidence of dyspnea.
Over the past several days, he has again been able to wean off pressure support with intermittent trach collar trials.
His EF was 44% pre-CABG, but most recent echo demonstarted preserved systolic function with evidence of impaired relaxation.
CHF: Most recent echo thought c/w impaired relaxation.
HYPOTENSION: he had intermittent episodes of hypotension, as well as a known history of adrenal insufficiency.
These episodes were usually in the setting of infection and underlying adrenal insufficuency.
He was intermittently tapered down on steroids as tolerated, but then re-started on stress dose steroids in the setting of infection or surgery.
He was also started on Fludricortisone for hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which resolved with treatment.
However, by mid [**Month (only) 958**], pt's hyponatremia had resolved and pt was notably hypertensive.
Despite his family's argument's, pt showed no signs of bronchospasm off steroids and remained hemodymically stable.
Given his complex id issues and less than ideal wound healing, the primary team felt that minimizing steroids would help to improve wound healing.
He was off steroids for a large majority of week of [**3-27**] but when developed new fevers, and hypotension on [**4-2**], was restarted on hydrocortisone.
Findings are concernng for maligancy although family has requested that pt not be notified of recurrent nodule.
Family had requested head CT which was unrevealing for evidence of mets.
Family does not want to tell patient about lung nodule as he is too sick with other things.
He is currently receiving epogen and iron although iron studies c/w anemia of chronic dz.
In general, despite daughter's argument, he should NOT be transfused unless crits less than 21 or active evidence of bleeding.
