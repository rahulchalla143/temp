Admission Date:  [**2129-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-11-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydralazine / Heparin,Porcine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrafiltration Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: (History obtained from son and OSH record) 76 yo F with history of CKD recently started on hemodialysis (2 cycles as of [**7-20**]), h/o CVA x2, h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy, and recent known [**Hospital **] transferred from the OSH to the ICU for planned GI work-up; however, was in respiratory distress requiring intubation in the [**Hospital1 **] ED.
Patient reported having had at least 1 week of melena and 1 day of hematemesis on [**2129-7-15**].
At the OSH ED, she was noteded to have BRBPR and initial Hct of 25.3 from 30.5 on [**7-12**] and 34.4 on [**6-7**].
She apparently underwent an endoscopy by DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 30885**], which showed a bleeding friable large pyloric channel stalk polyp 4-5 cm as well as gastric mucosal friability.
There was concern of pneumonia vs. fluid overload.
She was placed on BiPAP then was intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress on fentanyl and propofol.
Per ED report, patient had a living will from [**2117**] with DNR/DNI, but this was discussed with patient prior to intubation, and she agreed to it.
Bedside echocardiogram showed small pericardial effusion with left sided pleural effusion.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was quickly extubated without complication on [**7-21**] after HD ultrafiltration.
Echo showed EF 50% with apical hypokinesis attributed NSTEMI during this admission although trop elevations are only modest considering renal function and CK/MB not elevated.
EKG notable for non-specific t-wave changes.
In terms of her GI bleed, she was found to have a large polyp leading to obstruction of pylorus.
Patient also noted to have bleeding [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear on EGD on Monday [**2129-7-25**], after which she had 20 cc hematemesis but has had none since and has been hemodynamically stable the entire hospitalization throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
Her course was also complicated by MSSA bacteremia and a hematoma next to her AV fistula.
Initial concern for infected fistula given mild tenderness but ultrasound ok and vascular felt it was very unlikely (no graft).
She also had thrombocytopenia and Plt 142 on presentation, that decreased to nadir of 69.
Pt arrived at the floor with no complaint of pain.
Past Medical History: (per [**Hospital **] Hospital record) - Upper GIB from bleeding large pyloric channel stalk polyp with diffuse gastric friability - Lower GIB - history of CVAs x2, was on plavix (until OSH admission.
Did not tolerate Aggrenox per OSH record) - CKD stage 4, on dialysis (2 cycles as of [**7-20**]) - h/o renal cell cancer s/p nephrectomy - HTN - HLD - Anemia of chronic disease   Social History: - lived at home with son - has 3 grown children: son [**Name (NI) **], daughter [**Name (NI) **] and another daughter - no tobacco or alcohol use per son - has been physically inactive for at least 1 year - stays at home most of the time, but has a good friend that she talks to twice a day   Family History: - father deceased at 66 with MI - mother deceased at 91 to colon cancer - 1 sister is in good health   Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T:97.1 BP:109/67 P:77 R:17 O2: 97%, CMV Vt450, PEEP 10, RR set at 18 General: intubated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: bronchial breath sounds, clear to auscultation, no w/c/r appreciated CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, soft [**2-10**] holosystolic and diastolic murmur, no rub or gallops Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS present, no guarding, no organomegaly, + old scar GU: Foley draining clear urine Ext: Cool extremities, 1+ edema to the thighs, 2+ DP and radial pulses bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis.
AAOx3 HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: breaths slightly shallow but unlabored, good air movement, no use of supplementary muscles, clear to auscultation bilaterally, no w/c/r appreciated CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rub, or gallops Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS present, no guarding, no organomegaly, + old scar Ext: Warm extremities, minimal edema to the thighs, 2+ DP and radial pulses bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette, may be due to pericardial effusion and/or cardiomyopathy, not optimally evaluated due to the bibasilar opacities.
Bilateral mid-to-lower lung opacities likely represent layering bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal/anterior/apical hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectatic lung.
- Upper extremity ultrasound ([**2129-7-22**]): Extensive soft tissue edema, without focal fluid collection.
- CXR ([**2129-7-25**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-24**], there is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
Bibasilar opacification is consistent with pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, and increased pulmonary venous pressure or pulmonary edema.
There was no evidence of bleeding from the polypectomy site.
There was no evidence of bleeding initially, however at the end of the procedure, there was a moderate amount of fresh blood seen arising from the GE junction.
The area was flushed with water vigorously, and the bleeding appeared to stop spontaneously.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo F with CKD on HD, h/o CVA, h/o RCC s/p nephroctomy presents after recently initiating hemodialysis with GI bleed transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, found to have troponin leak, also found to have profound hypothyroidism and ?MSSA bacteremia.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure.
CXR on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] most consistent with fluid overload, potentially from flash pulmonary edema in the setting of demand ischemia.
Echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Patient successfully extubated without complication.
She continued to have large pleural effusions and oxygen requirement of 3L NC on the floor.
Ultrafiltration was limited by blood pressures; because pt's blood pressures could not tolerate pulling off significant volume, she will require rehabilitation stay for period of time until enough fluid is removed to decrease oxygen requirement back to baseline.
# ?NSTEMI vs Demand Ischemia Cardiac enzymes elevated with troponin 0.22 on admission and downtrended slowly, likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed.
Echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal/anterior/apical hypokinesis.
Aspirin 81mg and Plavix 75mg were held temporarily due to the risk of reemergent GI bleed.
She was also transitioned from captopril as an inpatient to lisinopril as an outpatient as its long half-life allows for once-daily dosing.
# GI bleed.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in setting of GI bleed with known gastric polyp.
Required 1 unit of pRBC transfusion for Hct drop of ~ [**10-15**] points over the course of [**2-6**] days but no obvious melena or BRBPR.
Patient had one episode of hematemesis after EGD but stayed hemodynamically stable.
# MSSA Bacteremia/hypotension: [**2-8**] Blood cultures on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] grew Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus.
U/S of the extremity showed edema but no abscess.
Echocardiogram showed AR and MR, but there is no history of echocardiogram at PCP's office for comparison.
# Hypothyroidism Patient was found to have TSH>50, for which she was started on levothyroxine 50mcg daily.
# Thrombocytopenia.
She was noted to have an acute drop of platelets by half in the MICU since her admission to the hospital.
PPI was continued in setting of her GI bleed.
# Chronic/End-stage renal failure on Hemodialysis.
Epo was held off given the history of renal cell carcinoma.
She does have a left arm hematoma near the site of her AV fistula which has been stable and does not disrupt use of the fistula for hemodialysis.
# HTN.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 54371**], You were admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital to start hemodialysis, but there you started bleeding from your gastric polyp, so they transfered you to the [**Hospital1 18**].
Here, you were having significant difficulty breathing in the Emergency [**Hospital1 **], so you were intubated and placed on a ventilator machine for one day in the medical intensive care unit.
You also had an endoscopy in the intensive care unit during which we removed a large bleeding polyp in your stomach.
You were also found to have a tear in your esophageal mucosa, called [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, which could have also caused some of the bleeding.
