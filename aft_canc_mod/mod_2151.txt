Admission Date:  [**2122-9-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2122-10-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-8-30**]       Sex:  F  Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer with bony metastases who presents to the Oncology Service as a transfer from surgery for initiation of chemotherapy.
The patient had There were two attempted biopsies of this mass without diagnosis.
She was initially scheduled for a VATS procedure on [**9-18**], but was admitted to an outside hospital on [**9-16**] with worsening shortness of breath and severe dysphagia and a temperature to 102.0.
She was started on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin at that time for a question of a post obstructive pneumonia and was subsequently transferred mediastinoscopy.
Mediastinoscopy on [**9-21**] was positive for a small cell lung cancer.
Neurology was consulted on [**9-23**] and noted multiple cranial nerve deficits including left VIII nerve deficit causing decreased hearing, IX and X nerve deficits causing dysarthria and dysphasia and a right XII nerve deficit causing right tongue deviation.
Neurology recommended a head MRI and lumbar puncture to rule out leptomeningeal disease at that time.
MRI of the spine on [**9-25**] showed diffuse bony metastases and epidural tumor in the lower thoracic spine.
There was also the question raised of lower motor neuron disease as the patient had weakness of her arms and legs.
Neurology also raised the question of Lambert-Eaton syndrome as a paraneoplastic condition to explain the patient's intermittent dysphasia and hypophonia.
Follow up MRI of the head was negative, but was notable for some motion artifact.
The patient was found to have dysarthric speech and to have dysphagia for solids and liquids as well as to have persistent right tongue deviation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies headache, dizziness or photophobia.
She complains of some bilateral shoulder pain.
There is no cough or sputum production, but she is having difficulty clearing her oral secretions.
She has no complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or sweats.
As described right upper lobe lung mass initially noted in [**2122-7-8**] with recently diagnosed small cell lung cancer with metastases to the vertebral bodies.
History of anxiety disorder.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There is no facial droop.
Neck supple, mildly tender to palpation with no lymphadenopathy.
Normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
Lungs poor air movement with no wheezes or crackles.
Extremities there is bilateral shoulder pain to palpation.
The patient has some unspecified pain with sitting up.
Her palette elevation is asymmetric.
She shrugs her shoulders and turns her head against resistance with no obvious deficiency.
MRI of the brain on [**2122-9-25**] showed no clear evidence of intracranial mass or metastasis, but was limited by motion artifact.
MRI of the spine on [**9-25**] showed clearly diffuse bony metastatic disease and epidural tumor in the lower thoracic spine.
Pathology of [**2122-9-23**] for right paratracheal nodes positive for metastatic small cell carcinoma.
Pertinent records from the [**Hospital3 4527**] where the patient had been admitted prior to transfer for mediastinoscopy, swallowing evaluation with question of hysterical etiology, upper gastrointestinal study was negative for esophageal narrowing.
Initial chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe and medial basilar segment right lower lobe infiltrate.
Repeat chest x-ray showed some slight improvement in the pneumonia with a persistent lung mass and a small pleural effusion.
Oncology:  The patient diagnosed with small cell lung cancer with bony metastases.
She also underwent whole brain x-ray therapy for presumed leptomeningeal disease as the source of her cranial nerve deficits causing dysphagia.
A lumbar puncture was attempted on the evening of admission in order to analyze spinal fluid for evidence of leptomeningeal involvement.
As noted the MRI of the brain was negative, but MRI of the spine did show a leptomeningeal enhancement consistent with dural metastases as well as diffuse metastatic disease of the lower thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine.
MRI of the spine showed no evidence of cord compression.
The patient was noted to have some right upper and lower extremity weakness.
This was attributed to possible nerve root involvement consistent with diffuse metastases in the vertebral bodies.
The patient's depressed mental status on admission gradually cleared over the course of her hospitalization.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient exhibited dysphagia secondary to cranial nerve deficits.
Renal:  The patient was noted to have a gradually worsening hyponatremia over the course of this admission.
Urine lytes and urine osmolarity studies suggested that the patient's hyponatremia was most consistent with SIADH a not uncommon finding in the presence of small cell lung cancer.
The patient had poor urine output through much of this admission, but remained essentially euvolemic with a stable normal creatinine.
Infectious disease:  The patient completed a fifteen day course of Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for bilateral pneumonia diagnosed at the outside hospital.
Given the patient's history of dysphagia this was most likely aspiration versus a post obstructive pneumonia.
On [**2122-10-7**] approximately eight days after completing chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide, the patient spiked a fever to 100.1 while neutropenic.
Hematological:  The patient's initial hematocrit was low and iron studies revealed that the anemia was most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Platelets were also depressed following chemotherapy.
There was no active bleeding.
Pulmonary:  The patient experienced an episode of acute respiratory failure with left lung collapse following PEG tube placement on [**2122-10-5**].
Emergent bronchoscopy revealed a large mucous plug in the left lung.
The patient was extubated approximately 24 hours later and subsequently returned to the floor with no significant neurological deficits.
The patient did, however, have evidence of a persistent left lower lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
The patient will in the future require aggressive oropharyngeal suctioning, aspiration precautions as well as avoidance of all po medications until the dysphagia is resolved.
