Pt reports that he could not even walk to the bathroom or hold a long conversation without significant SOB by yesterday.
Pt has had mild cough.
CT scan showed a large presumed hemothorax on the right with air in it suggestive of loculation.
There was also a slight shift in the mediastinum.

Pt has had five weeks of right sided chest pain and lower right back pain that is worse with deep inspirations.
Pt reports that his abdomen feels "hard" to him but denies any abdominal pain.
No nausea or vomiting.

Pertinent Results: [**2130-6-9**] 07:25PM   GLUCOSE-120* UREA N-15 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-94* TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-17 [**2130-6-9**] 07:25PM   WBC-17.9* RBC-4.23* HGB-11.0* HCT-33.9* MCV-80* MCH-25.9* MCHC-32.3 RDW-14.5 [**2130-6-9**] 07:25PM   PLT COUNT-561*  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2130-6-15**] 7:54 AM FINDINGS: There has been no change in the extent of opacification of the right hemithorax and left basilar atelectasis/consolidation.
No clear pneumothorax is seen on this study.
This is most likely due to a large pleural effusion.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST [**2130-6-10**] 3:59 PM 1) No definite evidence of pulmonary embolism on this limited exam.
2) Multifocal ground glass opacity, most prominent in the basal segments of the left lower lobe, representing multifocal pneumonia vs. aspiration.
3) Irregular circumferential right pleural thickening, consistent with the patient's known history of mesothelioma.
4) Large multiloculated right pleural effusion with pockets of air, resulting in compressive atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobes.
The majority of the pleural fluid measures simple fluid.
Study Date of [**2130-6-11**]  11:29:32 PM ECG Regular narrow complex tachycardia - mechanism uncertain - consider AV nodal reentry Left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 60 y/o man with PMH significant for mesothelioma transferred from OSH for management of hemothorax who was intubated for respiratory failure  #respiratory failure - likely from combination of progressive right sided hemothorax, progreessive lung cancer and right sided atelextasis, diffuse ground glass in lungs(CHF vs pneumonia) - tried diuresis with no improvement in respiratory status, likely not CHF - The patient was treated empirically for pneumonnia with Cefepime/Vanco/Flagyl.
#right sided hemothhorax s/p thoracentesis by IP - CT chest to assess size of hemothorax post tap:complete atelectasis RML and RLL from hemothorax, ground glass opacity in LLL - Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt the patient was not a candidate for pleurodesis.
#pneumonia - Afebrile with cefepime, vanco, and flagyl.
#Mesothelioma(sarcomatoid type)-diagnosed [**4-8**] with recurrent right pleural effusion, underwent bronchoscopy, VATS and decortication iwth residula pleural thickening.
- spoke to oncologist at [**Hospital1 **] - palliative care was consulted and the patient later died of respiratory failure .
#hyponatremia - likely from SIADH - will not fluid restrict since patient has terminal disease - sent for urine lytes .
