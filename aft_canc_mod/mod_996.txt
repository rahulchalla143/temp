[**2139-8-2**] CXR: Congestive failure with pulmonary edema.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had diffuse 40 to 50% disease with 50% lesions in the upper and lower poles of a large bifurcating diagonal branch.
The LCX had a hazy ostial 90% lesion with diffuse 50% disease in the mid to dital vessel.
The RCA had diffuse 60% stenoses with distal occlusion of the PDA and PL that filled via left collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right sided pressures (mean RA 7 mmHg), severely elevated pulmonary (mean PA 45 mmHg), and mildly elevated left sided pressures (LVEDP 15 mmHg) with no gradient upon movement of the catheter from the ventricle back to the aorta and a normal cardiac index (4.8 l/min/m2).
[**2139-8-4**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M a/w SOB and CP, found to have pulmonary edema and NSTEMI.
NSTEMI: On admission patient extremely SOB on 89% on 100% NRB.
CHF/pulmonary edema: On admission patient was had significant pulmonary edema initially satting 89% on 100% NRB then briefly on BIPAP with 100% O2 sat.
He had significant improvement in his respiratory status within 24 hours with improvement in pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and was satting 95 % on RA by discharge.
Renal: On admission creatinine was 10.3 indicative of ARF on CRF likely secondary to myeloma.
DM II: Fingersticks well controlled on RISS.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ESRD now on hemodialysis CAD s/p stent to LCX, EF50% Diabetes Mellitus Type II Chronic anemia Multiple Myeloma Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Gout   Discharge Condition: chest pain free, no shortness of breath, hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or any other concerning symptoms call you doctor or go to the emergency room.
