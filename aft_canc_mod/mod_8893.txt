There is no pain associated with her hemorrhoids.
At the same time, she has noticed worsened abdominal distension and her clothes no longer fit.
She denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Yesterday, she had a fever of 100F with some sweats, but has not noticed any fevers since.
She was also complaining of reflux symptoms over the past three days for which she had been taking an over the counter anti-acid.
A CT of her abdomen/pelvis with contrast was notable for a thickened colonic wall consistent with colitis and a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis/paracolic gutters.
She looks comfortable with no abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting.
She does feel somewhat lightheaded, but no chest pain or SOB.
Past Medical History: Hemorrhoids Depression  (hx of SI, insomnia) ETOH abuse, in remission (last drink > 1 year ago, last heavy use approximately 4 years ago) anemia secondary to folate deficiency asthma Hyperthyroidism s/p ablation, now hypothyroid HTN Low back pain secondary to DJD s/p tubal ligation s/p fibroidectomy   Social History: unemployed, social support from mother but serious financial limitations - Tobacco: 1 pack/day for 20 years - Alcohol:  former alcohol abuse (up to [**1-3**] pink whisky/night), quit using alcohol last year, reports much less alcohol over the past four years - Illicits: none   Family History: Diabetes mellitus and cancer in members.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98 BP:129/88 P:99 R:20 O2:100%(RA) General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: +BS, very distended, liver edge 4cm below costophrenic margin, tympanic to percussion, no tenderness to palpation GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, no edema  Discharge Physical Exam: All vital signs stable and within normal limits.
Mild jaundice.
Abdominal exam notable for significantly diminished distension after U/S guided paracentesis.
Abdomen nontender and liver edge no appreciated.
Otherwise exam notable for no asterixis.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Poor R wave progression with low QRS voltage in the precordial leads and the limb leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-8-9**] the QRS voltage has decreased and there is poor R wave progression.
Heterogeneously enhancing liver with a gastroesophageal varix and ascites; consider an acute inflammatory process of the liver.
Thickened right colonic wall, with lesser thickening of the left colon wall and transverse colon sparing; this finding may be nonspecific in the setting of ascites; another consideration is colitis (infectious versus inflammatory etiologies).
Heterogeneous liver with patchy areas of increased echogenicity, finding suggestive of steatosis or possibly acute inflammation.
No definite hepatic lesion is identified.
Diffuse gallbladder wall edema, likely secondary to edema and/or underlying liver disease.
No signs of acute cholecystitis.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Moderate ascites, largest pocket in the right lower quadrant.
Brief Hospital Course: 47F with PMH of chronic depression, hypothyroidism, and alcohol abuse presenting with hematochezia and abdominal distension and signs of acute liver injury with secondary portal hypertension/ascites.
1) Portal hypertension complicated by ascites due to acute or chronic hepatitis:  Pt presented with thromobocytopenia, increased transaminases with AST>ALT, elevated bilirubin, and elevated INR that did not normalize with vitamin K.  She also had ascites that was eventually revealed to have a SAAG of 1.3 suggestive of being due to portal hypertension.
Imaging revealed heterogeneous liver.
Possible patient has chronic portal hypertension due to cirrhosis (most likely due to previous alcohol abuse) but imaging not strictly typical and though SAAG met criteria for being due to portal hypertension ascites albumin was relatively high.
Other possibility would be an acute hepatitis causing acute portal hypertension.
Extensive work up for causes of liver disease was unremarkable except for positive low titre anti-smooth antibody but with negative [**Doctor First Name **].
She remained with an elevated bili, INR, and low platelets suggesting chronic cirrhosis but given she was otherwise stable she was discharged to follow up in liver clinic for further management and work up.
She was cautioned about other manifestations of decompensated cirrhosis (i.e.
encephalopathy) and warned to have a low threshold to seek medical care.
2) Hematochezia: On presentation patient had bright red blood per rectum with major concern being for a hemorrhoidal bleed vs diverticular bleed vs bleeding from colitis (as CT seemed to suggest inflammation).
Never had large volume of blood and never with dark blood suggesting more likely from a lower GI source.
Upper and lower endoscopy failed to reveal a clear source of bleeding though there were hemorrhoids, which could certainly explain blood that was seen.
Fevers: Pt reported low grade fevers prior to presentation.
ED CT scan concerning for colitis so she was started on cipro/metronidazole though never febrile here.
Colonoscopy did not show any colitis and C diff negative so metronidazole stopped.
SBP was also entertained as a source of fever but by time of paracentesis (deferred due to bedside procedure being technically infeasible and the deferred for endoscopies) she had received four days of antibiotics.
No prophylaxis was started as diagnosis never confirmed and seemed unlikely.
Patient has hx of anemia from folate deficiency.
Hct on presentation at 24.5 likely reflects baseline anemia with component of GI bleeding.
Labs suggested no current deficiencies.
Possible some degree of sequestration due to portal hypertension.
TSH 33 suggestive of very poor adherence.
pt with significant history of depression and had not been taking meds regularly.
7) Poor adherence: Discussed with social work and largely due to very limited income and large debts for housing.
Patient discussed and reassured her that the infrastructure at [**Hospital **] Clinic where she plans to be seen should be very helpful in working with financial issues and helping to make sure she does not miss care.
Transitional Issues: -Pt will follow up with PCP to assess for signs of dehydration, tolerance of daily furosemide regime -Pt will follow up with PCP and liver to assess resolution of ascites -Pt will follow up with liver to discuss further work up of liver disease, trend labs, and discuss need for biopsy -Pt will follow up with PCP to recheck anemia and trend as well as platelet count -Final ascites culture results and serum ceruloplasmin pending at time of discharge.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 4. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Acute decompensated cirrhosis complicated by ascites Acute GI bleed (source unclear)  Secondary Diagnoses: Depression Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with GI bleeding and swelling of your abdomen.
Nevertheless, the bleeding resolved on its own and it is likely a slow source so GI feels it can be worked up as an outpatient.
Finally, you have been started on a diuretic called furosemide (lasix) to help you get rid of excess fluid on the body.
