She originallypresented with tumor in the pancreatic head and during the Whipple operation she had an atypical neck margin which was cutback farther on the body of the pancreas.
Both the frozen section and the final margin on the second excision was negative for malignancy.
However, interestingly she comes back at this point in time with evidence of another tumor in the pancreatic remnant just at the pancreaticojejunal site.
This is causing duct obstruction downstream and clear-cut pancreatitis.
It is assumed that this is residual microscopic disease that was unrecognized at the first operation which has blossomed at the site of the pancreaticojejunostomy.
The rest of her workup was completely negative for metastatic disease and the tumor appeared as if it was resectable on the CAT scan in terms of the vascular involvement.

With the help of the pain service she was managed with Ketamine and a Dilaudid PCA post op.
From a surgical standpoint her wound was healing well without evidence of erythema or drainage.
The recommendations from the pain service include continuing the Fentanyl patch at 25 mcg/hr for 2 weeks post discharge and then decreasing to 12 mcg/hr for 2 weeks.
At that time she should be managed with oral narcotics for pain control.
After an uneventful post operative stay she was discharged home with VNA services for diabetic teaching and insulin administration and she will follow up with her PCP for further pain medication adjustment.
