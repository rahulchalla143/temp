On [**2194-10-26**], he underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis for a large left pleural effusion for which cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19205**] course was complicated by atrial fibrillation the night of his admission (HR as high as 160s bpm) which forestalled his bronchoscopy.
the decision by the consulting team was for rate control given his history of ablation for atrial flutter.
Also, given his history of hemoptysis and current disease, no anticoagulation and only aspirin was deemed appropriate currently.
As his WBC was elevated during his stay and at discharge, a CBC with differential is to be drawn on [**2194-11-3**] and the result paged to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Fellow-Interventional Pulmonology): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9986**], pager [**Numeric Identifier 34656**].
