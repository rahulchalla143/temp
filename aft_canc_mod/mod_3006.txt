EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Neurologically intact, however gait was not assessed  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2126-6-1**] 02:10PM   PT-23.5* PTT-25.6 INR(PT)-2.2* [**2126-6-1**] 02:10PM   WBC-7.6 RBC-4.44# HGB-13.7# HCT-41.7# MCV-94 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.0 RDW-13.7 [**2126-6-1**] 02:10PM   GLUCOSE-93 UREA N-18 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-16  LABS ON DISCHARGE: [**2126-6-17**] 07:55AM BLOOD WBC-7.1 RBC-2.92* Hgb-9.2* Hct-28.0* MCV-96 MCH-31.6 MCHC-33.0 RDW-15.1 Plt Ct-192 [**2126-6-1**] 02:10PM BLOOD Neuts-81.2* Lymphs-11.6* Monos-4.9 Eos-1.8 Baso-0.4 [**2126-6-14**] 10:09AM BLOOD Fibrino-260# [**2126-6-17**] 07:55AM BLOOD Glucose-95 UreaN-13 Creat-0.5 Na-135 K-4.6 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-11 [**2126-6-2**] 05:25PM BLOOD ALT-8 AST-17 LD(LDH)-203 AlkPhos-76 TotBili-0.4 [**2126-6-17**] 07:55AM BLOOD Calcium-8.6 Phos-3.4 Mg-2.0 [**2126-6-12**] 04:26PM BLOOD Osmolal-279  IMAGING: MRI +/- [**6-1**]: Two large heterogeneous lesions in the cerebellar hemispheres, with moderate surrounding edema and mass effect on the fourth ventricle with moderate dilation of the lateral and third ventricles related to obstruction.
These represent metastatic lesions.
Recommend neurosurgical consult.
CTA [**6-3**]: There are some prominent veins along the superior margin of the cerebellar lesions, particularly on the left.
No large arterial supply is noted.
There is no high-grade stenosis or aneurysm within the vasculature.There is no AV shunting.
The cerebellar lesions do not appear to be hypervascular with some prominent veins along the superior surface of the lesion, particularly on the left.
NCHCT [**6-5**] Post Op Postoperative changes related to cerebellar mass.
Minimal hemorrhage in the surgical bed  NCHCT [**6-6**]: 1.
Post-surgical changes status post bilateral suboccipital craniotomy and mass resection with edema surrounding the surgical bed causing mild interval increase in mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Small amount of hemorrhage and air noted in the surgical bed.
Post-surgical changes status post bilateral suboccipital craniotomy and mass resection with hazy nodular enhancement lateral to the left cerebellar surgical resection cavity which may be secondary to postoperative changes; however, recurrent or residual neoplasm cannot be entirely excluded.
No significant interval change in positioning of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the third ventricle with interval collapse of the right lateral ventricle.
Diffusion abnormality surrounding the surgical resection bed which is thicker than the thin peripheral rim of enhancement.
This most likely represents simple hemorrhage within the post-operative site or post-operative diffusion slowing secondary to the recent surgery.
This less likely represents neolasm considering that the original tumor did not demonstrate decreased diffusion.
She was initiated on treatment with decadron 4mg q6 hours for edema and monitored with q 4 neuro checks.
Hematology oncology was consulted who were in agreement that cerebellar lesions require surgical decompression prior to radiation therapy.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2126-6-5**] for a bilateral suboccipital craniotomy for mass resection.
Post-operatively she was kept intubated because of the potential fluid shifting.
A CT of the head was done immediatley post-op, which showed persistent and marginally worse vasogenic edema abutting the brain stem.
Surgery was without complication and she was transferred to the 11th floor.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezes.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezes.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
If there is any concern about the wound please call have them call our office for a wound check.
