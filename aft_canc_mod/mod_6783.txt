There is incomplete opacification of the left biliary ductal system.
and opacification of the biliary tree with contrast.
Common bile duct brushings  SUSPICIOUS for adenocarcinoma.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is noted.
An ill-defined infiltrating mass at the level of the hepatic hilum along the region of the left hepatic duct is again seen.
There is minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Overall, no significant interval change is evident.
Relative hyperemia of the gall bladder fossa probably reflects ongoing inflammation and the primary hepatic arterial supply to the liver in the setting of portal vein thrombosis.
The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear unremarkable.
The gall bladder is mildly distended, as before.
A small amount of perihepatic free fluid is noted.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes although scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes are evident.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A moderate amount of free fluid is present within the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are noted.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Unchanged ill-defined mass centered within the porta hepatis compared to the CT of six days prior.
Minimal associated intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Left portal vein involvement with thrombosis is unchanged.
Stable mild dilatation of the gallbladder.
No wall edema, or pericholecystic fluid is present.
Small right pleural effusion.
Brushings were taken for cytology, which eventually returned positive for adenocarcinoma.
She was noted to have chronic portal vein thrombosis on her CT scan, which was also noted on a prior admission.
Palliative care was consulted for management of her pain, and started her on oxycodone standing, with prns.
This appeared to work well for pain control.
