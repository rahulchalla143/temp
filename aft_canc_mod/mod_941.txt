# Portal Vein Thrombosis (main, left, right):  Given the patient's history of a lung mass on CT at an outside hospital, malignancy was initially of great concern although hypercoaguable diseases, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis were also considered.
The patient was started on a heparin drip on HD 2 after an endoscopy confirmed no active bleeding.
A CEA was elevated concerning for malignancy.
# Acute Renal Failure / Chronic Kidney.
The patient's acute renal failure was likely oliguric ATN with a FeNa of 1.7,  The etiology may have been due to pre-renal ATN from intravascular depletion and underperfusion of the kidney.
The patient was in metabolic acidosis, with elevated K+.
Afternoon labs on HD3 revealed elevated potassium and worsening creatinine.
The patient was given an 80mg bolus of lasix with low urine output.
An EKG demonstrated no change, no evidence of high k+.
# Metablic Acidosis, Respiratory acidosis: The patient presented with uncompensated mild lactic acidosis with concommitant respiratory acidosis.
On HD 3, afternoon labs revealed worsening renal function.
The patient developed agitation in the afternoon which was thought to be secondary to receiving ativan and morphine for a CT scan as the onset coincided.
He was called by nursing becuase of episodes of diaphoresis and agitation upon awakening that disappeared upon sleeping.
An EKG revealed no evidence of acute MI or elevated k+.
The patient was evaluated, vital signs were normal, (RR, HR and BP within normal limits) and stable and the patient was afebrile and continued to refuse medical care.
At this time, the patient developed deep breathing and worsening diaphoresis.
Repeat labs and an ABG revealed marked lactic acidosis with a pH of 7.1.
The patient developed hypotension to systolic 40s and became transiently unresponsive.
5L of normal saline were administered with levophed for pressure support.
The patient developed bradycardia and ventricular fibrillation before passing.
# Malignancy: A CT from [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] showed potential 15mm lesion in R lobe of liver; 10mm lesion in L lobe of liver.
However, CEA can also be raised in cirrhosis or pancreatitis.
A CT chest abdomen and pelvis was performed without contrast (the patient has renal failure) on HD 3 to evaluate interval change of prior masses and evaluation of possible new masses.
Preliminary read of the CT showed masses in the liver, lungs and mediastinum.
The patient expressed wishes to not have dialysis, chemotherapy or non-curative surgery.
# Hypoxemia.
?s hypoxemia is likely multifactorial: likely a combination of volume overload, pulmonary vascular shunting from liver thrombi, restrictive due to increased intraabdominal pressure w/ ascites, restrictive due to obesity, underlying pulmonary disease from chronic smoking.
As hypoxia worsened over the patient's first night, there was concern for a PE, given patient's hypercoagulable condition.
The patient was being treated for portal venous thrombosis with heparin drip, which is the treatment for PE.
A TTE revealed no evidence of transpulmonary shunting or PFO or ASD.
There was mild left vetricular hypertrophy, a bicuspid valve and moderate pulmonary hypertension noted.
# Spontaneous Bowel Perforation: A diagnostic paracentesis was postive for SBP although the patient demonstrated no clinical signs of encephalopathy or fever.
# Anxiety / pain: The patient's anxiety and pain were treated with IV morphine and ativan.
# HTN.
# Bloody NG lavage at end of procedure.
Etiology unclear, at first there was concern for varcieal bleeding.
Endoscopy revealed no variceal bleeding and octreotide was discontined and ppi was changed to PO.
# Bright Red Blood per Rectum:   Likely due to external hemorrhoids.
