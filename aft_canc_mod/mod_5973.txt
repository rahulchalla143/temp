Admission Date:  [**2171-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-7-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-11-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R IJ central line PICC line placed for long term IV access for intravenous antibiotics.
Cholecystostomy tube placed by radiology Foley catheter  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 99500**] is a 62 year old gentleman with history of multiple sclerosis, [**Known lastname 862**] disorder, dementia, and chronic indwelling foley with recurrent UTIs (including ESBL klebsiella) presented from his nursing home with altered mental status.
In communication with his PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], the patient's baseline mental status is alert and talkative(occasionally rambling), but he became lethargic and somnolent beginning the day prior to admission at the nursing home.
He reportedly had a U/A and culture sent 3 days prior to admission which revealed VRE (reportedly only sensitive to macrodantin) and proteus.
He was noted to have abdominal discomfort and suprapubic fullness.
Labs demonstrated WBC count of 27 with 16% bandemia and an elevated lactate to 10.5 which decreased to 8.6 with IV fluids.
A CT abd/pelvis was obtained to rule out bowel ischemia and surgery was consulted.
CT abd/pelvis did not reveal ischemia of the gut, but did note thickening of perirectal and sigmoid wall believed consistent with chronic laxative use vs. infectious/inflammatory etiology.
A CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity thought to represent atelectasis vs. consolidation.
Given his altered mental status, a head CT was obtained which was negative for hemorrhage and mass effect.
ROS: Unable to obtain secondary to altered mental status.

[**2171-6-26**] 3:49 am STOOL FECAL CULTURE (Pending): CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2171-6-28**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2171-6-26**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No significant change compared to CT of [**2171-5-12**] with multiple chronic findings as described above.
Soft tissue density material within the external auditory canals bilaterally, most likely cerumen.
Marked gastric distention.
Suggestion of markedly distended bladder.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-25**]: Detailed evaluation of the intra-abdominal and pelvic organs is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration and artifact secondary to patient arm positioning.
No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic pathology.
Infectious proctitis and inflammatory bowel disease also remain in the differential diagnosis.
If abdominal symptoms persist, consider follow up exam with oral and IV contrast.
Mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
Small bladder diverticulum.
Diffuse osteopenia with contiguous compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine as described above of, age indeterminate, but overall chronic in appearance.
Right femoral head subchondral sclerotic line could represent a stress fracture versus early avascular necrosis.
Right internal jugular central venous line tip likely terminates in the cavo-atrial junction.
Increased left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
Bibasilar atelectasis and possible small effusion.
No vascular congestion and I doubt the presence of consolidations.
Allowing for technical differences, there is little change from exam 24 hours ago, including the IJ line placement.
Sinus tachycardia.
Diffuse T wave flattening which is non-specific.
Compared to tracing of [**2171-5-12**] significant sinus tachycardia is new.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 132 118 92 322/400 56 56 57 EKG [**6-25**] 12:29 pm: Sinus tachycardia with slight ST segment elevations in leads I and aVL.
New T wave inversion in leads V1-V4 with ST-T wave flattening in leads V5-V6.
These findings are consistent with acute anterolateral ischemic process.
These images show no abnormal foci of tracer accumulation.
The above findings are consistent with no radiologic evidence of any fever focus.
However, the sensitivity of the study for detection of occult infection is decreased by prolonged antibiotic use.
IMPRESSION: No radiologic evidence of any focal fever source with limitations as noted above.
Subsegmental atelectasis in the left mid lung is unchanged since [**7-16**], new since [**7-8**].
No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusion may be present.
Several old healed rib fractures on the right lower inferior rib cage.

The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach and abdominal portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable.
A small, 3-mm low-attenuation lesion within the mid pole of the left kidney is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple renal cyst (2:59).
There are a few, sub 5-mm low-attenuation lesions within the right kidney which are also too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes identified.
There are few prominent mesenteric lymph nodes present.

Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Worsening bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are present, probably related to atelectasis, although underlying infectious process is not excluded.
Small pleural effusions, right greater than left, are not substantially changed.
MRI L, T spine - IMPRESSION: No evidence of spondylodiscitis or epidural or paraspinal abscesses of the thoracolumbar spine.
Partially imaged are degenerative changes of the cervical spine with likely mild-to-moderate canal stenosis at the C3/4 and C4/5 levels.
Large right pleural effusion.
Five views of the upper and lower femur show no abnormality of the femoral head, neck, trochanteric region are normal.
There is some demineralization of the mid shaft and heterogeneous mineralization of the condyles of the femur and possibly tibial plateau.

**FINAL REPORT [**2171-7-24**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2171-7-24**]):    No significant growth.
Brief Hospital Course: #Urosepsis - ICU course: On presentation the patient met criteria for SIRS and sepsis: WBC of 27, tachycardic and a source of infection, thought to be most likely urosepsis given frank pus drainage from the bladder, history of recurrent infections and his foley found to be obstructed.
He has also had multiple wound swabs that revealed MRSA and pseudomonas, thus, it was thought also reasonable to initially cover for MRSA.
His wounds, however, do not appear to be infected and were thought unlikely to be a contributing source of sepsis.
The CT of the abdomen did not appear consistent with bowel ischemia, but the patient was initially started on flagyl given colonic thickening.
A cortisol stimulation test was negative for adrenal suppression.
However he started having fevers again and hence flagyl was restarted.
Multiple tests done to identify source of infection - MRI spine - no abscess or osteomyelitis, ECHO no IE.
no C diff.
ID was consulted and CT abd, HIDA done that confirmed acute cholecystitis.
Patient finally remained afebrile for > 4 days prior to discharge.
Patient advised a follow up appointment with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4020**] from infectious disease in 2 weeks as well as on [**2171-7-26**] - patient should get a CBC, chem 7 for monitoring and results to be faxed as stated below to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4020**] who will check the results.
Acute retention of urine was resolved after foley was placed.
Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine is 0.4-0.9.
Initial bump in creatinine most likely was secondary to obstruction, but also given hemoconcentration and response to fluids, appeared to be prerenal as well.
Given frank pus from bladder, ascending b/l pyelo was a concern, but CT A/P, albeit without contrast, did not show evidence of this.
Creatinine back to baseline 2-3 days after initiation of volume resuscitation.
Coagulopathy: INR was elevated to 1.5, then 2.2 in the absence of blood thinning agents.
Given his poor nutritional status, may be a result of vit K deficiency, but certainly was concerning in the setting of sepsis.
# EKG changes: T wave inversions in septal leads most likely reflected lead placement, but new from most recent EKG.
Ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, cardiac ischemia was unlikely.
No events were seen on tele during the ICU stay.
Patient remained CP free.
# Elevated LFTs: Initially the process could be related to the sepsis.
However, later he did have acute cholecystitis refer above.
# Pancreatitis attributed to Ileus from MS - developed slight elevation of lipase in setting of ileus attributed to MS.  Made NPO for two days.
Repeat CT abdomen without evidence of pancreatitis, but GB distension and edema with stones.
Diagnosed with cholecystitis as above.
No acute mech bowel obstruction was noted.
# Facial rash consistent with fungal infection - stated miconazole cream.
# Noted anemia and thrombocytosis both of which were stable at discharge.
PO QAM (once a day (in the morning)) as needed for constipation.
