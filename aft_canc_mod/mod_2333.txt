# Recurrent venous thromboembolic disease: The patient had thrombus formation in his Left Internal Jugular, Left Subclavian, Right Common Femoral, and Left Internal Iliac veins.
The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolisms for which he had been on Lovenox 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] (1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]) for months.
He had a left upper extremity PICC line, which was pulled on admission.
His CT Head was negative for obvious brain metastases, so he was started on a Heparin drip, then bridged to Lovenox 120 mg [**Hospital1 **], as one study has shown that a 20-25% increase in dose may prevent future recurrences in patients with LMWH failure.
# Fever: Initially concerning for septic thrombophlebitis; however, admission cultures were negative, and his fever curve trended down as his pain from the clots improved.
His PICC catheter tip was cultured and had no growth.
We believe his fevers were likely secondary to his clots and tumors.
He was afebrile >24 hours prior to discharge.
-F/U pending cultures .
# Leukocytosis: Chronic, and likely secondary to his underlying malignancy.
He had no localizing signs or symptoms of infection, and his culture data was negative.
