Admission Date:  [**2142-9-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-10-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: PLASTIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7733**] Chief Complaint: facial lesion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2142-9-5**] 1.
Partial maxillectomy.
Re-excision of right facial eccrine carcinoma.
Debridement of nonviable tissue right cheek.
Debridement and delayed primary closure of partial wound     dehiscence right cheek.
There is no history of loss of sensation or facial symmetry.
A biopsy of this lesion revealed a basal cell carcinoma.
These apparently demonstrate a large Right facial mass which involves the cheek region down to at least the periosteum of the maxillary bone.
The tumor invades the Right lateral nasal dorsum and extends into the upper lip.
Past Medical History: bilateral wrist fracture for which he underwent external fixation.
Physical Exam: Prior to admission: A subcutaneous mass involving the Right mid and medial cheek is apparent.
The tumor extends up to almost the orbital rim and out laterally to the base of the nasal labial fold.
There was no palpable adenopathy noted in the head and neck region.
Similarly in the parotid and facial lymph node chains, no lymphadenopathy could be appreciated.
The oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharyngeal regions were all without evidence of disease.
Right peri-orbital soft tissue margin (A):  Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle, no malignancy identified.
Right infra-orbital nerve margin (B):  Peripheral nerve and adjacent fibrous tissue, no malignancy identified.
Right cheek, partial maxillectomy/ rhinectomy (C - R):  Infiltrating carcinoma with mixed basaloid, eccrine and adenoid cystic features (2.5 cm), no epidermal origin is identified in the sections taken.
Tumor invades subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle and shows perineural invasion.
Tumor extends to 0.25 mm of the posterior/deep soft tissue margin (C), and to 0.7 mm of the inferior soft tissue margin (N).
Keratinized squamous mucosa with focal fibrosis, ?
Sections showing the carcinoma with relation to the maxillary bone and sections of the bony resection margins are being decalcified.
The bulk of the tumor is in the deep dermis, and no epidermal or salivary gland origin is seen in multiple sections and levels (we do not have reviewed the original biopsy sections).
The stain for CK7 is strongly positive in small areas of the tumor, but completely negative in the majority of the tumor.
These immunoperoxidase findings are consistent with the above diagnosis.
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is as follows: "right peri-orbital soft tissue margin: negative for carcinoma."
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is "right infra-orbital nerve margin: no carcinoma seen."
It consists of a segment of skin with attached subcutaneous soft tissue, mucosa and bone measuring 6.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm overall.
The specimen is oriented with three sutures as follows: looped suture = midline columella, short suture = superior nasal lacrimal region, and the long suture = lateral.
There are additionally two areas of hemorrhage located superiorly to the erosion, measuring approximately 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a multilobulated mass measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm.
The specimen is represented as follows: C = mass at posterior/deep soft tissue margin, D = inferior bony margin, E = medial bony margin, F = superior bony margin, G = lateral bony margin, H = inferior soft tissue mucosa and skin margin, I = superior mucosal margin, J = medial mucosal margin, K = lateral mucosal margin, L = mucosa with erosion, M = mass with superior skin and soft tissue margin, N = inferior soft tissue margin, O = lateral skin and soft tissue margin, P = mass with posterior soft tissue margin, Q = mass in relation to skin, R = medial skin and soft tissue margin.
"Re-excision of lateral posterior inferior margin of right facial carcinoma,"(A-F):  -No malignancy identified, extensive reactive changes; status post excision (S08-[**Numeric Identifier 80370**]).
Right cheek, resection margin (G-H):  -No malignancy identified, extensive reactive changes; status post excision (S08-[**Numeric Identifier 80370**]).
Clinical:   Re-excision of lateral posterior inferior margin of right facial carcinoma.
Part one is additionally labeled "re-excision of lateral posterior-inferior margin of right facial carcinoma," and it consists of an oriented excision of skin with attached soft tissue measuring 8 x 1 x 4.0 cm.
The surgeon placed a long suture midway along the lateral aspect of the specimen to indicate the transition point from superior to inferior deep margins.
The anterior aspect of the specimen shows the previous surgical cavity has no gross evidence of tumor or necrosis.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/dif  SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: submandibular gland, submandibular lymph node.
Submandibular gland, right (A-H):  Salivary gland with no carcinoma identified.
Lymph node, submandibular (I):  One lymph node with no malignancy identified and adjacent soft tissue.
Acute inflammation.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "submandibular gland, rule out adenocystic carcinoma."
It consists of a submandibular gland weighing 9 grams and measuring 4.6 x 2.7 x 0.7 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal tan red cut surface with no discrete lesions identified.
Due to postive margins in the lateral inferior and posterior regions of the specimen that were less than a millimeter, he underwent reexcision on [**9-10**].
On the fourth or fifth postoperative day signs of demarcation on the upper 4 or 5 cm of the cheek flap occurred.
Debridement of nonviable tissue right cheek.
The patient had a partial wound breakdown in the medial canthal region probably from drainage from the underlying maxillary sinus.
He has had a trumpet in the right side of the nose which may have blocked much of the drainage from the sinus into the nose.
A second area to be closed was in the right lower cheek where he also had some partial wound dehiscence.
Here, we explored him for a possible orocutaneous fistula which was not present.
