In the context of this the patient had developed increased difficulty walking as well as swallowing.
Voice inaudible due to tracheostomy.

Expected post-surgical changes in the left posterior fossa consistent with resection of fourth ventricular mass.
LENIS [**11-25**]: No evidence of DVT.
No pulmonary embolism.
Patchy bilateral peribronchial airspace opacities, predominantly in a bibasilar distribution, but also seen in the right middle, right upper lobes,and in the lingula.
Although a portion of this opacity could relate to atelectasis, the possibility of aspiration or infection should also be considered.
Marked diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver, with probable areas of focal fatty sparing.
A 1.4 cm right adrenal nodule.
Head CT [**11-26**]: PFI: Acute hemorrhage in the region of fourth ventricle mass resection with resultant significant hydrocephalus.
There is concern for developing tonsillar herniation which is not well evaluated on this particular study.
2.1 x 1.1 cm area of enhancement in the region of the fourth ventricle, which may represent post-surgical changes vs. tumor.
Scattered areas of microcalcifications/microhemorrhages or cavernomas as described, most of which are unchanged compared to the [**2186-1-15**].
A few new foci may again represent microcalcifications or microhemorrhages or related to the presence of air.
No new lesions noted.
The previously described right frontal lobe lesion,  on [**2186-1-15**] does not have restricted diffusion or enhancement on the present study.
This may represent a non-neoplastic etiology.
However, there has been interval virtual-complete resolution of the predominantly triangular acute hemorrhage at the tumor resection bed, with significantly less effacement of the dorsal aspect of the fourth ventricle and some improvement in the ventricular dilatation, indicative of improvement in degree of obstructive hydrocephalus.
Persistent small amount of hemorrhage layers dependently in the occipital horns and atria of both lateral ventricles, with no new hemorrhage seen.
The remainder of the examination including chronic microvascular infarction in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter, with bilateral basal ganglia chronic lacunes, as well as predominantly left parietovertex scalp subgaleal hematoma, is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: 1.Status post recent suboccipital craniectomy with resolving post-surgical changes, including hematoma at the tumor resection bed and slight improvement in the findings of obstructive hydrocephalus.
However, as suggested previously, there may be residual tumor at the caudal aspect of the fourth ventricle.
2.Persistent small amount of blood layering in bilateral lateral ventricular occipital horns.
Chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction (as on FLAIR sequence from recent [**2186-11-25**] MR study), but no evidence of significant cerebellar or cerebral edema.
Left parietovertex scalp subgaleal hematoma, as before.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was electively admitted on [**11-24**] for planned suboccipital crani for mass resection.
Post-operativley he was monitored for 24hrs with ICU level care with aggressive SBP managment and monitoring.
On POD#1 he was found to be tachycardic, and evaluated for lower extremity venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus; both of which were negative for an acute process.
On [**11-25**], he was found to be in acute respiratory distress, likely secondary to his tachycardia.
Though the patient had a prior history of third ventriculostomy, he had an EVD placed to exclude elevated intracranial pressure as the cause of his deterioration.
The patient remained extremely tachycardic and required a tremendous amount of Diltiazam to control his heart rate.
He remained respiratorily stable until [**11-30**] when he suffered an episode of desaturation to the 80s.
Because of the prolonged intubation and the findings of PNA, the patient underwent trach and PEG placement.
No nausea or vomiting to report.
