ICU COURSE - She was admitted to the ICU for CVVH in the setting of a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis and an arterial pH of 7.57.
MULTIPLE MYELOMA - Patient was started on cytoxan (1.2 g/m2)and prednisone (total of 80mg) on [**10-7**].
Her IgG on admission was 7208 and trended down with pheresis and stayed down after stopping it on [**10-13**].
RENAL FAILURE - Patient had myeloma kidney with possible RTA associated with myeloma.
Patient recovered her renal function and now has been on creatinine of 1.3.
LIVER DYSFUNCTION / LIVER MASSES - Patient with HCV serology positive at OSH, but negative here and negative viral load.
Most likely was a false positive due to high IgG.
Patient had transjugular liver biospy on [**10-14**], which showed infiltration of Myeloma to the liver.
COAGULOPATHY - Patient had low platelets, high INR and low fibrinogen on admition, which were thought to be due to liver dysfunction.
Patient discharged with normal INR, PLT and PTT without any evidence of bleeding and stable HCT.
TRIPLE ACID-BASE DISORDER - Thought due to fluid overload and renal failure.
MSSA bacteremia may have worsened the disorder.
HYPONATREMIA - Patient admitted with hyponatremia thought due to nausea and decreased PO intake with diuretics at OSH.
HYPERTENSION - Triamterene/Hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg at home.
DIABETES - Regular insulin sliding scale.
Naphazoline-Pheniramine 0.025-0.3 % Drops Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic QID (4 times a day) as needed for eye irritation.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Multiple Myeloma with liver infiltration Acute Renal Failure  Secondary Diagnosis Diabetes mellitus with baseline renal insufficiency (baseline 1.2) Hypertension s/p Hysterectomy Peripheral neuropathy Metal plate in foot   Discharge Condition: Stable, breathing comfortably on room air, walking, eating, with baseline kidney function.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen at the [**Hospital1 18**] for multiple myeloma with acute renal failure and multiple liver masses.
You had USG, and MRI of your liver, which showed multiple masses and were inconclusive, so we had to perform a transjugular liver biopsy (through the neck), which showed infiltration of the myeloma to your liver.
For your myeloma you received cytoxan and prednisone upon admision.
