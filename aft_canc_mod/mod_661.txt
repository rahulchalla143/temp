He has had intermittant abdominal pain for the past 4-5 years for which he stops eating for a day or two and then it goes away.
Approximately 3 weeks ago, however, he developed a different kind of abdominal pain that is primarily epigastric and less intense that his usual bouts of abdominal pain, but much longer lasting.
He denies any significant vomiting, but has been eating relatively little due to poor appetite.
He had fevers and chills during the first 6 days of his illness but denies any within the last week.
Urine is also darker and foul smelling, but no dysuria.
Labs were notable for elevated LFTs and a WBC count of 21.3K.
RUQ Ultrasound demonstrated dilated biliary tree with an ill-defined pancreatic head mass.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, + lightheadedness, +DOE (new), + chronic LBP and sciatica, + hx of intermittant numbness in extremities (not currently) (-) Denies night sweats.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Depression 3.
Chronic back pain 6.
History of left foot drop and peripheral neuropathy, resolved 7.
Family History: Mother - has "gallbladder problems" but still has her gallbladder in Father - healthy Diabetes in some great aunts.
Maternal grandmother died of a MI in her 50s.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.9 BP: 150/60 P: 96 R: 16 O2: 100% RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, gaunt HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi, no CVAT CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, TTP in the epigastrium, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, negative [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro:  CNII-XII intact; 5/5 strength in the biceps, triceps, hip flexors, foot flexors and extensors bilaterally.
No free air under the diaphragms.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation to the level of the pancreatic head where a heterogeneous ill-defined mass is identified, suspicious for pancreatic neoplasm.
There was severe post-obstructive dilation of the bile duct.
[**2158-12-6**] MRCP - IMPRESSION: FINDINGS: There is a 5.4 x 3.8 cm complex cystic mass in the head and neck of the pancreas, the pancreatic duct is dilated upstream as well as downstream.
The inferior aspect of the head of pancreas is the only pancreatic tissue that has normal high signal intensity on pre-contrast T1-weighted sequences, the remaining pancreatic parenchyma has decreased signal intensity and is isointense to spleen.
The downstream pancreatic duct demonstrates mild increased signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences, which is hypointense compared to the signal intensity of bile in the gallbladder on T2 weighted images.
The overall appearances of the pancreatic mass are most consistent with an invasive adenocarcinoma arising from an IPMN.
There are several enlarged upper abdominal lymph nodes, some of which demonstrate cystic change versus necrosis (image 66, series 200).
Collateral venous flow from the spleen is noted through an enlarged gastroepiploic vein.
The hepatic artery is encased with abnormal soft tissue consistent with direct involvement with the tumor versus lymphadenopathy (image 16, series 5).
There are multiple upper abdominal venous collaterals including dilated gastroepiploic vein.
A common bile duct stent is seen in situ and the intrapancreatic CBD as it traverses through the pancreatic head mass tapers down.
There is enhancement of the intrahepatic bile ducts as well as the wall of the CBD highly suggestive of cholangitis.
The gallbladder is distended and there is mucosal hyperenhancing with an area of interruption of the mucosal lining of the gallbladder mucosal, which is worrisome for gangrenous cholecystitis (image 80, series 200).
There is mild hyperemia of the liver parenchyma around the gallbladder fossa.
There are several liver lesions which demonstrate mild high-signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences, low-signal intensity on pre-contrast T1-weighted sequences with enhancement on the dynamic series.
One of the lesions in segment VIII demonstrates a subtle halo of low-signal intensity on the dynamic series (image 27, series 200).
Overall appearances of these liver lesions are highly worrisome for metastatic disease.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no abnormal marrow signal.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
Unresectable large complex pancreatic head/neck mass most consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising from an IPMN.
Alternatively, the fluid filled collections could be pseudocysts in the setting of pancreatitis due to an obstructing adenocarcinoma.
There is extensive venous and arterial involvement as described above.
Multiple liver lesions with appearance worrisome for metastatic disease.
A less likely possibility is multiple liver abscesses.
Upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Distended gallbladder with hyperenhancing mucosa and foci of interruption of the mucosal lining worrisome for gangrenous cholecystitis.
EGD: Normal mucosa in the whole stomach No acitve bleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding was noted from the sphincteortomy site.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
Therefore, any underlying small lesions may have not been visible.
No source of bleeding identified.
Terminal ileum was intubated with no bleeding.
A few groups of atypical glandular epithelial cells in   crowded groups, non-specific, in a background of reactive   glandular epithelial cells, bile pigment and bacteria.
Blood and urine cultures were negative  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15829**] is is a 59 year old male who presented with dehydration, nausea, abdominal pain, and poor appetite who was found to have a pancreatic head mass and cholangitis.
#  Cholangitis - The patient's WBC count was elevated on presentation.
The following day, his WBC count was lower, he was afebrile, pain free, and his diet was advanced.
#  Pancreatic head mass - Initially seen on abdominal ultrasound and concerning for malignancy.
MRCP showed an unresectable large complex pancreatic head and neck mass and multiple liver lesions with appearance worrisome for metastatic disease or less likely possibility is multiple liver abscesses.
Hematology oncology was consulted and their recommendations were to await the cytology and CA19-9 an abnormality in either of which would be diagnostic of pancreatic cancer.
Surgery was consulted and they determined that the mass was unresectable.
#  Hyponatremia - The patient was hyponatremic on presentation with a serum sodium of 127.
#  acute blood loss anemia/GI bleeding- On [**2158-12-9**] patient was noted to have a maroon colored stool.
He was transfused blood and an endoscopy was performed that day in the MICU and no source of bleeding could be found.
The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications and was called out to the floor team on [**12-11**].
He also had a colonoscopy which revealed a sigmoid polyp which was removed but no evidence of bleeding.
#  Depression - The patient has a history of chronic, severe depression.
# concern for gangrenous cholecystitis on MRCP - felt to be low prob as had no abdominal pain after stenting .
# Code status was discussed and he wished to be full code but expressed hesitation about life prolonged life support if it became necessary and there was low probability for recovery.
Medications on Admission: Prozac 60 mg daily Ibuprofen and aspirin prn back pain   Discharge Medications: 1.
Pancreatic head mass, likely malignant 3.
Gastrointestinal bleed  Secondary Diagnosis: Major Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) **], You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of nausea and abdominal pain.
You were found to have cholangitis (an infection of the bile tract).
You were also found to have masses in your pancrease and liver that are concerning for cancer.
You also developed a bleed in your gastrointestinal tract.
The endoscopist did not find any source of bleeding but they cauterized the area around the stent to prevent further bleeding.
