Patient states that he was doing well at home, though noticed increasing fatigue and shortness of breath with minimal exertion for the past few days.
Stools were trace guiac positive.
Reports [**9-14**] pain in his epigastric region, which comes in spasms, especially when he burps.
(-) Patient denies fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain or tightness, palpitations.

Borderline low precordial voltage.
S1-Q3 pattern which is non-diagnostic and was present on the previous tracing of [**2123-6-3**].
Large mass centered within the lesser sac, larger in size compared to [**2123-5-25**].
Newly developed within the mass are multiple areas of air and high density contents, concerning for representing ingested contents or interval development of necrosis within the mass.
[**6-25**] EGD: Esophagus contains large amount of debris and fluid, noted immediately upon intubation.
Therapeutic large channel endoscope introduced, esophagus cleared of debris, rapid influx of debris and blood stained fluid into esophagus.
Esophageal stent appears to have migrated proximally.
This may be gastric cavity but given the findings of recent CT may also be erosion of stent into mass in lesser sac.
Large mass centered in the lesser sac is redemonstrated, with low-density areas consistent with necrosis.
Circumferential wall thickening of the distal esophagus redemonstrated, with unchanged position of esophageal stent.
Fluid layering in dilated distal esophagus, increasing risk for aspiration.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and large liver masses redemonstrated.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger than two days prior.
On admission, hct was at its nadir of 16.8 likely in the setting of a slow bleed from his GI tract.
Stool was weakly guiac positive which made a brisk bleed unlikely.
Decreased marrow production may also be contributing with a low reticulocyte count.
ESOPHAGEAL CA:  Chemotherapy was started 1 week prior to presentation with Xeloda; however, it was unclear whether the medication was passing beyond the large necrotic esophageal tumor to be absorbed so it was stopped.
EGD and CT abdomen were both consistent with a large, necrotic mass that was metastatic to the liver.
The patient wanted to leave the hospital AMA to maximize time spent with his family before meeting with IV access team to get a Portacath for future chemo or to meet with surgery to have a J-tube placed.
TACHYCARDIA:  Resolved after treatent of hypovolemia and pain.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT:  Patient with swollen, cold right upper extremity in the setting of PICC line placement.
An ultrasound showed evidence of thrombus and the PICC was removed.
LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA:  Patient with marked lower extremity swelling, worked up previously and negative for DVT.
Likely marked third spacing from decreased PO intake, poor synthetic function, and low intravascular oncotic pressure, given albumin levels ranging from 2.1-2.8. .
He has had mild mental status changes; was slow to respond and tangential, thought to possibly be adverse effect from narcotics.
PRURITIS: Patient was seen by dermatology for long-standing pruritus of upper and lower extremities with evidence of excoriated lesions.
Dulcolax 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1)  Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Metastatic espohageal cancer, upper GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have significant blood loss and were admitted to the intensive care unit.
