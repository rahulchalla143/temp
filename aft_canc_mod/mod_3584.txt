Admission Date: [**2110-2-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2110-4-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-5-26**]        Sex:  M  Service:HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY SERVICE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 53382**] is a 73 year old male with a history of cholangiocarcinoma who is status post left hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, common duct excision and pylorosparing Whipple procedure on [**2112-1-11**] who was discharged on [**2110-2-5**] and was subsequently readmitted on [**2110-2-10**] with a collection of a subphrenic abscess.
He developed at that time acute renal insufficiency with increased creatinine.
Over the few days prior to admission he had decreasing urine output.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history was significant for cholangiocarcinoma, acute renal insufficiency, squamous cell carcinoma of the lip, hypercholesterolemia, question of a prior myocardial infarction, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, diverticulosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for left hepatic lobectomy, a pylorosparing Whipple procedure, and multiple excisions of skin cancer.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Is significant for coronary artery disease and a brother with lung cancer.
He had no known drug allergies.
He was in no apparent distress and was alert and oriented times three.
Sclerae were mildly icteric.
He had no jugular venous distension.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
His rectal was guaiac positive without masses.
He had 2 to 3 pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities.
His prior imaging had been significant for renal ultrasound which showed no hydronephrosis and left 7 mm renal stone and good bilateral blood scan.
CT scan on [**2110-2-18**] had revealed stable peripancreatic fluid collection, left renal stone and diverticulosis.
Chest x-ray on [**2110-2-19**] revealed a right upper lobe opacity and bibasilar atelectasis.
On [**2110-3-2**] an abdominal ultrasound was done to assess for vascular flow in his liver and kidneys for a complaint of left flank pain.
The ultrasound revealed that patient was status post hepatectomy and no focal lesions were identified in the rest of the liver.
There was a small nonobstructing stone seen in the left kidney at the interpolar area.
There were no renal masses.
There was a normal arterial wave form in the renal arteries with high resistant indices around 0.8.
It was felt that he had a bullous drug versus scabies rash.
The biliary tree appeared decompressed and there was rapid flow through the biliary drainage catheter entering the jejunum.
Given his suboptimal fluid status at that time and his hypovolemia, the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at which time a Swan Ganz catheter was placed.
This was completed without complications.
Dermatology followed up on the biopsy that had been obtained revealed results consistent with a herpetic disseminated infection.
The physical examination at that time revealed vesicles with erythematous base.
His elevated liver function tests and right upper lobe infiltrate were suspicious at that time for visceral involvement.
The patient had a worsening respiratory status.
They did feel that he had possibly metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with visceral involvement.
He also had a worsening pulmonary status and renal status.
He did have some bleeding from his upper airway.
The patient through the next several days demonstrated septic physiology and required fresh frozen plasma and platelet products.
He also required Levophed drip for blood pressure support in light of his septic physiology.
He demonstrated a metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
He also had varicella pneumonia and varicella hepatitis.
At this time he was continued on antibiotics and CCVHD for his renal failure.
A family meeting was held on [**2110-3-10**] to discuss the current status and prognosis with the family.
He had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation on [**2110-3-12**].
A CT scan at that time revealed bilateral peribronchial opacities and bilateral pleural effusions.
There was a slight interval decrease in the size of the peripancreatic fluid collection and a nonobstructing left renal stone.
A cholangiogram on [**2110-3-21**] revealed a decompressed intrahepatic bile duct with a continued anastomotic leak.
The distal aspect of the catheter was clotted off and there was no passage of contrast at that time into the small bowel.
A post placement cholangiogram demonstrated appropriate positioning of the tube with the side holes draining into the intrahepatic biliary duct and distal pigtail within the small bowel.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy which revealed copious secretions which were suctioned from the right upper lobe and right lower lobe.
He had worsening hematologic parameters and continued to require CCVHD.
When the patient's amiodarone was discontinued he did recur into rapid atrial fibrillation.
On [**2110-3-27**] a repeat ultrasound was done due to his biliary drainage which had decreased output and continuously rising bilirubin.
There was no ductal dilatation.
There was a small right pleural effusion.
His culture data at that time showed a negative urine, a negative sputum although a bronchoalveolar lavage revealed no fungal and no viral cultures.
On [**2110-3-31**] he had a chest x-ray which revealed continued small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral patchy opacities with a residual opacity in the right mid lung.
He was bronchoscoped on [**2110-3-31**] which revealed a thick blood clot completely obstructing the left main bronchus.
He had persistent acidemia.
He had increased ventilator requirement and an acidosis on CVH.
He had increased coagulopathy and was requiring fresh frozen plasma.
His liver function tests were elevated and his mental status on [**4-1**] was decreased.
He was febrile and continued to require ventilatory support on these first few days of [**Month (only) 116**].
He was pronounced dead at 1729 P.M. of cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to multi organ failure originating from disseminated varicella Zoster infection.
Acute renal insufficiency.
Blood loss anemia.
History of myocardial infarction.
Anastomotic leak from prior biliary anastomosis.
Requirement for parenteral nutrition.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Rapid atrial fibrillation.
Respiratory failure requiring intubation.
