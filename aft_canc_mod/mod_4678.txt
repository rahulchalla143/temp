Unchanged right hemispheric parenchymal hemorrhages at the site of known masses, with stable degree of intraventricular extension of the hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo M with h/o metastatic inoperable NSCLC s/p chemo and radiation who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after developing L-sided weakness and falling when attempting to rise from a chair around 10:30pm on [**2109-8-12**].
He was found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage into a right thalamic metastases.
Another CT scan on [**8-14**] was performed to view if there was any change in his hemorrhage which showed unchanged right hemispheric parenchymal hemorrhages at the site of known masses, with stable degree of intraventricular extension of the hemorrhage.
There evaluation showed aspiration with thin liquids and prolonged mastication with mild-moderate residue with regular solid.
Patient was seen by palliative care who discussed with the patient and his family the two options for radiotherapy which include whole brain radiation therapy, which is standard of care,especially for lung cancer with brain metastases.
The patient and his wife ultimately will likely decide against this, and pursue only palliative directed therapies.
