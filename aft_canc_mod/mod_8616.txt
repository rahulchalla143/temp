CXR: FINDINGS: There is airspace consolidation at the left lung base, consistent with atelectatic changes, however, an underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.
There is post-ablation right middle lobe opacity that is unchanged from prior chest CT from [**2183-11-7**].
There is calcification within the right breast that projects over the right lower lobe lung fields.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with possible small pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe patchy opacity consistent with atelectatic changes, however, an underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.
CXR [**2183-11-27**] IMPRESSION: Evidence of chronic lung disease including prominent interstitial markings and probable underlying emphysema.
Slightly interval worsening of bilateral pleural effusions compared to examination of two days prior.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
No definite consolidation.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

# Hypoxia: Patient's symptoms on admission, including dyspnea, cough, and fever over past few days with myalgias in setting of leukocytosis and CXR findings, were  suggestive of PNA.
On repeat CXR, a clearly defined pneumonia was less evident, and chest film showed worsening of bilateral pleural effusions.
Pt was given Lasix 10mg IV x 1 with thought that hypoxia would improve with diuresis, but clinical response was limited.
Given pt's initial improvement on antibiotics and high fever on presentation, antibiotic coverage was continued.
She was switched from Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin to Levofloxacin 750mg PO (initially q48 [**1-18**] decreased CrCl, now daily) as she started having a mild transaminitis, thought to be possibly secondary to the Ceftriaxone.
She had a persistent cough that became more dry toward the end of her hospital stay.
It was also thought that pt's Afib with RVR was likely contributing to the development of the pleural effusions and associated hypoxia.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: It is likely that patient's underlying infection and volume depletion contributed to her RVR.
First set of cardiac enzymes were negative, and was not cycled as rate may cause slight demand ischemia with elevation in CE's.
Additionally, patient's other symptoms were not particularly cardiac in origin.
It was also thought that pt's Afib with RVR was likely contributing to the development of the pleural effusions and associated hypoxia.
Excessive albuterol was avoided to prevent further tachycardia.
Coumadin was initially held due to guiaic positive stools, but as crits and vitals were stable, Coumadin was resumed on [**11-28**].
# Guaiac positive stool: Pt was found to have a guiaic positive brown stool in the ED.
She has a history of colonic polyps, and was actually due for an outpt colonscopy this week.
Pt has been hemodynamically stable, and has not had any melena or hematochezia.
Pt initially also had hematuria, secondary to foley placement with resolved after foley removal.
Therefore, the oxygen requirement here is likely secondary to the acute infection/ effusions.
Steroids were not contiued as pt was not particularly wheezy on exam, and pneumonia and pleural effusions were thought to be the likely etiology for her hypoxia given her fever, leukocytosis, and positive response to rate control.
#Transaminitis: Pt has mildly elevated transaminases seen on transfer to the floor.
There was no documented hypotension to suggest shock liver (and not significantly elevated).
TSH was checked and elevated, but should be re-checked outside of acute infection.
