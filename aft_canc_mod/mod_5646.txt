The patient reports he had a fall approximately 4 days ago hitting his chest and left leg, however he cannot remember if hit his head.
This episode occurred in the setting of him bending over to pick up his pants, and he did not experience dizziness or vertigo.
He received dialysis [**5-28**] in [**Location (un) **] as scheduled, and was rescheduled to get an additional session of UF [**5-29**] for extra fluid removal.
He was brought to the ED from [**Location (un) **] over concern of his increased weakness and fever, in the setting of need for follow-up hemodialysis.
He states he has been feeling generally weak but denies chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, headache shortness of breath, or difficulty with bowel or bladder.
He was found to be moderately unresponsive, had decreased lung sounds bilaterally, and had 4 cm x 3 cm ulcer over his left shin.
CXR showed cardiomegaly and interstitial opacities suspicious for congestive heart failure vs multifocal pneumonia.
He was admitted for possible emergent hemodialysis, and evidence of pneumonia/sepsis.

Periventricular white matter hypodensities are most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Findings suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Probably chronic inflammatory change in the right posterior mastoid.
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT Study Date of [**2193-5-29**] 10:38 AM IMPRESSION:  No evidence for fracture or dislocation.
No evidence of fracture dislocation involving the cervical spine.
Moderate multilevel degenerative changes with spinal canal stenosis, worst at C6-7.
Thickening of apical interlobular septae, suggesting congestive heart failure.
Multiple epididymal calcifications, which may reflect sequela of prior infection or inflammation.
**FINAL REPORT [**2193-6-1**]** MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2193-6-1**]):    No MRSA isolated.

# Sepsis / pneumonia: The patient presented with elevated WBC 73.9 (94.4% pmns), fever (T 100.8), tachypnea (RR 24), and CXR that showed interstitial opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia vs CHF exacerbation.
He had mild hemodynamic instability (hypotension 90s-100s/40s-60s) without evidence of new end-organ dysfunction.
# CHF / fluid overload: He has a history of CHF, aortic stenosis, ESRD on HD, all of which contribute to interstitial opacities seen on CXR.
proBNP tremendously elevated > 70,000.
He was treated with hemodialysis [**2193-5-30**], which removed 3L of fluid and another liter on [**2193-5-31**].
Cardiology consulted who felt it was related to demand ischemia.
His cardiac enzymes were likely chronically elevated due to his ESRD, or from demand ischemia given his fluid overload; cardiology was consulted, and agreed with this assessment.
He did not have chest pain, new shortness of breath, and remained hemodynamically stable.
# LLE ulcer: He presented with a chronic-appearing 3x4cm ulcer in the left lower extremity that had been previously debrided.
Given the mild membranous exudate, there may have been a superimposed cellulitis.
# ESRD: He has end stage renal disease and regularly receives HD via the L arm graft T/Th/Sat.
He has a known history of myelodysplastic syndrome, and his leukocytosis is likely a combination of his mds and superimposed sepsis.
Please check his WBC to ensure that his leukocytosis has resolved.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had an infection of the lung which we treated with antibiotics.
You also have a leg wound which we debrided, and are treating with antibiotics.
While you were here, you were found to have increase in your cardiac markers.
Also, while you were here, your wound on your left shin was evaluated; we saw that there were areas of dead tissue, which the surgeons removed.
