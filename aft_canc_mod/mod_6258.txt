# GI bleed: Patient was felt to have a slow GIB secondary to his UC as stool was only trace guaiac positive,  His hematocrit was 23, down from 31 at the time of his last discharge.
He was taken for EGD/colonoscopy on [**7-20**] which showed no active bleed, and friable mucosa of the colon c/w UC (somewhat improved from prior endoscopy).
# Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has had a complicated course with his UC, treated with IV solumedrol his last admission, and discharged on prednisone.
