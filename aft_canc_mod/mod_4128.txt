ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old gentleman who was found to have a positive stress test during work up for his hip surgery.
He subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which was significant for three vessel coronary artery disease and he was therefore scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting.
There were no intraoperative complications and the patient was brought intubated to the cardiac surgery recovery unit postoperatively on Neo-Synephrine.
He notably did have an episode of atrial fibrillation which was limited on postoperative day #2 with reversion to sinus rhythm almost immediately with some supplemental beta blockade.
It was felt that by postoperative day #5 that as patient had been afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal with a pulse in the 70s in sinus rhythm and a blood pressure to 90s to low 100s along with clear lungs and stable sternum with a clean incision and minimal peripheral edema and otherwise tolerating regular diet and ambulating that the patient could be discharged to home in stable condition.
Notably patient's hematocrit had drifted down to 24 but as he was asymptomatic and otherwise hemodynamically normal and making excellent urine it was decided not to transfuse him and he was given iron supplements and ascorbic acid.
