Admission Date:  [**2114-10-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-10-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2044-2-3**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, who developed tachycardia while at Interventional Pulmonology for thoracentesis.
The patient noted an increase in shortness of breath for a few days and a chest x-ray revealed a new left pleural effusion.
Prior to the thoracentesis, she noted a significant increase in shortness of breath.
The patient at that time stated that she had an increased dyspnea on exertion as well as shortness of breath for two days.
Metastatic breast cancer diagnosed in [**2105**] treated with lumpectomy and XRT, [**2108**] with a recurrence left mastectomy that was followed by Taxol/carboplatin x6 cycles, followed by Xeloda x4 cycles, followed by Taxotere.
Status post TAH/BSO with ovarian cysts and fibroids.
Pleural effusions, scheduled for pleurocentesis on day of admission which was performed.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for breast cancer in maternal aunt, who died in her 40's.
Brother who passed away of head and neck cancer in his 60's.
No lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention noted in the neck.
Cardiovascular shows regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, warm, 2+ pulses.
Chest x-ray on [**10-11**] with decreased pleural effusion and increased aeration when compared to [**10-14**] which showed a left pleural effusion with collapse.
CT scan of the chest of [**2114-7-19**], nodule new left lower lobe, old lingular, in the left base increased ground glass.
Electrocardiogram:  First and second with rates in the 150s and 160s, question of MAT versus atrial fibrillation.
Three showed atrial fibrillation at 101 with normal axis and intervals, no acute changes, and the fourth showed sinus at 97 with multiple P-wave formations, question of atrial pacemaker.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 70-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer status post thoracentesis was admitted with increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure, was admitted for observation.
Her shortness of breath on admission was likely due to the tachycardia, as well as the pleural effusion which improved post-tap.
It was noticed on the day following admission, on examination patient had alternating loud versus soft heart sounds, bedside echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated a pericardial effusion, the patient was emergently transferred to the catheterization laboratory, where a pericardial drain was placed.
In the CCU, the patient continued to have intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation for which he was treated with diltiazem prn.
Due to her current bouts of atrial fibrillation, it was determined to start her on amiodarone in hopes of better control of her atrial fibrillation.
The patient was continued to be monitored in the CCU, the pericardial drain was removed on [**10-13**] without difficulty since the drainage was minimal.
While in the CCU, the patient had recurrence of her pleural effusions, she developed a large right sided effusion, at which time Interventional Pulmonology was consulted.
On [**10-15**], a therapeutic tap of the right pleural effusion was performed without complications.
Serous fluid 750 cc was removed at that time.
On the 28th, a followup echocardiogram was also performed which demonstrated decreased size of pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade.
Due to the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, with recurrent pleural effusions, as well as patient's symptomatic improvement post-thoracenteses, on [**10-16**], Interventional Pulmonology performed a left sided pleurodesis.
Patient remained in the CCU, with intermittent episodes of both atrial fibrillation as well as hypotension in the 70s, concern was for recurrence of the pericardial effusion.
The repeat echocardiogram based on this episode of hypotension on the 30th, was negative for recurrent pericardial effusion.
On the evening, the patient continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation in the 140s, even though she had been started on an amiodarone drip in the unit, and converted to an amiodarone po load followed by amiodarone 400 tid.
The patient was asymptomatic and feeling comfortable, but the chest tube was still in as of [**10-20**].
The patient continued to have followup echocardiograms with no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation.
On the 4th, the chest tube was eventually removed without complications.
The followup chest x-ray did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumothorax or effusion reaccumulation.
Patient did have an elevated white count, though likely due to a talc infusion, and the patient was afebrile, the patient was started on levofloxacin 500 q day as prophylaxis.
Patient remained stable, with only intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, although she remained asymptomatic, it was determined that the patient, due to her malignancy pericardial effusion, as well as pleural effusions requiring pleurodesis, patient when stable was discharged home with hospice on [**10-23**].
Metastatic breast cancer.
Atrial fibrillation.
