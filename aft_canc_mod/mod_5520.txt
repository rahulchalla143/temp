Admission Date:  [**2128-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-10-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Erythromycin / Lasix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20640**] Chief Complaint: left hand weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cervical embolization C7 Corpectomy PICC line placement bronchial artery embolization   History of Present Illness: This is a 53 yo female with a past medical history metastatic RCC, diagnosed 2 years ago, with brain and lung mets s/p nephrectomy and chemo, most recently on experimental protocol, s/p bronchial stenting on [**2128-6-30**], now with respiratory decompensation, hemoptysis, found to have occlusion of right side of stent by tumor growth, brought to IR today for bronchial artery embolization.
Prior to this admission, the patient presented with LUE weakness after a visit to her chiropractor, s/p nephrectomy and chemotherapy, and was found to have a pathologic fracture of C7.
MRI showed no compression but edema of C2-T1.
On [**7-12**], she was intubated for respiratory distress with SBP 70s, HR 130s, and she was started on Diltiazem gtt with Neo for SVT with hypotension.
She also underwent a right sided thoracentesis on [**7-14**] with 700cc removed, and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for fevers and empiric tx for VAP.
She was extubated on [**7-15**], but then had a witnessed localized motor seizure and was started on dilantin which was transitioned to keppra.
Over the next several days, her respiratory status appeared worse, and underwent another bronchoscopy on [**7-18**] secondary to right lung collapse.
At this time, the patient was considering transition to hospice, but then her respiratory status began to improve, and she regained some mobility in her arms and legs and decided she preferred to proceed to rehab instead.
She was to be discharged on [**7-27**], when she suddenly began to have increasing respiratory distress.
She was taken by IP for flexible bronch for therepeutic aspiration of secretions and visualization of Y stent, where it was discovered that, after therapeutic aspiration was performed, the left limb of the Y-stent was patent without endobronchial lesions or active bleeding, however, on the right side, there was a tumor ingrowth to the distal end of the stent which was approximately 90% occlusive.
At night has anxiety induced dyspnea where she is placed on NRB and given ativan.
On [**7-28**] a CXR showed complete opacification of right hemithorax, likely a combination of atelectasis and fluid due to lack of signicicant midline shift (overall slight leftward shift) concerning for blood as patient is status-post embolization.

Photodynamic therapy scheduled followed by debridement with rigid bronchoscopy [**2128-4-7**]: Rigid bronchoscopy; flexible bronchoscopy, RUL tumor destruction with cryo probe; tumor ablation with argon plasma coagulation [**2128-4-9**]: Flexible bronchoscopy; mechanical debridement & cryotherapy of RUL [**2128-4-16**]: Echo revealed small to moderate pericardial effusion with right atrial mass at the IVC-RA junction most likely representing tumor; admitted for evaluation & further w/u to determine if mass is a blood clot or tumor.
CT torso revealed no evidence of right atrial thrombus/mass but a conglomerate nodal mass in the azygo-esophageal recess near the junction of the IVC & RA.
She was hemodynamically stable & d/c home on [**4-22**] wtih a plan to perform cardiac MRI to determine location of thrombus/mass [**2128-4-21**]: Cardiac mass identified in RA & in IVC; started on Sutent therapy soon after (~ [**2128-4-23**]) [**2128-5-26**]: Flexible bronchoscopy for cough & hemoptysis [**2128-5-28**]: Signed consent for 08-313; RAD Biomarker trial [**2128-6-14**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 RAD001 (Everolimus) .

After hospitalization it was revealed that the pt had an outpt bronchoscopy that left her with some upper extremity weakness x 1 week.
She then sought chiropractic care for neck pain that left her with some LUE weakness.
Imaging of the cervical spine revealed C7 pathological fracture [**3-8**] renal cell mets.
After the embolization she remained intubated but appeared to have left leg weakness.
She also underwent MRI of brain which demontrated the following: metastasis in the left frontal lobe and left occipital lobe.
Tiny areas of acute infarct in the cerebellum seen as restricted diffusion.
She also underwent MRI c-spine which showed increased signal within the spinal cord from C2-T1 level could be due to ischemia or cord edema.
Decrease in size of the left paraspinal mass related to surgery and embolization.
On the first post-op morning her motor exam improved slightly and she was moving her right arm with slight movement left hand/wrist.
was extubated and then re-intubated secondary to failure to clear secretions.
Two days later she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for fevers and empiric coverage of VAP.
On [**7-16**] the patient was observed to have some focal motor seizures characterized by arm tremmors.
Her respiratory status was fluctuating and there was some discussion as to if the pt should be electively trached if she required reintubation.
She was bronch'd on the [**7-19**] for increasing RLL infiltrates and right lung collapse.
During their procedure they noted that the right mainstem bronchus was 50% occluded around the 13th and now is 60-80% occluded with blood clots overlying the protruding mass.
They would like to move forward with treatment of bronchial obtruction.
She then had a bronchial artery embolization and was then transferred to the MICU from IR for monitoring.
At night has anxiety induced dyspnea where she is placed on NRB and given ativan.
On [**7-28**] a CXR showed complete opacification of right hemithorax, likely a combination of atelectasis and fluid due to lack of signicicant midline shift (overall slight leftward shift) concerning for blood as patient was status-post embolization.
She again had respiratory distress and was transferred back to the ICU, until finally, she decided to be CMO and was transferred back to the OMED service.
She then had respiratory depression/failure and passed away at 5:59PM on [**2128-7-30**].
