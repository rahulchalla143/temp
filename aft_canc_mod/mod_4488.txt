depression in mother.
CV: Tachycardic and regular.
Abdomen: +BS, soft NTND Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Alert, confused.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain: GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2150-4-8**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE: NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
BLOOD/AFB CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
CXR (portable AP) [**2150-4-3**]: Increased vague densities at the bases, which could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
CXR (PA and lateral) [**2150-4-4**]: On the current study there is evidence of a patchy density at the left lower lobe posteriorly, consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is also some obscuration of the right heart border and increased density overlying the cardiac silhouette in the lateral view consistent with right middle lobe consolidation again likely pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
There are no features of CHF and the heart size is normal.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pneumonias as described above.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound [**2150-4-6**]: There is normal compressibility, augmentation and spontaneous phasic flow with no evidence of intraluminal filling defect.
There is an anechoic structure in the left popliteal fossa measuring 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm, most consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4675**] cyst.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
No acute intracranial process.
Stable chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
No evidence of distention of colon.
Prominent loops od jejunum, could be due to enteritis of infectiuos, ischemic, or inflammatory etiology.
Short term KUB to follow- if clinical concern.
Questionable lytic lesion in the right femoral neck, incompletely characterized.
Further evaluation with a dedicated radiograph is recommended.
No femoral osseous lesion detected.
In particular no lesion is identified in the right femoral neck.
The lucency quesitoned in this area on the [**2150-4-12**] abdominal CT likely represents partial imaging of a prominent area of more diffuse osteopenia ([**Hospital1 **] triangle), but is not thought to represent a focal lytic lesion.
Incompletely imaged left intrarenal soft tissue mass with delayed clearance of contrast from an inferior left renal calix, concerning for a transitional cell carcinoma, similar in appearance to the study performed on [**2150-4-12**].
This could represent edema or inflammatory changes.
However, no associated subcutaneous emphysema to indicate a necrotizing infection is identified.
No intratesticular mass.
No signs of Fournier's gangrene or epididymitis.
Small bilateral hydrocele.
Small indeterminate nodule adjacent to the left epididymis may represent a granuloma, but cannot be further characterized by ultrasound.
No overt abnormality in the partially visualized hip and knee and no knee effusion.
There is left basilar opacity most compatible with atelectasis given the linear appearance.
There is lucent appearance of the upper lungs suggestive of underlying emphysema.
There is no pneumothorax.
Skin biopsy right thigh [**2150-4-13**]: Marked superficial dermal edema and perivascular and interstitial mixed cell infiltrate with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and rare eosinophils.
The histologic differential diagnosis includes a bullous hypersensitivity reaction including a drug eruption.
PAS and gram stains are negative for fungi and bacteria respectively.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year-old male COPD on home oxygen, OSA, HTN, recent diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of his left kidney, and depression admitted initially to psychiatry for suicidal ideation s/p 2 ECT treatments with pneumonia.
He was transferred [**2150-4-5**] to the MICU for bibasilar pneumonia and back to the floor [**2150-4-7**].
He was readmitted to the MICU on [**2150-4-12**] for somnolence and increased oxygen requirement.
# Health-care associated pneumonia: On [**2150-4-3**], the patient developed fever to 102 and tachycardia to 140s.
He treated for health-care associated pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, later changed to vancomycin, Zosyn with improvement in his respiratory status.
Sputum grew methicillin-sensitive staph aureus.
# COPD: The patient's shortness of breath was thought to be multifactorial, related not only to pneumonia but also to COPD and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
# Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's shortness of breath was thought to be multifactorial, related not only to pneumonia but also to COPD and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
An echocardiogram was performed and showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient had two episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The first episode occurred in the intensive care unit in the setting of pneumonia and responded to IV diltiazem.
The second occurred on the medical floor in the setting of profuse diarrhea and dehydration and responded to IV fluids alone.
MI was ruled out with serial cardiac enzymes.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy: Continued terazosin.
# Diarrhea: The patient developed profuse diarrhea while on the medical floor.
His diarrhea was presumed to be due to antibiotics.
# Erysipelas: On the medical floor, the patient developed a worsening groin rash that was initially thought to be fungal but worsened on Nystatin.
Skin biopsy was consistent with this.
CT and ultrasound were done to rule out Fournier's gangrene.
# Drug rash: Patient developed a maculopapular rash during his ICU stay.
Dermatology thought likely drug reaction secondary to Zosyn that he had received a week prior.
The patient was monitored for signs of DRESS syndrome.
# Question of lytic lesion in right femur: A possible lytic bone lesion was noted in the patient's right femoral neck during abdomen/pelvis CT.
After discussion with radiology, the decision was made to proceed with bone scan given the patient's known transitional cell carcinoma and the high-risk location of the lesion.
During his psychiatric admission, the patient received two electroconvulsive therapy treatments, which were complicated by aspiration and pneumonia.
# Transitional cell carcinoma: The patient was recently diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma.
# Hypertension: Increased lisinopril to 10 mg daily and decreased diltiazem extended-release to 240 mg daily.
# Chronic neck and back pain: Stopped gabapentin and oxycontin.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: Continued Autoset CPAP at night.

You were transferred to the intensive care unit due to shortness of breath.
Your found to have pneumonia and an exacerbation of your COPD.
You were treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and with steroids for COPD.
Subsequently, you developed a groin rash, diarrhea, confusion, and an increased oxygen requirement, requiring transfer back to the intensive care unit.
In addition to the groin rash, you developed a second, more generalized rash, which was thought to be due to an antibiotic called Zosyn (pipercillin/tazobactam).
You had two episodes of an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You developed severe diarrhea.
There have been some changes to your medications: START nafcillin for skin rash until [**2150-5-4**] START loperamide for diarrhea START multivitamin INCREASE aspirin to 325 mg daily due to atrial fibrillation INCREASE lisinopril to 10 mg daily DECREASE diltiazem to 240 mg daily STOP Neurontin (gabapentin) STOP Colace (docusate) due to diarrhea STOP Ambien DECREASE oxycodone to 5 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain STOP oxycontin CONTINUE nystatin for thrush for another 5 day .
