CLINICAL INFORMATION: Metastatic melanoma with left facial flap revision and continued bleeding.
Ill-defined abnormality in the left middle cranial fossa is seen consistent with findings on [**2167-1-3**] on the MRI study of enhancing mass with adjacent edema of the temporal lobe and malacic change.
There is bone destruction of the anterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus and of the left ethmoid sinus.
There is opacification of the left frontal sinus.
There is an abnormality in the left side of the nasal cavity presumably representing a nasal pack.
There is opacification of the left side of the sphenoid sinus.
There is an air fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
There is opacification of the left mastoid sinus.
CT angiogram of the cervical vessels and intracranial circulation.
There is no evidence of significant internal carotid artery stenosis.
There is some abnormality medially at the left lung apex which might represent atelectasis but raises the question of prior radiation therapy in this region.
Intracranially, there is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
On the raw data series, there is no definite evidence of abnormal pooling of contrast material in the region of the facial flap or of the nasal pack in the left nasal cavity.
IMPRESSION: No obvious bleeding site in the left face or nasal cavity.
No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis or intracranial aneurysm.
Deformity of left-sided facial bones as described with considerable abnormal soft tissue.
Opacification of left mastoid sinus.
Abnormality in left middle cranial fossa consistent with the findings on the MRI study.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 23303**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Approved: WED [**2167-1-7**] 11:40 AM    MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-1-3**] 7:13 PM Reason: metastatic w/u history of brain metastases with melanoma  Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 69 year old man with melanoma and change in MS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: metastatic w/u history of brain metastases with melanoma MR HEAD  INDICATION: 69-year-old male with melanoma and change in mental status.
No prior studies available for comparison at this institution.
FINDINGS: There is an enhancing mass involving the left temporal lobe, which measures approximately 4.0 x 3.8 cm.
The mass abuts the ventricle, but there is no subependymal enhancement at this time.
The mass surrounds the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery and probably involves the left cavernous sinus and abuts Meckel's cave on the left.
Abnormal enhancing tissue also abuts the orbital apex on the left but does not appear to invade the orbit itself.
The mass extends inferior into the infratemporal fossa and involves the masseter space with a large area of amorphous abnormal enhancing soft tissue.
There is also diffuse involvement of the temporal bone on the left with abnormal enhancing tissue.
There is extensive abnormal soft tissue in the soft tissues overlying the left maxilla, which extends across the superior alveolar ridge to involve a small portion of the soft tissues overlying the right maxilla.
There are inspissated secretions noted in the left frontal sinus as well as an air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Extensive abnormal enhancing soft tissue involving the brain, infratemporal fossa, temporal bone, sphenoid sinus as well as the nasal cavity and the maxillary regions anteriorly.
If the patient has prior examinations, these would be extremely helpful for comparison to determine whether there has been progression of disease.
Status post malignant melanoma of the left maxilla.
Oral incontinence with elevated left upper lip.
Status post malignant melanoma of the left maxilla.
Oral incontinence with elevated left upper lip.
HISTORICAL NOTE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very unfortunate young man who initially presented to his dermatologist with a small lesion on the left cheek.
Biopsy eventually revealed a malignant melanoma for which he has been treated with a radical head and neck resection and resurfacing with a pedicle flap based on the superficial temporal vessels.
At the present time he has extensive intracerebral metastases which have been treated with radiation therapy.
He is awake, alert, coherent without significant neurologic deficits.
He is brought to the operating room today knowing full well that he does have metastatic disease for lowering of the upper lip and redirection of the fistula into the nasal cavity.
The significant debulking of biscuited flap in the left cheek was also done and this provided enough tissue to reroute the sinus.
PROCEDURE:  With the patient on the operating room table in the supine position with the head tilted degrees, general endotracheal anesthetic was induced without difficulty.
The lines for the incisions were then marked out at the base of the previous flap transfer to the left cheek.
The lining of the sinus was excised and with this we were able to elevate the cheek flap more and while tangentially excising much of this excess tissue we encountered tannish whitish almost gelatinous tissue which did not appear normal but we were not surprised that the frozen section on this biopsy was consistent with a malignant spindle cell type tumor.
The cheek flap was then brought down and was rotated medially toward the left side of the nose and inferiorly.
Preoperatively he was unduly swollen and this I am sure is due to the tumor in the area.
Skin, face, tissue for frozen section (A): Spindle cell neoplasm, consistent with spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma (see note).
Skin, face, tissue for permanent section (B-C): Spindle cell neoplasm, consistent with spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma, extending to specimen margin (see note).
Skin, left cheek plaque, tissue for permanent section (D-F): Spindle cell neoplasm, consistent with spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma, extending to specimen margin (see note).
Note: The findings are consistent recurrent spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma in a patient with known history of melanoma at this site.
The entire specimen is submitted in B-C. Part 3 is additionally labeled "plaque left cheek" and consists of a 3.5 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm piece of fibrous and adipose tissue with focal areas of hemorrhage.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was initially on experiencing mild bloody drainage from his left nostril and was transferred to the floor.
However, the bleeding was persistent despite numerous gauze, surgicel, merocel packings and pressure dressings.
His hematocrit was monitored daily and was overall stable without transfusion.
His hyponatremia resolved on fluid restriction and his sodium was in normal range at discharge.
They agreed with fluid restriction for his hyponatremia.
However, they did not believe the hyponatremia was related to the carbamazepine as he had been on a stable dose for several years.
In addition, based on history this medication was for trigeminal neuralgia and not for seizures.
They commented on the presence of extensive signal abnormalities in the left temporal lobe and questioned tumor recurrence vs. radiation necrosis.
The medicine service was consulted for his hyponatremia and they were in agreement with fluid restriction and also recommended repeating labs daily and not to give hypertonic saline.
They believed that the bleeding appeared to be coming from necrotic or neoplastic mucosa, which may not heal normally and therefore, were concerned that when packs are removed, the tissue will continue bleeding.
This led to the pursuit of neuroembolization for definitive management.
However, despite the successful embolization, the patient continued to have a slow bleed around the nasal packing.
He and his friend were instructed to call/return to [**Hospital1 18**] if there were any increase in bleeding or if the patient became symptomatic.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia for 14 days.
Please Dr. [**Name (NI) 67936**] ([**0-0-**]) or Dr.[**Name (NI) 67937**] office/return to [**Hospital1 18**] if you experience persistent fever, pain, increasing bleeding, increasing difficulty breathing, nausea/vomiting.
