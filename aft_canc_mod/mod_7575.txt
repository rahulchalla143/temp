Admission Date:  [**2103-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-4-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Sigmoidoscopy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 65453**] is a 44 y/o female with a hx of UGIB [**1-10**] duodenal ulcers and EtOH liver disease who was transferred from [**Hospital1 1562**] hosptial due to altered mental status.
As per her sister, she was recently admitted to [**Name (NI) 1562**] hospital for an upper Gi bleed.
over the next few [**Last Name (un) 32460**] she become progressively more confused and had significant decrease in her functional status.
Also having frequent diarrhea.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 1562**] (per report) it was thought her mental status may be related to her liver disease and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
She had a head CT which was negative for an acute process.
There was no ascitic fluid that was visulized therefore could not perform a diagnostic tap.
given narcan with improvement of mental status.
She was given 100g albumin for HRS and ceftriaxone for UTI, ?
This morning on rounds, she was thought to be acutely confused, and transfer to the MICU transfer was requested for altered mental status and possible endoscopy.
- Smoking: quit > 16 yrs ago, 25 pack year history - EtOH: history of abuse, last drink > 22 yrs ago - Drugs: history of polysubstance abuse including cocaine, crack, barbiturates, amphetamines, and marijuana.
Family History: No pertinent family history, including PSC, liver disease, or other gastrointestinal disease.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS - 98.1 132/74  96  20  99/ra GENERAL - NAD, drowsy, confused HEENT - scleral icterus NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, mild expiratory wheezing, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, distended but soft/NT, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - several punctures in volar arms with surround erythmea, ?
bilateral LE 3+ edema NEURO - AAOx1, mild left facial droop, speech fluent, no pronator drift .
Mildly Jaundiced.
NECK: Supple with low JVP CARDIAC: RRR, III/VI systolic murmur with best heard at LUSB.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Distended but Soft, non-tender to palpation, Tympanic to percussion, No HSM or tenderness.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial collection, or mass effect.
There is an air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus, and mucosal thickening of ethmoid air cells.
There is no osseous abnormality.
No acute intracranial process.
[**11-12**] LIVER ULTRASOUND:  FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely coarse and echogenic consistent with history of liver disease.
No focal lesions are seen.
The common bile duct is mildly dilated measuring up to 8 mm.
No definite stone is seen within the common bile duct.
There is no ascites.
The right kidney measures 13.9 cm in the long axis and is normal in appearance without hydronephrosis or stones.
Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with history of alcoholic hepatitis.
MRCP/ERCP could better evaluate for an obstructing cause.
There is no hydronephrosis, stones or masses.
At 15 minutes, the small bowel is visualized, although no tracer uptake is seen within the gallbladder throughout the first 75 minutes.
The patient returned to the nuclear medicine suite after 5.5 hours for additional imaging, which revealed tracer activity within the gallbladder.
Diffusely poor tracer uptake throughout the liver is consistent with poor hepatocellular function.
Tracer activity within the gallbladder on delayed images excludes the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
Excretion of tracer into the small bowel excludes the diagnosis of complete biliary obstruction.
A smaller region of consolidation may be present in the right lung projecting behind the lower pole of the right hilus.
Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have increased suggesting cardiac decompensation.
CXR [**2103-11-18**] Bilateral upper lobe consolidation is slightly more pronounced today than yesterday.
Whether this is due to progression of pneumonia or deposition of early edema in a region of pre-existing pneumonia is difficult to say since the mediastinal veins are dilated in the supine position.
Heart size is top normal, and there may be mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no clear edema elsewhere.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
Sigmoidoscopy [**2103-11-23**] - Polyp at 8cm in the rectum - Polyps at the ranging distance from 18 cm to 28 cm in the distal sigmoid colon - Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids - Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure - Recommendations: Patient will need colonoscopy for removal of polyps when her alcoholic hepatitis improves and her INR is less than 1.5.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 65453**] is a 44 year old female with a history of upper GI bleed (UGIB) secondary to duodenal ulcers and alcoholic liver disease who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] hospital due to altered mental status.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUES: .
She has signficant synthetic dysfunction as well with a discriminant function of 51 on admission.
Steroids were deferred initially for possible acute hepatitis since her LFTs and bilirubin were improving in the MICU with fluids.
Hepatitis B and C virus serologies negative.
Nutrition reconsulted and felt she could take adequate caloric intake to treat alcoholic hepatitis and so NGT was not replaced.
# Encephalopathy: The patient was transferred to the MICU for altered mental status (AMS); likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
She received Narcan in the ED to which there was a questionable improvement in her mental status.
She was given lactulose and rifaxamin, aiming for 4 bowel movements/day and was also started on empiric antibiotic coverage since she had a leukocytosis with the AMS including acyclovir, vancomycin, ampillicin, and ceftriaxone.
The patient then had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed dilated common bile duct, so she underwent a HIDA scan which ruled out cholangitis as a cause of her AMS and leukocytosis.
At that point, ampicillin was discontinued and the patient was continued on vanc/acyclovir, flagyl/ceftriaxone was added for intra abdominal pathology.
As the patient's mental status slowly improved, the acyclovir was stopped, as the concern for encephalitis lessened.
# Acute Renal Failure: The patient was found to be in ARF (baseline creatinine is around 0.9) and presented with creat 5.2.
FeNa of 0.22 consistent with prerenal etiology and muddy brown casts were found in the urine sediment suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
With significant liver dysfunction hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) was of concern.
She underwent a renal ultrasound which was normal and an albumin challenge which ruled out hepatorenal syndrome.
# Aspiration pneumonia:  She developed aspiration pneumonia on [**11-17**] with a rising leukocytosis.
Leukocytosis remained elevated despite HCAP treatment and so WBCs thought most likely related to alcoholic hepatitis rather than infectious etiology.
# Upper GI bleed (UGIB): Presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), and a Hematocrit trending down 33 -> 30.
Flex Sig was completed given concern for rectal bleed which showed grade 2 hemorrhoids and multiple recto-sigmoid polyps.
Polyps were not removed because of elevated INR and tenuous Alc Hep.
Repeat colonoscopy deferred to outpatient after improvement in hepatitis and coagulopathy.
# Anion Gap Acidosis: She is noted to have a gap of 18 upon admission labs.
Given BUN unlikely to be uremia, but possible contribution of acute renal failure.
Also possible alcoholic/starvation ketosis.
# Sodium imbalance: She likely had hypervolemic hyponatremia due to liver dysfunction.
She later developed hypernatremia while she was on tube feeds only for aspiration.
After hepatitis and HCAP improved/resolved her Na remained stable requiring no further intervention.
# Macrocytic Anemia: With significant alcohol use she is likely either folate or B12 deficient.
# Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): she has a history of duodenal ulcers and was continued on pantoprazole.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 5. hydrocortisone 2.5 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal PRN (as needed) as needed for rectal irritation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: hepatic encephalopathy acute kidney injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were more confused than your baseline and there was concern that you had bleeding from your intestines.
We did not find that there was any significant bleeding in your intestines and the levels of your blood stayed steady.
When your liver disease progresses, a condition called cirrhosis, your body builds up toxic substances.
Finally, you developed a pneumonia because when you swallow the food sometimes goes into your lungs.
