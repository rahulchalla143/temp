History of Present Illness: 37F with complex medical history well known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] who presents with a 6 day history of SOB that limited her ADLs.
She was evaluated in the ER at [**Hospital **] Hospital where she underwent an extensive workup revealing no problems.
Past Medical History: Gardners Syndrome Uterine fibroid s/p myomectomy- [**2118**] Desmoid tumor resection- [**2121**] Right Breast mass, s/p excision- [**2125**] Total Colectomy w/ ileostomy- [**2126-8-5**] s/p port-a-cath placment Atrial tachycardia secondary to doxarubacin toxicity h/o DVT LLE- [**2127**] h/o Hodgkins, s/p MOPP chemo- [**2117**] GERD   Social History: Pt is single, w/o children.
Left ostomy bag draining liquid stool contents.
Abdomen is firm and tender to superficial palpation.
She was started on antibiotics for empiric coverage.
A new draining site was noted on exam in proximity to her old midline fistula site.
A KUB was completed to evaluate renal stent position b/c she was complaining of urinary frequency.
AT HD 4 she was afebrile and doing well.
Fistula sites had increased drainage.
At HD 7 a fistulagram was completed which showed no clear relationship between the abscess and the bowel.
At HD 10 she was taken to CT for attempted drainage of the abdominal abscess.
She was found to have a proximal small bowel obstruction and the procedure was not performed.
At HD 11 she was (+) bilious vomiting.
KUB showed evidence of small bowel obstruction.
Abdominal pain was increased and a PCA was provided for pain management.
At HD 14 the abdominal abscess formed a fluctuent area which was drained of purulent fluid via aspiration and sent for culture.
CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis was performed which showed a high-grade obstruction of the proximal jejunum with transition point in the mid abdomen.
She was managed conservatively with NGT decompression, which was removed at HD 25 due to decreased output and patient discomfort.
She continued to have emesis each morning, but did not want the NGT replaced.
On [**6-9**] she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (4 hours enterectomy enteroenterostomy), resection of desmoid times 1, of the abdominal wall with enterectomy, closure of enterotomy and enteroenterostomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].
On [**6-15**] the path report showed skin and subcutaneous tissue with mets described as well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Likewise there was adenocarcinoma involving the wall of the small intestine/desmoid tumor.
Cells where positive for CK20 and CDX2, negative for CK7, suggesting an intestinal primary site.
[**6-15**] Path: Skin and subcutaneous tissue with mets well/mod-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Metastatic well- to moderately-diff'd adenoCA involving wall of small intestine/desmoid tumor.
Cells positive for CK 20 and CDX2, negative for CK 7 -> suggestive of an intestinal primary site.
She had an upper gi with small bowel follow through which visualized the tumor in the 2nd and 3rd portions of the duodenum.
Urine analysis showed yeast in the urine for which she was placed on diflucan.
She also had a CT scan to rule out any abdominal source for the fever.
The CT scan showed some old contrast from the upper gi, but no evidence of a current leak.
The patient remained afebrile after this point and was tolerating PO intake.
Desmoid with intestinal obstruction and gastrointestinal cutaneous fistula.
Duodenal adenocarcinoma 3.
Abdominal Abscess 4.
Nausea, vomitting or the inability to pass stool 3.
Abdominal Pain  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in his clinic on Friday, [**7-24**] at 2:45.
