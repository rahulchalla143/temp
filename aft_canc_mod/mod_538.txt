Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2180-2-18**] at 900am  Post bypass  Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine, milrinone and norepinephrine.
RV systolic function is slightly improved.
RAS    Final Report INDICATION: 72-year-old female with coronary artery bypass graft.
Please assess for renal artery stenosis.
FINDINGS: There is a moderate right pleural effusion as visualized on the prior CT from [**2180-2-14**].
There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
The main renal artery on the right shows normal flow, brisk upstroke and normal waveform with antegrade diastolic flow.
Evaluation of the interlobar artery is limited secondary to respiratory artifact.
LEFT KIDNEY: The left kidney measures 12.9 cm.
The main renal artery on the left shows normal flow, brisk upstroke and normal waveforms with antegrade diastolic flow.
Evaluation of the interlobar arteries is very limited secondary to respiratory artifact.
The study is limited secondary to respiratory artifact.
However, within those limitations, there is no evidence of renal artery stenosis bilaterally.
Moderate right pleural effusion as visualized on the CT from [**2180-2-14**].
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-22**], there is continued prominence of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis.
The upper lung zones are clear and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
She was on heparin and underwent cardiac cath on [**2-14**] which revealed severe left and right sided diastolic dysfunction with severe pulmonary hypertension.
She also had three vessel disease which included an 80% distal left main lesion and a totally occluded RCA.
She was unable to have an IABP secondary to bilateral iliac disease.
She was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on POD#3 but continued to require aggressive pulomnary tiolet due to underlying lung disease.
She was treated with betablockers, and diuresis for acute on chronic diastyloic heart failure.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] developed acute renal failure with a doubling of her creatinine and low urine output.
Renal was consulted and a renal ultrasound was done revealing no renal artery stenosis.
A small area of incisional erythema was noted at the distal aspect of her incision and per recommendation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] a 7 day course of keflex was started.
