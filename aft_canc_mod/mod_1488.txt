Chronic low back pain.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old male, with a history of end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas, who had been awaiting a liver transplant and had actually been admitted to the hospital towards the end of [**Month (only) **] for elective orthotopic liver transplantation, but unfortunately secondary to an inappropriate donor, Mr. [**Known lastname 17391**] liver transplantation was cancelled.
He represented on [**12-6**] after a suitable donor had been found for elective orthotopic liver transplantation.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there was no note of intraoperative complication.
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for ventilatory support and intensive monitoring.
NEUROLOGIC:  Neurologically, the patient's pain was    controlled with a variety of combinations of intravenous    and oral narcotics.
His chronic low back pain continued    to be an issue throughout his hospitalization, but prior    to his discharge we were able to sustain him on a regimen    of methadone 5 mg po bid, in addition to 5 mg of oxycodone    q 6 h as needed for breakthrough pain on top of his    Neurontin he had been taking.
The patient's pain was    controlled adequately with this regimen.
Notably during late in the second week of his hospitalization, the patient developed mental status changes which were characterized by increased lethargy and difficulty in rousing the patient.
He was transferred immediately to the Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation, and after a thorough work-up which included CT scan of the head which showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, it was felt that this was most likely secondary to cyclosporin toxicity along with the narcotics that the patient had been receiving.
The patient recovered from this quite well, and prior to his discharge he was alert and oriented, completely lucid, and otherwise had no neurologic deficits and, as noted, had good pain control.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient was supported with a ventilator    in the initial postoperative period from which he was able    to wean successfully without complication.
Notably, he    did develop bilateral pleural effusions throughout the    course of his hospitalization, but after diuresis, these    effusions significantly improved.
The patient otherwise    had no significant pulmonary complications.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's cardiovascular status was    tenuous in the initial postoperative period requiring some    vasopressor support with Neo-Synephrine, but after    adequate volume resuscitation in the immediate    perioperative period, we were able to wean off    vasopressors, and the patient was able to maintain an    adequate blood pressure with peripheral perfusion pressure    without any sort of pharmacologic support.
Follow-up biopsies evidenced no evidence of    acute cellular rejection, and the patient's liver function    tests continued to remain steady and within normal limits    throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
His    course was notably complicated by some stenosis and    thrombosis of the portal vein which required angiography    with thrombolysis and stenting secondary to acutely rising    LFTs on [**2140-1-3**].
The patient's    postoperative course was notably complicated by a    persistent ascites leak which was discovered on [**12-20**], [**2139**] after bedside exploration, and a fascial wound    dehiscence was discovered.
His wound was subsequently cared    for with a combination of wet-to-dry dressing changes and    placement of a wound VAC.
FEN:  The patient's nutritional status continued to be a    problem given his malnourished state at the onset, along    with his postoperative complications of pneumonia and    wound dehiscence.
The patient's renal status remained steady, and his creatinine remained around its baseline of 1.0, although while in the Intensive Care Unit, in the second week postoperatively, he did develop acute renal failure which was felt to be secondary to drug toxicity and intravascular volume depletion.
His renal function though did recover to its baseline without long-term complication.
HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient did suffer from blood loss    anemia for which he was transfused appropriately.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's main infectious disease    issues included a left lower lobe pneumonia, for which he    was treated appropriately with broad-spectrum antibiotics    including Zosyn.
Notably, he was colonized with VRE, although    there was never any focal infection with this, and    patient's MRSA screens were negative.
The patient's wound    grew out E. coli.
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal, with a pulse in the 60s, a blood pressure in the 110s, satting 95 percent on room air, with blood sugars between the 70s and 130s.
His lungs were clear bilaterally with only a slight decrease at the left base.
His abdomen was soft and nontender.
He had a 3 cm triangular wound underneath the subcostal margin at the bifurcation of the incision.
This was granulating in well at the base, there was no purulence, and a VAC was applied with good seal.
His abdomen was otherwise soft, mildly distended, but nontender, and he had only 1 plus peripheral edema.
