Multiple irregular filling defects were noted in the CBD, CHD and the right and left main intrahepatic ducts Pus and clots were extracted with balloon sweeps from the CBD, CHD and the left main intrahepatic ducts.
Large amount of bright red bleeding was noted after the last balloon sweep.
No further bleeding was noted.
Recommendations: Pt will be admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for monitoring If further bleeding occurs, pt will need angiography No aspirin or NSAIDs Continue with broad coverage IV antibiotics  [**2175-9-16**] 09:05AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-3.29* Hgb-9.8* Hct-28.9* MCV-88 MCH-29.7 MCHC-33.7 RDW-16.8* Plt Ct-236 [**2175-9-14**] 03:58AM BLOOD ALT-66* AST-81* LD(LDH)-115 AlkPhos-237* Amylase-108* TotBili-8.2* [**2175-9-15**] 08:10AM BLOOD ALT-64* AST-73* LD(LDH)-146 AlkPhos-276* TotBili-4.5* [**2175-9-16**] 09:05AM BLOOD ALT-61* AST-64* AlkPhos-287* TotBili-3.1* [**2175-9-16**] 10:24AM BLOOD ALT-60* AST-62* AlkPhos-282* TotBili-2.8* [**2175-9-13**] 09:00AM BLOOD CA [**84**]-9 -Test Pending  Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname 83712**] is a 66 year-old gentleman with locally-advanced cholangiocarcinoma who underwent ERCP due to concern for evolving cholangitis, with bleeding after stent manipulation, who was transferred to the ICU for monitoring after tamponade with expanding stent in effort to control bleeding from the billiary tree (see ERCP report).He was transferred to the medical floor on [**2175-9-14**].
Bleeding from ampula: Pt was mildly tachy at presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and while this resolved somewhat was still midly tachy at time of call out.
Pt was given 5mg Vit K for slightly elevated INR of 1.7.
At time of call-out to floor there was no evidence of active or large volume bleeding and pt had improvement in abdominal pain.
Pt did have elevated Tbili from 1.8 -> 8.2 likely [**2-14**] to bleeding and biliary dysfunction from the regional trauma related to the proceedure.
Full liquid diet with diabetic restrictions were started in the evening of [**9-14**].
Cholangitis w/ bacteremia:  Leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, RUQ pain - likely from cholangitis.
Clinic blood Cx from [**9-13**] came back with gram negative rods which speciated as ESBL E. Coli on [**2175-9-16**] sensitive to Meropenem on which he was started.
Tachycardia: likely due to underlying infection and possibly volume depletion.
Pt remained intermittently in mild sinus tach while in unit.
Diabetes Mellitus Type II: oral hypoglycemics were held and pt was maintained on ISS.
Cholangiocarcinoma: no acute issues st this time.
Disp:*12 gram* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cholangitis ESBL E. Coli bacteremia GI Bleeding post ERCP (ampullary bleed) s/p 3U PRBC Cholangiocarcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with cholangitis and recurrent biliary obstruction.
This was complicated by ampullary bleeding for which you recevied 3U PRBC and were observed in ICU.
You were subsequently found to have bacteremia with extended spectrum beta lactam (ESBL) resistant E. Coli infection for which Meropenem was initiated on [**2175-9-16**] after empiric treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn from [**9-13**] to [**9-16**].
