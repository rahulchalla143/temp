Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of gastric carcinoma and recent radial/ulnar fracture s/p surgical repair on Lovenox who presented with dark stool x 1 week and hematocrit drop.
NG lavage was positive for grossly black/melenotic return.
Melenotic fluid was noted on NG lavage but cleared after ~240cc of saline flush.
She has a reported history of gastric neoplasm though details are unknown as the lesion has never been biopsied; this may be the source of her bleed.
In addition, she has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, which raises the possibility of variceal bleed.
Patient had EGD on [**5-2**] which showed 3 cord grade 1 esophageal varices, a 2 cm submucosal mass in the stomach, and superficial non-bleeding ulcers at the duodenum.
# S/P SURGICAL REPAIR OF RADIAL/ULNAR FRACTURE: Patient had mechanical fall with resulting displaced fracture of left radius/ulna, s/p surgical repair on [**2165-4-25**].
She continued with calcium and vitamin D.  # CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS: MELD was 15 during prior admission (LFTs pending).
She has no known history of variceal bleed but records may be incomplete.
# GASTRIC NEOPLASM: Details unknown; per [**Date Range 2287**] records, this was a submucosal mass noted on EGD in [**2160**] but in a difficult position for biopsy, so none was undertaken.
Per patient and family, it seems she has no history of severe GIB, but EGD report does make note of overlying ulceration with bleeding treated with clips.
No further work up of mass has been undertaken and patient has been asymptomatic.
# Increased pulmonary interstitial marking.
Minimal to no symptoms.
