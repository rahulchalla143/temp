#Afib -- She has had decreased po intake for the last 2 weeks due to mouth pain   resulting in severe hypovolemia on presentation.
The combination of hypovolemia and medication noncompliance likely led to her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
She was started on Toprol XL in an effort to improve medication compliance with once-daily dosing.
#CAD -- No active ischemia.
#Oral cancer -- Much of patient's problems have come from her inability to take medications secondary to severe oral pain and odynophagia s/p XRT.
The dose was increased to 50mcg but she had mild delirium with this dose, so she was dropped back down to her home regimen.
In addition, she was offered lidocaine swish and swallow as well as GelClair and magic mouthwash for symptomatic relief.
#Renal insufficiency -- Baseline cr 0.5-0.8, Cr decreased fom 1 to 0.6 with IV hydration initially.
#Anemia -- Microcytic anemia with baseline hematocrit of 26-30.
# Leukopenia:  Her WBC count was noted to be 1.7 the day after admission.
She had 1 isolated temperature of 100.4, but no infectious symptoms.
Her leukopenia in combination with her anemia may be suspicious for MDS.
