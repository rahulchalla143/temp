At that time, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular spread;  he underwent EVD placement and a ventriculocisternostomy for clot retrieval and was placed on keppra.
?completely back to normal except for some mild cognitive changes.??????
In [**Month (only) 216**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40029**] developed nausea and vomiting.
Noncontrast head CT revealed right frontal new hypodense area with rim of hyperdensity in the area of prior flair hyperintensity ([**7-19**]) which was concerning for evolving hemorrhage versus abcess.
The left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage showed good resolution.
The patient was admitted to the [**Month/Year (2) 878**] service and had a thorough work-up for a CNS cause of his nausea and vomiting.
MRI suggested that the R frontal lesion represented scar tissue from prior premature removal of EVD by the patient.
The overall conclusion by the [**Month/Year (2) 878**] team was that the patient had an unrelated (likely GI viral) cause of his nausea and vomiting.
and had weakness of the left face, arm, and leg ??????
