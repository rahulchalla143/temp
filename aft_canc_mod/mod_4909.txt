There is profound vasogenic edema affecting nearly the entire left frontal and parietal lobes, and to a lesser extent, the left temporal lobe.
Additionally, there is 10 mm of left to right midline shift.
The left lateral ventricle is also mildly effaced.
There is no evidence of entrapment.
Minimal mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe lesion as described above, with surrounding vasogenic edema, sulcal and left lateral ventricular effacement, and 1-cm left to right midline shift, without significant change from outside hospital studies performed earlier this same date.
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic (patient has history of renal cell carcinoma) vs primary lesion.
Hemorrhage seen at the site of biopsy in the inferior aspect of the necrotic mass with hemorrhage tracking along the path of biopsy.
There is no increase in mass effect or edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] presented with neurologic symptoms and signs, namely right-sided clumsiness and speech diffciulties, that localized to the left cerebral hemisphere.
CT head was performed in the ED, revealing a small ring-like hemorrhage with disproportionate edema, concerning for underlying mass.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] previously had renal cell carcinoma without evidence of metastasis, however, we considered that this was a likely source of the probable underlying tumor giving rise to bleeding and edema.
Post op head CT revealed small hemorrhage along the biopsy tract.
Steroid treatment resulted in improvement of word finding difficulty.
Intracerebral hemorrhage.
This did not show evidence of recurrence of cancer in your abdomen.
Given concern for a tumor in your brain at the site of bleeding, a brain biopsy was performed.
