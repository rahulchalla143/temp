Minimal clot was aspirated back leading to the placement of the stent and a question of whether the embolus was tumor in origin.
There were emboli in the right pulmonary artery leading to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery and the left mean pulmonary artery leading to the left lower lobe pulmonary artery.
On [**10-9**], the patient became increasing hypoxic and was electively intubated.
Also, on the 12th, a chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
On the [**10-11**], the patient became increasing hypoxic and required 100% 02 which was slowly weaned down to FIO2 40% over the next few days.
On [**10-16**], the patient underwent a trial of nitric oxide without any change in her cardiac output or urine output or her pulmonary vascular resistance.
On [**10-22**], the patient had a worsening of her left lower lobe infiltrate and required increasing amounts of oxygen but stabilized on 60% FIO2 with PEEP of 10.
All showed approximately the same thing, an ejection fraction of greater than 60% with a hyperdynamic LV and RV that showed abnormal septal motion consistent with volume or pressure overload and [**Last Name (un) **] sign on admission, all pointing to an acute pulmonary process.
On electrocardiogram on admission, the patient had an S in lead I, a Q3 in the T3 which cleared after the suction thrombectomy and stent placement.
Subsequently, the S1, Q3, T3 pattern returned with presumed repeated PE's either breakup of the initial PE or with PE's breaking through the IVC filter.
On [**10-9**], when the patient was intubated, the patient became hypotensive and required Levophed at low doses to maintain her blood pressure.
On the [**10-11**], the patient became acutely hypotensive and required three pressors, Levophed, Neo-Synephrine and vasopressin.
On [**10-14**], the patient was given stress dose steroids for persistent hypotension.
The Swan numbers were consistent with right heart failure with ventricular interdependence.
On [**10-24**], the patient had a drop in her blood pressure and had crackles on pulmonary exam.
A Swan was placed at that time that showed non cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Levophed therapy was initiated for hypotension.
From a hematologic point of view, the patient was started on heparin upon admission for her pulmonary embolus.
The patient has received multiple transfusions with a transfusion criteria ranging from 23 to 27 depending on the past volume status.
From an Infectious Disease point of view, on [**10-9**], the chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
On [**10-11**], the patient had a positive urine culture for Citrobacter pansensitive and therapy was not adjusted.
However, on the 14th, the patient became hypotensive as noted previously.
On [**10-19**], Diflucan was started for a presumed urinary tract infection.
The cultures revealed yeast in the sputum and urine.
Staph aureus grew out in the sputum that was previously sent and at that time ceftazidime was again initiated because the patient continued to be febrile.
On [**10-25**], an Infectious Disease consult was obtained and also on the 28th the sensitivities returned on the Staph aureus and the sputum as methicillin resistant to Staph aureus.
Also of note, upwards of 12 blood cultures including isolator bottles were sent and no cultures were ever positive.
Since the 28th, the patient has remained afebrile on monotherapy of vancomycin for the presumed Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Renal:  The patient had decreased urine output starting on [**10-11**], the day she became hypotensive and required three pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
On [**10-15**], urine electrolytes were consistent with prerenal and examining the urine revealed no casts.
On [**10-21**], Lasix therapy was initiated with good effect for agitation, agitation being defined as increased respiratory rate and tachycardia likely secondary to dyspnea.
Fluid status:  The patient has low albumin, which has come down since admission and remains low.
This has lead to intervascular volume depletion and extravascular volume increase.
On [**10-14**], steroids were given for persistent hypotension and were discontinued two days later.
The patient is diabetic and has been on a regular insulin sliding scale throughout her admission with fingersticks q.i.d.
Intermittently, the patient has required an insulin drip for persistent hyperglycemia.
Also, the patient is hypothyroid and has been on her standing outpatient Synthroid dose since admission.
Numbers quoted were 2% risk of rupture per month.
