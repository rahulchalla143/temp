CTA showed bilateral PE, no RV strain.

The variable ventricular response suggests atrial fibrillation (atrial flutter).
No significant change compared to the previous tracing except that the current ventricular response is more variable suggesting the combination of atrial fibrillation and flutter.
EKG [**2175-9-11**]: The rate is much slower with persistent flutter/fibrillation waves with a regular ventricular response suggesting conducted atrial fibrillation.
CXR [**2175-9-11**]: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
CTA Chest [**2175-9-11**]: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary emboli involving the right middle and lower lobar as well as left lower lobar pulmonary arteries without evidence of right heart strain.
Small bilateral simple pleural effusions are slightly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old female with end stage gastric adenocarcinoma with metastases to peritpneum and a history of atrial flutter requesting comfort measures only who presents with atrial flutter and PE prior to placement of PleurX abdominal catheter.
Because she was symptomatic from her atrial flutter, it was deemed reasonable to rate control her.
There was no evidence of hemodynamic compromise or RV strain.
Also explained that because of her cancer, she has a high risk of developing more clots even while on coumadin.
Recurrent ascites: Likely secondary to malignancy.
Patient underwent PleurX abdominal catheter placement [**2175-9-14**] for palliation.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you were about to have a catheter placed in your abdomen to drain extra fluid, you developed an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
We controlled you heart rhythm with medications, and placed the catheter.
After discussing treatment options, which include frequent blood draws or injections, you decided this did not fit with your goals of care and declined treatment.
- START Zofran 4mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea - STOP Amlodipine - STOP Hydrochlorothiazide - STOP Furosemide (Lasix)  No other changes were made to your medications.
