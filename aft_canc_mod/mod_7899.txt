The surgery was performed electively and occurred without complications.
On POD1 the patient developed hypotension and bradycardia with blood pressures as low as 60's/40'2 with a heart rate in the low 50s despite being completely asymptomatic.
At that time she began having loose bowel movements.
On POD 2 she had blood pressures in the normal range but continued to have very loose/watery bowel movements over 20 times that day.
The patient remained afebrile and C.diff cultures were negative.
POD3 the patient developed fever to 103.8, tachy to the 130s, and increased tachypnea all with a stable BP.
Ms. [**Known lastname 92753**] was worked up for causes of fever but continued to look poor clinically and was transferred to the ICU for more highly monitored care.
UrCx and BlCx were positive for GNRs (aerobic and anaerobic) and she was started on cefepime/flagyl.
POD 4 she underwent barium enema with fluoroscopy and was found to have a colonic leak at/near the site of anastomosis.
On POD 5, she went into atrial fibrillation which did not respond to medical cardioversion.
She remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic throughout, and was successfully electrically cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm the afternoon of POD 7.
Her WBC became elevated and remained elevated despite antibiotic therapy; chest xray was negative for pulmonary causes of infection, but urine studies were positive for a coagulase negative staph sensitive to vancomycin.
She stayed on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl but continued to have persistent elevated WBC; a CT scan of her pelvis revealed a pericolic abscess that could be the culprit.
CT guided drainage of the pericolic abscess was placed on hold indefinitely as she remained asymptomatic with downtrending WBC.
