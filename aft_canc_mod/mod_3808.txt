diabetic male vasculopath with multiple medical conditions (including Afib on coumadin) presenting with upper GI Bleed.
He thought this would pass, but upon awakening on [**10-24**] he again noted nausea and dry heaving, and his wife called EMS.
His ECG had lateral ST depressions and he was having SSCP.
Coronary Artery disease s/p cath [**2133-6-1**].
Left circumflex had a long 60% stenosis and the RCA had 70-80% sequential high grade stenosis.
CHF (systolic) with EF of 30%.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 4.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed 12 years ago on insulin 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
Rheumatoid arthritis 7.
Chronic renal insuffeciency- Baseline creatinine is 1.5.
Carotid stenosis on the right ICA 9.
His wife has severe sciatica and is limited in mobility.
Can speak in full sentences with mild dyspnea.
Pulm: CTA b/l ABD: Soft NT, ND Ext: No edema.
Slow cap refill but 1+ DP b/l.
LVH with lateral (V3-6) ST depressions new and different compared with baseline strain pattern.
[**2133-10-27**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall and distal halves of the anterior septum and anterior wall.
The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic and overall systolic function is moderately reduced.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
male diabetic vasculopath with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear in [**5-26**], known unrevascularized 3VD, Ischemic CM with EF 30%, CKD presents with hematemesis, acute renal failure and chest pain.
The patient was thought to be having a massive UGIB leading which lead to an NSTEMI in the setting of a hct of 23.
1) GI Bleed: Likely upper GI by hematemesis and NG Lavage with coffee grounds.
He was seen by GI on admission who felt that this was a likely UGI source (he subsequently had guaiac positive stools).
Given cardiac enzyme leak in the setting of this demand, scope was delayed until hemodynamics stabilized.
2) CAD with known 3VD now w/ NSTEMI.
He began to have chest pain on admission with cardiac enzyme leak.
After blood transfusions, chest pain resolved.
Cardiology felt that a cath was not warrented given the patients lack of anginal symptoms (when hct normal).
If abnormalities seen that correlate with RCA, they would consider intervention.
3) Acute renal failure/FEN.
Renal insufficiency likely in setting of poor forward flow and blood loss.
4) Ischemic Cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, global HK.
TTE was repeated to determine if he had any new wall motion abnormalities that would suggest focal plaque rupture (vs. demand ischemia).
Cardiology felt that a cath at this point was unnecessary.
They recommened possible outpatient stress as if area of abnormalitiy correlated with RCA they would consider intervention.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual q 5 minutes for 3 doses: please take every 5 minutes x 3 doses if chest pain.
call 911 if pain does not resolve.
