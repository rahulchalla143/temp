A CT/CTA of the head showed no acute process.
She exhibited no residual neuro deficits and maintained her baseline neuro status for 24 hours following this event.
No erythema, induration, or drainage.
Extremities: Nontender, mildly edematous, no cyanosis.
Pertinent Results: Labs on discharge: [**2180-9-28**] 05:25AM BLOOD WBC-5.3 RBC-2.90* Hgb-8.9* Hct-27.1* MCV-94 MCH-30.7 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.5 Plt Ct-369 [**2180-9-28**] 05:25AM BLOOD Glucose-106* UreaN-15 Creat-1.3* Na-142 K-3.9 Cl-101 HCO3-35* AnGap-10 [**2180-9-28**] 05:25AM BLOOD Calcium-8.3* Phos-4.2 Mg-2.4  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT [**9-27**]: There is no acute hemorrhage, large areas of edema, or mass effect.
There is asymmetric atrophy of the right cerebral hemisphere and cystic encephalomalacia with porencephalic changes of the right temporal lobe, likely related to patient's prior stroke.
Asymmetric enlargement of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name **] and lateral ventricle is most consistent with ex vacuo effect.
A VP shunt via right posterior frontal lobe approach ends in the left lateral ventricle near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) **].
Significant streak artifact from an aneurysm clip at the right MCA limits [**Last Name (un) 13963**] in the immediate adjacent areas.
A CT/CTA of the head (prelim read by rads and neuro) showed no acute process.
She has no residual neuro deficits and has now returned to her baseline neuro status.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: -endometrial cancer -s/p laparoscopic converted to open total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, cystoscopy -acute on chronic renal failure -pneumonia -acute neurologic event, likely due to hypoxia/hypoventilation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Call your doctor for: * fever > 100.4 * severe abdominal pain * difficulty urinating * vaginal bleeding requiring >1 pad/hr * abnormal vaginal discharge * redness or drainage from incision * nausea/vomiting where you are unable to keep down fluids/food or your medication  Incision care: * You may shower and allow soapy water to run over incision; no scrubbing of incision.
You developed acute worsening of your kidney function while in the hospital.
You had an acute change in consciousness POD#9.
Based on assessment by neurology this was most likely due to low levels of oxygen from not taking deep breaths.
A CT scan was done of your brain and there was no sign of a stroke.
The neurologists do not believe that you had a stroke or seizure and would like to follow up with you after you leave the hospital.
