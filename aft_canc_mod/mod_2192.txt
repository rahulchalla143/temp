Admission Date:  [**2121-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-7-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-1-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Leukine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Right Lower extremity weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**7-7**]: T11 Vertebrectomy   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 42367**] is a 37 y/o female who underwent excision of a 0.7 mm thick superficial spreading melanoma from her right shoulder in [**2112**].
In [**2115-5-6**], she developed a recurrence in the right mandible and staging CT scan revealed multiple nodules in the lung, liver and spleen which were FDG avid on PET scan.
Biopsy revealed metastatic melanoma.
In [**2117-12-6**], she developed spinal cord compression in the thoracic and lumbar spine due to a large soft tissue mass presumed to be melanoma treated with radiation therapy.
She then developed a new spine lesion, which was causing cord compression.
In [**11-11**], she noted a soft tissue nodule in her right side with torso CT on [**2121-4-5**] showing a right superior pelvic subcutaneous enhancing nodule worrisome for a metastatic focus.
FNA on [**2121-6-4**] reveals poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with melanoma.
Spine MRI and radiation therapy records were reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] of radiation oncology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] of neurosurgery with conscensus being that she has spinal cord compression without neurologic compromise.
Over the past 3-4 days she has noted increasing weakness in the right leg; however, she denies falls or bowel/bladder incontinence.
She also describes a vague numbness over the right leg below the knee.
She returns to the ED for evaluation of these symptoms.
Past Medical History: metastatic melanoma s/p IL-2 therapy, radiation therapy, and recent start of CTLA-4 antibody compassionate use trial  PSH: [**2119**] spinal metastatic lesion resection and placement of thoraco-lumbar fusion construct [**2112**] melanoma resection  Social History: LIVES WITH HUSBAND / PARENTS IN TOWN FOR ASSISTANCE  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.

No significant change in the 1.3 x 0.9 cm enhancing lesion in the left occipital condyle, presumed metastatic lesion in the left occipital condyle.
Osseous integrity of this lesion is not well assessed on the present study.
No new lesions are noted.
Study severely limited due to hardware artifacts.
Within these limitations, there is a large mass, with compression fractures involving the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies, causing severe canal stenosis and severe cord compression.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Specifically, within the right upper lobe, there are two 2 mm subpleural nodule (2:15), and (2:27).
Within the left lower lobe, there is a 6 mm somewhat linear appearing opacity (2:28).
There is also a 3 mm nodule within the left lower lobe (2:45).
Within the left upper lobe, there is a 2 mm pulmonary nodule (2:33).
There is no pleural effusion.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Area of hypodensity adjacent to fissure of ligamentum teres likely reflects perfusion differences.
Within the kidneys, there is an ill-defined low attenuation within the medial upper poles bilaterally, right greater than left, similar in appearance to [**2121-4-5**], which likely reflects renal cortical atrophy.
Assessment is slightly limited due to streak artifact from adjacent hardware.
There is no intra- abdominal lymphadenopathy, free fluid, or free air.
There is a trace amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES: Spinal rods are present throughout the thoracic spine, with bipedicular screws spanning T5-6, T8-10, and L1-2.
Evaluation is slightly limited due to metallic streak artifact.
Again noted is an abnormal soft tissue density within the T11-T12 vertebral bodies, extending into the central canal, better assessed on MRI of the thoracic spine obtained concurrently.
Additionally, there is destruction of the vertebral bodies at these levels.
There continues to be a trabecular irregularity of the right sacral ala as well as within the superior aspect of the right acetabulum and adjacent ilium.
Sclerotic focus within the left ilium is also unchanged.
Within the soft tissues, there is a 1.8 cm x 1.8 cm enhancing nodule located within the subcutaneous tissues of the right pelvis (2:86), immediately superior to the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**].
Additionally, there is irregular stranding of the right axillary soft tissues, similar in appearance to [**2121-4-5**].

MR THORACIC SPINE  HISTORY: 37-year-old woman with malignant melanoma, spinal metastasis, status post tumor resection.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to CT of the thoracic spine from the same date as well as the preoperative MR of the thoracic spine from [**2121-7-5**].
This study is markedly limited due to patient motion and artifacts from the posterior cervical spinal fusion instrumentation.
No large residual tumor is identified, but the evaluation again is markedly limited.
There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
No definite gross tumor residual remaining, although the evaluation is markedly limited by patient motion and artifacts from instrumented fusion.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a spinal arteriogram from [**2121-7-7**], CT of the chest from [**2121-7-6**] and MR of the thoracic spine from [**2121-7-5**].
The previously seen large mass in this region is no longer visualized, although the evaluation is somewhat limited due to streak artifacts from the adjacent spinal hardware.
New subcutaneous staples are seen in the midline.
There are also small areas of subcutaneous emphysema of the posterior soft tissues.
There is no abnormal angulation of the thoracic spine.
No other suspicious lytic lesions are seen.
There is a right internal jugular central line whose tip is in the superior vena cava.
The visualized lungs show bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions and scattered band-like densities which may represent atelectasis or scarring.
IMPRESSION: Status post surgical resection of large T11 mass, now with postoperative air-fluid level in this region.
There are no gross tumor residual although the evaluation is limited due to streak artifact from the adjacent orthopedic hardware.

This was not associated with any bowel or bladder incontinence.
She is know to have metestatic melenoma to the spine and has had RT to this area in the past.
She underwent the procedure and awoke from anesthesia without complication.
The foley needed to be replaced due to urinary retention and a liter was drained after the catheter was replaced.
They re-evaluated her on [**2121-7-12**] and recommended>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Post operatively she had a CT scan of the T spine for eval of instrumentation as well as an MRi to evaluate residual tumor burden.
