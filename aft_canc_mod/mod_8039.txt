Admission Date:  [**2113-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-6-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**] Chief Complaint: s/p cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central venous catheter placement cardiopulmonary resuscitation endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 86 yo M with history of metastatic prostate cancer with bilateral nephrostomy tube and recent diagnosis of malignancy in chest, initially presenting with altered mentatl status, who had an asystolic cardiac arrest in the ED, and is now transferred to MICU post-arrest.
The CXR that was done pre-arrest showed bilateral plerual effusions and interstitial edema.
A bedside echo showed no RV strain.
Only exam finding before code was mild abdominal pain.
In MICU, the patient was initially non-responsive, with only corneal reflexes present.
Subsequently, he withdrew to pain in all extremities.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma to bone with local extension to bladder and rectum also complicated by bilateral hydronephrosis s/p nephrostomy tubes.
- Recently diagnosed extensive intrathoracic malignancy - Coronary artery disease - Atrial fibrillation (previously on coumadin) - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Type 2 Diabetes - Pleural effusion s/p right thoracenteses x 2 in the past month   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has 8 children who live nearby and are involved in his care.
He is a Jehovah's Witness and notes that his faith plays a central role in his life.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: bilateral nephrostomy tubes in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 1+ bilateral LE edema Neuro: Non-responsive to sternal rub or painful stimuli.
Does not move any extremity initially.
No acute intracranial process.
Opacification of the left mastoid air cells .
Clinical correlation is recommended to assess for mastoiditis.
Worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
Increased opacity at the lung bases bilaterally may be a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis.
However, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer and recent diagnosis of extensive intrathoracic malignancy, initially presenting with altered mental status, who had asystolic cardiac arrest in the emergency department.
However given his extensive comorbidity combined with grave prognosis and failure to respond to supportive measures, it was ultimately decided by the family to focus on comfort measures and the patient was terminally extubated and died on [**2113-6-13**].
Family meeting on [**6-9**] demonstrated that they were not ready to withdraw life support and were hoping for a miracle.
Patient's FAST exam was negative in the ER and blood cultures on admission were positive which suggests septic shock as possible cause of asystole.
He was not cooled, and MRI the following day did not show any signs of anoxic brain injury.
# Hypotension: Vital signs were normal on initial presentation but he became hypotensive requiring Levophed for blood pressure support s/p arrest.
His hypotension could be related to cardiac stunning in setting of recent arrest but was more likely related to underlying sepsis.
Echo was orderd in the ICU which showed focal regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Aneurysmal interatrial septum.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension with at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mildly dilated right ventricle.
Very small pericardial effusion.
With acute renal failure and poor urine output, and hypervolemia on exam, the patient was transitioned to low dose dopamine gtt with lasix boluses on [**2113-6-8**], which improved his blood pressures and his creatinine 1.8 --> 1.7 with good urine output (100cc/hr X2-3 hours with each bolus).
He did have a near arrest on CPAP and required reinitiation of full vent support.
The patient was gradually transitioned back from Assist Control to PSV with thoughts that intermittent tachypnea due to central process and some discomfort that responded to Fentanyl 25mcg boluses.
# Altered mental status: Initially likely toxic-metabolic process in setting of medical illness/UTI.
CT head was non-focal, and MRI after arrest without signs of hypoxic brain injury.
# Urinary tract infection: U/A consistent with infection.
# Bacteremia: Grew strep viridans from BCx.
Mechanical complications of this malignancy could underlie arrest, although echo in ED does not support this, and hypoxemia seems more likely given rapid return of spontaneous circulation.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently not on any treatment.
