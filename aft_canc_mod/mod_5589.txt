Likely multifactorial etiology due to discontinuation of midodrine and blood loss given acute on chronic anemia.
Infectious etiology was considered unlikely given that pt remained afebrile, without leuocytosis,negative UA, no evidence of pathology on CXR or abdominal imaging, and improved clinically with fluids and transfusion.
Pt was given one dose vancomycin and cefepime for possible infection in ED which was d/c'ed.
In fact, pt has had elevated sbp 130-190.
Pt had elevated lactate to 2.3 on admission which trended down to 0.6.
# Anemia: Patient has a history of MGUS/MDS with baseline Hgb/Hct 8-9/23-25, but presented with severe acute on chronic anemia with Hgb/Hct 4.9/14.6.
She was guaiac negative in the ED and has no clear source of blood loss.
In the past she has had a macrocytic anemia and was recently found to have an elevated MMA so she was started on vitamin B12 supplementation.
It revealed an esophageal ulcer in the distal third of the esophagus with overlying organized and adherent clot.
Moderate erythema and scattered white plaques in distal third of esophagus consistent with likely [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.
Coffee ground material were noted in antrum and duodenal bulb.
# Syncope: Patient denies a history of syncope leading to her presentation to the ED.
No evidence of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke on head CT.
Patient has no history of seizures.
No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG and troponin <0.01 x 3.
# Prolonged INR: Likely related to nutritional deficiency.
Patient reports poor PO intake and has albumin of 2.5 on admission.
Pt received one dose at 6pm on [**9-26**] and resumed 7am on [**9-27**] and an hour later pt developed dystonia with flexion posturing of all 4 extremities and repetitive stereotyped movements of fidgeting with bed sheets.
Home neurologist felt that pt's hypotension, acute anemia and npo may have contributed to overmedication with sinemet, and recommended decreasing dose to 1 tab q2.
Pt's dystonia has resolved and her symptoms improved significantly on the lower dose.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU for loss of consciousness, low blood pressure, and low red blood cell count.
With this, your pressure normalized and there was no further loss of consciousness or light-headedness.
The EGD revealed an esophageal ulcer with an overlying clot and evidence of past bleed.
There was also evidence of yeast esophagitis.
You were also noted to have more movement irregularities and this was attributed to too high sinemet levels.
