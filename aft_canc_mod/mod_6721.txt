Due to suboptimal image quality and focused views, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded..
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small pericardial effusion, primarily around the right atrium and basal right ventricle with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**3-8**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of either lower extremity.
[**3-8**] Head CT: IMPRESSIONS: No acute intracranial abnormality.
No evidence of intracranial mass, but MRI is more sensitive for the detection of intracranial lesions and should be considered.
[**3-10**]: KUB Moderate amount of ascites with largest pocket seen within the right lower quadrant.
[**3-12**]: Request for Pleurx catheterization for palliative peritoneal ascites drainage.
Removal of one liter of yellow ascites fluid.
69 yo F with metastatic breast cancer prsents with vomitting, poor po intake and dyspnea and to be in acute renal failure with hyponatremia.
Was tachycardic and complaining of mild chest tightness.
Admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hyponatremia, then to the oncology floor.
Goals of care: meeting in ICU regarding goals of care and poor prognosis, then reiterated on the oncology medicine floor: Code: DNR/I (discussed with patient and HCP), and daughter HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80568**].
# Altered mental status: Patient does not respond to verbal or visual stimuli on the floor.
Likely d/t progressive metastatic disease, combined with renal failure, hypotension, pain, SBP infection, delirium.
Pain controlled with IV morphine prn, treated SBP with ceftriaxone, palliative care following.
# Chest Pain: unclear etiology, seemed to be costrochondritis related as the pain was reproducible.
Ruled out for MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
On the floor, patient unable to verbalize whether chest pain still present.
# Hypotenion/Tachycardia: likely was related to underlying cancer and hypovolemia.
Initially she seemed fluid responsive with a decrease in rate from 130s to 110s (which seemed to be her baseline).
She remained tachycardic on day two of admission without an obvious cause as she seemed mostly fluid repleted.
Her tachycardia improved with IVF boluses prn.
# Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
With fluid resuccitation, she corrected and normalized very quickly but did not have any neurological changes.
She did have a CT head in the ED that showed no intracranial lesions to explain this.
# Thrush: Likely due to poor po intake and nausea/vomitting.
Is metastatic and has recurrent ascites requiring taps.
On presentation, her abdomen was soft and a therapeutic paracentesis was deferred because of her hypovolemia, moderate hypotension and neutropenia.
Family meeting regarding poor prognosis and goals of care; patient not to have further chemotherapy or interventions/invasive procedures.
ANC 600 so not yet neutropenic and never needed to be on neutropenic precautions.
# Pleurex catheter placed to help with paracentesis/ascites drainage.
