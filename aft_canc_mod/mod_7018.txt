The patient had been doing well until she had sudden onset of shortness of breath at rest that was unresponsive to her bronchodilator metered dose inhalers.
The patient called EMS, where she was noted to be tachypneic and tachycardic as well as hypoxic, with oxygen saturation approximately 82% on [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, she had electrocardiogram demonstrating new right heart strain, and CT angiogram was performed, demonstrating evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli.
The patient was started on heparin, and echocardiogram was performed at the bedside, demonstrating right ventricular dilatation and paroxysmal subtotal wall motion.
The patient had right upper lobe mass with right-sided pleural effusions, for which she underwent pleuroscopy and pleurodesis.
Diabetes mellitus Type 2 3.
Rheumatoid arthritis 4.
Asthma 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
History of tobacco use  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No history of drug or alcohol use.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic but regular.
Lungs:  Dullness to percussion at the right base, and decreased breath sounds.
Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  CT of the head was negative for bleed or metastases.
CT angiogram showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Chest x-ray with right basilar opacity consistent with right pleural effusion.
The patient developed right neck hematoma and bleed on heparin.
She consequently had thrombocytopenia (plt to 30k).
Also noted to have stranding in the superior mediastinum, consistent with mediastinal hemorrhage.
She had small thrombus in the proximal left superficial femoral vein, as well as more occlusive thrombus in the popliteal vein on the left.
The patient then underwent inferior vena cava filter placement with Trap-Ease type filter.
Heparin was continued to be held secondary to bleeding and thrombocytopenia risk.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody was negative.
The patient had right neck hematoma as well as mediastinal bleed.
Hypotension:  The patient initially was hypotensive, probably secondary to her pulmonary embolism.
Secondary to her acute illness and her thrombocytopenia, these were not performed in-house.
