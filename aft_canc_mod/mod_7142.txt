NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary): NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENT TEST FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (Final [**2147-11-29**]): PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII NOT SEEN.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2147-11-29**]): NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending) [**2147-11-28**] Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture: No Virus isolated so far.
[**2147-11-28**]: negative for c.diff, shigella, campylobacter [**2147-11-29**]: negative for c.diff .
[**11-26**] CXR: Patchy opacities throughout the left lung are concerning for pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**11-27**] CXR: Compared with [**2147-11-27**], the moderately extensive left lung infiltrate shows marked interval consolidation, consistent with progressive pneumonia and/or intra-alveolar blood or infarction.
[**11-27**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral  valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Interval marked worsening of alveolar consolidations including the entire lungs The findings appear consistent with infection ehich might overlay aspiration, especially in the setting of gradual worsening.
No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
Small associated bilateral pleural effusions.
Heterogeneous spleen enhancement with rounded hypodense lesions might represent splenic infection.
[**12-2**] Bronchial lavage:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2147-12-4**] 10:17 AM Limited study, without definite fluid collection.
Fluid in nasopharynx and upper trachea, with fluid density posterior to left nasopharynx, probably a continuation of nasopharyngeal cavity.
No definite abscess.
Mild diffuse increase of the subcutaneous fat, especially at the level of the tongue base, which can be due to edema, however, inflammation in this area cannot be totally excluded given the clinical setting.
Bilateral pleural effusions, intra-abdominal fluid, and anasarca are suggestive of fluid overload.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed or fluid collections within the abdomen.
Tracheal Wall Bx: Fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and focal ossification.
No malignancy identified.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2147-12-28**] 4:57 PM No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremities.
Interval improvement in right mid lung and left upper lung air space opacities, consistent with either resolving pneumonia or resolving pulmonary hemorrhage given history of Wegener's granulomatosis.
Increase in right perihilar opacity likely represents worsening mild asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27273**] is a 76 yo gentleman with newly diagnosed laryngeal ca ([**5-15**]) c/b esophageal stricture s/p dilation, who presented with bilateral parotiditis, transferred to the medical ICU with hypoxia and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
He was later transferred to the medicine service for fevers x 2 d ([**11-25**]).
On medicine team, patient was complaining of worsening shortness of breath, and cough with hemoptysis.
CXR revealed patchy opacities and CTA revealed multifocal PNA L>R.
Patient also had loose stools x 2 d (c diff neg x 2).
Patient was then transferred to the ICU after bronch and IR procedure for concern of hemoptysis and hypoxia.
He continued to have hemoptysis, dried dark blood, small amounts.
He has been noted to be tachycardic in the ICU (sinus) and was given 500cc IVF [**11-29**] with no improvement.
During the transfusion he became increasingly tachypneic, tachychardic and had a fever of 101.
# WEGENER'S: Diagnosed [**12-7**] by positive C-ANCA, Anti-GBM negative.
Derm biopsy of neck rash demonstrated vasculitis.
Patient was transferred to the MICU and reintubated due to increasing hemoptysis and bloody output from ETT.
No focal bleeding sites were found on Bronchoscopy [**12-2**].
He was started on Ceftriaxone for a fever on [**12-24**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 27273**] was eventually able to use the trach collar duing the day with minimal rusty sputum production.
Patient spiked a low grade fever to 100.7 on [**12-29**] and was started on Ceftrixone.
# RESPIROTORY FAILURE: Patient was intubated in the MICU for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage subsequently diagnosed with Wegener's.
He continued to have minimal rusty sputum production with cultures showing sparse oropharyngeal flora.
He was very weak secondary to a prolonged hospitalization and possibly steroid myopathy.
Eventually, he began to have increase in bloody secretions.
After discussion with the family, he was made CMO and eventually expired secondary to respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage related to his underlying Wegener's.
# PANCYTOPENIA:  Thought to be multifactorial in etiology with largest contributant from cytoxan therapy and possibly Bactrim.
Anemia exacerbated by ongoing slow ongoing bleeding, phlebotomy, thrombocytopenia exacerbated by recent plasmapheresis.
Cefepime was used transiently for fever and neutropenia.
Patient's lines (left port) and PIV's were monitored closely for infection, blood cx remained negative, sputum with sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Patient had loose stool however was negative for C.diff.
Recently had esophageal stricture dilated [**11-15**].
#) ABDOMINAL PAIN:  The patient complained of intermittent abdominal pain, with decreased bs/increased residuals, likely secondary to ileus.
#) PAROTIDIS: This was thought to be secondary to radiation scarring vs. infection.
#) CAD s/p CABG: No evidence of active ischemia.
He was continued on high dose metoprolol; however, [**Month/Day (4) **] was held due to alveolar hemorrhage.
#) NSVT:  Patient had recurrent NSVT.
#) CODE STATUS: Patient was initially DNR, not DNI; patient was later made CMO by family after clinical status continued to decline and patient had further bloody secretions.
#) DISPO: Patient expired on [**2148-1-20**] secondary to respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage related to his underlying Wegener's.
