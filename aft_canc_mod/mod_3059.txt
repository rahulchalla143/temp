Admission Date:  [**2119-1-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2119-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2096-7-6**]     Sex:  F  Service:  BMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 22 year old female with Hodgkin's disease who presents with superior vena cava syndrome, secondary to a Port-A-Cath related clot, status post lysis.
Patient with Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2118-7-25**], specifically nodular sclerosing subtype.
She was stage 4B given her thoracic abdominal axillary and pulmonary lymphadenopathies with metastases.
She subsequently underwent ice chemotherapy consisting of ice-phos, bromide, mesna, carboplatin, and VP16 on [**1-10**] through 19 due to disease recurrence as visualized on the PET scan.
She presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Emergency Room where she was noted to have facial edema plethora with purplish discoloration of her face and the absence of any upper respiratory symptoms.
A CT scan did reportedly show an air fluid level in her right maxillary sinus.
Several days following discharge, the patient continued to have progressive facial swelling.
She also noted progressive headache.
She also noted nausea and vomiting and was unable to lie supine.
On the Emergency Room presentation, the patient had an ultrasound showing occlusion of her left subclavian vein with extensive thromboses over her bilateral internal jugulars which extended to her right atrium, however, no clot in the right atrium.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  Young obese female lying in bed in no acute distress.
Neck:  Full without any gross lymphadenopathy.
Extremities:  Left upper extremity swollen and erythematous, no focal tenderness, other extremities unremarkable.
Neurological:  Mild decrease in gross sensation in left upper extremity, sensation otherwise intact.
CT of chest showed large thrombosis extending along Port-A-Cath within the left subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava, does not appear to extend into the right atrium.
Grossly unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy which does not compress vessels.
Trivial tricuspid regurgitation, right atrium normal.
Superior vena cava syndrome:  The patient was admitted with acute superior vena cava syndrome due to a thrombosis of her superior vena cava.
Patient recently had a Port-A-Cath placed and it was thought that her thrombosis was most likely a Port-A-Cath associated clot.
Follow-up imaging showed resolution of the thrombosis with no residual clot.
Plan is to continue patient on Lovenox most likely for several months, however, her platelets and other blood counts will have to be monitored carefully in the setting of her underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.
Hodgkin's lymphoma:  Patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed [**Month (only) **] of the previous year, status post [**Location (un) 20180**] 5 chemotherapy with recurrent disease.
Patient was already started on Neupogen prior to admission for her neutropenia following chemotherapy.
She was maintained on Neupogen through the hospital admission with plans to continue this until her neutropenia resolved.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with [**Hospital6 407**] for PIC line care.
Catheter related venous thrombosis.
HOSPITAL PROCEDURE:  In situ thrombolysis of central venous thrombosis.
