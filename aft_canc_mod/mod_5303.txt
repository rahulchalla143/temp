History of Present Illness: 76M with hx of LUL resection for NSCLC 30 years ago who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with massive hemoptysis on [**2160-9-5**].
At that time, he was intubated for airway protection and on bronchoscopy, he was found to have an obstruction lesion of the right mainstem due to a RUL tumor.
At that time, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-9-9**] for a rigid and flexible bronchscopy where they found that the right mainstem was approximately 80-90% obstructed by a tumor mass coming from the right upper lobe.
They found foreign bodies which appeared to be suture material and perhaps a fingernail in that area which was sent to pathology as well, prompting a possible diagnosis of foreign body granuloma.
Following the biopsies, the tumor was destroyed with electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation.
He had a video swallow which showed no evidence of aspiration.
Of note, he originally presented to PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] month of cough and shortness of breath.
He was treated emperically with abx with no resolution of the mass on cxr, which prompted the bronchoscopy at [**Location (un) **].
Past Medical History: NSCLC LUL resection 30 years ago HTN CAD s/p angioplasty/stent [**2148**]  Social History: Lives with family and worked 25 years as a plumber.

No discrete bronchial lesion identified, although the right main stem bronchus is not visualized.
The superior mediastinum is obscured with no discrete margination of its lateral borders, and there is slight prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary markings.
No discrete lung mass and no vascular congestion or consolidations.
Slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm.
No lung nodules or bone destruction identified.
BRONCH RUL BX: Right upper lobe mass, biopsy: Undifferentiated large cell carcinoma.
CYTOLOGY RUL MASS: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
MRI HEAD: No evidence of intracranial metastasis.
Appearance raising concern for the possibility of a pulmonary embolus in a right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary artery, although indeterminate.
Bibasilar mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities, which given their recent onset, are most suspicious for an infection, inflammation, or in the appropriate clinical setting, hemorrhage.
Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, for which short-term followup is recommended.
Several subcentimeter vague hypoattenuating foci in the liver which are nonspecific.
Metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
Large 3-4 cm nonspecific lesion in the spleen.
A 13 mm lesion along the lower pole of the left kidney with indeterminate characteristics and too small to characterize here.
Filling defects within the arterial pulmonary vasculature within the superior portion of the right lower lobe consistent with pulmonary embolism.
Etiology could include primary embolus versus tumor thrombus.
Mixed ground glass and consolidative opacities seen by bibasilarly.
BONE SCAN: No definite evidence for osseous metastases.
LENIS: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76M with hx of LUL resection for NSCLC presents with hemoptysis and found to have RUL mass with obstruction of right mainstem.
# HEMOPTYSIS: He did not have any hemopytsis during his hospital course here.
# NSCLC: s/p resection of LUL 30 years ago.
Pathology and cytology from biopsy shows undifferentiated large cell carcinoma.
Chest CT showed mediastinal and right hilar LAD.
Abd CT showed 3-4cm lesion in spleen and non-specific lesions in liver.
# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  He has a RLL PE by CTA.
# POST-OBSTRUCTIVE PNA:  He has radiographic opacities on chest CT which could be infectious or could be hemorrhage from RUL ablation (reviewed with radiology).
# HTN: Continue outpt metoprolol.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
