Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o man with metastatic lung cancer (bone) now with likely malignant pleural effusion, obstructive/aspiration pneumonia, and large pulmonary emboli admitted to the MICU.
His well ventilated lung on the left was filled with pulmonary emboli.
His right lung was nearly obstructive at the secondary bronchi from tumor and his pleural cavity filled with a likely malignant pleural effusion.
Given the risk of bleeding and pneumothorax in his already critical state, it was decided by the ICU to not pursue any further invasive strategies (thoracentesis, etc).
Fevers - Likely from aspiration and possibly postobstructive pneumonia.
He failed multiple speech and swallow studies at the bedside, and continue to have fevers despite receiving antibiotics.
Given his critical state it was decided to stop antibiotics and treat him to bring him comfort and ease his pain.
