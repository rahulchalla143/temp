Admission Date:  [**2110-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-1-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-5-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, SVT, hypercalcemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 70-year-old female, 50 pack-year tobacco use, with poor medical follow up who presents with neck pain.
She also noted right upper extremity weakness and difficulty ambulating.
Three days prior to presentation, she developed confusion and generalized weakness.
The primary care physician who took [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest X-ray, which showed a lung mass and right pleural effusion.
She notes a 12 pound weight loss over last 3 weeks.
She denied fever, chills, cough, hemoptysis, or headache.
The day of presentation the patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] for CT and MRI for further work-up.
Her imaging showed diffuse metastatic disease with invasion of spinal cord.
She also developed hypotension and tachycardia which responded to a fluid bolus.
Currently, the patient notes mild neck pain but is otherwise comfortable.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 98.1 BP: 102/57 HR: 83 RR: 20 O2sat: 95% 2L NC GEN: ill appearing, pleasant, confused female, no apparent distress HEENT: PERRL, dry MM Neck: Unable to assess, collar RESP: clear to auscultation bilateral CV: RR, nl rate, II/VI murmur at apex ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly appreciated EXT: wwp, no c/e, + clubbing SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: A0x1.
Pertinent Results: [**Hospital1 **] IMAGING: CXR: There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
There is patchy opaciifcation of the right lower and middle lobe with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and to a lesser extent, the right heart border.
Somewhat nodular density is seen in the right lower zone.
Left lung base appears clear and there is no evidence of left-sided effusion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Mild background degenerative changes are seen at the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints.
Right scapular outline is poorly defined, correlating with CT finding of osseaous lesion (see CT report).
IMPRESSION: RIGHT BASAL/MIDDLE LOBE OPACIFICATION AND SCAPULAR LESION AND PLEURAL EFFUSION.
NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS.
EXTENSIVE MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY IN ADDITION TO RIGHT HILAR MASS WITH RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE COLLAPSE LIKELY REFLECTING PRIMARY BRONCHOGENIC NEOPLASM WITH EXTENSIVE METASTATIC DISEASE.
NUMEROUS LARGE PLEURAL-BASED METASTASES IN THE RIGHT HEMITHORAX PARTICULARLY AT THE RIGHT BASE WITH SOFT TISSUE ALSO EXTENDING FROM THIS INTO THE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM AND INTO THE PERICARDIAL FAT PAD ON THE RIGHT.
VERY EXTENSIVE BONY METASTATIC DISEASE INCLUDING A LARGE SCAPULAR METASTASIS, LEFT-SIDED RIB METASTASIS AND MULTIPLE SPINAL METASTASES, MANY OF WHICH EXHIBIT MASS EFFECT AND NARROW THE SPINAL CANAL.
ASSESSMENT FOR CORD COMPRESSION WITH THORACIC SPINE MRI IS RECOMMENDED.
NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.
A FOCAL CORTICAL HYPODENSITY INVOLVING THE LEFT INSULA, WHICH [**Month (only) **] BE FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY MR, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.
BILATERAL CONFLUENT HYPODENSITIES INVOLVING SUBCORTICAL AND PERIVENTRICULAR WHITE MATTER, WHICH [**Month (only) **] BE REFLECTIVE OF SMALL VESSEL ISCHEMIC DISEASE.
MULTIPLE LYTIC LESIONS INVOLVING THE CALVARIUM, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
THESE LESIONS ARE CONCERNING FOR METASTATIC DISEASE.
MR [**Month (only) **] BE OBTAINED TO EVALUATE FOR POSSIBLE METASTATIC PROCESS WITHIN THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA.
MRI Spine: Widely disseminated, likely metastatic neoplastic disease, with the largest lesion being at T1, and involving the posterior elements.
Cervical spondylosis.
[**Hospital1 18**] IMAGING: [**2110-1-23**] CXR: Large area of opacity involving the right mid-to-lower lung which may represent a combination of mass, pleural effusion, atelectasis and consolidation; given history of new lung mass, without prior for comparison.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Diffuse white matter hypodensities may represent chronic microvascular disease, subacute watershed infarcts, and/or underlying mass lesions.
Multiple calvarial metastases.
MICRO: [**2110-1-24**]  BLOOD CULTURE-PENDING [**2110-1-23**]  MRSA SCREEN-PENDING [**2110-1-23**]  BLOOD CULTURE-PENDING [**2110-1-23**]  URINE CULTURE-<10,000 organisms/ml [**2110-1-23**]  BLOOD CULTURE-PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: 70-year-old female, 50 pack-year tobacco use, with poor medical follow up who presents with metastatic cancer, cord compression and hypercalcemia.
# Metastatic cancer: Most likely lung cancer given appearance on imaging and smoking history with suspicious lesion in lung.
Given diffuse nature of the disease likely would be a very poor prognosis.
Discussions held with daughter and family and agreement was made that patient would not want any invasive procedures for diagnosis and preference would be to go home with hospice.
Pain controlled with oral regimen morphine SR 60mg PO and morphine liquid as per scale for breakthrough at time of discharge.
# Cord Compression: Evidence of encasement of spinal cord by tumor.
Evaluated by ortho spine who request multiple imaging studies but based on patient's goals of care ti was dcided to continue dexamathasone but discontinue spine precuationsa nd cervical collar since advancement of weakness and cord compression would likely be related to advancement of overall disease.
Radiation oncology consult initially placed; however, patient's family did not wish to go forward with possible palliative XRT.
# Hypercalcemia: Patient presented with hypercalcemia and altered mental status likely from invasion of tumor +/- paraneoplastic syndrome.
# Leukocytosis/Fever: Most likely etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia.
