Multiple splenic lesions and a small pulmonary nodule were also noted.
He was treated initially with day #1 of CHOP as an inpatient and then after the c-myc data returned on day #8, he was converted to a modified ProMACE-CytaBOM regimen without methotrexate due to significant lower extremity edema.
He was discharged after management of complications including a-fibrillation, lower extremity DVT, and physical therapy for a right lesser trochanter avulsion fracture.
His pain was much improved after the first cycle of chemotherapy.

The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear # ################################################################ MR HEAD:  1) No evidence of mass effect, abnormal enhancement, or acute infarct.
2) Minimal fluid signal within the mastoid air cells and within the right sphenoid sinus, findings that are suggestive of mild mastoid and sinus inflammation.
# ################################################################ MRA HEAD:  2 mm wide-mouthed aneurysm arising from the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery.
No other aneurysm is identified # ################################################################ MR HIP:  1.
Pathological subtrochanteric fracture of the right proximal femur as described above.
Abnormal signal surrounding the fracture is comprised of fluid as well as soft tissue without a hypervascular soft tissue component.
An additional lesion within the left femur extends from the proximal left femoral diaphysis through the entire left femoral neck.
A separate rounded focus of abnormal signal is also seen within the mid left femoral diaphysis.
# ################################################################ XR PELVIS:  1) Comminuted pathologic fracture of the right femoral neck, extending into the lesser trochanter, seen on recent MRI.
The underlying bone is mottled with abnormal periosteal reaction of the proximal one-half of the femoral shaft.
Low likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
Ventilation findings consistent with COPD # ################################################################ ECG: Sinus at 95 bpm.
Q in III, No acute TW or ST changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o male with a hx of Burkitts Lymphoma who presented with R leg pain, mild fevers.
?s Lymphoma: On xray in ER, concern for malignancy in bone was seen on MRI.
Ortho was consulted in ER, and pt was taken to OR for R hip arthroplasty/tumor removal.
Unfortunately post-op, due to pt's poor nutritional status, wound had continual drainage, and chemo/XRT were delayed until the wound healed.
Radiation therapy was postponed to allow for adequate wound heailing of the R hip wound.
To increase albumin and allow adequate patient nutrition for healing, tube feeds were attempted, the patient  pulled out his Dobhoff tube x2 days in a row during sundowning episodes.
He had a calorie count indicating inadequate calorie intake for his healing process and TPN was continued on discharge to acute rehabilation.
During his course he was started empiracally on vancomycin and cefipime, he was afebrile with negative cultures,vancomycin and cefepime was discontinued and maintained on Bactrim prophylaxis only.
A-fib:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had intermittent atrial fibrillation during his hospital course.
Cardiology consult recommend identifying an underlying source for his tachycardia including repleting his electrolytes, hematocrit, controlling pain, and oxygen saturation.
To address his tachycardia, his blood pressure tolerated increase of metoprolol, and he had a brief course of digoxin, but was discontinued from digoxin and started on diltiazem for further rate control of his atrial fibrillation.
This was possibly of multifactorial etiology.
Likely post-surgical bleeding (hct not appropriately increasing despite transfusion).
Large amounts of IVF that may also add a dilutional component.
Only 800 cc of intra-op blood loss recorded.
Possible early sepsis.
He was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency through a cortisol stimulation test.
His mildly elevated INR (1.3) treated with vit.
He continued to have a slowly decreasing hematocrit likely due to his oozing right hip surgical wound.
Orthopedics was aware and recommended maintaining the current management of pressure dressings, with increased nutrition to raise albumin, and increase healing.
He had negative blood cultures, urine cultures and CxR, and no electrolyte imbalances.
One day prior to discharge, he again developed mental status changes, with no identifiable origin.
FEN:  He had inadequate PO intake during his hospital course for sufficient nutrition especially in light of his wound healing.
The patient pulled out last 2 Dobhoff/TPN tubes likely sundowning/unaware that he has been pulling out his tube.
If you have increased pain, fever chills, bleeding, nausea or vomitting please contact your physician.
