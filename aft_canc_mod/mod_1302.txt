Persistent FDG-avid consolidated opacities in the right upper lobe.
Persistent FDG-avid nodular pleural thickening in the right lung base.
Decreased right pleural effusion.
2) Increased uptake in the shoulder muscles and left posterolateral chest wall musculature.
While some of this may physiologic, there is a suggestion of slight thickening in the chest wall musculature.
It is uncertain whether this may also represent lymphomatous involvement.
[**12-9**] CT abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1) Small amount of nonocclusive tumor thrombus located around catheter within SVC.
2) Multiple right pulmonary nodules with nodular areas of pleural thickening.
3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several nodular areas, unchanged since the prior FDG PET CT, allowing for differences in technique.
4) Multiple nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal, periportal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Nearly completely occlusive thrombus within the distal superior vena cava at the tip of the central line.
Improved areas of parenchymal consolidation in the right upper lobe.
[**12-9**] CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 39 yo male with relapsed Hodgkins Disease on CEPP chemo, w/ SVC syndrome here for TPA infusion via portocath.
He had an infusion of low dose TPA with no change in fibrinogen or INR but the follow up venogram showed some residual clot.
There was some residual clot but there was free flow in the superior vena cava so it was left.
A repeat PET was done on [**12-8**] which showed possible new disease in the LUL and stable disease in the RL.
A follow up CT showed multiple right pulmonary nodules with nodular areas of pleural thickening, but no new disease in the LUL.
At that point, it was decided to send the patient home with no further chemotherapy and to consider harvesting the patient for an autologous stem cell transplant instead of doing the 3rd cycle of CEPP.
3) Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe with several nodular areas - most likely c/w Hodgkins Lymphoma as present since [**2140-4-7**] despite several trials of antibiotics.
Since the patient was neutropenic and having fevers, a possible new pneumonia could not be ruled out.
All of his antibiotics were then stopped when he became afebrile.
Pain control- The pt has bilateral leg pain from chemotherapy.
In the ICU, the pain was managed w/ short acting oxycodone because they wanted to follow his MS during the tpa infusion.
His oxycontin was titrated upt to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone for breakthrough for optimal pain control.
