He was also noted to have one minute of chest pain en route to the ED.
He also has had multiple leg surgeries and states he has had a right foot drop for a while.
He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence with this.
He also complained of lightheadedness at that time and had subsequent blurry/double vision.
He also had 1 minute of chest pain which he describes as SSCP [**2-10**], no associated N/V, +lightheadedness, no fevers, no radiation of chest pain.
He states that he has chronic SOB and lately, if he bends over to feed his cat, his SOB worsens.
Later that AM, the patient was again found to have SBP in the 80s, asymptomatic, and was given another 250cc fluid bolus.
Presumed Coronary artery disease with last evaluation [**2-3**] (negative P-MIBI) 2.
Seizure disorder after head trauma.
COPD and a history of prior ARDS.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair andcomplicated by graft infection.
History of pseudomonas sepsis.
History of DVTs and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism in [**2125-1-31**].
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the right lower extremity.
History of GI bleeding.
History of C. difficile colitis.

Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: Gen- lying in bed flat in NAD, speaking full sentences, no slurred speech, AAOx3 HEENT- EOMI, +horizontal nystagmus, PERRL NECK- supple, no JVD appreciated but thick neck CV- RR, nl S1/S2, no M/G/R CHEST- CTAB ABD- obese, soft, NT/ND, +BS EXT- + bilat.
plastic posterior splints with attached neoprene orthopedic shoes; 2(+) pedal edema BLE; no cyanosis, clubbing, joint inflammation NEURO- CN2-12 intact, bilateral UE strength 5/5, RLE strength [**5-6**], LLE strength 5/5, R. foot drop noted with multiple ankle surgical scars, +1 patellar reflexes bilaterally.
CT head: No evidence of acute mass effect, hemorrhage or territorial infarction.
Question raised about possible abnormality in the right basal ganglia.
There is minor bibasilar atelectasis with tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
No lymphadenopathy is identified in the mediastinum, hila or axillae.
There is a right-sided dual lead [**Month/Day/Year 4448**].
A calcified granuloma is seen in the left lung base.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is poor vascular enhancement by IV contrast, which may be due to the patient's cardiac status.
On this limited scan, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, adrenals, pancreas and right kidney are unremarkable.
Multiple round low-density lesions are seen in left kidney.
No lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
The aorta is normal in caliber and contains mural calcifications, however, there is no unusual retroperitoneal density to suggest a hematoma.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are calcifications within the iliac vessels, without evidence of an extravasation.
An EKG was performed which revealed no changes from previous.
Because the patient has a history of CAD s/p PCI in [**2-/2127**], a Persantine MIBI scan was performed to assess for restenosis.
The patient experienced a resurgence of his chest pain during the period of hypotension that occurred during his hospitalization.
Repeat EKG again showed no change, and repeated serial troponins were negative.
Hypotension:  as noted in the HPI, the patient experienced brief hypotension in the ambulance PTA.
However, in the AM on [**10-13**] the patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness with BP falling into the 60s systolic.
He experienced no further episodes of hypotension.
It has been at least partially attributed to his narcotics regimen, however, Narcan was administered during his hypotension with no resolution of his signs.
Because of the alpha-blockade with this medication, it was held after his episode of hypotension.
Neurology was consulted, and concluded that the weakness was likely multifactorial, at least partially due to a steroid myopathy.
He will likely benefit from an acute rehabilitation stay.
In the future, it would likely be beneficial if the patient could titrate back his steroid requirements, but in the context of his lung disease this may not be possible.
LLL lung nodule:  A nodule has been noted in a previous CT scan of the chest which was going to be followed up as an outpatient for CT-guided biopsy.
Diplopia:  The patient complained of diplopia throughout his stay.
He has had 2 outpatient CT head with no abnormalities seen.
The patient had a 2L O2 requirement throughout his stay.
His CXR was consistent with mild volume overload, but he had no exacerbation of his CHF during his stay.
Seizure disorder s/p TBI:  The patient was noted to have a grossly elevated dilantin level in the 40s on admission.

Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
