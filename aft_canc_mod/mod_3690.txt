Admission Date:  [**2164-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-12-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-8-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Headache and unsteady gait.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75 year old right handed man with a history of prostate cancer who presents with headaches since Monday, lethargy since Tuesday and unsteady gait.
Today, his PCP had organized an MRI of his brain at [**Hospital 246**] Hospital, which showed a right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, so he was sent in for further evaluation.
ROS: the patient and the patient's family, have not noticed any weakness such as hemiparetic symptoms, word finding difficulties, seizures, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, tinnitus, phonophobia, dyspnea, although he does have a cough, no palpitations, no chest pain, no abdominal pain or dysuria.
HTN 2.
Prostate cancer - transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy on [**7-6**], [**2164**], revealing [**3-30**] cores positive for [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+3=6 disease with up to 40% of core length involved - there is a question of starting brachytherapy 3.
Family History: He reports a family history of oral cancer in his father diagnosed at the age of 70.
Physical Exam: T-98.8 HR-74 BP-180/80 RR-16 SpO2-99%  Gen: Lying in bed, no bruising noted over the head HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: +BS, soft, nontender Ext: No edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: General:  alert, awake, lethargic (received morphine) Orientation:  oriented to person, place, but not date, keeps saying 11, 11, 11.
Speech/Language: Extremely hypophonic but non-dysarthric speech.
Fluent w/o paraphasic (phonemic or semantic) errors; comprehension, repetition, naming (high frequency objects): normal.
He found low frequency words difficult, but according to his son, this may be his baseline because his main language in Armenian.
VII: Mild L facial droop with slightly large palpebral fissure on the L. VIII: Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
No observed myoclonus or tremor His left arm drifts down slightly with possible pronation.
He appears to have full strength in his arms and legs - possible 4s in FEs but bilateral.
Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 74 194 86 366/390 31 -26 21  CT head and CTA neck [**2164-12-21**] CT head demonstrates right basal ganglia hemorrhage with extension to the lateral ventricles without hydrocephalus.
This finding should be evaluated with a regular PA and lateral views of the chest when possible to exclude hilar or lung abnormality.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Repeat NCHCT [**2164-12-22**] Similar appearance of right basal ganglia hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, but increased lateral ventricle caliber as compared to eight hours ago, suggestive of a developing mild hydrocephalus.
Right-sided basal ganglia hemorrhage identified with surrounding edema and extension to the ventricle.
There is some enhancement surrounding the hematoma on the post gadolinium images.
He had no prior hx of headaches and he also felt more fatigued.
He denied any other associated symptoms but given the worsening headache, he went to an outside hospital where he was found to have R IPH hence transferred here for further care.
There is no report of any trauma but he does report that he has had elevated BP in the past but has been under good control for the past few years.
He was hypertensive in the ED.
He underwent repeat head CT and MRI with and without contrast to further evaluate for possible underlying pathology.
However, there was no evidence of tumor or aneurysm/AVM.
Given the location and the risk factors (hypertension), this was felt to be likely hypertensive in etiology.
He has extremely hypophonic speech with some L facial droop and possible, mild L arm weakness.
Most likely secondary to hemorrhage but may be exacerbated by the fact that he was not using BiPAP during this admission.
R caudate hemorrhage - likely hypertensive in origin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Intracerebral hemorrhage likely due to hypertension  Secondary Ostructive Sleep Apnea  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Very soft speech with mild L facial droop and slight L arm weakness.
Complains of bifrontal headache which is likely multifactorial including not being on BiPAP during this admission and the brain hemorrhage.
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of the cause and management of this intracerebral hemorrhage.
We think that your bleed was a consequence of mild hypertension and aging of small vessels of your brain given that no underlying lesion was noted on MRI scan of your brain.
It will be important to have this imaging repeated in about six weeks to evaluate this further.
