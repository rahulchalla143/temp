Admission Date:  [**2121-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-9-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: IV Dye, Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: R putaminal hemorrhage   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Tracheostomy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 59501**] is a 53 year old male with history of nephrolithiasis and ?
pyelonephritis who presents with large R putaminal hemorrhage.
The patient complained of feeling warm earlier today, and mild low back pain consistent with his history of kidney for percocet for the pain.
He developed low back pain in the evening, took a percocet for the pain, went to his prayer room, and he was then found by his wife on the floor, vomiting and unable to get up.
At the [**Hospital3 20284**] Center the pt's head CT revealed a large right putaminal hemorrhage extending posteriorly and inferiorly in the right posterior midbrain with blood in the third ventricle.
His wife reports recent low back pain and perhaps fevers, but he did not take his temperature at home.
No recent wt loss.
He does not have a history of headaches.
Past Medical History: Nephrolithiasis- as above No known h/o hypertension   Social History: Married, has two children, he works as a laotian translator at [**Hospital3 1810**] and also formerly at [**Hospital1 18**], he has also worked as a court transcriptionist.
Family History: pt's wife is unfamiliar with his FH, does not recall any h/o stroke, ICH or bleeding diasthesis.
HEENT- NCAT, anicteric, OP clear, no oral trauma Neck- no carotid bruits bilat CV- RRR, 2/6 SEM heard best at apex PULM- CTA B Extrem- no CCE SKIN- multiple tattoos, R thigh, chest, patchy blanching erythematous reticular rash on anterior chest.
Extensor posturing of LUE and LLE with noxious stimulation.
Reflexes- 2+ on R [**Hospital1 **], tri, brachioradialis and patellar, ankle.
PTT 28, INR 1.2  EKG (from OSH)- NSR with left atrial enlargement, RBBB.
<br>  Imaging: Head CT [**2121-4-4**]: FINDINGS: There is acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia measuring roughly 4 x 3 cm, which extends inferiorly into the right pons and mid brain.
There is a moderate amount of associated intraventricular blood seen within the lateral ventricles, greater on the right than on the left.
Small amount of blood is seen within the third ventricle.
There is slight effacement of the suprasellar cistern, suggesting early uncal herniation.
There is minimal, 2 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
Edema surrounding the area of hemorrhage causes mild mass effect on adjacent sulci.
There is no extra-axial hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of infarction.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia, with extension into the right pons and mid brain.
Moderate intraventricular extension into the lateral ventricles and third ventricle.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Although I agree with most of the above report, there is no evidence of uncal herniation associated with this globus pallidus hematoma.
<br> Head CT [**2121-4-5**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Since prior examination, there has been no significant change in the hemorrhage within the right globus pallidus extending into the midbrain.
Although there is less blood in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles, the extent of hemorrhage within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle is not appreciably changed.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
This is associated with mildly increased hydrocephalus.
A 5 mm vague hyperdensity is seen within the inferior brainstem (series 2, image 4), which was retrospectively present on prior exam and may represent tiny focus of blood.
Copious secretions are seen within the nasopharynx.
Minimally increased hydrocephalus.
<br> CXR [**2121-4-4**]: FINDINGS: Single portable supine chest radiograph is reviewed without comparison.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for portable supine technique.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no effusion.
<br> KUB [**2121-4-9**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or obstruction <br>  CT TORSO [**2121-4-14**]: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low.
There are no pulmonary nodules.
There is no mediastinal or axillary adenopathy.
There are bilateral moderate, pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is massive ascites.
The caudate lobe is somewhat prominent, as is the left lobe, consistent with cirrhosis.
There is a hypoattenuating liver mass measuring 4.7 x 3.1 cm, in segment IV A of the liver, which encroaches on the IVC and the portal vein.
The bowel shows generalized edema likely due to the patient's cirrhosis.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction or ischemia.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
There is no pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Patent SMA, SMV, celiac, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**], without evidence of bowel ischemia, although there is bowel wall edema, likely due to underlying cirrhosis.
New liver mass in segment IV A, which in the setting of the prominent left lobe, caudate lobe, and borderline small right lobe with massive ascites is concerning for a primary liver lesion, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, or less likely a cholangiocarcinoma.
Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
<br> PERITONEAL FLUID [**2121-4-15**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Only portions of the liver could be imaged,and the left lobe and known left lobe mass could not be visualized due to the high position deep to the sternum.
The right lobe was well imaged and showed no masses.
The gallbladder was not overly distended, but the wall was thickened and edematous undoubtedly related to the underlying liver disease.
There was marked ascites surrounding the liver, which had a somewhat coarse nodular texture.
Hepatic artery was also easily identified and patent as well as the inferior vena cava.
However, no detectable flow could be identified within the right portal vein either by color flow or pulse Doppler.
CONCLUSION: Cirrhotic liver with marked ascites.
Limited views do not allow for visualization of the known left lobe mass.
Doppler assessment shows patency of the hepatic artery and hepatic veins, but no flow could be detected in the right portal vein, even at low flow settings.
This either indicates occlusion or extremely low velocity flow, less than 10 cm/sec.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 59501**] was admitted to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring and blood pressure management after diagnosis of his putamenal hemorrhage in the ED.
He was kept euglycemic with insulin sliding scale, and Tylenol was administered for any temperature greater than 100.4F.
It was presumed that the etiology was long-standing hypertension, with an acute hypertensive episode that likely led to the bleed perhaps precipitated by the pain due to his renal stones.
Neurosurgery was consulted for possible EVD placement, but as there was no significant hydrocephalus and his 4th ventricle appeared patent, no drain was placed.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59501**] was monitored with a repeat CT scan after 6 hours, which showed no change in the hemorrhage and only minimal increase in the hydrocephalus.
Throughout his hospitalization, his neurologic status showed no improvement.
He continued to have no pupillary reaction, minimal oculocephalic response, and decerebrate posturing.
A percutaneous enterogastrostomy (PEG) was planned as well, but before this could be performed, he developed significant ascites.
The CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed massive ascites with one large liver mass and several smaller liver nodules, consistent with a primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
The day after this CT, he underwent paracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic measures.
No malignant cells were seen in the ascitic fluid and there was no evidence of peritonitis.
Following the paracentesis, he became hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 70s; he was given albumin to restore intravascular volume.
At the same time, he began to develop a coagulopathy due to his failing liver.
Similarly, he began to develop renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome.
It was explained to his family that despite all the best medical care, there was no chance of his surviving.
