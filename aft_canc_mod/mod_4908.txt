[**5-23**]: Right VP shunt placement  History of Present Illness: 26M who presented to an OSH with one year of progressively increasing headache, memory problems (both long and short term), and vision blurriness who was found to have new mass on CT scan.
Positive family history for CAD and breast cancer.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Visual fields intact III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus or diplopia.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Coordination: no dysmmetria on finger-nose-finger  Discharge Exam; gen - pleasant, stable acromegaly, pleasant and cooperative skin - incisions are clian and dry, no rash no eccymosis CV - RRR, S1 and S2 nl Pulm - CTAB no w/c/r GI - soft, obese, distal umbilical incision c/d/i, NT/ND Ext - No c/c/e Neuro - AO x 3, PERRL, bilateral homonymous hemianopsia, full motor, sensory to light touch intact, no pronator drift   Pertinent Results: [**2149-5-10**] MRI BRAIN w/ & w/o contrast: FINDINGS: A mass measuring approximately 5 x 5 x 6 cm appears to arise from the sella turcica and extend into the suprasellar cistern.
The mass is inhomogeneous in intensity, but predominantly hypointense to brain on the short TR images and markedly hyperintense on FLAIR and long TR spin echo images.
There is a prominent cystic component anteriorly, extending into the right frontal lobe.
The mass enhances inhomogeneously after contrast administration.
The left internal carotid artery is encased in its cavernous and supraclinoid portions as it courses through the mass.
The optic chiasm is traumatically elevated by the lesion, and I cannot identify the course of the optic nerves as they pass over this lesion to approach the optic canals.
This lesion appears most likely to represent a pituitary adenoma.
The mass elevates the third ventricle and causes compression at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
This apparently is responsible for bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles, more severe on the right than left.
CONCLUSION: Massive sellar and suprasellar enhancing neoplasm, most likely a pituitary adenoma.
There is compression of the optic chiasm and hydrocephalus due to elevation and compression of the ventricular system at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
[**2149-5-11**] CTA Head: Large sellar and suprasellar mass with components in the pontine cistern, cavernous sinus, suprasellar cistern, and invaginating into the right  frontal lobe.
The appearance remains consistent with a pituitary adenoma.
There is encasement of the left internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally course through the lesion.
[**5-14**] CT Head: No significant change in large suprasellar mass leading to right lateral ventricular dilation.
There is no evidence of interval hemorrhage.
[**5-14**] CT Head postop: In comparison to a study obtained five hours prior, there is notable improvement in right lateral ventricular dilatation and right frontal cystic lesion.
There is no hemorrhage along the course of the right ventriculostomy catheter, which is terminating in the third ventricle.
Small-to-moderate pneumocephalus is likely post-surgical.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Small-to-moderate pneumocephalus persists, likely post-surgical.
Stable size of the ventricles compared to [**2149-5-15**], with mild dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.
The large sellar/suprasellar mass, with a large cystic component indenting the right frontal lobe  [**5-23**] Ct head - s/p r VP shunt, no acute hemorrhage   Brief Hospital Course: 26M who was admitted to Neurosurgery for a right frontal cystic lesion and a sellar/suprasellar mass with subsequent hydrocephalus.
The patient got out of bed and wanted to leave the hospital "Against Medical Advice"  On [**5-12**], patient was seen to have bitemporal hemianopsia, but was otherwise intact on examination.
He tolerated the procedure well without intraoperative complications.
Post operative Head CT revealed no hemorrhage and significant decompression.
On [**5-15**] the EVD was clamped after CT head demonstrated stable ventricular size however it had to be opened approximately 2.5hrs after clamping for severe headache and episode of confusion.
His ventricular drain was clamped several times but patient continued to have elevated ICPs and severe headaches.
Plan for VP shunt was postponed on [**5-20**] for fever to 102.7.
Fever workup was negative for DVT with lower extremity Dopplers, negative consolidation on chest xray.
He devoloped a total body rash that resembled a reaction to dilantin and so the patient was transitioned to Keppra, Dilantin was stopped and the rash was treated topically with hydrocortisone cream and with Oral benadryl PRN.
No respiratory distress, no oral swelling.
He was afebrile on [**5-21**] and was neurolopgically stable with EVD in place while awaiting VP shunt placement.
His pain is well controlled and incision appear clean/dry/intact.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal cystic mass Sellar and suprasellar mass Hydrocephalus Increased intracranial pressures Post operative confusion Post-op fever   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?Please return to the office in [**8-3**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
