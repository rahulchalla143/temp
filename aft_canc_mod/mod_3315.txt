On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient felt well and denied chest pain.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATH at OSH ([**2113-8-21**]):  80% prox LAD stenosis, 80-90% LCx stenosis, 80% RCA and 60-70% ramus stenosis .
EKG on arrival: NSR at 70bpm, nl axis, near resolution of ST elevations in the precordium with biphasic T waves in V2-V5 .
No evidence of pulmonary edema or CHF.
80% proximal stenosis of the right proximal internal carotid artery.
80-99% left internal carotid artery stenosis.
There is decreased flow in the right vertebral artery, suggesting inflow stenosis.
Focal wall motion abnormality not able to be fully excluded.
Mildly dilated arotic sinus.
No AS or MS.  Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
80% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
Mid-LAD diffuse disease.
90% stenosis of the mid-LCX.
60% stenosis of the prox-ramus.
Carotid angiogram showed bilateral high grade focal disease.
Left subclavian artery with minimal disease.
Left Internal Carotid Artery with 99% stenosis.
This resulted in normal flow with filling of the ipsilateral Middle Carotid Artery.
ABDOMINAO/PELVIC CT:  NO retroperitoneal bleed.
Bilateral pleural effusions, sigmoid diverticula, degenerative changes in the right ischial bone.
Exophytic lesion of the lower pole of right kidney measuring 42mm.
COLONOSCOPY ([**2113-8-28**]):  The patient was found to have Diverticulosis of the whole colon, external hemorrhoids, Polyps in the rectum (these were not removed as the patient was on Plavix.)
There was no active bleeding during the colonoscopy.
No obvious upper GI source of bleeding.
UA ([**8-22**]): > 50 RBCs, 0-2 WBCs, [**7-16**] epis     Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 15499**] is a 78 year-old female with a 50 pack year smoking history admitted to OSH for antero-septal ST elevation myocardial infarction with three vessel disease and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
Anterior ST elevation MI.
Patient with severe 3 vessel disease with smoking as an only known risk factor for coronary artery disease.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was chest pain free with improvement in ST elevations on EKG.
Pre-op carotid US showed a  80-90% bilateral carotid stenosis, making her a poor surgical candidate for CABG.
Therefore, in the setting of the patient's recent anterior myocardial infarction and proximal LAD lesion, the patient was taken for a cardiac catheterization ([**2113-8-23**]) with LAD thrombectomy and drug eluting stent placement in the LAD.
Carotid Stenosis:  Carotid US showed bilateral 80-90% carotid stenosis.
Peripheral catheterization on [**2113-8-24**] showed a 60% Right Internal Carotid Artery stenosis and a 99% Left Internal Carotid Artery stenosis.
PUMP:  Echocardiogram on [**2113-8-22**] showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% with mild LVH and impaired ventricular relaxation.
She has no know history of heart dysfunction or congestive heart failure.
The patient was treated with metoprolol 12.5mg TID to maintain a low heart rate and allow left ventricular filling.
Due to her low-normal blood pressure, an ACEI could not be started in the hospital, but she may benefit from one in the future.
She was completely asymptomatic at that time, without tachycardia, chest pain or shortness of breath.
Etiology of hypotension unclear, but on questioning pt reports "always having very low blood pressure."
There was no evidence of bleeding post cath, and HCT was stable.
She was given 2 fluid boluses with slight elevation of blood pressure and good urine output, but continued to have MAPs lower than 60.
Additionally, peripheral catheterization showed an  80% Right Subclavian Artery Stenosis, causing even lower pressure readings by cuff measurements taken in her right arm.
The patient was stable with good urine output and no change in mental status.
A abdomino-pelvic CT was performed to rule out an retroperitoneal bleed.
Although her HCT rose to 27.0 on [**2113-8-26**], she reported that she had multiple loose, bloody stools.
On [**2113-8-27**], a NG lavage showed no blood and the bleed was assumed be from a lower GI source.
There was no active bleeding during these studies.
Arthritis: The patient reports a history of degenerative joint disease.
When the patient describes the pain, she states that it does not stay confined to the joints and that the pain shoots down her arms and legs.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction 2) Bilateral carotid stenosis 3) Right Subclavian Artery Stenosis 4) GI Bleed 5) Rectal polyps   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulating  Discharge Instructions:   During this hospitalization, you were diagnosed a myocardial infarction or a heart attack.
The type of heart attack that you had is called an anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
We treated this with a cardiac catheterization and a stent in one of the coronary arteries.
Additionally, during this hospitalization, you were found to have narrowing of the arteries in your neck.
Finally, you had a GI bleed during this hospitalization.
2)Because you have had a heart attack, it is important for you to follow up with a cardiologist.
