Admission Date:  [**2149-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-6-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-4-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: GI Bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Balloon enteroscopy  History of Present Illness: 81yo M w/ PMHx of CHF (EF <45% on [**5-17**] ECHO), recent DVT in left arm [**1-8**] PICC on heparin SQ and Fe-deficiency anemia w/ recent GI bleed last month who presents to the ED after capsule endoscopy showed active bleeding in small bowel.
With this report from capsule endoscopy, the patient was referred by GI to the ED for admission and further evaluation/treamtent for possible balloon enteroscopy.
He endorses poor appetite but has not had weight loss.
Patient was type and screened.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Recreational Drugs: denies use   Family History: Son with MI requiring CABG at age 50.
Brother had an MI at age 63.
No crackles or wheezes.
No murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Normal, active bowel sounds present.
Midline, healed surgical scar appreciated.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or pitting edema b/l.
No ulcerations or rashes.
Jejunum:  A circumferential friable mass of about 4-5 cm in length with luminal narrowing and areas of ulceration was noted in mid/distal jejunum.
Retrieval of the capsule was not possible due to the angulation of the scope and the resultant difficulty in passing instruments down the scope channel.
Impression: A circumferential friable mass of about 4-5 cm in length with luminal narrowing and areas of ulceration was noted in mid/distal jejunum.
Retrieval of the capsule was not possible due to the angulation of the scope and the resultant difficulty in passing instruments down the scope channel.
These findings are compatible with a small bowel tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 81yo M w/ PMHx of CHF (EF <35% on [**5-17**] ECHO), recent DVT in left arm [**1-8**] PICC on heparin SQ and Fe-deficiency anemia w/ recent GI bleed last month who presents to the ED after capsule endoscopy showed active bleeding in small bowel for further management.
#GI Bleed/ Acute blood loss anemia: Capsule endoscopy showing active bleeding in the small bowel.
Of note, patient recently had a CT abdomen/pelvis that showed a segment of abnormal bowel wall thickening involving the midline small bowel, which has a dilated appearance and is adjacent to several prominent mesenteric lymph nodes.
This appearance of aneurysmal dilation of small bowel is concerning for small bowel lymphoma.
Patient reports dark, tarry stools, but has not had frank blood in his stools.
The procedure revealed a friable tissue mass consistent with distal small bowel tumor.
They have been told that the patient is at risk of further bleeding and/or obstruction without this surgery and that surgery would, in many ways, be palliative.
He is expected, however, to have continued slow oozing from this mass.
He was also seen by oncology who recommended surgery and noted that it was consistent with a palliative approach.
Patient appeared euvolemic on exam without LE edema, crackles, or elevated JVD.
These medications were initially held given his NPO status for procedure.
#h/o UE DVT: When discharged from hospitalization when he developed UE DVT, the patient was started on [**Hospital1 **] heparin injections for prophylaxis per Heme-Onc consult from last admission.
It is possible that hypercoagulable state may be due to a possible malignancy (suspecting small intestinal lymphoma).
The risk of holding heparin and resulting DVT and pulmonary embolism, potentially resulting in death, was explained to the patient.
The risk of giving heparin and likely continued oozing from his mass was also explained to the patient.
Bleeding could be treated, however, with blood transfusions, whereas pulmonary embolism is less treatable and could be deadly.
Differential included HIT versus medications.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
You underwent an endoscopy and had a mass that was biopsied.
