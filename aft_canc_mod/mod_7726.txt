Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis with stable diffuse sigmoid mural thickening and mild stranding.
Degree of involvement correlates with extent of diverticulosis, favoring chronic diverticulitis as the primary process on underlying Crohn's disease.
Direct visualization by colonoscopy is recommended after acute symptomology resolution for further evaluation.
Stable pulmonary nodules consistent with known metastatic carcinoid tumor.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
CXR ([**2167-3-21**]) - FINDINGS: Minimal linear opacities are present in the left base and may reflect atelectasis or scar.
There is no consolidative opacity to suggest an infectious pneumonia.
Small left pleural effusion versus minimal pleural thickening appears unchanged.

No viral cytopathic changes identified.
Active colitis with ulceration.
No viral cytopathic changes identified C.  Sigmoid colon:     1.
Active colitis with ulceration     2.
No viral cytopathic changes identified.
Active colitis with ulceration.
No viral cytopathic changes identified.
Note:  No granulomata or dysplasia identified.
Immunohistochemical stain for CMV was negative in parts A and C  GI Bleeding Study ([**2167-3-30**]) - IMPRESSION: Active bleeding first occurring at 67 minutes in the area overlying the pelvis between the iliac arteries, although localization to a portion of the bowel was not possible.
GI Bleeding Study ([**2167-4-4**]) - IMPRESSION: No active bleeding seen during the duration of the exam.
Diverticular disease with focal ulcers and CMV inclusions.
No evidence of chronic colitis/Crohn's disease.
Stress Test ([**2167-4-14**]) - IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
CT Head ([**2167-4-14**]) - IMPRESSIONS: No definite acute intracranial pathology seen.
Hypodensity along the left anterolateral aspect of the pons could represent streak artifact; however, old infarct could also have this appearance.
If there is concern for acute infarction, MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
There may also be a small lacune in the right paramedian pons (2:12).
Echo ([**2167-4-16**]) - The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the left ventricle with sparing of the basal inferior/inferolateral/anterolateral walls.

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of prior study (images unable to be reviewed) of [**2166-7-4**], biventricular systolic function, the severity of mitral regurgitation, and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure have worsened.

Suboptimal examination for evaluating segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries.
New moderate pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Incomplete evaluation of known widespread pulmonary carcinoid metastasis, due to respiratory motion and presence of effusions with compressive atelectasis.

Bilateral pleural fluid.
EMG ([**2167-4-20**]) - IMPRESSION: Technically difficult, complex, and abnormal study.
The findings are suggestive of a generalized myopathy with myotonic features affecting predominantly lower extremities.
The lack of denervation on needle EMG argues against a superimposed acute or subacute lumbosacral polyradiculopathy or other neurogenic process.
The poor activation noted in several muscles is likely the result of poor patient effort or central nervous system disease.
Degenerative changes at the lumbar spine, with more pronounced changes at L4-L5, and L5-S1.

# GI Bleed/CMV colitis: Pt has had progressively bad bloody diarrhea with recent admission for a similar presentation.
Pt had only been at rehab for 1 week when he returned with multiple bloody BM's and hypotension at rehab believed to be [**1-6**] volume depletion [**1-6**] bloody diarrhea.
This was initially felt to be most c/w his presumed Crohn's diagnosis as carcinoid does not cause bloody diarrhea and his stool cultures were negative including c diff x3.
Due to continued bloody diarrhea, on [**3-25**], pt had a sigmoidoscopy which showed diffuse ulcerations, cobblestoning, erythema, and friability extending to the distal transverse colon c/w severe Crohn's disease as well as diverticulosis of the descending colon and sigmoid colon; 4 biopsies were taken which were negative for active CMV.
Pt recieved infliximab on [**2167-3-27**] (hep serologies and ppd negative) with minimal effect.
On [**3-29**], pt again had bright red [**Month/Year (2) **] per rectum with tachycardia and was again transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU pt continued to have intermittent BRBPR with coincident hct drops for which he required several more units of PRBCs.
On [**3-31**], pt underwent CSCY which was notable for a bleeding vessel in the sigmoid colon which was injected.
On [**4-4**], pt underwent a bleeding study that showed no active bleeding.
On [**4-6**], pt went to angio and found to have an intermittently bleeding branch of the left colic artery but too tortuous for intervention thus pt taken to OR on [**4-7**] and underwent L. colectomy with colostomy with specimen sent to pathology which returned positive for CMV inclusions.
He had visual complaints and ophtho was consulted with concern of fungal infection (see below).
Prior to discharge, the patient's surgical site was noted to have pus-like drainage from its inferior aspect.
The PICC tip was sent for culture.
# CMV Viremia:  ID was consulted on [**4-11**] and recommend CMV VL which returned at 39, 900.
He was initiated on IV ganciclovir and had a negative opthalmology exam for retinitis.
A peripheral flow cytometry was ordered and did not reveal any significant abnormalities.
# AMS/weakness: Neurology consulted for AMS on [**4-15**], and patient was found to have proximal muscle weakness.
Thought to be possibly secondary to CMV polymyositis.
MRI T spine was limited but revealed no specific abnormality.
MRI L spine showed moderate right subarticular recess narrowing at L4-5 and mild left subarticular recess narrowing at L2-3 level, as well as soft tissue edema around the spinous processes in the lumbar region.
EMG showed generalized myopathy with myotonic features affecting predominantly lower extremities.
# Tachycardia: Triggered multiple times on the floor and transferred several times to the MICU ([**3-25**], [**3-29**]).
His HR went up to 200s, sinus tach vs atrial tachycardia.
They recommended deferring treatment for tachycardia, but suggested nodal agents/antiarrhythmics once more medically stable.
Throughout his hospitalization he has been on various medications on and off for tachycardia including diltiazem, esmolol drip, standing metoprolol iv and po.
A nuclear stress test was ordered that showed EF 20% (two years ago EF 50%) and an echo was done per cardiology request that showed biventricular dysfunction, EF 20%, MR/TR, RV volume/pressure overload (see below).
# HF: Patient was intermittently treated with iv lasix though overall this had been held given the concern for bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
Though his admission he did develop an oxygen requirement 2L nasal cannula to NRB.
CXR was notable for diffuse alveolar opacities c/w CHF and pulmonary edema.
A nuclear stress test was ordered that showed EF 20% but normal perfusion (two years ago EF 50%) and an echo was done per cardiology request that showed severe hypkinesis of LV (EF 25%), dilated RV w/ hypokinesis, RV pressure/volume overload, worsening MR (3+), moderate TR (2+) and moderate PA systolic HTN.
CTA was performed, which showed no evidence of PE but did show pleural effusions.
# Anemia: Felt to be secondary to GI bleed.
# Thrombocytopenia: Developed thrombocytopenia [**3-27**] with a nadir of 19 on [**4-6**].
His thrombocytopenia was suspected to be secondary to bone marrow suppression from CMV.
# HTN: Patient admitted with hypotension that improved with ivfs and pRBC.
# CAD: Troponins were elevated but stable during pt's hospitalization.
Perfusion scan did not show perfusion defects pointing against ACS.
At times, he did complain of some chest discomfort, which seemed more pleuritic in nature.
His aspirin was held during his hospitalization, given his recent GI bleed.
# Metabolic Alkalosis: Felt to be related to diuresis, given rising bicarb and low chloride.
Feel that OS lesion could represent fungal process vs chorioretinal atrophy.
Of note, colectomy samples did not show evidence of Crohn's.
# Anal Fissure: Pt noted to have large non-healing anal fissure.
Pt's hypdrocortisone enemas were discontinued given severe irritation of perineal area.
# Carcinoid Tumor: S/p left lower lobe wedge resection per chart, was being followed conservatively.
# Hypernatremia: Noted on admission.
