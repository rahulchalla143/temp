Admission Date:  [**2170-1-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-1-8**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F  Service:  DEATH SUMMARY:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented to [**Hospital1 **] - [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-12-29**] with right-sided weakness and difficulty swallowing and was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
Head CT demonstrated a lesion in the left frontal lobe consistent with metastatic renal carcinoma.
Over a relatively short period of time, his right-sided weakness improved.
He was noted to have intermittent word-finding difficulties and a lumbar puncture was performed with cytology pending.
He was noted to have had a low ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent, as well as focal wall motion abnormalities that were new since [**2168-1-12**] in the distal anterior apical region.
Carotid ultrasound was performed which showed 60 to 79 percent right internal carotid artery stenosis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2169-5-12**].
Subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.5.
ALLERGIES:    No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease or malignancy.
The patient's general exam was significant for decreased breath sounds at the apices bilaterally.
A II/VI systolic ejection murmur was noted.
On initial neurologic examination he was described as having full power in the extremities bilaterally with intact cranial nerve exam on the Medicine neurologic examination  LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION:  Head MRI demonstrated a mass along the superior sagittal sinus and left parietal convexity without herniation or mass affect.
EKG demonstrated T-wave inversions in the inferior leads as well as V3.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  A Neurology consult was obtained with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and it was felt that the patient's right hemiparesis was likely secondary to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] paralysis.
On [**1-4**], the patient underwent an MRI of the head, subsequently found to have evidence of a complete right internal carotid artery occlusion and underwent angiography for possible revascularization.
The MRI scan was performed in the setting of incoherent speech, evidence of left-sided neglect and right gaze deviation.
During angiography, the patient was found to have 100 percent occlusion of the internal carotid artery on the right and this lesion was not amenable to stenting.
........... venogram showed decreased flow in the superior sagittal sinus.
Repeat MRI scan did not show evidence of DII abnormalities despite complete right internal carotid artery occlusion.
Head CT did not show evidence of bleed but there were hypodense regions along the right centrum semiovale.
The patient subsequently developed a fever and he was started on aspirin and Plavix.
On [**1-6**], the patient had an episode of tachycardia with a drop in his blood pressure to a systolic of approximately 130.
He was felt to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and was restarted on amiodarone.
On [**1-7**], the patient was noted to be less responsive and had pupillary asymmetry with a dilated pupil on the right.
head CT to rule out herniation and there was evidence of significant mass affect with right hemisphere edema.
On [**1-8**], the patient subsequently had a systolic arrest and was pronounced dead at 3:40 a.m.                               [**Name6 (MD) 725**] [**Name8 (MD) 726**], M.D.
