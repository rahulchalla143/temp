She does note baseline shortness of breath from pulmonary involvement of disease, but no oxygen requirement.
She denies any bleeding including blood in urine or stool, epistaxis or gum bleeding.
No recent fevers, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
She has had chronic sciatic pain for which is on narcotics and that may have been a little worse today.
She also had an episode of diaphoresis today.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: Diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosing) in [**2123**].
The patient initially was treated with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine with subsequent disease recurrence.
In [**2-/2130**] (about one year post transplant) a CT evaluation revealed recurrent disease in her chest and abdomen.
She underwent a biopsy of her anterior mediastinal adenopathy that revealed recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.
PET/CT done in [**2-/2131**] still shows some FDG avid lesions in lung.
Hodgkin's lymphoma with the details described above.
Previous history of clot in left SVC.
She was on Coumadin for a period of time but this has been held due to her low platelet count.
Her father was diagnosed recently with  pancreatic liver and colon cancer of unknown primary.

No abnormal epidural soft tissue or abnormal epidural fluid collections.
No evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
[**5-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Apparent slight enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, which may be accentuated by lower lung volumes on the current study.
Left hemidiaphragm is chronically significantly elevated and the resultant left lower lobe is chronically collapsed.
Moderate left pleural effusion was little changed between [**4-4**] and [**5-16**], but has increased subsequently.
No pneumothorax.
New, extensive consolidation within the left lung.
The differential diagnosis includes infection or marked radiation pneumonitis.
Increase in small-to-moderate left partially loculated pleural effusion with possible component of pleural thickening.
The differential diagnosis includes parapneumonic effusion/empyema, or neoplastic involvement of the pleura.
Marked increase in left chest wall and breast edema could represent post- radiation change or lymphatic obstruction.
No significant interval change in left chest wall and mediastinal masses, although comparison is difficult due to technique.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Questionable new nodule in right middle lobe, difficult to assess due to motion artifact in this area.
Increased left pleural effusion resulting in complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
Resolution of pulmonary edema.
Stable bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged left chest wall and breast edema secondary to lymphatic obstruction or post- radiation change.
Multiple mediastinal and chest wall masses, relatively unchanged, but new pulmonary nodules in the right middle lobe are identified.
No fluid collections in the abdomen or pelvis, or other definite evidence.
[**2131-6-14**] CT head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: Bilateral frontal subcortical white matter hypodensity, more prominent on the left.
No abnormal enhancement noted.
These findings could be due to an area of lymphomatous involvement (though it is more common to see contrast enhancement at such involvements); other differential diagnosis to be considered are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, encephalitis.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 38 year-old female with refractory and recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**2128**], asplenic, and status post multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, s/p Mini allo-MUD [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] on [**2131-5-22**].
Hodgkins Lymphoma: She had a response to ICE and it was felt that her disease burden was low enough to allow the SCT.
Her conditioning regimen consisted of Campath, fludarabine, and Cytoxan.
Her POC remained in place during her transplant given her history of chest wall edema and the risk of poor healing.
She was initially started on Cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis but she subsequently developed ARF requiring HD so this was stopped and high-dose Methylprednisolone was started in place.
The pt was also started on clotrimazole, nystastin, and ursodiol for prophylaxis and given a dose of aerisolized pentamadine and then bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
A CT chest continued to show progression of the pt's lymphoma, and given the pt's high tumor burden and poor prognosis, lack of further options for treatment, and persistent respiratory failure, the decision was made during a family meeting to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
The pt was extubated on [**6-11**] but was reintubated again the day after for hypercarbia, increased work of breathing, and sedation needs beyond those that were safe off of the vent.
The pt had no increased secretions suggestive of infection, however completed a course of vancomycin and cefipime for empiric tx of VAP and was placed on voriconazole for fungal coverage.
Myopathy of critical illness was also a likely contributing factor to the pt's inability to be weaned off of the vent.
The pt was scheduled to go to the OR for a trach placement when she had a precipitious drop in WBC, likely [**12-28**] myelosuppression from bactrim.
Mental status changes: The pt began to develop mental status changes that were noted during sedation weaning.
A LP done by IR on [**6-20**] was significant for a bloody tap not concerning for bacterial infection; however all viral cultures eventually came back no growth.
CT and MRI of brain were both concerning for PML/encephalitis/toxicity from chemotherapy.
A repeat MRI showed decreased instensity of parietal lobe abnormality; per neurology, pt's mental status changes likely [**12-28**] reversible luekoencephalopathy.
The pt had several episodes of hypotension during CVVHD and was unable to be transitioned to HD during hospital course.
Diarrhea: Had 2 days of diarrhea during course but was c diff negative X 3 and it did not persist .
Breast pain: before intubation, she complained of chronic L breast swelling, erythema and pain; thought to be secondary to LN involvement and chest-wall mass; inflammation swelling seemed to correlate to volume status.
Breast pain and swelling subsequently resolved during hospital course.
Dispo: Given pt's grave prognosis, high tumor burden, lack of further treatment options, and persistent respiratory failure, a family meeting led by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was held in which the family decided to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
