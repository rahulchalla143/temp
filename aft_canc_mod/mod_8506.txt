Admission Date:  [**2122-1-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-1-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath and altered mental status.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname 32277**] [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of dementia, atrial fibrillation on aspirin, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED from [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Center, where he lives, with altered mental status and increased respiratory rate.
Notably, since [**2119**] he does appear to have a chronically elevated white count (mid to high teens) with neutrophilic predominance.
He had an electrocardiogram that showed non-specific st-changes in V2-V6.
A urinalysis showed many bacteria, negative leuk esterase and negative nitrite.
A chest x-ray showed multiple areas of patchy opacities consistent with possible aspiration pneumonia.
He was given 2+ liters of IVF for volume resuscitation and admitted to the ICU given his oxygen requirement (non-rebreather).
His O2 sat improved to 92% on 2L thus his presentation was thought to be most consistent with an aspiration pneumonitis.
Past Medical History: - Per prior cardiology note, had an echo with trivial to mild TR, enlarged RV and possibly a PFO.
- Longstanding exertional dyspnea - has pulmonologist who reportedly has done "multiple tests with no abnormalities" - Polymyalgia rheumatica (ESR initially 100, now 6) - HTN - TIAs - per wife, 10yrs ago he had a few minutes of unsteadiness - Hyperlipidemia - h/o prostate cancer, s/p resection [**2096**] - Recent admission for rapid heart rate (wife does not know why) - R postsurgical pupil - MGUS - Baseline Cr 1.4-1.7 in [**10-21**] (no earlier levels known) - PALPITATIONS - shown to be ventricular premature beats in multiple Holter monitors - MITRAL VALVE DISORDER - ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - LUMBOSACRAL SPONDYLOSIS - ATRIAL PREMATURE BEATS - GERD - Degenerative disk disease in the thoracic spine.

This may account for the appearance of decreased aeration at the left base in the region of pneumonia that involves the mid and lower lung zones on this side.
Mild basilar atelectasis is seen on the right and the central catheter remains in place.
It is difficult to determine whether there may still be slight coiling distally  HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2122-1-16**]: No evidence for acute intracranial process.
Changes consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease and age-related cortical atrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: Altered mental status: likely was multifactorial due to aspiration pneumonia, hypoxemia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, all in the setting of baseline dementia.
His mental status improved with treatment of these problems however given his severe underlying dementia he did not improve to the point at which he was able to cooperate to take POs.
He would answer "no" to pain, nausea or shortness of breath.
