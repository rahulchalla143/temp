No perforations were identified in the small and large bowel, however saline flushed through the left-sided transhepatic catheter produced a large amount of fluid leaking from the hilum of the liver.
Dissection further up into the hilum of the liver gave visualization of the transhepatic catheters as they coursed through the common bile duct.
There was a large segment of the anterior wall of common bile duct that was necrotic and there was a large hole in the bile duct.
It was felt that a Roux hepaticojejunostomy could not be done due to the tumor present so transhepatic catheters were opened to drain to widely drain the hilum.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2187-12-6**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Patient also had Vanco resistant Enterococcus recovered from Bile and fluid cultures on [**12-9**], Sensitive only to Linezolid.
On [**12-12**], Meropenem was d/c'd due to potential for causing mental status changes per neuro recommendations.
During the post-op period, abdominal exams were noted to produce tenderness on palpation.
Abdominal CT performed on [**12-6**] to assess status of continuing abdominal tenderness and distention showed interval decrease in the amount of ascites and no evidence of obstruction.
OT in agreement with team assessment of cognitive impairment, easy distractability and poor insight.
Patient is a fall risk.
Patient was started on home dose of escitolpram, but was subsequently d/c'd due to concerns for mental status changes.
Hydrocolloid dressings to be changed every 3 days with use of air mattress being employed.
Pullback Cholangiogram on [**12-13**] showed both right and left internal-external biliary drains demonstrating opacification of the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and intrahepatic ducts.
There is contrast extravasation from the common hepatic duct along the right undersurface of the liver.
