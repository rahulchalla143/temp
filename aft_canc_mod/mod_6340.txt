Admission Date:  [**2127-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-4-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-12-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided liver biopsy PICC line placement, removed IVC filter placed R IJ triple lumen catheter  History of Present Illness: This is a 61-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma status post six cycles of R-CHOP between [**6-/2126**] and [**10/2126**] and also status post five cycles of high-dose methotrexate and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate, who presents with symptoms cough, shortness of breath, mild chest discomfort, generalized weakness, and possible syncopal episode at his rehab facility today.
Given that he had recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for similar symptoms, the rehab staff was concerned that he had again experience a syncopal episode, and sent him to [**Hospital1 **] ED for further evaluation.
The patient states that he does not recall losing consciousness earlier today, but cannot elaborate any further and cannot say if he forgot any of the events which occurred earlier this morning.
He does describe that he had mild chest discomfort and left thigh pain that made him feel short of breath and unable to talk, but that he is currently pain free.
He also states that he has had symptoms of a cough and shortness of breath for a few days, but that his shortness of breath today was worse.
He had radiographic evidence concerning for a RUL PNA on CXR.
EKG showed non specific lateral T wave changes, as well a troponin level of 0.26, however, upon arrival there, the patient denied having any symptoms of chest discomfort earlier in the day.
The patient was given 2gm of IV Ceftazidime for his pneumonia and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care per the request of his family.
Troponin was found again to be slightly elevated (0.39), but lower than when he was recently discharged.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the [**Name (NI) 3242**] service on [**2127-2-11**] for nausea and abdominal pain.
He underwent a work up which included a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed colitis involving the distal portion of the transverse colon, descending colon, and proximal sigmoid colon.
A new 2cm right hepatic lesion concerning for lymphoma was also identified on that scan.
The patient also underwent an EGD that was unremarkable, Sigmoidoscopy which confirmed pseudomembranous colitis, and an upper GI study which showed dysmotility in the lower third of esophagus, but no evidence of stricture or mass.
Shortly after discharge, the patient returned to the ED after being found by EMS to have altered mental status, junctional bradycardia with HR 20-30's, and hypotension with systolic BP's in the 80's.
The patient was observed on the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service, underwent a TTE which showed a normal LVEF, mild MR but otherwise no significant valvular abnormalities, and no overall interval change from previous TTE in [**2126-12-19**].
The patient was evaluated by EP and determined to have had experienced a vasovagal episode.
Troponins during that admission were mildy elevated, but were determined to be secondary to demand ischemia, with flat CKs as well.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented to an outside hospital in [**6-25**] with a  30-pound weight loss over the prior 6 months.
He was worked up and found to have a soft tissue mass in the cardiac ventricles involving the myocardium and extending into the interatrial septum.
He was also noted to have multiple pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions, a pericardial effusion, large bilateral adrenal masses, and diffuse soft tissue masses involving both kidneys.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by the development of tamponade physiology, and the patient ultimately underwent a pericardial window.
A renal biopsy on [**2127-7-23**] confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Stage 4B), and a pericardial biopsy on [**2127-7-25**] also was consistent with large B-cell lymphoma.

Right apical pleural thickening and scarring persists.
No definite acute focal pneumonia.
On the right, there is a small amount of intraluminal material in the right mid superficial femoral vein where the vein does not compress completely, consistent with a very small amount of residual thrombus.
Aside from the focal abnormality in the mid right superficial femoral vein, deep veins of the right and left lower extremities are patent and compressible, with normal waveforms and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: Mild residual thrombus is present in the mid right superficial femoral vein, which is not fully compressible at this time.
Unilateral Extremity Ultrasound (L leg): IMPRESSION: Occlusive DVT involving the left common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein in its proximal and mid portions.
Marked bowel wall thickening and edema involving the cecum and ascending colon, consistent with typhlitis.
Additionally, inflammatory changes surround the transverse, descending and sigmoid colon, and rectum, but to a lesser degree than the cecum and ascending colon.
No evidence of perforation.
Cholelithiasis with unchanged prominent CBD measuring 11 mm and proximal pancreatic duct measuring 5 mm.
Heterogeneous hypodensities of the inferior poles of the right kidney, adjacent to the inflamed bowel and mesentery, likely reactive inflammation.
Unchanged atherosclerotic disease with stable mild aneurysmal dilatation of the right common iliac artery.
Previously noted right hepatic lesion not well visualized.
Near-complete interval resolution of left chest wall mass, with decreased cardiac masses, consistent with improvement in lymphoma.
Circumferential wall thickening and inflammatory change involving the proximal ascending colon, suspicious for colitis which may be infectious or inflammatory in nature.
Stable right upper lobe consolidation with central cavitation, with multiple additional nodular opacities which are stable to minimally decreased in size, as described.
Multiple peripheral renal hypodensities bilaterally, which may reflect infection, small regions of infarct, or may be related to the patient's known lymphoma.
Fullness of the adrenal glands bilaterally.
This is slightly more prominent at the lateral aspect of the left adrenal gland, but no definite focal adrenal lesion is seen.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the distal aorta with bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms measuring up to 2.5 cm in size on the right.
These findings may be consistent with typhlitis, a diffuse colitis, or Clostridium difficile colitis.
Patent abdominal arterial vasculature including the arterial and venous systems.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
New abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Dilation of the left femoral vein compared to the right raising concern for a thrombus within the left femoral vein and would recommend further evaluation with ultrasound.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

Bili 0.5   Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o M with hx of DLBCL who presents with second syncopal episode in one week, with continued elevated troponins and unclear etiology of syncope.
Hospital course complicated by fever and neutropenia secondary to clostridium difficile infection, typhlitis, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Hospital course by problem list:  # RUL PNA: On admission, patient with symptoms cough and shortness of breath, and noted to have thickened sputum production at [**Hospital **] hospital with portable CXR concerning for pneumonia.
Repeat PA and lat CXR here did not show a pneumonia and the zosyn was stopped after two days because he did not clinically appear infected.
Then had an episode of aspiartion while in the CCU and found to have aspiration pneumonitis v. aspiration pneumonia on CXR.
His cough and symptoms improved.
# Pre-syncope: Episode very similar to previous episode of syncope, occuring after pt had BM, with associated transient hypotension and bradycardia.
By time of admission, the patient was normotensive, without bradycardia, and alert.
During admission he was asymptomatic and monitored on telemetry for four days.
He had no alarms.
He had orthostatic hypotension with daily vitals.
His syncope was thought to be either secondary to vaso-vagal syncope associated with BMs or orthostasis.
We did not start beta blocker because of orthostasis.
We started captopril for hypertension while lying down and wanted to optimize his cardiac standpoint.
He stood up, walked to the chair, sat down for a few minutes then felt dizzy and became unresponsive.
EKG showed new T wave inversions.
He complained of SOB and O2 was 98% on RA.
Cards was reconsulted and he was transferred to CCU for possible EP study as arrhythmia as possible cause of syncope.
CCU Course: Pt did not have any further episodes of syncope or arrhythmia while monitored on telemetry on the cardiology floor.
No EP study was performed since pt did not have any further episodes despite having several BMs on the floor.
He was later found to have lymphoma involvement of the heart based on CT scan, which was likely the cause of the syncope.
He had no more syncopal episodes.
# Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Patient is s/p 6 cycles R-CHOP + Methotrexate, completed in [**10-26**].
However, recent CT abdomen showed evidence of new liver lesion concerning for disease recurrence.
The biopsy was positive and on workup of other disease, was found to have involvement in his heart, chest wall and retropharyngeal space.
No discrete hepatic lesions noted on CT abdomen on [**3-21**].
Flow cytometry showed indefinite evidence of lymphomatous involvement of the CSF.
He was followed by neuro-oncology in-house who recommended no further IT ARA-C and to follow his neurologic symptoms clinically, and to re-refer him back to his outpatient neuro-oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79456**] if he had any worsening confusion or neurologic symptoms.
# Febrile neutropenia -  Patient had fever and neutropenia, and was treated with IV and oral vancomcyin, cefepime, flagyl, ciprofloxacin and micafungin.
Likely source was C. difficile infection (see below).
# h/o C Diff colitis: Pt with episode of diarrhea at rehab, and with loose stool here.
Had continued diarrhea while inpatient and was started on PO flagyl.
When he became neutropenic, his diarrhea started to be more severe and he had abdominal cramping and a positive c.diff again on [**2127-3-12**].
Diarrhea has slowed down dramatically and C. difficile toxin assay was negative x3 on discharge.
# Typhlitis: Noted in the setting of chemotherapy.
# DVTs - was initially on lovenox for DVT diagnosed in [**Month (only) **].
Lovenox was held for liver biopsy and repeat B leni's showed no further DVT, so it was decided to not continue lovenox.
Then his L leg swelled again and he had another DVT in his left common femoral vein diagnosed on [**2127-3-10**].
An IVC filter was placed in lieu of anticoagulation because of his low platelets from chemotherapy.
An ultrasound showed extensive clot in the subclavian and axillary veins.
# Elevated Troponin / likely CAD: Troponin found to be slightly elevated during last admission and determined to be from demand ischemia, as patient was asymptommatic.
Earlier today, pt complained of mild chest discomfort, and troponins still slightly elevated, but trending down from last admission.
Plan was for stress test as outpatient and started aspirin.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: Patient had a history of this, then multiple episodes of AF w/ RVR while inpatient.
Patient was transferred to the MICU twice for AF w/ RVR and hemodynamic instability.
He had 2 episodes of AF w/ RVR in the setting of being diuresed, one requiring ICU transfer for hemodynamic instability.
He was followed by cardiology who recommended aggressive electrolyte repletion (K > 4, Mg > 2 at all times), no further diuresis with lasix as he was intravascularly dry, (leg elevation and [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings for his lower extremity edema) and rate control with Toprol XL PO daily.
He has had intermittent atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic stability, blood pressures in the 100s-110s systolic.
He was stable in normal sinus rhythm but had another episode of afib on [**2127-4-25**] in the morning, lasting for 4 hours.
He should be given an extra dose of Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg PO at midnight to prevent atrial fibrillation in the morning.
#) VRE urosepsis: Noted to have VRE urosepsis on [**2127-4-8**] with positive blood and urine cultures.
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis.
He had no other evidence of blood infection, fevers or hemodynamic instability after Daptomycin was stopped.
#) Platelet refractoriness: Was noted to not be adequately increasing platelet count after transfusions during neutropenic nadir.
Recovered and began responding to platelet transfusions once out of neutropenic nadir.
# Back pain- Patient complained of chronic backpain and had decreased rectal tone on exam so L-S MRI ordered but pt refused.
L-S plain films showed no evidence of fracture, no evidence of lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Minimal dextroscoliosis with no otherwise gross abnormality.
There are dense areas in the right upper abdomen most likely representing diverticula.
We had the pain service see him and he was switched to methadone 5 mg TID and morphine for breakthrough pain.
# Double vision: Seen by opthalmology, has 6th cranial nerve palsy.
No evidence of lymphomatous involvement causing palsty.
Pt should be monitored on telemetry for atrial fibrillation.
Wound Care: Patient has a pressure ulcer on sacrum: Turn patient side to side while in bed off back.
Please apply a thin layer of DuoDerm Gel to the coccyx ulcer and apply Mepilex sacral border dressing over the area.
Antibiotics: IV Flagyl should continue until [**2127-5-8**] which is 14 days after other antibiotics stopped to treat C. Diff infection.
