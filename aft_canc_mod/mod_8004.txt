loss over several months, increasing SOB with exertion, and left LE swelling/erythema over the past 2-3 weeks that is increasingly painful.
Denies chest pain or pressure.
Denies hemoptysis or night sweats.
Past Medical History: Smoker 55yrs 2ppd PVD CAD S/P CABG [**2125**] - LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA.
CHF - EF 25-30% (in [**2125**]) - now essentially has Class III failure Hard palate SCC -dx.
pigmented lesions of the face and chest, NAD CTA, mild expiratory wheezes RRR, occ premature beat, mid-peaking crescendo-decrescendo murmur, [**12-28**] Abd soft, nt, nd, bs+ Thin, wasted extremities, mult.
stigmata of vascular insuficiency: dry, lichanified, skin, warm, but non-palpable pulses, Lt. LLE painful to touch, erythematous, open lesion b/t 4th and 5th toes, no purulence, but serous drainage.
Ventricular premature beats.
Left atrial abnormality.
Modest non-specific low amplitude lateral T wave changes.
Since the previous tracing of [**2135-12-20**] limb lead QRS voltage is lower making assessment for possible prior inferior wall myocardial infarction more difficult, and lateral T wave amplitude is lower.
CXR: Large left effusion, obscuring the left mid and lower lung.
There are degenerative changes at the tarsometatarsal joints.
There is no osseous destruction visualized to confirm osteomyelitis.
CT CHEST: There is a large layering left pleural effusion causing eversion of the left hemidiaphragm and extending into the azygoesophageal recess.
There is atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula.
A 2.6 x 2 cm lobulated, pleural-based solid mass is seen in the left upper lobe abutting the mediastinal pleura, however, without any invasion of the mediastinal pleura or the lateral chest wall.
A 4-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule is seen in the right lower lobe (image 2:36).
There is an enlarged 11-mm subcarinal lymph node.
There is no hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ABI/PVR: Findings consistent with significant aortobi-iliac level arterial disease.
In addition, there is most likely significant tibial level arterial disease bilaterally.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal to mid inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CAROTID DOPPLER: Findings as stated above which indicate 60-69% ICA stenoses bilaterally   Brief Hospital Course:   Shortly after admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed respiratory distress in the setting of aspiration and a large pleural effusion, requiring intubation and transfer to ICU.
While in the ICU his pleural effusion was drained and found to have malignant cells.
Recently the medical team had discovered a lung mass by imaging studies and this was felt to be the likely primary.
After drainage of the effusion and placement of a pleuridex catheter pt was able to be extubated.
Shortly after extubation pt required re-intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
At that time the patient was found to have a re-accumulation of the pleural fluid as well as pulmonary edema.
Pt was initially admitted for severe peripheral vascular disease and resultant necrosis of the distal toes.
Medications on Admission: None  Prescribed Medications In Past: (very poor compliance) Zestril Coreg 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] Singulair Combivent Wellbutrin  Per patient, he is not taking any of these medications.
