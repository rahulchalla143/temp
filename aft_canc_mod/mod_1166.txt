She reports epigastric abdominal pain and nausea, and she took Maalox for her pain with improvement.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of her hematemesis vs hemoptysis.
She denies recent fevers, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea (although she does endorse frequent stools since her last hospitalization), denies chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath.
Of note, the patient reportedly has had several GIB's in the past due to a Dieulafoy lesion including a recent episode in [**2158-6-7**] during which she was intubated with a hct 20 and 500cc bloody NGT output.
She had an EGD at [**Hospital3 17162**] at that time which showed a Dieulfoy lesion with active bleeding which was clipped x2, and she was discharged on PPI for chronic suppressive therapy.
She reports that since her discharge, she has experienced continued nausea but denies any abdominal pain or hematemesis.
In [**Hospital1 18**] the ED, initial VS: 98.0 70 96/62 16 97% 2L Nasal Cannula The patient was found to have mild abdominal discomfort and on rectal exam, had brown, guiac positive stool.
NG lavage revealed flecks of blood which were guiac positive, and subsequently put out 200cc of bright red blood mixed with stomach contents.
She did not have any further episodes of emesis subsequently.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient reported continued abdominal pain but denied nausea, hematemesis, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a tricuspid valve prosthesis, the nature of which is not evident on the basis of this study.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present (?mild-to-moderate) but could not be quantitated with certainty.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
Impression: the markedly elevated antegrade pressure gradients across prostheses in the tricuspid and aortic positions suggest a mechanical abnormality such as immobilized leaflet (pannus ingrowth vs valve thrombosis); consider transesophageal echocardiography to better define  ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2158-8-3**] 8:28 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Trace pleural effusions seen bilaterally.
Nodular hepatic architecture with no focal liver lesion identified.
Small bilateral simple cyst seen in each kidney.
ECG Study Date of [**2158-8-4**]  6:05:18 PM Atrial fibrillation.
Delayed precordial R wave progression.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-8-2**] the rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 65 0 94 476/484 0 -24 -18   EGD [**2158-8-2**] Findings: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade I varices were seen in the esophagus.
Stomach:  Lumen: A large hernia was seen with a potentially para-esophageal component.
Protruding Lesions A single 4 -5 mm polypoid lesion was found in the stomach body.
Impression: Esophageal varices Polyp in the stomach body Hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE:  60yoF with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, with mechanical aortic, tricuspid, mitral valves on Coumadin, h/o afib, h/o upper GI bleeds in the past [**3-15**] Dieulfoy lesion presenting with hematemesis.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to GI Bleeding (Duelifoy's Lesion): Pt was admitted after noting some blood on her pillow that was thought to be [**3-15**] GI bleed given the presence of blood on gastric lavage.
She underwent an EGD which showed 4 cords of grade I esophageal non bleeding varices, large hernia with possible para-esophageal component, protruding 4 -5 mm polypoid lesion in the stomach body.
No active signs of bleeding were noted, her GI bleed was thought to be [**3-15**] Dieulafoy lesion that intermittently will bleed, hence her prior history of GI bleeds.
The polyp was not biopsied given the patient's elevated INR and she will need a repeat polypectomy.
She was also started on Levo/Flagyl (PCN allergy) for SBP ppx.
She had no further bleeding during her admission   #.
Coagulopathy, s/p Mechanical Valves x3: Patient with aortic, mitral, tricuspid valves due to endocarditis, INR goal between 2.5-3.5 with current INR goal closer to 2.5 given GIB weighed against risk of thrombus given her three mechanical valves.
Chronic Hepatitis C: Pt with h/o Hepatitis C, likely [**3-15**] past IVDU.
Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Pt has a history of CHF, prior to her leaving the ICU she was noted to have more pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateraly effusions with the rt effusion being larger.
COPD: No evidence of an acute exacerbation, Atrovent and Albuterol nebs were continued  #.

Disp:*21 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Upper gastrointestinal bleed  Secondary Mechanical heart valves with aortic stenosis Pleural effusion Depression Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
During your time in the intensive care unit, you did well and did not have any further episodes of bleeding.
The gastroenterologists perfomed and endoscopy (looked inside your stomach with a camera) and saw a vessel that was not bleeding.
During your hospital stay you developed more shortness of breath and a chest xray showed a pleural effusion on the right side.
This was after you had received a lot of fluids in the intensive care unit and given your heart condition probably led to the effusion.
We gave you some medicine to get the fluid out and this worked and you had no further symptoms.
Because of this we got a transthoracic echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) which showed some changes in your mechanical heart valves.
