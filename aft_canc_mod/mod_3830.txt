Admission Date:  [**2138-9-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is an 86-year-old woman history of [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] cancer s/p resection who presented to her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**9-4**] with a 1-week history of feeling fatigued and increased abdominal distension.
Per the office note, patient has felt "miserable" with extreme fatigue and weakness for one week.
She has also had dry cough with occasional left-sided chest pain occurring with cough.
She endorsed anorexia and minimal urine output.
She has not had nausea or vomiting, but she has had a few episodes of diarrhea with no significant bleeding.
In the ED, her initial vitals were significant for hypotension (SBP 90s-100) despite 1.5 liters intravenous fluid.
Her blood work showed acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 1.7 from baseline 1.0.
CT [**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis with contrast showed numerous enlarged lymph nodes and renal hypodensities.
As she remained persistently hypotensive after volume rescuscitation in the ED, she was admitted to the intensive care unit.
At time of admission, she had received 3L IVF, with SBPs ranging 90-100 and very low urine output.
Denies significant weight loss.
Past Medical History: --OSTEOPOROSIS: only intermittently on Actonel b/c of GERD --HYPERLIPIDEMIA --HYPOTHYROIDISM --[**Last Name (un) **] CANCER s/p left colonic resection for [**Location (un) **] B tumor, in [**State 2748**]; last surveillance colonoscopy done in [**2136**], notable for ascending and sigmoid diverticulosis --CLAUSTROPHOBIA --CATARACTS --HYPERTENSION --URINARY INCONTINENCE --GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX --HEARING LOSS   Social History: Lives at home with husband.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp:98.9 BP: 131/73 HR: 76 RR: 20 O2sat: 98%RA GEN: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules.
No rebound tenderness or guarding.
Well-healed transverse surgical scar over mid-abdomen.
No secondary excoriations.
Mild left axis deviation, possibly physiologic.
No ischemic ST-T wave changes.
Generalized lymphadenopthy from a coincident nonneoplastic systemic illness may be considered, but felt less likely.
Chest Radiograph [**2138-9-4**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: in summary an 86-year-old woman with remote history of [**Year (4 digits) 499**] cancer s/p resection, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presents from primary care office with one week of increasing abdominal distension, anorexia, fatigue and poor urine output, admitted to the ICU for further work-up of hypotension and acute kidney injury.
Hypotension: Pt vaguely described intermittent anorexia and mild nausea over the last week, concerning for volume depletion.
No clear signs of infection, though perhaps symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and drenching sweats point to systemic process.
Not on recent steroid therapy, making adrenal insufficiency less likely.
Responded well to volume resuscitation, with no need for vasopressors.
Acute kidney injury (Cr 1.7): likely perfusion-related kidney injury in the setting of poor po intake.
UA negative, though specific gravity of 1.030 suggests volume depletion.
FeNa 0.8%, FeUrea 30.6%, consistent with pre-renal state.
Enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and atypical lymphocytosis: In setting of one year of drenching night sweats, this is concerning for lymphoproliferative disorder vs hematologic malignancy.
LDH elevated to 373.
# Transaminitis: Elevated ALT/AST from prior.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent viral infection (viral hepatitis vs systemic viral infection).
No referable symptoms to right upper quadrant.
# Hyperlipidemia: patient with elevated transaminases; statin and fibrate held as above  Medications on Admission: --Amlodipine 2.5 mg once daily --Atorvastatin 40 mg once daily --Fenofibrate 145 mg once daily --Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily --Levothyroxine 125 mcg once daily --Lisinopril 40 mg once daily --Metoprolol succinate 75 mg once daily --Potassium chloride 10 mEq once daily --Aspirin 81 mg once daily --Multivitamin once daily --calcium dose unclear --[**Name2 (NI) 42298**]-3 fatty acids dose unclear   Discharge Medications: 1. allopurinol 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
