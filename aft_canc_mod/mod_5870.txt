Admission Date:  [**2158-11-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2158-11-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-4-11**]     Sex:  F  Service:  IM-[**Last Name (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 63 year old woman with multiple medical problems including pancreas divisum, diabetes mellitus type 2, transaminitis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hemorrhoids, Crohn's Disease in remission, metastatic pancreatic cancer to liver.
She was in her usual state of health until seven days prior to admission, when she noticed a swelling of her left foot.
Three days later, there was swelling noted on the right foot as well as right leg and thigh.
Over the following day, her swelling increased and coolness and discoloration were noted in the lower extremities causing pain on ambulation especially with dorsiflexion.
There was no associated shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, headache, change in vision or change in mental status.
The patient called her primary care physician who scheduled [**Name Initial (PRE) **] lower extremity venous duplex at [**Hospital1 190**] which showed bilateral deep venous thromboses.
The patient was given 80 mg of Lovenox subcutaneously there and was directly admitted for treatment of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has complained of recent dry mouth, loss of taste and weakness.
Denies any recent weight loss, chest pain, dizziness, fever, chills or night sweats.
In general, chronically ill appearing in no acute distress.
Mucous membranes were moist; no adenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or rhonchi, breath sounds normal.
Cardiovascular examination:  S1, S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Ill defined immobile mass in the left lower quadrant, nontender, nondistended, no rebound, guarding or rigidity, bowel sounds normal.
Extremities with bilateral pitting edema to knees, plus four, right lower extremity greater than left.
Bilateral discoloration, right greater than left.
Venous duplex:  Extensive deep venous thrombosis from common femoral vein to popliteal veins bilaterally.
Assessment:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old woman with multiple medical problems, of note, metastatic pancreatic cancer to the liver, who presents with increased lower extremity swelling for one week, subsequently found to represent bilateral deep venous thromboses.
Given the high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism in the setting of metastatic cancer, it was decided to order a CT angiogram to evaluate the possibility of pulmonary emboli.
Subsequent CT showed significant filling defects in the pulmonary circulation representing massive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit where the patient arrived to the Medical Intensive Care Unit alert and oriented in no apparent distress.
She was in sinus tachycardia with heart rate in the low 100s with no ectopy seen at the time.
There were no complaints of shortness of breath or chest pain.
Her groin site was intact with no signs of hematoma or bleeding.
She continued having bilateral lower extremity edema however.
Upon arrival to the regular medicine floor, the patient continued to be tachycardic and hypotensive.
The patient was preload dependent and needed boluses to maintain her blood pressure.
During the rest of her hospital stay, she continued in sinus tachycardia with no arrhythmias noted on Telemetry.
Respiratory she remained comfortable saturating in the 90s on room air with no desaturation.
The rest of her hospital stay was complicated by oliguria followed by anuria.
Urinalysis was sent which results were consistent with a urinary tract infection.
intake, the patient persisted with poor appetite.
She remained afebrile afterwards, however, she remained anuric.
The patient's hypertension was an indication of her hemodynamic instability in light of the thromboembolism.
While initially she had low blood pressure throughout the course of her hospital stay, she became normotensive.
For her thromboembolic disease, the patient was thought to have an element of mild DIC, in light of the low platelets and high INR and presence of thromboembolic disease in the lower extremities and in the pulmonary vasculature.
While the patient is on a chemotherapy regimen with Taxotere, the possibility of a low grade DIC could not be excluded in this setting.
For her malignancy, her end stage pancreatic cancer, again being treated with Taxotere palliatively, but will be held for the time being as per oncologist.
Her electrolytes were noted to be low, specifically magnesium and potassium.
Pulmonary embolism / infarction.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Hypotension as a result of thromboembolic disease.
4   Tachycardia as a result of thromboembolic disease.
Azotemia in the setting of oliguria and subsequent anuria.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
