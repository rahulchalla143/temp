A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    73 year old woman with likely CHF and pneumonia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    Interval change?
Minimal tendency to increasing consolidation at both lung bases, as manifested by slight decrease in extent of the previously visible air bronchograms.
Brief Hospital Course: #.Hypoxia:  Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-19**] with respiratory distress and decreased O2 sats.
CXR was taken and showed both findings suggestive of pulmonary edema and opacity probably representing atelectasis or pleural effusion, but could not rule out infectious processes.
It is unclear whether she suffered flash pulm edema from a supraventricular tachycardia or infectious etiology, but pt had not produced sputum, and remained afebrile throughout ICU course.
Pt did not feel short of breath at this time, and for the remainder of her hospital course.
It was presumed that her hypoxia was due to pulmonary edema from the patient's CHF.
#.Diastolic CHF: pt was found to be fluid overloaded on admission, and pt was given 80 mg IV Lasix twice while in the ICU.
Pt did not complain of abdominal pain or diarrhea during admission.
#.Tachycardia: pt's tachycardia was controlled during hospitalization with home doses of metoprolol and amiodarone, to be continued as written.
#.Chronic kidney disease: pt's Cr showed a small increase during diuresis for fluid overload, but normalized according upon titrating down the dose.
