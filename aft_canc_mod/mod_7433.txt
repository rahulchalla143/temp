Admission Date:  [**2142-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line  History of Present Illness: 89 year old male with HTN, CHF (EF 40%), chronic aspiration, celiac sprue and recently diagnosed IgA nephropathy with hemodialysis initiation in [**3-12**] and subsequent transfer to a nursing home, who presents with a 2 weeks history of diarrhea, found to be hypotensive at rehab.
The patient states that he has been having diarrhea for the last week or so at rehab.
He has become progressively more fatigued over the week, but otherwise has been feeling well.
He denies any fevers or chills, dysuria, cough, shortness of breath.
Of note, he had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**3-12**] for acute on chronic renal failure at which time he was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy and started on HD.
During this hospitalization he was diagnosed with C. Diff which was treated initially with flagyl, but later changed to PO vancomycin given concern that flagyl was contributing to mental status changes.
While in the ED he was noted to have 2-3 episodes of ventricular tachycardia on telemetry lasting about 15 seconds during which time he was asymptomatic.
An EKG after the episodes demonstrated sinus tachycardia with T wave flattening throughout the precordium, no ST segment changes.
Patient denied any chest pain currently, or in the past.
LVEF 40%, with RV systolic function mildly depressed as well.
Also with signs of diastolic dysfunction.
3) Gout 4) Chronic renal insufficiency with superimposed acute renal failure; renal biopsy in [**3-12**] with IgA nephropathy.
5) Celiac Sprue 6) History of aspiration pneumonia 7) History of MRSA pneumonia 8) History of Clostridium Difficile infection [**3-12**] 9) Anemia of chronic inflammation   Social History: Patient currently living in a nursing home since last admission.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, though heart sounds are distant.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at L base and dullness to percussion.
Groin: R groin with bandage in place, no bruit or hematoma.
[**2142-6-7**] 02:39AM STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN B ASSAY-DETECTED  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypotension: On admission, there was clinical concern for sepsis given hypotension, leukocytosis, and hypothermia.
By HD #[**2-9**], he was maintaining adequate blood pressures without fluid boluses.
2) Diarrhea: Felt most likely from C. Diff colitis.
He was started on empiric metronidazole on admission and stool samples sent for C Diff toxin assay.
Despite negative laboratory data, there was high clinical suspicion for C Diff.
Oral vancomycin was added for coverage of metronidazole resistant C Diff, with prompt response and near resolution of his diarrhea.
4) Ventricular tachycardia: He had ventricular tachycardia in the ED, possibly secondary to chronic scar given biventricular failure.
He had no signs of active ischemia.
Troponin was chronically elevated and unreliable in setting of end stage renal disease, with a normal CK.
He had no further ventricular tachycardia on telemetry.
5) Atrial tachycardia:  He had intermittent atrial tachycardia during his hospitalization, with a rate of around 100.
He seemed to tolerate this well, without associated hypotension or symptoms.
7) CHF: He had a history of biventricular heart failure, both systolic and diastolic, therefore fluids were given judiciously initially.
He continued to appear hypovolemic by exam, and never had any signs of fluid overload other than mild bipedal edema.
8) Mixed Respiratory and Metabolic acidosis:  He initially had what appeared to be an acute respiratory acidosis based on ABG, with additional metabolic AG acidosis (AG at 16, and expected much lower given last albumin 2.2), in part secondary to lactic acidosis, possibly also contribution of unmeasured anions in renal failure.
It is unclear what caused his respiratory acidosis.
His metabolic acidosis resolved with treatment of his sepsis and decrease in his lactate.
9) Eosinophilia:  He was noted to have a chronic eosinophilia.
A cortisol level was checked to rule out Addison's Disease, which was normal.
11) Celiac sprue: Continued a gluten-free diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement.
12) Thrombocytopenia: Noted to have thrombocytopenia during the last hospitalization at which time a HIT antibody was negative.
It was noted that he has a concurrent anemia with elevated MCV (with normal B12), and large platelet forms.
This could possibly represent myelodysplastic syndrome  An outpatient hematology consult is something to consider should his blood counts worsen.
14) Corneal ulcerations: Diagnosed with bilateral exposure keratopathy and corneal ulcerations by ophtho during last admission.
Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen 500 mg Q6 hours Milk of Magnesia prn, bisacodyl prn Methylphenidate 10 mg PO QAM Pancrease 1 cap PO before meals TID Cyanocobalamin 500 mcg PO daily Allopurinol 100 mg PO QOD folic acid 1 mg PO daily Vitamin C 500 mg PO daily Calcium acetate 667 mg PO TID with meals Cholestyramine 1 packet PO Q 8 hours Chlorhexidine 30 mL?
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Armenian Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Clostridium Difficile Collitis Diarrhea Hypotension secondary to dehydration End stage renal disease on hemodialysis Chronic tophaceous gout Celiac sprue Exposure keratopathy   Discharge Condition: Stable, resolved diarrhea, stable blood pressure   Discharge Instructions: 1) Continue your medications as prescribed.
- You were started on an antibiotic called vancomycin for an infection causing your diarrhea.
