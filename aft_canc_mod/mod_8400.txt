Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Hemostasis was obtained from a bleeding vessel around the pancreas and the aortic repair appeared to be intact.
Propofol use was minimized due to its hypotensive effect and her general dependence on pressors.
On [**2139-5-4**] she was noted to have a left lateral gaze deviation on exam; given her sedation it was difficult to evaluate for other signs of neuro deterioration and therefore she had a STAT Head CT; it was negative for a bleed and EEG monitoring was started shortly therafter and was negative for seizure activity.
Once PMV was placed she was able to talk, coherent speech, occasionally confuse but majority of time alert and oriented x 3.
She had several takebacks to the OR for washout of her abdomen and for intra-abdominal oozing/bleeding, around which her pressor requirement increased and she often required extensive blood, platelet, FFP, cryoprecipitate transfusions (see GI section).
Her endotracheal tube was exchanged for a percutaneous tracheostomy (done in the operating room during a concurrent takeback for a jejunal perforation) on [**2139-5-9**].
She had another acute desaturation episode on [**2139-5-9**] and continued to be persistently tachycardic (100s-110s).
Although she had other reasons to be tachycardic (persistent ooze intraabdominal, sepsis), she was also very high risk for a pulmonary embolism and since this could not be ruled out a CTA of the Chest was performed on [**2139-5-9**] in coordination with a CT Abd/Pelvis to assess for intraabdominal collection/bleeding.
She was taken to the OR for repair of the jejunal perforation with an omental patch and concurrently had placement of a jejunal tube (therafter used for tube feeding) and a tracheostomy.
She again appeared to make modest improvements in her overall status but had an increase in  her pressor requirement yet again after abdominal washout [**2139-5-13**].
She was taken back to the OR for a repeat washout on [**2139-5-14**] with an estimated 1 liter of clot/old blood removed, with the bleed/ooze originating from the liver bed which was treated with argon beam.
A CTA on [**2139-5-14**] did not show any active source of bleed but she continued to have a high pressor requirement and persistent need for transfusions.
Her bleeding issues resolved post-operatively after this procedure.
Decided to open inferior portion of the wound with removal of staples.
Mesh was noticed overlying abdominal contents.
To avoid the complications of cholestasis on an already compromised liver, the chloride/acetate ratio was optimized in conjunction with the nutrition consult service.
Renal failure improved significantly, with increasing urinary out put and decreasing creatinine.
She was initially on heparin prophylaxis due to her high risk factors for DVT but due to persistent bleeding concerns this was ultimately discontinued.
She had an IVC filter placed by interventional radiology on [**2139-5-19**], eventually re started and discharged on SCH  She did have extensive hematologic testing including measurement of factor levels and assessing for antibodies to platelets.
She did test positive for HLA antibodies for her platelets but the hematology service deemed it unnecessary for her to receive typed platelets.
ID: She had an impressive leukocytosis that peaked in the 40s on [**2139-5-1**] prior to trending downwards slowly to 15.3 on _6/12/12.
She tested positive for clostridium difficile on [**5-2**] and [**5-9**]; A flex sig on [**5-3**] during a takeback to the OR did now show pseudomembranes and she did not show evidence of complications of cdiff colitis during her stay.
Due to her sepsis-like picture and later her gastric perforation, persistently elevated WBC count, and low-grade temperatures while on CVVH, she was placed on additional broad spectrum antibiotics and completed a course of vancomycin, meropenem and micafungin which were discontinued on [**2139-5-21**] after 2 weeks.
The PO vancomycin was continued until [**2139-5-28**] as prophylaxis against recurrent cdiff infection due to multiple antibiotic use.
She also had Yeast infection with positive sputum, blood and peritoneal cultures, treated wiht fluconazole, patient was discharge with 7 more days of fluconazole.
