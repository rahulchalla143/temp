Admission Date:  [**2196-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-6-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: electric shock like sensation   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2196-12-14**]: Posterior cervical laminectomy C6-C7, T1-T2 for resection of intradural tumor at C7-T1.
History of Present Illness: This is a 76 year old white male who reported that he has had feelings of pins and needles in his right arm for years.
Two days ago he was shaving and he got an electric shock in the right side of this neck.
Motor:        B     T    IP    Q  H     AT    [**Last Name (un) 938**]    G R      5     5    5     5  5     5     5      5 L      5     5    5     5  5     5     5      5  Sensation: Intact to light touch, Reflexes:  Pa Ac Right       2 0 Left        2 0  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: His wound was clean and dry with resorbable sutures.
There were [**3-25**] areas of [**2-25**] mm cysts at the superior pole.
There was no drainage.
Flattening of the hemidiaphragms on the lateral film could suggest mild overinflation.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions.
No lung nodules or masses.
[**12-10**] CT C-Spine: IMPRESSION: Known intradural extramedullary mass at the level of C7-T1 does not appear to be associated with any calcifications on this non-contrast study.No expansion of neural foramina or bony erosion seen.
Cranio-cervical bony abnormality with spinal stenosis at C1.
No acute intracranial process.
No pathologic focus of enhancement; specifically, there is no finding to suggest meningioma in the intracranial compartment.
Mild-moderate global atrophy, particularly bifrontal cortical, and sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Relatively mild chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses.
Markedly dysmorphic appearance to the atlas and axis; please see separately-dictated report of the concurrent MR examination of the cervical spine.
This has imaging characteristics strongly suggestive of "typical" meningioma, with significant mass effect upon and compression of the subjacent spinal cord, without signal abnormality.
Likely os odontoideum with likely associated fusion anomaly involving the anterior neural arch of C1; as above; these dysmorphic vertebrae significantly narrow the ventral spinal canal and, in combination with the resultant angulation of the spinal cord, as well as ligamentum flavum thickening, severely narrow the spinal canal, compressing the cord, which demonstrates intrinsic signal abnormality, likely representing myelomalacia.
Instability with abnormal motion at this level (which commonly accompanies such anomalies) cannot be excluded on this static study.
Multilevel degenerative disease, most marked at the C5-6 level, where there is significant left anterolateral spinal canal and severe left neural foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left C6 nerve root.
An MRI of his neck and spine was obtained which revealed a extramedullary-intradural lesion occupying much of the spinal canal.
Findings were suggestive of a meningioma.
He was kept flat for 48 hrs to prevent CSF leak.
He was elevated on [**12-16**] without incident and transitioned OOB minimally.
His wound had running Monocryl superficial sutures with some small areas of cyst formation but no sing of infection.
Medications on Admission: pravastatin 40 daily, aspirin 81mg qod  Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever: max 4g/24 hrs.
Keep your wound clean and dry / No tub baths or pool swimming for two weeks from your date of surgery.
No pulling up, lifting more than 10 lbs., or excessive bending or twisting.
?Please return to the office in 10 days (from date of surgery) for a wound check.
