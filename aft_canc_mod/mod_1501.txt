Admission Date:  [**2156-7-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-11-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: confusion fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture Staple removal, fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and BKA sites Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: Briefly, 44yo man with h/o DM1, ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD s/p BKA [**6-25**], ?CVA 2y PTA after p/w first seizure, multiple seizures since, who p/w malaise, confusion, tremors concerning for sz, to OSH ED.
He was d/c'd to [**Hospital **] Rehab for 1 week, where starting several days PTA he began c/o increased urinary frequency and urgency x several days, but unclear if he produced urine.
Then 2d PTA had an episode of CP, SOB, diaphoresis, occasional jerking movements of his extremities and fasciculations of his abdominal muscles in context of elevated BP post-HD, which resolved spontaneously.
Because of hypertension to SBP 220s, he was started on his home agents, then changed to nitroprusside.
He was also started on insulin gtt for elevated fsbg in 300s.
HTN 3.
H/o CVA 2 yr ago 5.
H/o GBS 7.
Asthma 8. gullian bare syndrome  Social History: Married, two 6-yo twins, lives in [**Location 5450**] NH, on disability.
HEENT: Small 2 mm pupils equally reactive to light.
NECK: Supple, no nuchal rigidity CV: Tachycardic, hyperdynamic, systolic flow murmur, nl S1 S2 PULM: Coarse bs bilaterally, R>L ABD: +bs, soft, NT/ND EXTR: R BKA and groin incision healed with staples, thin, + R third digit erythema and excoriation, L foot excoriation, no frank pus NEURO: Unresponsive to voice or sternal rub .
Cardiomegaly and mild congestive heart failure versus volume overload.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2156-7-26**] 1:37 PM IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema, which may be due to volume overload in this patient with history of end-stage renal disease.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  [**2156-7-25**] 11:06 AM IMPRESSION: Simple fluid collection within the right groin.
CT RECONSTRUCTION  [**2156-7-24**] 9:17 PM CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 4.4 x 4.5 cm low-density rounded lesion within the right inguinal region.
This could represent a pseudoaneurysm or a mass, however, as contrast was not administered, its enhancement characteristics cannot be determined.
An ultrasound of this mass is recommended.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes.
TRACING #1 Read by: [**Last Name (LF) 2194**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] H. Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 101 140 82 300/358 22 -31 112  Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2156-7-23**] IMPRESSION: This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the presence of bifrontal and widespread slowing superimposed upon a slow background.
This pattern is most consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
The technologist did not note any episodes of unusual movements, and no evidence for ongoing seizures was seen.
Mild fusiform enlargement of the proximal portion of the right subclavian artery, corresponding to a diameter of 150 per cent as compared to the contralateral side.
No mural thrombus is seen.
[**2156-7-18**] Cardiology ECG Sinus rhythm Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2156-7-12**], baseline artifact seen  [**2156-7-18**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG obtained in wakefulness and brief stage II sleep.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
No intracranial masses visualized.
No acute stroke is seen.
Few foci of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter which may be related to chronic hypertension versus chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
[**2156-7-16**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)   IMPRESSION: Normalization of chest findings.
Good position of right-sided PICC line.
[**2156-7-13**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: Possibly normal EEG with an excessively drowsy record overall possibly suggestive of sleep deprivation or an early encephalopathy.
[**2156-7-12**] Cardiology ECG Sinus rhythm Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2156-6-29**], QRS voltage and ST-T wave changes more prominent  [**2156-7-12**] Cardiology ECHO 1.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on  the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is  seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2156-7-12**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION: 1) Increasing opacity in left retrocardiac region, which may be due to aspiration, atelectasis or evolving infectious pneumonia.
2) Possible mild fluid overload  [**2156-7-11**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION: Low position of endotracheal tube, terminating in the proximal right main stem bronchus.
Subtle increased opacity in left retrocardiac region, which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration or early pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 yo M w/ DM1, HTN, ESRD on HD, p/w delta ms x2d and marked fever x 1d.
Also had head CT that was negative for bleed or mass, EKG with peaked T waves but no ischemic changes, serum tox negative.
Repeat CXR showed increasing opacity in the left retrocardiac region, concerning for pneumonia.
Prior to transfer to floor, was followed by Renal who feel that symptoms on admit were likely from hypertensive urgency, and Neuro who feel that symptoms were c/w sz d/o (partial complex status epilepticus), recommended dilantin loading, EEG that was consistent with encephalopathy but without sz activity.
Delta ms: -was likely multifactorial, including some element from HTN, dilantin side effect as free dilantin levels were markedly elevated with %bound dilantin around 55%, possible postictal state.
HTN was intermittently brought under control but with continued encephalopathy.
Though no sz activity was caught on EEG, it was thought that the story of his presenting symptoms were likely possibly from a postictal state.
Patient's symptoms slowly improved, most notably after discontinuing the Dilantin, though it is hard to say for sure what the biggest factor was in his delirium.
He did have a second episode of encephalopathy during the later part of the hospitalization when the patient again became febrile.
It should be noted that on initial presentation the patient was also febrile so the second episode of fever/delerium may have [**Doctor First Name **] caused by the same factor as the first.
This would suggest that the first episode of delerium was not due to a seizure.
Had urinary sx on admit as well, with elevated WBC count and bandemia concerning for UTI; patient was anuric except for straight cath specimen that was overwhelmed with blood from the straight cath itself most likely.
His symptoms resolved after antibiotics were given in MICU.
His CXR was initially clear, but had some evidence of PNA on repeat and RN suctioned same material out of ETT that was vomited.
TTE was negative for vegetation.
He had recurrent fever on [**7-23**] and was pan-cultured with no obvious source found.
An ID consult was obtained and it was thought that he most likely had a bacteremia that was not caught on culture.
It seems likely the patient's hypertension is in large part volume dependent as his interdialyctic weight would often increase by as much as 6kg.
Anemia: stool found to be guaiac positive and because of unexplained hematocrit drop he underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy which revealed gastritis and a polyp (latter was biopsied- results pending at the time of this summary).
Although this was not likely to cause the drop in HCT, the patient was transfused and his HCT  remains stable to date.
DM1: was initially kept on lower dose of glargine in setting of poor PO intake, but then glargine was titrated back up in the setting of hyperglycemia and dietary indiscretion.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed: for pain from gangrenous fingertips.
Hypertensive urgency 2.
Dry gangrene of 2nd, 3rd digits on right hand, likely from microvascular disease though concerning for embolic disease from proximal vessels 4.
Right lower leg amputation, from prior admission 6.
If you develop confusion, lightheadedness, dizziness, systolic blood pressures consistently over 200mmHg, headache or visual changes, blood sugars consistently over 300 mg/dL, please call your doctor and/or go to the nearest Emergency Room for evaluation.
