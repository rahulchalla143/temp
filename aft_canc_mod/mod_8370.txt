History of Present Illness: HPI: 69 y/o female with a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach placement and revision [**5-/2147**], recently discharged [**2147-6-30**] with sepsis presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes in from [**Hospital3 **] with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
She also had a new PICC tube placed yesterday for additional access as her one PICC line was deemed inadequate.
The patient had known intermittent fevers with a negative workup for anything other than her TB ever since she was first diagnosed with TB in [**2146-11-21**], however yesterday she was noted to have increased fevers.
In addition, she was also noted to have a decreased hct and was transfused 2PRBC overnight.
This morning she was then noted have tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension with BP as low as the 60s systolic.
She remained on AC, no increased support requirements.
CT abd was obtained which showed no sign of abdominal abscess and normal positioning of the G-tube.
Past Medical History: Recent ID course summarized as: Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**].
Tobramycin was added on [**6-19**] for double coverage of resistent pseudomonas given poor lung penetration of Cipro.

No intra- abdominal abscesses are identified although difficult to evaluate given lack of IV contrast.
Enlarged bilateral inguinal lymph nodes and left flank subcutaneous nodules.
Left lower lobe consolidation.
Heterotopic new bone formation surrounding the left proximal femur, unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Increased airspace density within the left lung base, which may reflect pneumonia or aspiration.
Multiple ill-defined areas of low attenuation within an enlarged spleen, suspicious for infarction.
Interval progression of bilateral lower lobe consolidation, with stable small pleural effusions.
New simple appearing abdominal and pelvic ascites.
No significant interval change in abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy, compatible with known diagnosis of disseminated TB.
IMPRESSION: Limited ultrasound of the kidneys shows no hydronephrosis or perinephric abscess.
Peritoneal ascites with some complexity in the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen.
It is uncertain if this represents hemorrhage or other debris and infection cannot be excluded.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2147-8-8**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Other Laboratories: Cortsol-14.0 [**2147-8-1**]: Urine electrolytes Na 34 Cr 46 K 24 Cl 41 Peritoneal Fluid: Protein 2.9 Glucose 69 Albumin: <1.0 WBC 2967  Poly  48% Lymph  20% Mono 30%    EOs    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 yo female with a history of disseminated TB, significant brain injury from ischemia, vent dependency with tracheostomy, and MDR pneumonia who presented to the ED on [**2147-7-23**] with fever, hypotension and tachycardia.
She was found on admission to have a new LLL infiltrate on CT and CXR and a mild lactic acidosis.
Of note, she had a history of MDR pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli for which she completed a 14-day course of meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and inhaled tobramycin on [**2147-7-3**].
Her blood pressure in the ED was initially as low as a systolic in the 60's.
Sputum sample from [**2147-7-23**] grew out pan-sensitive Serratia and 2 strains of Pseudomonas, for which she was started on a 3-week course of inhaled tobramycin and ciprofloxacin that completed on [**8-11**].
ARF: On admission, the patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine of 3.2 with concurrent hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia.
At the time of her most recent discharge it was noted to be 2.6 and it was felt that the patient had renal damage secondary to recurrent exposures to nephrotoxic medications and hemodynamic instability.
On admission, the worsening from this baseline was thought to be due to acute renal failure from hypotension; her creatinine improved with IV hydration to 1.3.
Her hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia have also resolved.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: The patient was found on [**2147-8-5**] to have a positive UA and urine culture with 10-100,000 colonies of E. Coli sensitive to Zosyn, meropenem, and imipenem.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: The patient was noted to have a persistently decreased serum bicarbonate and a blood gas consistent with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with renal loss of bicarbonate.
Her picture was felt to be most consistent with a type I renal tubular acidosis, although the etiology is not entirely unclear.
Bicarb losses from chronic loose stools is also possible.
Attempts were made to increase her bicarbonate (and thus hopefully decrease her elevated respiratory rate) by tripling her replacement; her bicarb improved to 20 but she became alkalemic to a pH of 7.50 and had no improvement with her hyperventilation.
PERSISTENT INTERMITTENT FEVERS: Throughout this hospital course Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had persistent intermittent fevers.
As noted above, she was found to have pneumonia from Pseudomonas and a urinary tract infection from E. coli.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient with persistent respiratory failure throughout this admission.
It is likely that her respiratory failure is multifactorial.
She also presented with evidence of pneumonia and mild pulmonary edema.
She has been able to tolerate trials of pressure support for only short periods of time, but eventually becomes tachypneic over her already elevated baseline.
We attempted to decrease her respiratory rate by increasing her bicarb supplementation.
While her bicarb level did improve towards normal (up to 20), her respiratory rate never slowed even though she became alkalemic.
This finding points towards a central (brain) cause for her hyperventilation.
She underwent an abdominal/pelvic CT scan and it showed no signs of intraabdominal pathology.
A few days prior to discharge, the balloon from this tube was found to be outside of the abdominal skin.
The balloon was left deflated to prevent further erosion of the tract.
LACTIC ACIDOSIS: Patient noted to have an elevated lactic acid on admission of 3.3.
This was initially attributed to sepsis given her presentation.
She was started on thiamine out of concern that nutritional deficiency might be contributing.
ASCITES: The patient was noted on abdominal ultrasound to have free fluid in her pelvis.
Gram stain of her peritoneal fluid showed 1+ PMNs with no organisms.
Samples were sent for bacterial and mycobacterial culture.
The patient is completing a two week course of meropenem for her urinary tract infection and completed a three week course of ciprofloxacin and inhaled tobramycin for pneumonia.
ELEVATED INR: The patient has had an elevated INR throughout this admission ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 with a normal PTT.
Her increased INR has been attributed to malnutrition and prolonged antibiotic use.
She has had no evidence of active bleeding.
She did have mild hemoptysis at admission, but this was attributed to bleeding from earlier tongue bites.
TACHYCARDIA: Throughout this hospitalization the patient has been noted to have intermittent episodes of tachycardia to the 150s.
The tachycardia has not seemed to correlate with her blood pressure and is not responsive to fluid administration.
The etiology of her tachycardia is unclear at the time of discharge but does not appear to cause hemodynamic instability.
Echocardiogram on [**2147-7-26**] showed improvement of her global left ventricular systolic function from a prior study in [**Month (only) **], but worsening of her mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and anemia and is transfusion dependent for platelets and red blood cells.
Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are thought to be secondary to her myelodysplastic syndrome.
During her last hospitalizations, she was ruled out for active tuberculosis infection with three negative induced sputum samples.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient has a baseline decreased mental status secondary to multiple watershed infarcts of the brain, particularly of the right frontal lobe, and possible anoxic injury due to episodes of hypotension and/or hypoventilation.
SWOLLEN RUE: During her MICU course, the patient has been noted to have a warm, erythematous right upper extremity near the site of her original PICC line.
POSSIBLE SPLENIC INFARCTION: Patient has had two abdominal CTs and an abdominal ultrasound that have shown changes consistent in her spleen consistent with infarction.
DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient has a history of type two diabetes.
For this reason, she did not receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
