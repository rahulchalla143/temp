She has had a day of worsening shortness of breath.
She denies any chest pain or fevers.
On arrival to the ED, she was tachypneic and appeared uncomfortable.
Her chest xray was consistent with pulmonary edema.
She was also given inhalers which did not change her symptoms.
However, this was partially estimated due to incontinence.

Single, unmarried, no children.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Resp are labored, patient speaking in only short sentances.
Scattered crackles throughout, but exam limited due to resp distress,  No wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system demonstrated non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
The LAD had minimal luminal irregularities.
The LCx and RCA were noted to be free of any angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right- and left-sided filling pressures, with a RVEDP 11 mmHg and LVEDP 10 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with pulmonary pressures of 40/20, mean 31 mmHg.
There was mitral stenosis with a mean transvalvular gradient of 10.75 mmHg with a calculated mitral valve area of 1.5 cm2.
Selective renal angiography of the left and right renal arteries demonstrated no angiograhically-apparent stenoses or lesions.
Mild non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
Normal right- and left-sided filling pressures.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Systemic arterial normotension.
Moderate mitral valve stenosis.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal and apical LV hypokinesis (LAD territory).
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 13 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Post-radiation valvular disease with mild mitral stenosis and mild aortic stenosis.
Mild regional biventricular systolic dysfunction, most c/w CAD, although post-radiation changes cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year old woman with a history of cardiomyopathy thought secondary to radiation therapy.
She presents with a CHF exacerbation.
# Acute on chronic diastolic and systolic CHF: Her most recent echo showed a normal EF with diastolic dysfunction.
A repeat echo on this admission showed a depressed LVEF of 40%.
Her symptoms were most consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
# CAD: She has a history of CAD with a known stent in the LAD.
Her echo indicated reduced systolic function concerning for recent ischemic disease.
She was brought to cardiac catheterization where she was found to have non occlusive coronary disease.
Lisinopril and metoprolol were held due to hypertension but restarted on discharge.
# HTN As above, imdur, metoprolol and lisinopril were held due to hypotension.
# DM Continued home insulin.

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath, and this was because of a heart failure exacerbation - meaning you had build-up of fluid around the heart.
We also did a cardiac catheterization to look at the arteries that supply the heart, and this did not show any significant change from a previous procedure.
