The differential diagnosis includes a metastasis.
No evidence of new hemorrhage, infarct or hydronephrosis.
Post-surgical changes in the left frontal lobe with blood products at the surgical site and pneumocephalus.
Restricted diffusion is identified at the margin of surgical cavity which would be postoperative in nature but there is also noted a linear component which extends further deep into the white matter from the surgical cavity and could be related to associated area of ischemia.
Extensive changes of small vessel disease.
Left frontal lobe edema unchanged from previous study.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
She was transferred to SICU and MRI was ordered to rule out infarct.
MRI showed increase in edema and steriods were kept at 4mg Q6H.
She remained in the SICU while awaiting a floor bed and her aphasia improved to her baseline speech by POD2.
