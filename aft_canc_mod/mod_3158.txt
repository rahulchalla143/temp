Admission Date: [**2102-12-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2102-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-10-4**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MICU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a 43- year-old male, previously diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer, status post nephrectomy of his right kidney with recent clinical course significant for T7 spinal cord compression and large right loculated pleural effusion with pigtail catheter drainage who presented from rehab with shortness of breath, lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, and decrease in hematocrit requiring transfusion.
Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to have systolic blood pressure of approximately 100, to be tachycardiac to 110, and to have continued dyspnea with desaturations to 80 percent on nasal cannula oxygen.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell cancer with metastases to right pleura and spinal cord, status post right nephrectomy in [**9-19**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness to percussion.
Abdomen:  Obese, soft, and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.
Chest x-ray, re-accumulation of previously seen right-sided pleural effusion with a density at the right lung base representing pneumonia.
CT of the chest, loculated pleural fluid collections on the right with air-fluid levels consistent with empyemas.
Multiple pulmonary and liver metastases with lesions eroding into the left fifth and sixth proximal ribs.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially taken to Radiology for a CAT scan of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolus, at which time the patient became increasingly lethargic with a decrease in respiratory rate and was intubated for respiratory failure.
Additionally, the patient was given stress-dose steroids given his chronic steroid dependency, and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells given his new-onset anemia.
On hospital day two, the patient was made CMO and the cross covering medical intern was asked to evaluate the patient as he had become apneic and unresponsive.
Septic shock.
