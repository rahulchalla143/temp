Admission Date:  [**2138-9-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-10-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-2-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin / Demerol / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting and productive cough.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement Pheresis catheter placement and removal  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 y/o F with h/o AML M5a s/p MUD in [**6-13**] who returns to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] today because of nausea, emesis, and worsening productive cough.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] has GVHD and was recently admitted for diarrhea and fever.
Her post-transplant course has been complicated by chronic GVHD - involving mouth, liver, and eyes.
She also reports alot of stress with her children.
She doesn't drink, smoke, do any drugs  Family History: Mother with uterine or cervical cancer requiring hysterectomy.
Imaging: CT abdomen [**2138-10-19**]: Large extracapsular liver hematoma with a large amount of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic hemorrhagic ascites which is highly concerning for active bleeding given the patient's coagulopathy and dropping hematocrit status post liver biopsy.
Liver biopsy [**2138-10-16**]: Marked cholestasis with associated balloon-cell degeneration.
Mild lobular mononuclear cell inflammation and rare apoptotic hepatocytes.
Bile ducts and vascular structures, with no significant findings.
No definite features of graft-versus-host or [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease seen.
No viral cytopathic effect seen.
The main findings in this biopsy are severe cholestasis in the absence of bile duct damage or bile duct proliferation.
The differential diagnosis includes drug-induced injury.
The absence of bile duct proliferation does not support an extra-hepatic cause/obstruction of cholestasis.
Repeat US [**2138-10-14**]: No evidence of intraluminal thrombus within the left upper extremity venous system.
TEE [**2138-9-25**]: No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Multiple irregular nodules in the right upper lobe with patchy nodular and linear opacity in the left lower lobe.
Bacterial and viral pneumonias should also be considered.
Heterogeneous hepatic enhancement.
Given patient's history graft versus host disease was most likely.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is a 35 y/o F with GVHD on immunosuppresion now w/ a productive cough, nausea, emesis and acute renal insufficiency .
TTP/HUS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to BMT service on [**2138-9-14**] when she presented with approximately one-month history of nausea, emesis and worsening productive cough.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**8-30**] through [**9-10**] with diarrhea and fever.
During that admission her diarrhea was felt to be a flare of chronic GVHD.
When she was readmitted to BMT [**2138-9-14**] she was initially felt to have TTP/HUS-like syndrome and was initiated on plasmapheresis.
She was then found to have disseminated adenovirus infection (isolated from blood and stool).
Transaminitis: Her hospital course was also complicated by MRSA bacteremia (TEE negative, treated with Vancomycin x 4 weeks), and PNA (Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum) treated with Abx.
Following her biopsy, the patient was noted to have decrease in BP (baseline 160-180 systolic to 110-120).
Post-procedure, she was not getting transfused aggressively with platelets due to concern for TTP/HUS and her platelets went down as low as 11.
On the evening of [**2138-10-18**] she developed abdominal tenderness and urgent CT scan of abdomen [**2138-10-19**] showed hemoperitoneum.
Diarrhea: Patient has had frequent episodes of diarrhea and restarted Flagyl on [**9-16**] for explosive diarrhea.
C. diff negative x 2, stool studies negative or pending.
Colonoscopy was performed which revealed no evidence of GVHD.
Sputum gram stains: 4+ GPC's in chains, clusters, pairs; 4+ GNR's, <10 polys (patient neutropenic); culture showed MRSA and Pseudomonas.
CT showed infiltrates in RUL, LLL.
Blood cultures 2/4 positive for MRSA; however, decided to leave port in for now unless gets acutely ill. By discharge and after Abx treatment, her symptoms resolved.
#) Thrombus at site of port: U/S on [**9-17**] showed small non-occlusive thrombus about the site of the port.
Repeat U/S revealed no evidence of thrombus and vancomycin stopped.
Albuterol-Ipratropium 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-13**] Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Line care Please flush and care for PICC line as per protocol   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Home Health [**Location (un) 8117**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: AML adenovirus infection pneumonia hepatocellular necrosis thrombotic throbocytopenic purpura Secondary:   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You had a viral infection called adenovirus, which may have resulted in a condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
In addition, you had elevated liver function tests caused by a toxin.
