Menorrhagia labs were drawn and were essentially negative except mildly elevated prolactin which was repeated and noted to be within normal limits when fasting.
Different treatment options were discussed and the patient opted to proceed with surgical management with a diagnostic laparoscopy for possible total laparoscopic hysterectomy and RSO but understood that there was a likely risk of conversion to a laparotomy given her prior abdominal history and pelvic exam suggesting an enlarged 14 to 16 size fibroid uterus.
Past Medical History: - hypertension - hypothyroidism - anxiety - myomectomy x 2  Social History: - non-contributory  Family History: - non-contributory  Physical Exam: Physical Examination:  Pleasant overweight female in no acute distress.
Neck:  Supple, full range of motion, no thyromegaly, no nodules.
Back:  No CVA tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.
Well-healed low transverse suprapubic scar.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
On bimanual exam, uterus ~[**11-23**] wks size, the cervix is deviated very posteriorly and there are multiple palpable subserosal fibroids on the anterior lower uterine segment and fundus, compressing the bladder.
No palpable adnexal masses; however, the exam is quite limited due to the patient's body habitus.
Fibroids, menorrhagia, complex R ovarian mass On diagnostic laparoscopy, extensive adhesions were noted, and the decision was made to convert the procedure to an exploratory laparotomy.
Due to these extensive adhesions, as well as several cervical/parametrial fibroids, the case was prolonged and a significant blood loss sustained.
On the morning of POD#1 she was extubated without difficulty, and later that evening was transferred to the floor.
She remained afebrile and had stable vital signs, and was discharged home in good condition on POD#3.
Hypertension Home medication initially held due to significant blood loss during surgery.
