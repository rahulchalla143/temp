Admission Date:  [**2182-11-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-1-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-4-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Leukopheresis Central line placement and removal Arterial line placement and removal Intubation Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 53yoF with h/o DM2, Etoh abuse who presented to an OSH with confusion and urinary/fecal incontinence after approximately two to three months of non-specific symptoms, most noticeably fatigue.
Her symptoms had progressed, and on the day of admission, she was found by her husband sitting on the floor, quite confused, and was taken to OSH ED.
There had also been a complaint of dry cough and rhinorrhea x 2d.
Of note, pt had recent a recent work-up in [**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) **] for weightloss (~30lbs over past year) which included labs notable only for anemia and CT Abd which per husband "showed pancreatitis."
Family History: No known family history of hematologic malignancy.

Respiratory failure -- Initially intubated at an OSH, Mrs. [**Known lastname 59246**] proved difficult to extubate because of poor oxygenation related to large bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.
Given her functionally neutropenic state, cefepime and vancomycin also were initiated for a possible bacterial process, with azithromycin added later for atypicals.
Although afebrile following this, her temperature curve could not be interpreted due to steroids given in stress-dosing.
However, the following day her steroids were stopped and she became increasingly tachypneic and re-spiked a temperature.
She was unable to be weaned off the ventilator, and eventually developed pulmonary changes consistent with end-stage ARDS/fibrosis.
After 2 weeks on steroids repeat CXR should slight improvement of diffuse infiltrates.
Her ventilatory settings were gradually weaned and she was able to tolerate PS with minimal pressures and PEEP.
Unfortunatley she had an event of hemoptysis in which she desaturated into the 70's and required increase vent support.
Also around this time she developed fevers and bacteremia.
CXR during this period showed persistent signs of ARDS with no improvement in lungs on CXR.
The patient had increasing respiratory distress from [**2183-2-8**] onward and became increasingly difficult to ventilate with worseining CXR on full coverage of antimicrobial agents.
Blast crisis -- Most likely AML.
More definitive chemotherapy was initially put on hold given her poor respiratory function/infection (as described below) and her initial echo with and EF of 30%.
She was transfused multiple times to keep her Plt > 10 and Hct > 20, eventually having a minimal response to transfusions.
DAT was positive for anti-SDH, which according to the blood bank, was not enough to account for what would have been the degree of hemolysis needed for the lack of response.
She remained neutropenic for 2-3 weeks then as she improved her WBC began to slowly rise again.
She had a period where she was non-neutropenic for about 7 days during whichc she was afebrile and off of antibiotics.
Also noted during this period was that she had no blasts in her peripheral blood samples.
Thus it was decided to re check a bone marrow biopsy to determine if the patient had AML or more of a MDS picture.
After being non-neutropenic for 7 days or so her counts began to drop at which point it was discovered she had VRE and MRSA bactermia.
Anisochoria -- Noted on the first morning of admission, the patient's anisochoria manifested as a dilated right pupil that was sluggishly reactive as compared to a smaller, reactive left pupil.
A stat head CT was obtained without obvious abnormalities and neurology was consulted.
An MRI additionally failed to provide and explanation, and ultimately, it was felt that this was due to the disease process, possibly a leukemic infiltrate.
On CT she was also noted to have splenic infarcts; however, her other respiratory and infectious problems prevented any further workup for possible infiltrative disease.
Elevated LFTs -- Present upon admission, the top two theories were alcholic hepatitis versus leukemic infiltration.
She had an ultrasound that showed findings consistent with fatty liver disease and a solitary nodule.
Her LFT's remained stable but elevated, and CT showed liver disease, which would have required MRI or biopsy; however, other clinical problems prevented further workup.
RUQ uUS showed no evidence of cholecystitis but she did have a thickened GB fundus indicative of possible adenomyomatosis.
Otherwise she had no specific abd complaints and her labs were followed.
ID: The patient had a positive DFA, and was started on tamiflu empirically.
She was also started on ambisome, which was discontinued due to renal failure; then caspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole due to concerns for cholestasis.
She was continued on imipenem and voriconazole empirically for febrile neutropenia.
After she was non-neutropenic for several days and afebrile the imipenem and voriconazole were removed.
So she was restarted on daptomycin, and  cefepime was added as well for fever of neutropenia.
This was a high grade bacteremia with multiple cultures coming back positive.
However given this finding and persistent fevers of neutropenia voriconazole was added back to abx regimen.
Echo initially showed decreased EF, which gradually became hyperdynamic as she continued to be septic.
Her volume status corrected on its own as the patient autodiuresed which helped to substantially decrease her peripheral edema.
There was concern for CVA so MRI was done which was negative for stroke.
At that point it was felt the dilated may have been secondary to infiltration due to AML.
However given her other medical conditions this was not further worked up until later in her course.
This time there was evidence of ischemia in 2 areas of the brain.
The other was a small stroke that was concerning for embolic event.
However neither stroke could account for her MS changes or the dilated right pupil.
Ophtho was consulted and it was discovered that the patient had acute angle glaucoma in the right eye which could account for the dilation.
It was felt she likely had acute glaucoma around time of admission leading to the dilatation of the right eye.
As described above she had MRI which showed evidence of two areas of ischemia in the brain.
However they were small and could not account for her MS changes.
Lumbar puncture was done to rule out malignant involvement.
This came  back negative for malignant cells in the CSF.
Her stroke risk was also worked up with negative vascular disease, carotid stenosis, and negaitve echo.
Her MS slowly improved with time and was felt to have been caused by slow metabolism of the on board sedatives.
Unfortunately she had developed severe muscle weakness during her stay likely secondary to steroids and critical illness.
EMG and nerve conduction studies showed severe ICU myopathy and polyneuropathy.
