The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed a large mucopurulent plug aspirated from the R mainstem bronchus.
BAL was done (gram stain negative for organisms).
Vancomycin and Gentamycin were restarted given acinetobacter and MRSA seen in sputum several days prior (course had been completed).
They do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD10.
The immunophenotypic differential diagnosis of a CD5-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders includes  a) An early, evolving Prolymphocytic leukemia.
Note: review of her peripheral blood shows 12% mature appearing lymphocytes with 2% atypical lymphocytes with prolymphocytic features.
b) A chronic lymphocytic leukemia with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PLL).
Given the dim surface immunoglobulin expression and subset expression of CD23, this possibility is less likely, however, sample will be sent to cytogenetics for FISH analysis to look for t(11;14) to exclude this possibility.
