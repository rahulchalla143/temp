Persistent small pleural effusion, but improving bibasilar atelectasis and resolution of previously reported vascular congestion.
Persistent small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-2-8**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.

The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PRE-BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal septal as well as the mid to distal anteroseptal walls.
The right ventricle displays focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.5 cm2).

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild tricuspid valve septal leaflrt prolapse is present resulting in mild, posteriorly directed tricuspid regurgitation.
The coronary sinus ostium appears dilated but injection of agitated saline in the left upper exrtremity intravenous line does not appear to enter the right atrium through the coronary sinus.

Electronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2189-2-5**] 17:05     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service with recent non st elevation myocardial infarction in setting of a lower GI bleed for consideration of surgical revasularization and mitral valve surgery.
He was seen by the GI service and colonoscopy was performed on [**2-4**] which was notable for a fungating, ulcerated non-bleeding 3cm mass of malignant appearance in the proximal rectum.
Small non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were also noted.
Given that this rectal mass was likely carcinoma, he was seen by Colorectal surgery.
Infectious disease and podiatry services were also consulted regarding his left lateral malleolar ulceration with history of MRSA.
Foot films were obtained which revealed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
The patient developed bradycardia post-operatively while receiving amiodarone and became dependent on temporary pacer.
Recommendations included to discontinue amiodarone and start dofetilide with the goal of keeping the patient in sinus rhythm, as he is not a suitable candidate for anti-coagulation given his rectal mass and risk of bleeding.
He continued to progress and tolerated dofetilide with no further bradycardia.
He went back into atrial fibrillation on [**2-10**] and EP continued to follow no further adjustment in medications.
Podiatry also debrided his left foot ulcer on [**2-10**] and to continue with wet to dry dressing changes.
He was ready for discharge to rehab on post operative day six with follow up for rectal mass [**3-26**] with GI service.
Beta blocker Beta blocker was not started during admission due to bradycardia when in normal sinus rhythm, please continue hold, will be reevaluated in outpatient follow up or call with questions 6[**Telephone/Fax (1) 67538**] 11.
Outpatient Lab Work please check weekly potassium, magnesium, creatinine Potassium level should be greater than 4 and magnesium greater 2 due to dofetilide - please check friday   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 17921**] Center - [**Location (un) 5450**], NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease s/p Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Atrial Fibrillation s/p MAZE procedure Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Rectal Mass, likely carcinoma Non healing Left Foot Ulcer Hemorrhoids Hypertension Diabetes Mellitus with Neuropathy and Retinopathy Chronic anemia Basal cell cancer status post removal status post Tonsillectomy status post 5th toe transmetatarsal amputation Nephrolithiasis MRSA Osteomylitis   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: 1)  Monitor wounds for signs of infection.
These include redness, drainage or increased pain.
In the event that you have drainage from your sternal wound, please contact the [**Name2 (NI) 5059**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
