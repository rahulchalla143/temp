Report date [**2141-1-18**] DIAGNOSIS: I.  Stomach, gastric donut (A): Gastric segment with oxyntic type mucosa, within normal limits.
Esophagus, "donut" (B): Segment of squamous epithelium-lined esophagus, within normal limits.
Gastric fundus, resection (C-D): Gastric segment with oxyntic type mucosa, within normal limits.

B.  Thirty-one regional lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/31--ypN0).
C.  Submucosal fibrosis and mucosal ulceration consistent with the patient's history of neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
D.  No precursor dysplasia or intestinal metaplasia identified.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2141-1-13**], the patient had a minimally invasive esophagectomy.
NEURO/PAIN: The patient's pain was initially well-controlled with an epidural.
On POD#1 and POD#2, the patient had episodes of confusion and agitation, necessitating soft restraints in the ICU; his mental status improved considerably after discontinuation of all narcotics, and he remained generally well-oriented (with only occasional periods of mild disorientation at night) through to his day of discharge.
On POD#2, during an episode of agitation, an ABG showed respiratory alkalosis and mild hypoxia; a CT then was negative for PE.
He subsequently improved from this episode, both in terms of his mental status and respiratory status.
During an episode of agitation on POD#2, he did remove his NGT, and this was replaced without incident.
HEME: The patient's hematocrit was monitored daily, and he required no transfusions.
ID: The patient did have a temperature of 101.2 on POD#2, but this resolved and he required no antibiotics.
He had no further fevers and his white blood count remained normal.
On CXR the day of discharge he did have a patchy right-sided opacity.
However he remained asymptomatic, afebrile with no productive cough.
ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was monitored and he had no significant endocrine issues.
O2  Sig: One (1)   once a day: 1-2L continuous oxygen, pulse oxygen for portability diagnosis: s/p esophagectomy.
