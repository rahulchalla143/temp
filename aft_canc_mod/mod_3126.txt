He has also had growing anxiety and repetitive questioning.
U/A was borderline positive and per old records altered mental status is his classic presentation for UTI, but he has never been confused to the point of being non-verbal as he currently is.

Serum tox was negative, U/A borderline positive and cardiac enzymes were positive.
His EKG had some mild STD in lateral leads and cardiology was consulted and did not feel that this was acute.
C4/C5 Spinal Cord Injury (17 y/a)due to MVA - can move arms slightly cannot move legs 2.
Seizure Disorder ('[**62**]-'[**63**]) 4.
HEENT: R eye prothesis, No conjunctival pallor.
No JVD visible CV: RRR, II/VI systolic murmur but distant heart sounds LUNGS: CTAB, good BS BL, No W/R/R ABD: NABS.
Suprapubic catheter in place, with no surrounding erythema.
SKIN: Erythema on face w/ some scaling.
Several flesh colored papules on face noted.
R eye false.
bilateral UE and LE clonus x many beats.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No structural valvular disease.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Mild diffuse sulcal effacement could be a normal finding, however, clinical correlation is recommended.
Unchanged high-density secretions within the frontal and maxillary sinuses, which may be due to fungal disease.
Small area of possible inflammation in the lower abdomen, which may represent the sequela of recent diverticulitis, but is somewhat non-specific.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Chronic hydroureteronephrosis.
Multifocal pneumonia or less likely aspiration.
Extensive inflammatory sinus disease, involving bilateral maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses.
Fluid within bilateral mastoid air cells.
[**2169-3-15**] EEG This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no ictal or interictal epileptiform activity.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Time Taken Not Noted     Log-In Date/Time: [**2169-3-12**] 5:59 pm       URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2169-3-13**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2169-3-13**]):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN       AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION  Brief Hospital Course: 39 yo M w/ PMH of Sz, MDS, recurrent UTI, p/w AMS, thrombocytopenia and borderline positive U/A.
He had an IR guided LP which was c/w traumatic tap, cultures have remained negative HSV PCR is pending.
He was seen by neurology and given empiric lorazepam for partial complex seizures witnessed by the neurology team in the ICU.
Urine and serum tox were negative, CT head and MRI head showed sinus disease but no other focal abnormality.
Meropenem and Flagyl were stopped after seven days as he had clinically improved, and the inflammation seen on CT abd/pelvis was non-specific and thought unlikely to be contributing.
A repeat urine culture was sent with no further growth.
Thrombocytopenia: Initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concern for TTP, but no schistocytes, Hct at baseline, no e/o hemolysis.
U/A not very impressive but given confusion, low grade temps was treated.
Previous Serratia sp resistant to tetracyclines/bactrim and E.coli ESBL, both sensitive to imipenem.
Repeat urine culture showed enteroccus sensitive to meopenem.
Would be consistent with MDS and multilineage failure.
Hct dropped from 30 to 20 after admission, no bowel movements, no e/o bleeding on CT abd/pelvis, no e/o hemolysis.
Likely 30 was spurious as recent baseline had been around 25 and likely MDS progressing along w/ acute infection, but unknown why Hct dropped acutely as was not volume resucitated.
noticed air leak at bottom.
Advised RT to evaluate for new mask.
Given witnessed seizures in the ICU he was switched to keppra.
EEG showed no signs of seizure activity but this was done after he had been loaded with anti-epileptics.
Unknown etiology given no Hx of DM and not taking insulin or hypoglycemics.
Doubt liver failure given normal INR and bili.
No evidence of insulinoma on abdominal CT.  #Elevated Cardiac enzymes: EKG showed ?
Considered possibility of bradycardia contributing to chronically "foggy" mental status as reported by family, but patient without significant change in mental status when HR in 60s-70s.
EKG shows sinus bradycardia.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) mg Injection Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for seizure activity.
