History of Present Illness: 58M, Polish speaking, s/p RUL lobectomy [**11-6**] for Stage III NSCLC, discharged home on [**11-17**] (4d prior to this presentation) on 2L home O2, returns to ED c/o 2 days of productive cough and fevers as high as 102.
CXR showed a right-sided infiltrate.
Pt received RMLobectomy for RML collapse.
On arrival to the ICU, he denies any pain or discomfort, but does note subjective dyspnea.
Past Medical History: PMH: CAD, MI, HTN, HLD, COPD (FEV1 69% [**2171**]), CVA, Stage III NSCLC s/p neoadjuvant chemoradiation  PSH: hip repair, elbow fracture repair, [**2172-11-6**]:Right thoracotomy, Right upper lobectomy, Buttressing of bronchial closure with intercostal muscle flap.
No etoh, no drugs.
No family history of cancers  Physical Exam: PE on discharge:  Vitals: 99.3, 85, 110/60 18 95% RA GEN: A+O x3, NAD Cardiac: RRR, normal S1/S2, no MRG Resp: CTA bilat with mild RLL crackles and some expiratory weezing.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2172-11-26**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
There has been worsening of the area of consolidation with air-fluid levels within the right upper lobe.
This is consistent with suspected empyema following right upper lobe resection.
Status post chest tube removal with increased fluid accumulation in the right anterior and superior pleural spaces in the post-surgical cavity.
Persistent right middle lobe collapse with obliteration of the right middle lobe bronchus.
Evaluation for torsion is limited but the configuration of the collapsed right middle lobe appears similar to the prior examination where there was not evidence for torsion.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema, stable.
Left lung clear CXR [**11-23**]: Unchanged appearance of the mild right apical hydropneumothorax CXR [**11-24**]: Moderate volume right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
New opacification in the right mid lung could be atelectasis, pneumonia, or hemorrhage.
Small left pleural effusion and moderate left basal atelectasis are more pronounced.
Unchanged right pneumothorax since removal of basilar chest tube.
No evidence of tension.
Slight worsening of left basilar atelectasis and small effusion.
There is progressive decrease in the pleural air collection in the upper zone.
On the lateral view, there is an air-fluid level anteriorly at the mid-to-lower zone, consistent with small loculated hydropneumothorax.
There were no complications during the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedures well overall.
On [**11-6**] he underwent a successful RU lobectomy via thoracotomy for for Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.
Non-con chest CT was suspicious for empyema.
He became hypotensive while on propofol, initially responded to fluid bolus but did require phenylephrine.
An a-line was attempted without success.
He had stridors initially that resolved with albuterol but +crackles and a CXR consistent with fluid overload- IVF were then stopped.
His respiratory status improved but still c/o significant pain with respiration and movement.
One chest tube was removed and cxr showed no pneumothorax.
On POD 3 sputum cultures were growing out e.coli and the Tobramycin was dc'd after discussion w/ ID given improvement on CXR and no pseudomonas in cultures.
Chest tube #3 was pulled on this day and cxr showed no pneumothorax.
Repeat CXR shows no acute changes and it was likely a mucous plug.
On POD 7, his final chest tube was removed and cxr showed no pneumothorax.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Morphine IV/PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
Occasional episodes of tachycardia were well treated with lopressor.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge on POD#9, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
He continued to have decreased saturation while ambulating and was thus sent home on the same oxygen therapy that he came in with.
