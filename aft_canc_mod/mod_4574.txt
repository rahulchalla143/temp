Patient underwent L TKA in [**Month (only) **], then has slow onset of lower back pain on discharge to rehab.
He had no focal weakness/numbness or pasathesias, and was able to participate in rehab activities.
At home his back pain became progressively worse over the next 5 days, to the point where he became non-ambulatory.
Again, he endorses no focal weakness/numbness/parasthesia, and denies bowel or bladder incontinence.
He said that the pain was so severe that he could not walk.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-6**] for pain control.
There he received a lumbar spine MRI (details below) that showed likely osteomyelitis of L1 with compression fracture, and liekly disckisits of adjacent disks.
Based on this finding, patient was transferred tot he [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
He endoreses [**1-22**] lowerback pain centered over his spine, non radiating.

Compression fracture at L1 vertebral body, associated with retropulsion resulting in moderate anterior thecal sac effacement and moderate canal stenosis at this level.
Increased intervertebral disc signal changes at T12-L1 and L1-L2 levels.
Focal area of T2 and FLAIR high signal on the left at T12 vertebral body concerning for a matastasic lesion.
CT: L/T Spine IMPRESSION: There is compression deformity of L1 with lucency within the vertebral body.
Dilatation of the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries.
Right upper lobe lung mass with enhancing components and small central cavitation with associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy concerning for neoplastic process.
Stable T12 and L1 with enhancing epidural soft tissue component at L1, concerning for metastatic process.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**6-19**] MRI: Head IMPRESSION: No enhancing brain lesions are seen to indicate metastatic disease.
No acute infarcts.
7-mm focus of enhancement in the anterior portion of the odontoid process could be due to bony metastatic lesion given the patient's history of other areas of bony metastasis.
No evidence of impending fracture seen or epidural mass identified.
Mild narrowing of the spinal canal is noted on sagittal post-gadolinium images at C3 and C4 level.
The fractured L1 vertebral body demonstrates slightly increased loss of height and slightly increased retropulsion.
The appearance remains suggestive of a pathologic fracture.
Slight interval enlargement of the T12 lytic lesion, likely a metastasis.
3.2 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is again noted.
[**7-14**]: L-Spine AP/Lateral: IMPRESSION: There is no change in hardware position or alignment compared to the intraoperative images from [**7-7**].
Pathology: L1 Vertebral Body Biopsy: Vertebral body, L1, biopsy: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, consistent with pulmonary origin, see note.
Bone, L1 vertebra, vertebrectomy (B-F): Metastatic poorly-differentiated carcinoma.
These findings are consistent with metastatic poorly-differentiated carcinoma of lung origin.
The patient's history of a lung mass is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with h/o DM2, recent L TKA, p/w severe back pain, now found to have L1 compression fracture and found to have metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
Patient had palliative vertebrectomy.
L1 Compression Fracture/Vertebrectomy: His outside MRI sugggestive of osteo and fracture of L1, with diskitis of T12-L1, L1-L2.
Also high grade stenosis of L4-L5.
CT/MRI were performed at [**Hospital1 18**] that were suspicious for lytic lesions of the spine and a lung lesion rather than the initial suspicion of infection.
A pelvis and torso CT showed a R lung mass concerning for a primary malignancy.
His antibiotics were discontinued, and his lower back pain was controlled with morphine.
28 staples were removed from his thoracotomy incision on [**2149-7-17**].
# Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: Due to CT findings of right lung mass, the patient underwent a CT guided biopsy of his spine, which revealed metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
Prior to his surgery he was determined not to be a chemotherapy candidate due to poor functional status (he could only lay flat in bed).
They do not wish to have artifical nutrition supplied to their father.
# Pain Management: Mr. [**Known lastname 87644**] was managed on MS Contin 15 mg q8 hours for pain post-op.
It is key to control pain so that mobilization is not limited by pain.
He was found to have a UTI and C. Diff, both of which are being treated.
The delirium waxes and wanes, and when he is delirious, he is very easily re-oriented.
# Nutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname 87644**] had poor PO intake throughout hospitalization.
# Urinary Tract Infection: The pt was found to have GNR on UCx during hospitalization.
Speciation showed pseudomonas aeruginosa intermediate for Cipro.
# C. diff: The patient was found to be positive for C. diff toward the end of admission.
He was started on PO Metronidazole for total 14 day course, last dose 9/12 (or 7 days post-completion of antibiotics for Pseudomonal PNA).
He did not have diarrhea at time of discharge.
# Hypercalcemia: He initially had a mildly elevated Calcium during his hospitalization, and he received fluids.
The elevated calcium may be secondary to his lung mass.
His lisinopril was held as his blood pressure was low and he had one episode of orthostatic hypotension.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for sob/wheezing.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] at [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - L1 pathological fracture - Stage IV poorly differentiated NSCLC lung (RUL) - C. difficile colitis - Delirium - Pseudomomal urinary tract infection  Secondary: - Hypertension - Diabetes mellitus - Gout - Asthma - COPD - GERD - L TKR   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 87644**],  You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for an L1 compression fracture and osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone.
However, new imagining suggested that your lower back pain was due to a compression fracture at L1.
There was no evidence of infected bone.
However, there were small lesions in other bones that were concerning for a malignancy.
You had a CT scan of the torso and pelvis which revealed a mass in the right lung.
We did a biopsy showing that you have cancer in your lung that spread to your back.
You had a surgery called a vertebrectomy to relieve the pain in your back.
