The patient notes that she has had heavier menses with increasing pelvic pressure and cramping.
She denies any abnormal intermenstrual bleeding.
Ultrasound showed an enlarged fibroid uterus, which measured 21.8 x 9.5 x 13.9 cm in size.
Patient's procedure was complicated by large intraop bleeding for which she received massive transfusion.
Her bleeding had stopped prior to closure.
Past Medical History: Uterine Fibroids s/p Multiple myomectomy in past s/p C section H/o Ovarian Torsion H/o breast reduction chronic HA  Social History: Living with husband and 2-1/2 daughter, [**Name (NI) 21310**].
Family History: Negative for breast and ovarian cancer, positive for lung cancer in her father.
CXR ([**2102-10-5**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process CXR ([**2102-10-6**]): bibasilar atelectasis CTA ([**2102-10-7**]): No evidence of pulmonary embolism .
Tissue Pathology ([**2102-10-5**]) of uterine fibroid: Pending  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 31 yo F w/ a h/o significant uterine fibroids, presented for elective multiple myomectomy for extensive fibroid removal on [**10-5**], complicated by large intra-operative blood loss requiring massive transfusion protocol.
# Blood loss: Patient underwent elective myomectomy for extensive fibroids, complicated by 3.5L estimated blood loss intraoperatively.
Patient was noted to have SBP drop to the 60s for 15 minutes, MAP in the 40s, and tachycardia in the 150 range.
Given her massive transfusion requiring, patient was at risk for ARDS, acidosis, and hypocalcemia thus patient admitted to the ICU.
Patient was monitored for signs of rebleeding, with serial hematocrits and coags.
Pt was on Dilaudid for pain control.
# Respiratory: Due to risk of ARDS from massive transfusion requirement, patient was continued on ventilatory support following surgery with propofol titrated for sedation.
Initial CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Post extubation patient had several episodes of desaturation with activity.
Given the patient also had sinus tachycardia, we obtained a CTA chest to rule out pulmonary embolism and this study showed no evidence of PE.
Fever thought likely secondary to inflammatory response following myomectomy.
# Enlarged pulm artery on imaging: diff incl high output heart due to chronic incr demand from multiple fibroids, a heart defect such as ASD, essential pulm HTN.
# Post op care: Patient was on Protonix, dc'd it on the day of transfer.
Pt was on Dilaudid PCA pump for pain, subsequently switched to IV Dilaudid PRN and Percocet (which pt states worked well for her before).
Patient discharged with motrin and percocet as needed for pain as well .
