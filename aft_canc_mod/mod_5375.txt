RADIOLOGY  MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-8-5**] 5:13 PM  MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man with fall subdural bleed REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Looking to r/o posterior stroke with MRA/MRI brain.
Also would like MRI brain w/ gadolinium r/o brain mets, hx of jaw ca recurrence.
MRI AND MRA BRAIN  INDICATION: 67-year-old man with fall and subdural hematoma.
Rule out posterior stroke with MRI/MRA of the brain, rule out brain metastasis with history of jaw carcinoma recurrence.
No diffusion DWI or GRE sequences were performed.
BRAIN MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] CONTRAST: Right subdural hematoma has not appreciably changed in size since the previous examination.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood products are not definitely appreciated on this study due to limited examination.
There is an area of enhancement involving cortex and subcortical white matter of the right inferior temporal lobe, corresponding to an area of contusion on the previous examination.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
BRAIN MRA: As on the previous study, there is absent flow in most of the internal carotid artery, with a short segment flow in the supraclinoid left internal carotid artery.
There is collateral or retrograde filling from the segment through the anterior and posterior communicating arteries.
Absent flow in the major part of the left internal carotid artery, with collateral or retrograde flow to a short supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery.
Area of enhancement in the right anterior temporal lobe, corresponding to an area of contusion seen on previous examination with surrounding edema.
This finding may reflect a post-traumatic etiology; however, underlying enhancing brain lesion cannot be entirely excluded.
Short-term two-week followup is recommended to document resolution of this finding.
Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage not evaluated on this study, as gradient echo imaging was not performed.
Within these limitations, there are new bibasilar effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases.
There has been improvement in the multifocal ill-defined consolidation in both lungs.
There is no significant intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are small filling defects in the branches of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery as well as branches of the bilateral lower lobe pulmonary arteries suggestive of subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
CT ABDOMEN POST-ADMINISTRATION OF [**Month/Day/Year **] CONTRAST:  There is free fluid present in the upper abdomen, particularly around the liver and spleen.
There is minimal thickening of the left adrenal gland.
There is a filling defect in the right femoral vein likely a DVT.
There is a left- sided inguinal hernia containing loops of bowel within it.
There is a urinary catheter seen in the bladder with air likely representing recent bladder instrumentation  MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are multiple left-sided rib fractures.
Fractures are also present involving the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], the left superior pubic ramus and the left inferior pubic ramus.
There may also be a fracture through the right iliac bone.
Interval development of bibasilar effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases.
There are small filling defects in the branches of the right upper lobe and right and left lower lobe branches of the pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary emboli.
There has been interval improvement with significant resolution of the consolidative opacities in both lungs seen on the prior study.
Abdominal pelvic ascites is present.
Left inguinal hernia containing loops of bowel within it.
Fractures involving the left ribs, left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], left superior pubic ramus, the left inferior pubic ramus and a probable fracture through the right iliac bone.
A filling defect in the right femoral vein is consistent with a thrombus and may be further assessed with a Doppler ultrasound.

FINDINGS: There is a right subdural hygroma, measuring approximately 6 mm in maximal thickness, with small amount of subacute subdural hematoma layering posteriorly in its dependent portion (best seen on FLAIR images).
Subarachnoid blood is present in multiple sulci of the right cerebral hemisphere, and in a few sulci of the left cerebral hemisphere.
There are multiple small cortical foci of high signal on FLAIR and diffusion-weighted images in the superior medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes, most consistent with hemorrhagic contusions.
There is an area of high T2 signal involving the cortex and subcortical white matter of the right inferior temporal lobe.
There is a small linear focus of high T2 signal in the subcortical white matter of the posterior left frontal lobe, without any associated signal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted or gradient echo images, which appears non-specific, and may or may not be related to the patient's trauma.
The major vascular flow voids appear unremarkable.
The left frontal sinus, bilateral ethmoid air cells, and the nasal cavity have fluid signal.
There is moderate circumferential mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses, and mild circumferential mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
Multiple foci of soft tissue swelling are noted in the posterior scalp.
Small right subdural hygroma, which contains a small amount of posteriorly layering subacute blood products.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the hemispheric sulci, right greater than left.
Multiple small hemorrhagic contusions in the superior medial aspects of bilateral frontal and parietal lobes.
Larger right inferior temporal contusion, which may or may not be hemorrhagic.
Intraventricular blood as before.
Images were reconstructed utilizing bone and soft tissue window algorithms.
FINDINGS: There is a large subgaleal hematoma extending over the left frontal convexity with a large laceration extending to the skull surface.
Soft tissue swelling extends over the lateral aspect of the included left face superficial to the left zygoma and in the preseptal soft tissues.
There is a linear lucency extending over the left orbital roof which may represent a nondisplaced fracture.
Subcutaneous air in an extraconal distribution is identified, particularly medially.
There is possibly an inferior orbital wall fracture.
There is extensive opacification of the ethmoid air cells and near-complete opacification with a small amount of layering high-attenuation fluid around more chronic appearing mucosal thickening in the left maxillary antrum.
The right maxillary antrum demonstrates similar but less severe thick mucosa likely due to chronic sinusitis.
Intracranially, the ventricles are midline with no intraventricular hemorrhage identified.
There is layering subarachnoid hemorrhage over the right frontal convexity.
Two small punctate rounded hyperattenuated foci are noted in the right posterior temporal lobe likely due to contusions.
A small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage is also noted in the perimesencephalic cisterns posterior to the right colliculi.
No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke is noted.
IMPRESSION:  Small hemorrhagic contusions in the posterior right temporal lobe and subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the posterior right frontal lobe and perimesencephalic cistern.
No significant mass effect or intraventricular extension noted.
No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke.
Question of possible nondisplaced fracture over the left orbital roof.
Likewise, the left inferior orbital wall or medial wall of the left maxillary sinus cannot be cleared of fracture definitively.
Consider detailed maxillofacial CT scan for further evaluation.
