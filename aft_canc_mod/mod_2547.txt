History of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma removed in [**2118-12-13**] with positive margins and skeletal muscle invasion and total laryngectomy and neck dissection for local control of disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old male who was known to have thyroid cancer which was poorly differentiated follicular carcinoma with lymph and vascular invasion.
On that excision there were positive margins for tumor and skeletal muscle invasion and the patient had a tracheostomy placed on [**8-23**] of this year for stridor and local invasion of cancer into his airway.
He had presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a total laryngectomy and neck dissection and afterwards is planning to receive XRT to his neck for potential hopeful control of his thyroid follicular carcinoma.
