[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 2.9 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: *2.8 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.5 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 2.1 cm Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *2.2 cm2 (nl >= 3.0 cm2) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.8 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.14 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 296 msec  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderate global LV hypokinesis.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
Severely depressed LVEF.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Suboptimal image quality.
Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/ akinesis of the apex with severe hypokinesis of the of all distal LV segments.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is mild TR.
There is severe athersclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta including a large mobile plaque in the distal aortic arch.
After completion of coronary grafting, and with epinephrine infusion, the LV displayed worse global and segmental function with extension of the severe hypokinesis towards the mid LV segments.
No other changes.
