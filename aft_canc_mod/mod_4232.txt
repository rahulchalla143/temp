Around 4-5 weeks ago, she was in her normal state of good health when she developed shortness of breath asssociated with back pain.
She treated the back pain with flexerol, it resolved, but the shortness of breath remained.
Two weeks ago, she developed acutely worsening SOB over a 24hr period, and presented to her [**Known lastname 3390**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**] directed her to the ER given concern for PE; CTA-chest per report showing no embolus but liver nodules concerning for malignancy.
Subsequent biopsy showed adenocarcinoma of unknown origin.
No lung lesions identfied on multiple imaging.
No chest pain.
Recent weight gain from baseline 175 to 197 lbs.
While receiving chemo, she had chills, nausea and several episodes of emesis.
No chest pain, no itch.
She developed worsening weakness, and she was intubated as it appeared she was tiring out, in anticipation of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICU care.

question of opacity at right heart/diaphragmatic border .
EKG: tachycardic, sinus, slight rightward axis, poor R wave progression, incomplete rbbb, t wave inversions in v1-v3 .
Abd/pelvis CT: 1.
Moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
No bowel dilatation or bowel wall thickening to suggest bowel ischemia.
Small bilateral peripheral nodular opacities at the lung bases suggest an infectious etiology.
Alternatively, this could represent metastatic disease.
Head CT: There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the right parietal lesion and a smaller one on the right frontal region.
There is dissection into the right lateral ventricular system.
There is substantial displacement of the atrium of the right lateral ventricle and substantial right to left subfalcine herniation.
There is effacement of sulci and decreased density of the white matter diffusely consistent with diffuse cerebral edema.
The region of the foramen magnum is not well assessed due to motion artifact but some transforaminal herniation is suspected.
There is a small amount of blood in the posterior aspect of the left lateral ventricle.
There is mild ventricular dilatation with slight prominence of the temporal horns.
IMPRESSION: Extensive right-sided parenchymal hemorrhage with diffuse cerebral edema, a subfalcine herniation and probable transforaminal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was severely ill on admission to the ICU with a lactic acidosis, respiratory failure, and hepatic failure.
She was minimally sedated on propofol gtt but still was not responsive to painful stimuli.
Because of her lactic acidosis, she had an abdominal CT to eval for bowel ischemia which was negative.
She also had a head CT given her unresponsiveness, which demonstrated a large intracerebral hemorrhage with uncal herniation.
At this point, a discussion was had with her HCP who stated that pt would not have wanted further invasive measures, such as neurosurgical intervention, and would rather be made comfortable.
