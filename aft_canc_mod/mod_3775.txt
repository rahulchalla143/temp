Admission Date:  [**2155-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-4-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-7-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PCI w/thrombectomy and BMS placement in RCA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70 yo woman with h/o metastatic pancreatic cancer s/p chemotherapy (cycle 13 of gemcitabine) yesterday who presented to the ED with chest pain.
She took Maalox without improvement.
She had associated SOB and diaphoresis, but no nausea or abdominal pain.
Her EKG showed STE in II, III, and avF, with deep depressions in I and aVL and v2, so she was started on Plavix and a heparin gtt and was sent to the cardiac cath lab.
In the cath lab, patient was found to have a proximally occluded RCA and underwent thrombectomy and BMS placement.
She was noted to have a fair sized hematoma around her sheath.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for some DOE, which she attributes to chemotherapy, and the absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -  Locally advanced pancreatic cancer with radiologic evidence of metastases to lungs, on gemcitabine chemotherapy GERD s/p appendectomy s/p hysterectomy .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Dry mucus membranes.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Active BS EXTREMITIES: Bleeding around R femoral cath site; non tender; No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
STE in II, III, avF with depressions in I, aVL and V2.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old woman with h/o metatstatic pancreatic cancer who presented from home with chest pain consistent with inferior STEMI, now status post thrombectomy and BMS to proximal RCA.
# STEMI: Pt now s/p inferior/RV STEMI with some hemodynamic instability in cath lab, s/p thrombectomy and BMS to RCA.
She had some hemodynamic instability in the cath lab requiring dopamine and atropine, these were attributed to a vagal reperfusion response in the setting of stenting her RCA occlusion.
She remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
Patient had a post-MI echocardiogram which showed an EF of 40-45% and regional biventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w inferior and RV myocardial infarction.
# PUMP: S/P inferior/RV STEMI with hemodynamic instability in cath lab requiring atropine and dopamine.
# RHYTHM: Was monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm.
# HTN - Remained normotensive after her RV MI without any periods of hypotension.
# HLD - Lipid panel showed HDL of 19 and LDL of 85.
# Pancreatic cancer- Metastatic with presumed involvement of lungs on CT chest.
She did not become neutropenic during this admission.
Likely secondary to pre-renal etiology in setting recent MI as it improved to baseline with fluid rehydration.
# Anemia: Patient presented with chronic anemia at baseline around 31, likely secondary to cancer and chemotherapy.
There no significant groin hematoma.
