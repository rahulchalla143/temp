During this hospitalization the patient was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and dyspnea in setting of Influenza and possible CAP for which he was treated with Tamiflu as well as CTX/Azithro.
The patient was treated with Solumedrol and required intubation with need for repeat intubation given recrudescence of symptoms post-extubation thought to be secondary to volume overload from hypertension and volume.
It was also thought the patient had a significant component of anxiety contributing to his extubation failure for which his anti-anxiety regimen was increased with impression that hyperventilation was contributing to auto-PEEP and worsening obstruction.
The patient's course was additionally complicated by reported STEMI on admission with 1mm ST elevations in V1-V3 and elevated Troponins, CKs flat.
The patient was again admitted recently on [**2179-2-24**] for symptoms of low grade fever and productive cough for which he was again treated for COPD exacerbation with Levofloxacin and ongoing PO Prednisone.
Ux on admission now reveals growing Pseudomonas resistant to quinolones.
The patient now presents with recurrent shortness of breath since this morning.
He reports that minimal activity resulted in severe dyspnea and prolonged recovery.
No fevers, chills.
The patient has noted some LE edema over the last couple of weeks.
He has been unable to lie flat for years, no PND.

No obvious ST or TW changes .
Given the presence of severe emphysema, pulmonary edema cannot be entirely excluded, multifocal pneumonia remains a diagnostic consideration as well.
Echocardiogram [**2179-3-2**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild diastolic dysfunction with elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 70 yo M with known severe COPD who presented with recurrent symptoms of dyspnea admitted with pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, found to have mild acute on chronic diastolic CHF and also with pseudomonal UTI.
Required intubation for respiratory distress.
Completed treatments for pneumonia as well as UTI.
# COPD exacerbation: ABG revealed hypercarbia most likely secondary to his COPD exacerbation.
He was also thought to be slightly volume overloaded, secondary to known diastolic CHF.
He was intubated on [**3-1**] for increased work of breathing.
He was treated with IV steroids, inhalers and antibiotics for a COPD flare.
# Anxiety: Pt with significant anxiety r/t breathing, being alone contributing to symptoms of shortness of breath.
We maintained pt on lorazepam 1mg po q4h PRN anxiety and shortness of breath.
# Parosxymal atrial fib with RVR: He was in sinus throughout the majority of his admission; however, on two occasions while in the MICU and intubated he developed Afib with RVR; slight hypotension during second episode.
This resulted in gross hematuria (likely due to known bladder tumor) with supratherapeutic PTT.
# UTI: He was also noted to have a pseudomonal UTI which he was treated with a ten day course of cefipime.
The patient had a recent nephrostomy tube placed for obstructive calculi in the left kidney.
# Hematuria: as above notes for Afib.
Urology was consulted given his history of bladder tumor and felt no intervention would be advised at the current time.
Bladder irrigation started & hematuria resolved with d/c heparin drip.
# Bladder tumor: Pt has a superficial tumor obstructing L ureteral orifice, by CT did not appear to be outside the bladder.
# Nephrolithiasis: 1cm stone & 5mm stones x 2 noted to L kidney.
Had superficial tumor obstructing L ureteral orifice, hence percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Echo this admission revealing EF >55%, mild diastolic dysfunction as well as moderate pulmonary HTN.
Pt appeared to be minimally volume overloaded, however difficult exam given severe pulmonary disease.
# CAD: s/p STEMI [**12/2178**] however did not undergo any cardiac intervetnion.
Pt withoug any active cardiac events this admission.
# Ulcerative Colitis: Did not have any acute issues.
