Admission Date:  [**2136-6-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-6-13**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Codeine / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Hyperkalemia, cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 79 yo female with hx of multiple myeloma and CRI was found to have potassium level of 9 at the rehab center and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Patient was walking, talking, and waiting at the waiting room, she suddenly became unresponsive, diaphoretic, hypotensive, and bradycardic and found to be in v-fib/v-tach.
Stress dose of steroid, and levo/flagyl were given as well.
During admission, patient was noted to have acute renal failure on top of CRI secondary to multiple myeloma.
Rapid atrial fibrillation - medically managed, on coumadin.
Transient ischemic attack 14 years ago associated with transient speech loss.
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2133**] - on thalidomide and decadron 4.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.4 with an unclear etiology.
Zoster with chronic pain in her left arm 9.
Left arm weakness of unclear etiology  Social History: The patient is a retired physcial therapist.
HEENT: Pupils 7 mm and minimall reactive, no Doll's eyes Lungs: bilateral crackles, coarse breath sound CV: Regular, tachy, no murmurs Abd: Distended, tympanic, +BS at LLQ, no fluid wave Ext: 2+ LE edema, 1+ DP bilaterally Skin: multiple patches of ecchymosis at LLE.
Neuro: Unresponsive to painful stimuli, GCS 3, fixed dilated pupils, absent corneal reflex, no Doll's eyes.
V-tach/V-fib was secondary to hyperkalemia although her digoxin level was elevated.
Hyperkalemia most likely due to acute renal failure from worsening myeloma nephropathy and prerenal cause since pt was reported to be taking decreased PO.
After CaCl, insulin/D50, Kayexelate, bicarb, and emergent hemodialysis, her potassium level was lowered to 4.7  Cardiac enzymes were positive, most likely patient had cardiac infarct during the arrest.
Head CT done at ED was negative for bleed and herniation, but patient was unresponive initially and became only minimally responsive to painful stimuli the next day.
Patient most likely had watershed ischemia from the arrest.
Hypotension most likely from cardiogenic shock plus hypovolemia/bleed.
For that reason, patient received no transfuion.
