Admission Date:  [**2120-7-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-8-21**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted on [**7-22**] for resection of a left lower lobe adenocarcinoma.
She was transferred from the MICU service after a prolonged hospital course, notable for multiple PNA's and atrial fibrillation.
This patient was first seen by pulmonary in [**5-7**] when she began complaining of new onset shortness of breath plus notable for chronic cough.
She had some weight loss and decreased appetite.
There was a left lower lobe resection done with pathology that showed adenocarcinoma.
She was extubated after surgery and then on [**7-25**] she went into atrial fibrillation and her blood pressure dropped to the 90's and she had shortness of breath.
She again became short of breath on [**7-26**], diagnosed with left lower lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
She was intubated and had left lower lobe thick secretions and collapse was thought to be secondary to mucus plugging.
She was reintubated secondary to a decreased saturation and an increased CO2 and rebronch'd on [**7-29**] with thick secretions and a plug on [**7-29**].
She had a period of atrial fibrillation on [**8-7**] with rates in the 70's and a systolic blood pressure in the 70's.
The patient had complained of difficulty breathing, also had secretions and was unable to tolerate oral food.
The patient had moderate thick, yellow secretions.
She was bagged, tried to replace the trach mass but saturations continued from 88-90%.
She was brought back to the ICU and found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates via chest x-ray.
She was then bronch'd on [**8-15**] in the morning and found to have minimal secretions.
She was also hypotensive to pain medications.
She currently has some difficulty breathing on the ventilator, was otherwise comfortable and denies pain or any other complaints.
She had an AAA repair in [**2100**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**], notable for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, right hip replacement, 100 pack year history of smoking, seasonal allergies and emphysema by pathology.
ALLERGIES:  Possibly Ciprofloxacin causing confusion, dated [**11/2118**], otherwise no known drug allergies.
No family history.
In general, cachectic, elderly white female lying in bed, tracheostomy on ventilator, in no acute distress.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm with 3/6 systolic murmur left lower sternal border, stable with respirations and no S3 or S4.
Abdomen distended, PEG in place, positive bowel sounds, nontender and soft.
Dipstick urinalysis showed moderate blood, positive nitrites, 100 protein, glucose negative, ketones trace, bilirubin negative.
Chest x-ray from [**8-15**] showed some interval clearing of the left base with progressive infiltrate and left upper lobe and right upper lobe consistent with infection vs edema.
Hospital course was complicated by respiratory distress from mucus plugging, rapid atrial fibrillation and failure to wean.
The patient now has a tracheostomy and a PEG tube status post an episode of respiratory distress on the floor, likely secondary to decreased FIO2, rapid atrial fibrillation with elevated white blood cells and infiltrate on chest x-ray.
Pulmonary:  Pneumonia, given multiple infiltrates on the chest x-ray and elevated white blood cell count, treating aggressively for gram negative and will double cover with Levaquin and Ceftaz.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient likely has diastolic dysfunction when in rapid atrial fibrillation.
Cardiology:  Rhythm, atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone.
Hemodynamics:  The patient is slightly dry, most recent echocardiogram shows no systolic dysfunction though since then she has had a slow troponin leak likely from failure.
Infectious Disease:  Pneumonia as above.
Renal/ Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient's electrolytes need repletion, especially given her arrhythmia and to prevent muscle fatigue.
Anemia:  Patient's low blood hematocrit was improving until yesterday with a hematocrit of 32.
Neuro:  The patient has a history of delirium intermittent through ICU course.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since [**2120-8-15**] - the patient was found to have +4 gram positive rods on bronchial washings.
The patient had a CT of her chest which showed a left pleural effusion.
The patient reports no difficulty breathing and no difficulty being off the ventilator.
She had a brief episode of hypotension which responded to 250 cc of normal saline bolus.
The patient continues on the Amiodarone for history of atrial fibrillation.
The patient has a trach tube that will be vent assisted if needed at [**Hospital1 34648**].
