Moderate pericardial effusion increased since prior study.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

MODERATE GROWTH.
Fever/leukocytosis: Likely secondary to post-obstructive PNA.
Gram positive cocci on sputum cx from OSH.
Bronchoscopy noted purulent sputum in L lung which was suctioned.
Hemoptysis/respiratory failure: Bronchoscopy performed on [**9-22**] revealed a tortuous and macerated trachea with significant tumor infiltration along the length of trachea extending into the right and left mainstem bronchi.
Three stents were placed: 14x2 mm stent in R mainstem bronchus, 12x4 mm stent in L mainstem bronchus and 20x4mm tracheal stent.
The patient continued to have small amounts of blood in the ET tube.
The patient also remained somewhat drowsy after stoppage of sedation but has slowly grown more alert.
He required no transfusions.
He remained intermittently guaiac positive on exam and would likely benefit from outpatient colonoscopy in the future.
Given his fever spike, there was some concern for septic physiology and he was started on antibiotics as above.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Pt was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency by cosyntropin stimulation test.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63345**], oncologist, pt presented in [**1-13**] with weight loss, scapular pain.
His sliding scale was adjusted as needed for tight glucose control.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Near total obstruction of right bronchus secondary to non-small cell lung cancer stage 4.
Hemoptysis secondary to invasive lung cancer.
