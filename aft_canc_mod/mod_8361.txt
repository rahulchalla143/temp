Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T: 98.0 BP: 114/65 P: 88 R: 18 O2: 94% RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, left sided fullness felt in the supraclavicular fossa.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CN II-XII intact b/l.
Left upper lobe mass is suspicious for primary lung cancer.
Consolidation and ground-glass opacities around the lesion could be related to superimposed infection or post-obstructive pneumonitis.
Multiple necrotic lymph nodes in the mediastinum, bilateral hila and supraclavicular station are seen.
Multiple bilateral lung nodules are mostly bronchiolar consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process.
Pericardial effusion with slightly high density could be neoplastic, though this is uncertain.
A cardiac son[**Name (NI) **] is suggested to rule out tamponade.
11-mm hypodense liver lesion is too small to characterize but is suspicious for metastasis.
[**2112-9-20**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Moderate to large pericardial effusion with evidence of impaired ventricular filling, but no frank tamponade.
Pericardial fluid distribution is poorly suitable for needle pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoid approach.
Extensive regional LV wall motion abnormalities, consistent with prior anteroseptal myocardial.
Unchanged appearance of the left chest tube and left pectoral pacemaker.
On today's image, there could be a minimal left apical pneumothorax.
No evidence of tension.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with signs of minimal fluid overload.
No pleural effusions.
[**2112-9-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.

Transferred to ICU [**2112-9-18**] for hypoxia and dyspnea, likely due to flash pulmonary edema as she improved with furosemide.
Pericardial window placed via VATS [**2112-9-21**] for a pericardial effusion causing ventricular compromise, but no tamponade.
MICU Course 1: The patient was transferred in the AM of [**2112-9-18**] with hypoxia to 83% on non rebreather, acutely short of breath.
Her aspirin and Plavix were stopped due to concern for intracranial hemorrhage as well as preparing for EBUS-guided biopsy of her lung masses later int he week.
She did have a pericardial effusion without tamponade.
# Seizure: Due to new brain mets.
No recurrence.
Cannot have MRI due to pacemaker.
# Metastatic squamous cell lung CA, LLL, mediastinal and supraclavicular LNs, brain mets: Confirmed by EBUS/bronch cytology.
# Hypoxia: She had episode of acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia [**2112-9-18**], likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
Echo showed severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis of the antero-septum, anterior, distal LV, apical AND basal inferior segments.
# Pericardial effusion: Pericardial window placed via VATS [**2112-9-21**] for ventricular compromise, but no tamponade.
No need for repeat echo s/p pericardial window per Cardiology, unless she becomes symptomatic again.
No events on telemetry.
# Pneumonia: Given ceftriaxone and azithromycin at outside hospital.
# Dyspnea/hypoxia: Resolved.
# Leukocytosis: Likely reactive/pneumonia and steroids.
# CAD/CHF: Held aspirin and clopidogrel for small tumor-associated CNS hemorrhage and for procedures.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued ezetimibe and statin.
# Pain (none): Acetaminophen, hydromorphone PRN.
# Constipation: Added laxatives.
# DVT prophylaxis: Heparin SC.
# GI prophylaxis: PPI while on steroids and for GERD.
Increased bowel regimen for constipation.
# Precautions: None.
# CODE: FULL.
Metastatic lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma).
Pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart).
Pulmonary edema (fluid on the lungs).
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] hospital from an outside hospital for a seizure.
The seizure was due to brain metastases from a new lung cancer seen on CT scan.
CT scan showed a tumor in the left lung, chest lymph nodes, and the right and left brain.
You were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for low oxygen levels and shortness of breath.
This was likely due to pulmonary edema (fluid on the lungs), a result of congestive heart failure.
Echo of the heart showed fluid surrounding the heart.
This was drained by placement of a pericardial window by a surgical procedure called VATS.
The fluid around the heart most likely was caused by the cancer.
The cancer will be treated initially with whole brain radiation, which will start on Monday as an outpatient, and then followed by chemotherapy.
Dexamethasone (Decadron) 4x a day, to decrease the swelling around the brain masses.
Stop aspirin, stopped to prevent any more bleeding in the brain.
