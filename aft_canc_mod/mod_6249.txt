Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with h/o HTN and asthma who was admitted to the MICU for stridor due to a large mass compressing his airway which required a tracheal stent placement.
Repeat biopsies of mass were taken at that time and another flex bronch on [**6-25**] revealed no migration of his stent and no further intervention was performed.
Endoscopy with biopsy was performed on [**6-26**] and significant for non-obstructive mass visualized in middle third of esophagus.
He will likely get radiation to his mass as an outpatient, but there was no indication for emergent XRT as an inpatient per the rad/onc consult obtained.
An outpatient steroid taper with prednisolone prescribed for asthma was continued and completed on [**6-25**].
The final pathology of his tumor will be followed up at his outpatient oncology appointments.
Low-grade Fever: Continued to have low grade temperatures daily most likely due to underlying tumor.
CXR showed no evidence of infection.
He did have a leukocytosis but it improved without antibiotic treatment.

You then had two more similar procedures to look into your breathing tube to make sure the stent was in place and also to get biopsies of the mass that was found in your breathing tube.
You also had another procedure called an EGD which showed that the tumor was also present in your eating tube.
You will need radiation as an outpatient to help prevent the tumor from continuing to grow which would cause blockage of your breathing or eating tubes.
