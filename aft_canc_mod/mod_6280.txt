Admission Date:  [**2158-1-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-1-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-1-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2158-1-21**] - left-sided thoracentesis ([**2145**] mL drained)  History of Present Illness: 62yo male with history of refractory biphenotypic leukemia, disseminated fusarium [**Year (4 digits) 2**], who presents with shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].
The patient was recently admitted to BMT in [**12/2157**] for febrile neutropenia and hypoxia.
He had been doing well at home until yesterday when he developed shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] and [**Year (4 digits) **] after receiving PRBC and platelets (with 20mg PO lasix).
He was recently started on home oxygen at night but, given his shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**], he used it around the clock with mild relief of his dyspnea.
CXR revealed interstitial edema and left-sided pleural effusion.
He denies chest pain, abdominal pain, LE edema, rash but does report decreased urine output without dysuria.
He has no acute complaints and reports resolution of his [**First Name3 (LF) **].
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Biphenotypic Leukemia - Initially presented with "autoimmune pancytopenia" treated with steroids and IVIG.
Preliminary bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD.
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3.
Day 14 and two subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement with leukemia.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium [**Hospital1 2**] in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2157-7-27**] for neutropenic fever and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.
While hospitalized he was treated with a 10-day course of decitabine without complications.
[**10-19**] marrow with persistent blasts accoutning for 80% or marrow cellularity.
OTHER PMH: Disseminated Fusarium ([**5-15**]):treated with Ambisome and Voriconazole H/O Hepatitis B (on Lamivudine) S/P appendectomy S/P umbilical hernia repair Atrial fibrillation  Social History: Currently on disability.

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: [**2158-1-21**] [**Month/Day/Year **] culture (x 2) - pending [**2158-1-21**] MRSA screen - pending [**2158-1-21**] Urine culture - no growth [**2158-1-21**] Urine legionella antigen - pending [**2158-1-21**] Pleural fluid - 2 strains of VSE .
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with [**Month/Day/Year **], inflammation or other cellular elements.
Normal biventricular systolic function with septal shutter suggestive of constriction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Left pleural effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-12-22**], the patient is now in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
[**2158-1-21**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Decreased left lower lobe opacity is consistent with decreased atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged.
Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion is stable.
[**2158-1-22**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Stable bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with significantly increased left lobar collapse and increased surrounding ground-glass opacities representing microatelectasis versus superimposed infectious process.
Stable minimal non-pathologic mid thoracic vertebral compression fracture without associated retropulsion.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 62M with extensive medical history who presents with shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**].
# DYSPNEA - dyspnea is likely multifactorial.
The patient has known pleural effusions with recent [**Month/Day/Year **] transfusion.
In addition, in an immunocompromised patient presenting with fevers and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] acute infectious etiology must be high on the differential.
However CT Chest revealed more chronic inflammatory changes as opposed to active infectious changes.
It did show pleural effusions and patient had 2 L removed.
Pleural fluid + for VSE, which patient has had in the past.
Given patient's h/o of VRE bacteremia, immunosuppression and longstanding VSE in pl fluid, will treat with vancomycin x 6wks, the course given to patients for empyema/abscess.
Patient also presented with afib with RVR and HR was stabilized with home medications over the course of his stay.
WRT to patient's longstanding and frequent reaccumulation of pleural fluid, a discussion with the IP team led to conclusion that patient is not candidate for pleurex given neutropenia and frequent infections, including possible pna currently.
Also not candidate for pleuridesis given h/o constrictive pericarditis and thrombocytopenia.
Given that patient has had many of these in the past, these should be done judiciously as each successive [**Female First Name (un) 576**] may introduce new pathogens and possibly pna/infections.
# ANEMIA, DECREASED HEMATOCRIT - His cell counts have been decreased in the setting of his underlying malignancy, but following his thoracentesis there was a 6 point drop in his hematocrit without CT chest evidence of hemothorax.
Patient tolerated transfusions and was given lasix 20IV post to avoid positive fluid balance.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - Patient has a history of going into RVR to 140s, doing well since IV fluid resuscitation in the ED.
Patient was restarted on home metop and dilt slowly given low SBP and concern for [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2**], eventually titrated back to home medications with HR in the 80-100 range and SBP in the 90-100 range.
# HISTORY OF NEUTROPENIC FEVER - Patient presented with a temperature of 102.0 at home for which he took Tylenol.
He has remained afebrile since admission, still and was antibiosed since admission with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
# REFRACTORY BIPHENOTYPIC LEUKEMIA - Patient is currently s/p cycle two of Dacogen, althought he never had improvement in his cell counts.
# HBV [**Last Name (STitle) **] - Previous core antibody positivity.
# Hyponatremia - Patient developed hyponatremia to 128, urine lytes obtained and more consistent with hypovolemia with Na <10.
