There are no other lesions or masses.
There is significant mass effect causing left sulcal effacement and compression of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is a 7.6 mm rightward subfalcine herniation.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or ventricular entrapment.
IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe poorly defined mass with vasogenic edema and 7.6 mm rightward subfalcine herniation.
Findings are concerning for a primary glial neoplasm and further correlation with MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is recommended.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-8-27**]: FINDINGS: As seen on the recent CT examination, there is a mass identified in the left frontal lobe region.
The mass demonstrates irregular shape and measures approximately 4 cm in size.
The mass extends from the left frontal lobe region to the subcortical region.
Extensive surrounding edema is seen with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and midline shift.
There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement identified within the brain.
IMPRESSION: Large, approximately 4 cm mass in the left frontal lobe with rim enhancement and surrounding edema with midline shift and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Foci of low signal on susceptibility images in the mass indicate prior hemorrhage.
The appearances of the mass are suggestive of a primary neoplasms such as a glioma.
There is no hydrocephalus or acute infarct seen.
PFI: Left frontal lobe mass with surrounding edema and midline shift.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Final Report CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST [**2116-8-28**] 5:33 PM FINDINGS: CT CHEST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
There is focal fatty infiltration adjacent to the ligamentum teres (3, 54).
Minimal gallbladder wall thickening is likely attributable to adenomyomatosis.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
The small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening.
There is no evidence of free air or free fluid.
Multiple dilated veins along the left pelvic side wall, including the left gonadal vein is noted (3, 104).
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
No CT evidence of primary malignant tumor or distant metastases.
Prominent pelvic veins along the left pelvic sidewall and dilated left gonadal vein, a frequent incidental finding.
However, in the setting of chronic pelvic pain, the appearance can sometimes reflect pelvic congestion syndrome.
Left frontal tumor is frozen section #1 (A-B): Necrotic tissue with rare atypical cells.
Left frontal tumor for frozen section #2 (C-D): Malignant neoplasm consistent with glioma.
Left frontal tumor for permanent section (E-H): Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV), See Note.
Note:  Severe cytologic atypia, numerous and atypical mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis (extensive) are seen.
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2116-8-31**]: There has been interval left frontal craniectomy and excision of a previously 3.5-cm mass in the left frontal lobe.
Although the degree of vasogenic edema is similar, there has been a decrease in the degree of shift of midline structures, previously 10 mm shift to the right, and now 5 mm shift to the right (2:15).
There is again compression of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, but this appears somewhat less severe than in the prior study.
The right lateral ventricle demonstrates improvement in the degree of mass effect.
There has been no interval development of hydrocephalus, and the basal cisterns appear intact.
There is no evidence of transtentorial herniation.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and remainder of soft tissues appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Expected appearance following resection of left frontal lobe mass, with continued, but somewhat decreased mass effect and right shift of midline structures.
MRI [**2116-9-1**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy and resection of a previously identified neoplastic process involving the left frontal lobe, there is evidence of residual blood products within the surgical area, persistent and unchanged vasogenic edema and mild mass effect along the sulci in the right frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
After administration of [**Doctor Last Name **] contrast, there is no evidence of significant abnormal enhancement, however, possibly it is too early to discriminate abnormal enhancement, correlation with a followup MRI once the blood product has been reabsorbed, is recommended for further assessment.
On the axial T2-weighted sequence, the arterial flow voids, demonstrates a possible vascular loop at the junction of the left A1 segment, and the anterior communicating artery (5:11), formally a small aneurysm cannot be completely excluded, followup with MRA is recommended.
The visualized paranasal sinuses are normal as well as the orbits, there is evidence of patchy opacities at the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
The patient is status post left frontal mass resection and left frontal craniotomy, there is persistent vasogenic edema, blood products in the surgical bed.
The previously described left frontal lobe mass lesion apparently has been resected, and the blood at the surgical cavity obscures the pattern of enhancement, followup after the reabsorption of the blood products is recommended.
Possible prominent vascular loop versus a small aneurysm is identified at the junction of the A1 and anterior communicating segment on the left.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS([**9-2**]): On non-contrast, decreasing pneumocephalus, otherwise unchanged post-left- frontal-mass resection appearance; no new hemorrhage.
On CTA, no aneurysm or vascular occlusion.
Area at the A1 segment bifurcation with acomm not aneurysm, likely infandibulum   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**2116-8-27**] after her CT scan revealed a new brain mass in the left frontal lobe.
She was started on steroids for the large amount of edema surrounding the mass as well as dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
The was also mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
She went to the OR for tumor resection on [**8-31**].
Her MRI showed a gross total resection however there was a question of a small aneurysm seen at the junction of the ACOMM at A1 on the left.
