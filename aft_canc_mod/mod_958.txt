During the preceding six months, he reported a history of shoulder, neck and quadriceps pain as well as fatigue, weakness and poor appetite.
He reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months.
He then presented to the emergency room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on [**2197-7-19**] showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys.
On [**2197-7-20**], MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a "double hit" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma.
Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.
-- Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening  and admission for neutropenia.
During admission, noted for atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125  mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily.
-- Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension  and cough.
A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin.
-- Follow up PET scan on [**2197-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary  opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central  lucencies most of which were new.
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli.
-- FDG tumor imaging on [**2197-10-19**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with slight interval decrease in size in bilateral pulmonary infarcts.
Focal uptake in the posterior left kidney appears parenchymal, but may be within the collecting system and  projecting over the kidney due to misregistration.
Focal FDG uptake in the left ischial tuberosity, without corresponding lytic or sclerotic lesion.
Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence  for lymphoma and no cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly no c-Myc or Bcl2 translocation.
TEE revealed thrombus at the tip of his right atrial catheter, with no PFO.
-- Admitted on [**2197-11-23**] for high dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization.
-- Repeat PET imaging on [**2197-12-19**] showed new focal mild FDG-avidities in the mediastinal region.
Interval worsening of FDG-avidity in the soft tissue immediately medial to the left acetabulum.
Persistent FDG-avidity in the left ischial tuberosity, without CT correlate.
-- Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2197-12-20**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with some dyspoiesis noted.
No cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically no evidence for MDS.
-- Noted slight increase in LDH to ~ 260.
Repeat CT of the torso on [**2198-1-3**] showed left pelvic soft tissue and expansion of the left piriformis muscle corresponding to the regions of FDG avidity for [**2197-12-19**] scan.
Small internal mammary and left  juxtaclavicular lymph nodes corresponding to foci of FDG avidity.
Decreased size of lymphomatous renal lesions compared to [**2197-7-6**] with stable small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Continued evolution of pulmonary infarcts.
No definite bony lesions, though there is slightly lucency in the left acetabulum in a region of FDG avidity.
PAF diagnosed in [**2180**] with now chronic atrial fibrillation in the past several months.
He had no history of treatment with anti-arrhythmia or anticoagulation prior to his admission in [**8-/2197**], currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and digoxin.
Pulmonary embolism, fondaparinux on hold due to thrombocytopenia #.
Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed in [**2197**] and managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], although further treatment on hold while getting treatment for lymphoma and unclear if his symptoms were related to lymphoma and not PMR.

[**2198-6-29**] PPD NEGATIVE  Brief Hospital Course: A 59 year old man with DLBCL, not responding to primary curative chemotherapy, on palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine, liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), and bortezomib (Velcade) is admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and found to have lymphomatous invasion of the kidney.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient was admitted from renal clinic after Cr trended up sharply from 1.7 to 4.7 over five days.
Creatinine did not trend down after fluid challenge, suspicion for lymphomatous infiltration of the kidney was high.
He was admitted to the ICU for renal biopsy (high bleeding risk given thrombocytopenia).
Given progressive renal failure, acidosis, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, a HD catheter was placed and dialysis was initiated.
# Hyperkalemia: Admitted with K 5.5 related to acute renal failure, EKG did not show peaked T waves.
# Pancytopenia: Related to chemotherapeutic effect and bone marrow involvement by DLBCL.
# Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma: Given "double hit" highgrade lymphoma with translocation of c-myc and Bcl-2, prognosis was grim and he had been on palliative chemotherapy.
# Afib s/p cardioversion and HTN: Metoprolol had been held during previous admission for bradycardia to the 30s.
# Hx of PE: Diagnosed with PE in [**9-/2197**] and previously anticoagulated with fondaparinux, anticoagulation was stopped prior to admission for thrombocytopenia and not resumed.
# Goals of care: Given poor prognosis and progressive renal failure, he decided to focus goals of care on comfort, and declined experimental chemotherapy.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for acute kidney failure.
Kidney biopsy revealed this was due to lymphoma in the kidney.
This is probably due to the lymphoma and past chemotherapy.
