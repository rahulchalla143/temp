He then developed tachycardia to 130-140s, irregular.
Because of a mild ARF (Cr 1.8, baselie 1.3) noted on his labs he got 1L NS, and then another one was hung before coming to the floor.

He could not feel his heart beating fast, had no chest pain or shortness of breath, did not feel dizzy and had no nausea or abdominal pain.
He was persistently tachycardic and developed increased hypoxia, wheezing and confusion.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Moderate ventricular hypertrophy with moderate systolic dysfunction.
Mildly dilated and borderline hypokinetic right ventricle.
At least moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
Moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The severity of aortic stenosis and mitral/tricuspid regurgitation have increased.
No hydronephrosis or stones or solid masses are identified in either kidney.
A simple cyst is seen in the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.7 cm.
Two simple cysts are seen in the left kidney, the largest measuring 2.6 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm.
IMPRESSION: Simple bilateral renal cysts.
No hydronephrosis identified.
Gallbladder with wall thickening, but without distention, evidence of stones, or pericholecystic fluid.
Wall thickening may be due to third spacing.
Pleural effusion on the right.
CXR [**2172-2-6**] Small bilateral effusions are present.
No upper zone redistribution is seen.
The retrocardiac portion of the left hemidiaphragm is obscured, which could indicate collapse or consolidation within the left lower lobe.
No evidence of failure apart from small effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 85yo M with h/o pAFib, aortic stenosis, and systolic HF admitted with afib with [**Month/Day/Year 5509**] causing acute exacerbation of HF, which was not controlled on the floor and resulted in a CCU stay before improvemtment and discharge to rehab.
# Afib with [**Month/Day/Year 5509**]: Patient was intially admitted to medicine floor and was not controlled on PO dilt.
He had a prior hx of orthostatic hypotension on BB, however, CCB was not contolling his rate with afib.
He was [**Month/Day/Year **] given amiondarone, but it was stopped due to transaminitis.
He was also started on a heparin gtt [**Month/Day/Year **], he had a hx of being on coumadin in the past, but it was stopped due to hx of falls and hx of hospital admission with INR of 18.
Hypoxia - Pt w/ ARF on presentation as below, treated w/ 2L NS given concern for pre-renal azotemia.
In setting of A-fib w/ [**Name (NI) 5509**], pt likely w/ pulmonary edema [**3-9**] poor LV filling time.
# ARF/UTI: [**Name (NI) 17820**] Pt w/ elevated Cr to 1.8-1.9 (from bl Cr 1.3).
Renal failure continued to worsen.
Urine lytes showed FeUrea <35%, consistent with prerenal.
Pt had temporary low UO, which then improved with fluid challenge.
Acute on chronic exacerbation caused by afib with [**Month/Year (2) 5509**].
# Orthostatic hypotension - Pt tx w/ Florinef at home, was held while in ICU.
Pt not having orthostatic hypotension currently.
[**Month (only) 116**] need reevaluation at rehab and consider restarting 0.1mg Florinef if a problem.
# Aortic stenosis: valve evaluated on echo, however, size may have been underestimated because echo done during afib with [**Month (only) 5509**].
Also, there was concern for doing cath in light of recent renal failure.
Hepatology elvaulated pt and also thought pt had shocked liver or had liver congestion from heart failure.
Will need period rechecking to monitor LDH after discharge since pt has hx of burketts lymphoma.
Altered mental status - Unclear etiology, started after hopsitalization likely multifactorial including hypoxia, anti-cholinergic medication effect, sun-downing, ICU psychosis, and baseline dementia in setting of UTI.
Sx improved except for mild confusion at discharge.
# HTN: Has diastolic and systolic hypertension for which he normally takes only diltiazem at home.
# Hypernatremia: Occured in setting of ARF and lasix, then autodiresis.
Urinating without difficulty .
# Depression: continued on citalopram .
# DJD: Continued on ASA, but aleve was stopped due to renal failure.

You were found to have a rapid heart irregular heart rate.
You also had worsening heart failure.
You are also on anitibioitcs for a bladder infection, which will be completed on [**2172-2-17**].
