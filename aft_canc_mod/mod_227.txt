She was seen by the ENT and a fiberoptic examination was done by ENT who found her to have super-glottitis and at that point she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for protection of her airway.
She resolved from super-glottitis and the soreness of her throat, but she did develop a little bit of a rash in the bottom of the neck and on the left supraclavicular area.
A CT scan was done which showed no abscess present, however, her rash did improve the day before her discharge, and so she was sent home.
