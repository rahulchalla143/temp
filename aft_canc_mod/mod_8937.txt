Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year-old woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder, metastatic [**Known lastname 499**] cancer to the liver s/p colostomy and urostomy (~6 years ago, no longer on chemo), and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for sepsis (due to polymicrobial bacteremia- VRE, strep viridans and due to cholangitis/biliary obstruction; discharged [**5-2**] with plans to complete course of Cipro- 4 more days, Flagyl- 4 more days, and [**Month/Year (2) **]- 11 more days) who presents with activity concerning for seizure.
She was found in her facility to be unresponsive with food in her mouth; she was reportedly presumed to be post-ictal after a seizure, though there is no report of witnessed seizure activity.
Upon arrival to the ED, she was initially noted by ED staff to be unresponsive with eyes deviated left and extensor posturing in the upper extremities.
She was given another dose of Ativan, this time 1 mg but remained unresponsive, she she was intubated for airway protection given her persistent unresponsive state.
Regarding her prior seizure history, according to her daughter, she does not see a Neurologist; etiology of seizures unknown to daughter, previously on Dilantin, but was told not working so switched to Keppra.
Her last seizure, per her daughter, was a few months ago and semiology includes eye deviation to the left, unresponsiveness and generalized convulsive activity.
Past Medical History: -Sepsis-due to polymicrobial bacteremia (VRE, strep viridans) and due to cholangitis/biliary obstruction [admitted [**Date range (1) 110193**]] -s/p [**Date range (1) **] on [**4-27**]- finding biliary pus and a large obstructing stone that could not be removed.

Unable to elicit ankle jerks.
**FINAL REPORT [**2121-5-8**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2121-5-8**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Blood cultures x 2 - no growth to date  EEG: [**5-5**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy with extremely frequent paroxysmal bilaterally synchronous polyspike and high voltage sharp slow discharges.
[**5-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of frequent generalized bilaterally synchronus polyspike and wave epileptic discharges which are replaced by multifocal epileptiform discharges in the second half of the recording.
These findings are indicative of diffuse cortical irritability, which gradually subsided through the course of the recording.
In addition, background is diffusely slow and disorganized in the first half of the recording, which gradually improves to a mildly disorganized impersistent posterior dominant alpha rhythm toward the end of the recording.
These findings are suggestive of a gradullay resolving mild encephalopathy with  potential infectious, metabolic or toxic etiologies.
No electrographic seizures are present in the recording.
[**5-7**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of a few generalized bilaterally synchronus polyspike-and-wave epileptic discharges in the first few hours of the recording.
These findings are indicative of diffuse cortical irritability, which gradually subsided through the course of the recording.
In addition, background is mildly slow and disorganized in the first half of the recording, which gradually improved to an organized posterior dominant alpha rhythm towards the end of the recording.
These findings are suggestive of a mild encephalopathy with potential infectious, metabolic or toxic etiologies, which gradually resolved through the course of this recording.
No electrographic seizures are present in this study.
There is no consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
NCHCT: FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface is preserved without evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
The ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent but proportional consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the bilateral carotid siphons and left vertebral arteries are noted.
No acute intracranial process, specifically no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Mild global atrophy.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year-old woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder (unknown type, no records available  and patient and PCP unable to report any additional information), metastatic [**Known lastname 499**] cancer to the liver s/p colostomy and urostomy (~6 years ago, no longer on chemo), and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for sepsis ([**1-23**] polymicrobial bacteremia- VRE, strep viridans likely due to recurrent cholangitis/biliary obstruction; discharged [**5-2**] with plans to complete course of Cipro/Flagyl (for empiric coverage of GNR/Anerobes) and [**Month/Year (2) **] (for VRE/Strep) who presents with activity concerning for seizure.
On arrival to the ED she was given ativan 2mg and then 1 mg but remained unresponsive and was intubated in the ED for airway protection.
# Neuro: .
They patient had no further events during this admission.
The most likely cause of her seizure at rehab was thought to be the seizure threshold lowering potential of her Abx regimen "Cipro/Flagyl".
A brain MRI was done to ensure no new mass lesions as a cause for seizure.
Her PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] who reported brain imaging within the past year showed no cause for seizures and that she had been on the Keppra for an unclear amount of time.
# ID: continued [**Name (NI) **] for VRE/Strep viridans.
# Heme: chronic anemia with high MCV, anemia chronic disease + iron deficiency?
There was no signs or blood loss.
LFTs were checked given recent transaminitis and these were in the normal range.
# DVT proph: Maintained on Hep SQ  # Code: remained Full Code .
Neuro: No deficits   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital after having a seizure.
During your stay we did a MRI of your brain to look for any other cause of seizures but this did not show any cause.
