He stated that his symptoms began 2 days ago when he noticed some congestion and a cough productive of green sputum.
He states that his SOB was markedly worse today upon waking up.
He was also complaining of nausea and a headache.
He vomited x1 and had tenesmus with loose stools x3 this morning.
On exam in the clinic, his lungs with diffuse coarse crackles.
Of note, the patient has been on Coumadin for recent PE and continued immunosuppression for GVHD.
A cardiac consult was obtained for concern re: MI and they felt that he was not having ACS.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY # CML diagnosed in 1/[**2120**].
During the [**2120-8-17**] the patient first noticed some lower extremity swelling and began to feel quite fatigued.
In [**Month (only) 404**] [**2120**] he presented to [**Hospital6 204**] with an acute onset of dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and confusion.
Workup was consistent with pneumonia and anemia with a hematocrit of 23.
He had an elevated white count, elevated platelet count, increased basophils, and splenomegaly at that time.
He tolerated this as above with diarrhea, rash on upper torso, and abdominal pain.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY # GVHD- chronic diarrhea and liver involvement (chronic transaminitis) # Chronic RUQ pain- since [**2113**] with extensive workup and pain clinic evaluations.
No prior abd surgeries.
# GERD- [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagus, offered Nissen fundoplication but not done, takes pantoprazole # HTN # Hx of recent PE [**4-25**] - on coumadin.
Smoked 1 PPD for many years.

# LABS ON DISCHARGE: .
# MICROBIOLOGY: .
[**6-15**] - Nasopharyngeal aspirate --> Parainfluenza virus antigen POSITIVE .
# RADIOLOGY:  [**6-10**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
RADIOLOGY: [**6-11**] CTA Chest 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old male with CML s/p allo BMT [**9-23**] complicated by chronic GVHD of skin and liver presented with hypoxia and dyspnea for two days as well as loose stools.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] monitoring for desaturations to 80% on room air, where he improved significantly no ABx and increased dose of steroids.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Given patient's history, bandemia, bronchiectasis (predisposes to infection) and immunosuppression, bacterial PNA was considered the most likely cause of his hypoxia, SOB, however, no evidence of consolidation on CT scan.
Atypical bacterial PNA, viral PNA or bronchitis vs underlying GVHD of lung (which can have neg CT/CXR finding, requires High Resolution CT) that may make him more prone to a pneumonitis when he has a respiratory infection were also considered.
Other causes include cardiac ischemia but felt to be unlikely given lack of sx, EKG changes and recent [**12-25**] nl echo.
Finally, since patient was c/o nasal congestion, a set of nasal washings and cultures revealed parainfluenza virus antigen positivity.
Was discharged with mid-90% O2sat on RA with pulmonary followup.
# Bandemia: On admission it was felt that PNA was the most likely etiology.
Other possible sources considered included GI given sx or urine.
# CML and GVHD - no acute exacerbations noted during hospital stay, but possibly contributing to respiratory distress.
# Osteoporosis & compression fx - continued outpatient pain meds and Ca and Vit D. .
# GERD: asymptomatic during admission, continued PPI.
# Recent PE: Elevated INR of 2.1 was noted on HD#3, patient on Warfarin for PE.
Eleveated INR most likely [**12-19**] starting azithromycin for pulmonary infection.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID:PRN as needed for constipation.
