Admission Date:  [**2111-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-3-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-11-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Mental status changes.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Brain biopsy [**2111-2-23**] Central line placement [**2111-2-28**] Portacath placement [**2111-3-12**] G-tube placement [**2111-3-12**]  History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old female with history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with mental status change, aphasia, left sided weakness and facial droop, and encephalopathy.
She was found at outside hospital to have multiple brain lesions with mass effect on CT scan.
Here an MRI of the head showed multiple, likely metastatic lesions of the brain.
CT abd showed suspicious low attenuation lesion in dome of liver.
CT head repeat showed multiple enhancing lesions including the largest in the right frontal lobe measuring 15 mm, most consistent with metastatic disease.
Unchanged cerebral edema in the right frontal lobe with associated mass effect upon right lateral ventricle, and no interval development of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
On CXR on [**2111-3-3**] the patient was found to have new collapse of the RML and RLL, in addition to enlarging pleural effusions compared to prior AP films.
It is possible that the patient's hypoxia and RML/RLL collapse were due to her expanding pleural effusion or to a mucous plug.
Past Medical History: - Bipolar disorder - Anxiety - Hypothyroidism - Chronic ETOH use - Left distal radial fracture in [**2110-8-22**], chronic back pain, recent fall with chin laceration and facial contusion, recent hospital admission for failure to thrive.
Sclera anicteric.
Left sided facial droop improved.
Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
PULMONARY: No chest wall deformities.
Respirations were unlabored, decreased breath sounds at bases.
Crackles on right base.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing or cyanosis.
There is no right-left confusion but she cannot show me her thumb.
Extraocular movements appears full; there is saccadic intrusion.
Coordination examination does not reveal gross appendicular dysmetria.
"-4":  Smear - Gliotic brain tissue.
B)  "-3":  Gliotic brain tissue with scattered atypical round cells.
"-2":  Smear - Gliotic brain possibly with some necrosis.
"TP":  Smear - Gliotic brain with atypical cells - could be met or infiltrating neoplasm.
"+2":  Smear - Gliotic brain tissue.
focus of possible necrosis and heterogeneous round cell infiltrate.
Favor lymphoma but would also consider inflammatory process, or metastatic neoplasm.
E)  "+3":  High grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in keeping with a primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS, see note.
"+4":  Smear - Gliotic brain tissue.
with heterogeneous small round cell infiltrate.
F)  "+5":High grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in keeping with a primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS, see note.
The diagnostic lesion is best seen in Specimens E and F, although it is likely that there is some infiltration by lymphoma in B, C and D. Hematopathology note: (E), (F):  High grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in keeping with a primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS, see note.
There is a diffuse dense infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells comprised of predominantly large cells, within finely dispersed chromatin and multiple small nucleoli.
Overall, the findings are of a high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in keeping with a primary diffuse large B cell lymphatic of the CNS.
CT head [**2111-2-18**]: Multiple enhancing cerebral lesions, with vasogenic edema surrounding the largest of these in the right frontal lobe.
Findings are concerning for metastatic disease.
MRI head [**2111-2-20**]: Multiple enhancing masses suggesting most likely malignant neoplasm, metastatic or primary.
Diffuse white matter infiltration and cortical infiltration raises the possibility of either glial infiltration, or swelling related to recent seizure activity.
ECHO [**2111-3-2**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The anterior mitral valve leaflet is mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral leaflet thickening with mild mitral regurgitation.
Video swallow [**2111-3-13**]: Moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia, including aspiration of thin liquid.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 year old female with history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with mental status change, aphasia, left sided weakness and facial droop, and encephalopathy.

It is possible that the patient's hypoxia and RML/RLL collapse were due to her expanding pleural effusion or to a mucous plug.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for altered mental status and weakness and were found to have a lymphoma in your brain.
You are on dexamethasone, a steroid which helps with swelling in the brain.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
