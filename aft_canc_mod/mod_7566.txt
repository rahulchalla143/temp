Admission Date:  [**2190-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-1-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cephalexin / Cephalexin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 63yo F with h/o smoking, pulmonary HTN diagnosed in [**2189**], transfered from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for futher workup of pulmonary HTN including R heart catheterization.
Pt states she was in her usual state of health when polycythemia was noted on her labs at annual physical exam in [**Month (only) 547**] or [**2189-5-24**], leading to a workup in which she was diagnosed with pulmonary HTN.
She had noted some dyspnea on exertion prior to that time but was generally active and not bothered by her symptoms, which she associated with her past smoking history.
PFTs showed moderate obstructive airway disease with severely reduced DLCO; CT showed apical bullous emphysema as well as basilar pulmonary fibrosis.
Her condition worsened subacutely in [**12/2189**], when she was found to have low blood pressure at an outpatient visit and admitted to the hospital for a week.
She was readmitted about 3 weeks ago with 3-4 days of worsening dyspnea and some lethargy.
She was treated with an insulin sliding scale for new hyperglycemia in the setting of steroids.
Pt had an episode of urinary retention, with placement of a foley 3 days ago.
Pt reports sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough productive of sputum that was initially dark brown (weeks ago) and is now yellowish.
She denies pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills, and palpitations although she notes occasional panic attacks.
Past Medical History: hyperglycemia--first noted on current admission in the setting of steroids, pt has been on insulin sliding scale as inpt Pulmonary HTN as above, R sided heart failure.
Family History: Both parents died of MI, brother has a defibrilator.
One uncle had pulmonary disease with a history of asbestos exposure.

Larger pattern of radiolucency is seen in the upper lung fields consistent with emphysema.
Pulmonary vasculature and interstitium is consistent with heart failure.
Prominence of pulmonary artery is consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63y/o lady with pulmonary hypertension of unknown etiology, with subacute worsening of her dyspnea, who was transfered after 3 week admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further workup of pulmonary HTN.
She had increasing O2 requirements and complained of worsening dyspnea throughout her stay.
Her labs and ABGs suggested respiratory fatigue and systemic ischemia (rising lactate; antibiotics were started in case this represented sepsis).
A family meeting was held with the patient and her family; she had a significant risk of mortality from CPR and intubation, and might possibly never be able to be weaned from a ventilator in the setting of her bad emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
