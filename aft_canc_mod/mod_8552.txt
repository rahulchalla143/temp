Since the previous tracing atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation no longer present.
In view of clinical history and pattern of lung nodules though septic emboli is likely possibility, presence of L2 vertebral body lytic lesion focal and focal lucency in D11 vertebra along with enlarged mediastnal and supraclavicular lymph nodes is concerning for metastatic disease from primary/lymphoma.

Dense mitral annulus calcification and minimal pericardial effusion.
Congenitally hypoplastic left vertebral artery with effective  PICA-termination and secondary atherosclerosis with reduced flow, likely accounting for the findings on the prompting recent cranial MRA.

Markedly abnormal appearance to the limited included lung apices, including several peripheral irregular solid nodular opacities; in the setting of known MSSA endocarditis, these are highly suspicious for septic pulmonary emboli.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with patchy ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, suggestive of pulmonary edema.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral effusions are concerning for a malignancy," with a recommendation for dedicated chest CT, was posted to CCC by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (2:20 p.m., [**2198-10-14**]).

MRI head with and without contrast [**10-10**]: IMPRESSION: Scattered foci of slow diffusion seen in bilateral cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres in multiple vascular distributions with no obvious enhancement.
Given the lack of enhancement in the lesions, septic emboli are less likely.

FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o F with h/o ESRD on HD, malignant hypertension, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter presenting with MSSA bacteremia c/b endocarditis and septic emboli to the brain and lung with incidental finding on CT scan of lumbar lytic lesion concerning for malignancy.
# MSSA endocarditis: Patient was febrile on admission with an altered mental status with MSSA bacteremia.
On TTE she was found to have a vegetation of her Mitral valve leaflet.
She was complaining of headaches with a nonfocal neuro exam and pain of her neck.
On MRI of her brain she was shown to have scattered embolic infarcts that were consistent with septic emboli.
She had a TEE which showed the same lesion of her valve and no abscess and no thrombus in her left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Laboratory [**Month/Day/Year 7941**] required frequency: [**Month/Day/Year 20515**] - CBC with diff - BMP - LFTs .
# Lytic lumbar lesion: On CT chest, a lytic lumbar lesion was noted.
This, taken in context with mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy in addition to bilateral complex pleural effusions was concerning for an underlying malignancy.
Specifically, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or a solid lung, breast tumor were considered.
This, however, may be secondary to systemic infection, and also could be explained by amyloidosis.
Given patient's ESRD, amyloid is likely, as she has also had echo evidence of a restrictive cardiomyopathy concerning for amyloid.
Multiple myeloma is less likely at this time as SPEP was negative (unable to obtain UPEP as patient is anuric).
On HD 12 patient had an ultrasound guided biopsy of a right enlarged supraclavicular lymph node.
# Arrhythmia- patient has a history of Afib and was on coumadin.
Her INR levels were rising and this was felt to be due to interaction with her antibiotic regimen as she had no other signs of liver failure, or DIC.
She had an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia down into the 30s with a junctional rhythm which was nonresponsive to atropine.
After her TEE (which was negative for perivalvular abscess and other complications) and her rhythm, which converted back to afib in the low 100s, she was transferred back to the medical floor.
Patient was restarted on amiodarone and carvedilol on HD11 as patient was tachycardic, however, on HD12 patient had another episode of bradycardia to 38.
With regard to her anticoagulation, she met with neurology, and given her septic emboli, it is recommended that she stay of anticoagulation for at least 1 month.
#Transitional issues: - Patient has LN biopsy results pending re: malignancy work-up.

Lytic lumbar lesion noted on CT scan .
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis 3.
Diastolic congestive heart failure 4.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for nausea and vomiting, and were noted to have missed one of your dialysis sessions.
You underwent dialysis without complication, but developed high fevers.
You were found to have bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and were placed on intravenous antibiotics.
We found that this bacteria had made a cluster on your heart valve (endocarditis), and small pieces had broken off and travelled through the blood up to your brain and to your lungs giving you tiny areas of very tiny strokes.
You also had a very slow heart rate at one point during your hospitalization you were monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit.
You had one other episode of this abnormal rhythm while inpatient and so the decision was made to discontinue the medications that can slow your heart rate (carvedilol and amiodarone).
Lastly, you had some findings on a CT scan of your chest which were concerning for cancer.
