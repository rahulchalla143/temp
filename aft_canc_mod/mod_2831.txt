2) Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of the right upper and both lower lobes.
Echo [**6-7**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular chamber size is mildly dilated with   mild free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is   seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a   small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic   compromise.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild right ventricular cavity   enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Small circumferential pericardial   effusion without hemodynamic compromise.
Based on [**2166**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings   indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions   regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and   echocardiographic data.
[**2174-6-12**]: Abdominal/Pelvis CT: 1.
No evidence of lymphoma recurrence within the abdomen and pelvis.
Enlarged lymph, in the part of cardiac region, large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with compressive atelectasis again seen.
Bilateral inguinal hernias.
ECG: Atrial fibrillation Multifocal atrial rhythm Since previous tracing of [**2174-6-7**], irregular supraventricular rhythm seen  [**2174-6-13**] Cytology PLEURAL FLUID pending  CXR [**6-14**]: Compared with [**2174-6-13**] there is considerable interval clearing of the pulmonary edema and the pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Residual right pleural effusion is seen causing haziness at the right base.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: a kappa-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old man with CLL, COPD, HTN admitted s/p fall 3 days prior to admission  1) Pulmonary: pt arrived from OSH intubated for tachypnea ?lung collapse and airway protection per ED physician who evaluated pt at [**Hospital3 15402**].
Pt has been fluid overloaded with anasarca and right pleural effusion.
Thoracentesis done [**6-13**] around 2pm which showed a transudative process consistent with CHF.
Started on keflex for possible right wound infection, although superficial wound culture was negative.
Pt still occasionally spikes fevers but blood, urine and pleural fluid cultures have been negative.
3) Onc: Pt has chronic lymphocytic leukemia with extremely elevated white blood count.
Pt was temporarily started on allopurinol for possible tumor lysis, but this was discontinued.
The patient is noted to have an enlarged spleen.
Heme onc was consulted, but they felt no acute interventions were indicated.
We considered adding beta-blockade although there is some quetion of whether he also is in wenckebach [**Date range (1) 61876**] although official ekg read as afib w/ multifocal atrial rhythm.
b) pump: echo shows normal ef, decreased E/A ratio == dialstolic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension.
5) Neuro: history of parkinsons disease, continue cinemet.

Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical attention for fevers>101.4, for chest pain, or for anything else medically concerning.
