Admission Date:  [**2131-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-11-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-6-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Phenergan / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 24529**] is a 68 year-old male with recently diagnosed locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy s/p 5-FU/cisplatin cycle #1 on [**2131-10-8**], also with a history of DM type 2, HTN and COPD, who is being transferred from the floor for further management of hypotension.
* He initially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital on [**2131-10-15**] with a [**3-2**] day history of diffuse cramping abdominal pain, associated with N/V.
An AXR showed no pathology, a RUQ U/S was remarkable for a mildly dilated CBD 10.3 mm without other abnormalities, and a CT revealed no obvious explanation for his abdominal symptoms.
* While on the floor, he developed a fever to 101.9, and was placed on Unasyn for coverage of ?
His abdominal pain persisted.
* In ICU, pt was initially treated with IVF and mild pressors for hypotension.
[**Name (NI) 24895**] pt was evaluated for persistent fevers, neutropenia and abdominal pain.
Pt thought to have both entercolitis as complication of 5FU and also ileus (increased output from G-tube).
The patient was kept on vancomycin and cefepime given that he was severely neutropenic with potential GI infection.
Pt currently has no complaints.
He has no pain, no nausea or vomiting.
No distant metastases.
COPD 3.
History of recurrent gallstone pancreatitis with resultant chronic pancreatitis, status post cholecystectomy.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
No palpable lymphadenopathy.
RESP: occasional crackles on right lower base, otherwise clear CVS: RRR.
Distant heart sounds, no audible murmur.
GI: Moderate abdominal distension, hypoactive but present bowel sounds.
Mild diffuse tenderness to palpation without voluntary guarding, no rebound, no rigidity.
EXT: Without edema Back: no spinal tenderness Neuro: Reflexes: 2+ patellar, downgoing toes, strength 5/5 UE, LE with intact sensation to touch LE.
Imaging: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-10-17**] 4:41 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Long segment of multiple smoothly, circumferentially thickened loops of distal jejunum and ileum.
Inflammation, ischemia, vasculitis, or hemorrhage are also possible.
Small intra-abdominal ascites.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2131-10-18**] 3:12 AM IMPRESSION: Successful placement of left subclavian line.
No pmeumothorax .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-10-18**] 1:28 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of free air.
Distended air-filled small bowel loops consistent with ileus.
No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally  normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral  valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate distention of most of the small bowel.
Diffuse wall thickening in the small bowel is considerably improved.
The appearance is most suggestive of an ileus, as no transition point suggesting obstruction is visualized.
Again seen are distended loops of small bowel, without evidence of a transition point or obstruction.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Linear opacities in the left base, most likely represent atelectasis.
However, pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.
Small regions of consolidation in the periphery of the left lung are new and may represent early foci of pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
A dilated loop of bowel in the midline simulates pneumoperitoneum, but no free subdiaphragmatic gas is present.
A J-tube is present with the tip terminating in the left lower quadrant with intraluminal opacification of loops of small bowel.
No extraluminal contrast is seen.
Nonspecific loops of air-filled small bowel are again seen, most pronounced in the right upper quadrant which may be consistent with reported history of resolving ileus.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male with esophageal carcinoma on neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, s/p cycle 1 of 5FU and Cisplatin, with abdominal pain, fever, and hypotension.
1) Hypotension: The patient has hypotension at the beginning of the hosptia course that responded well to agressive IVFs and 12 hours of neostigmine.
He did not have any ischemic changes on EKG and enzymes were negative for troponin leak.
He was also continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed sepsis and he responded well.
He was monitored daily in this regard and had transient episodes of asymptomatic hypotension that responded well to NS boluses.
2) Febrile neutropenia: Symptoms localize to abdomen, attributable to 5-FU toxicity with superimposed mucositis.
Infectious work-up negative and the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage until he was afebrile with an ANC > 1000.
Antibiotics were tapered gradually and the upon completion of antibiotic removal the patient remained afebrile with an adequte ANC count.
3) Abdominal pain: Likely mucositis due to side effects from chemotherapy as there was no infections etiology found.
After advancement of his diet, he developed hypotension, fever to 102, and abdominal distension.
These images were negative for perforation but showed a continual ileus.
His distension resolved, his hypotension resolved, he became afebrile and antibiotics were stopped without complication.
His diet was advanced slowly and the patient was able to tolerate the reinstitution of diet with moderate abdominal pains.
This was stitched back into place without complication.
4) Esophageal cancer: The patient underwent daily radiation to his esophageal cancer without complication.
There were periods of anemia for which he required blood transfusions.
5) DM type 2: Actos on hold, patient placed on sliding scale and maintained within normal limits.
There were no active issues in this regard during this hopsitalization.

Tolerating POs, ambulating without difficulty.
Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting blood or any other concerning symptoms.
