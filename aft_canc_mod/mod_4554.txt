Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: # Stage [**Doctor First Name **] squamous cell cervical carcinoma: - developed vaginal bleeding around [**Holiday 1451**] [**2172**].
- Pap smear showed showed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.
- continued to experience vaginal bleeding, and also developed suprapubic abdominal pain, urinary frequency/urgency, and 5-10lb  weight loss.
A  pelvic ultrasound on the day of admission showed a bladder hematoma with no clear visualization of the uterus or ovaries.
Abd/pelvic CT the same day showed mild right hydronephrosis and  hydroureter with clotted blood in the bladder.
- was admitted to the Urology service and on [**2173-2-10**] had an MR urogram which showed a 5.7 x 3.6 x 1.9 cm cervical mass with bilateral parametrial involvement, mild hydrometria, invasion into the posterior bladder wall over 3.5 cm and right hydronephrosis.
A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pelvis.
- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a cystoscopy [**2173-2-10**] which showed the cervical mass to be invading the trigone and posterior wall with  a large amount of old clot and oozing.
- Pathology from this biopsy returned positive for invasive squamous cell carcinoma consistent with a cervical origin involving the muscularis propria and the lamina propria without  involvement of the bladder mucosa, with lymphovascular invasion.
- Examination under anesthesia performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5797**] [**2173-2-11**] showed a necrotic cervical mass which obliterated the  vaginal fornices and infiltrated the anterior upper half of the  vagina, with left parametrial involvement to the sidewall and medial right parametrial involvement.
Proctoscopy showed no rectal involvement.
Biopsies of the cervix again showed squamous  cell carcinoma with vascular invasion.
- Ms. [**Known lastname 5936**] had a PET-CT scan on [**2173-2-16**] that showed FDG-avidity in the region of the known cervical mass, with irregularity of the posterior urinary bladder and extension of FDG-avidity through the uterine myometrium to the fundus.
No  distant metastases were seen, and therefore staging is consistent with T4, FIGO stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] disease.
- She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Radiation Oncology on [**2173-2-16**] and started radiation therapy on [**2173-2-19**] for planned 37 sessions - saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**] in Oncology on [**2173-2-22**], planning to start radiosensitizing weekly cisplatin on [**2173-2-25**] - admitted [**2-25**] to [**3-4**] with ARF relieved with BL nephectomy tubes and developed LGIB [**3-17**] tumor invading into bowel - started cisplatin weekly [**2173-3-4**], last dose [**2173-3-16**] .

Pt d/c with oral replation and close f/u of labs as an outpt.
# Thrombocytopenia: New onset thrombocytopenia/ Likely due to the infection in addition te recent chemotherapy.
