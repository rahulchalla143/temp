She denies any visual problems.

Right cerebellar vasogenic edema concerning for underlying cerebellar mass.
An additional mass underlying the region of edema remains a possibility.
Some mass effect on the fourth ventricle which remains patent.
Prominence of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle is thought to be due to generalized atrophy however developing hydrocephalus cannot be entirely excluded.
Opacification of the left mastoid air cells with minimal opacification of the right mastoids air cells.
Correlate clinical for mastoiditis or other regional inflammatory process.
18 x 16 mm single right cerebellar mass, with neighboring edema and no significant local mass effect.
Diffuse cortical atrophy and changes secondary to microvascular ischemic disease.
Pagetoid changes in the left hip.
Known non-displaced left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, better characterized on study performed one day prior with dedicated bone windows through the pelvis.
Tiny amount of linear hyperdensity along the craniotomy site, likely post-surgical blood products.
No large intracranial hemorrhage.
Residual vasogenic edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere with unchanged mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
MRI HEAD [**7-23**] Status post resection of right cerebellar lesion with mild residual enhancement at the anterior margin.
No significant change in mass effect or new infarct seen.
No hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 85F admitted to the neurosurgery service following transfer from OSH in the setting of new cerebellar mass.
She was also administered steroids to treat vasogenic edema.
MRI of the head was obtained and showed 18 x 16 mm right cerebellar mass.
Her diet was advanced, she was voiding without difficulty.
Her steroid dosing will be weaned to 2mg [**Hospital1 **] and her L hip fracture requires no surgical intervention, she can TDWB.
Glucagon (Human Recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
Dextrose 50% 12.5 gm IV PRN hypoglycemia protocol 18.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
Followup Instructions: FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT INSTRUCTIONS - You have staples closing your surgical wound, you will have to have these removed in our office in [**8-13**] days from the date of your surgery, please call to make an appointment to have your wound checked and staples removed.
