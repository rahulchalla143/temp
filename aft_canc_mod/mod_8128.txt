Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Open cholecystectomy   History of Present Illness: 67 year old female with multiple medical co-morbidities who recently underwent ERCP for choledocholithiasis.
She started having intermittent epigastric pain 2 weeks ago, radiating to bilateral sides and back.
The pain was unrelated to food and had initially resolved after ERCP (as had her LFTs) however some mild pain did restart.
She was tolerating a regular diet with no nausea or vomiting.
She had no prior episodes and no episodes of cholecystitis.
Past Medical History: PMH: - COPD, continues to smoke, not on home oxygen - H/o pulmonary nodules followed for several years - CAD s/p CABG (4 vessel in [**2116**], one vessel occluded on cath [**2118**], no stents) - Perforated ulcer - [**2125**] ex-lap, was H pylori positive - Uterine CA -s/p TAH BSO - 40 years ago  PSH: - CABG ([**2116**]) - Appendectomy - Tonsillectomy - Bladder suspension procedure - Eye surgery x 3 - TAH/BSO (40 years ago) - Ex-lap for perforated ulcer repair ([**2125**])  Social History: Retired claims adjustor, lives at home with spouse and current 1ppd smoker, 4-6 beers/day.
Family History: Breast/ovarian cancer   Physical Exam: Upon Discharge: Vitals - 98.1  98.0  96  150/86  22  95%3L Gen - AAOx3, NAD CV - +S1/S2, no murmurs/rubs/gallops Resp - distant breath sounds bilaterally, diffuse occasional coarse breath sounds and crackles diffusely, no wheezes/rhonchi Abd - soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS, no rebound/rigidity/guarding, no palpable masses Inc - clean/dry/intact, no erythema/drainage/induration Ext - no cyanosis/clubbing/edema  Pertinent Results: OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY ([**2130-8-22**]): Gall bladder, cholecystectomy: adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with associated high-grade dysplasia.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2130-8-25**]): No DVT in both lower extremities.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2130-8-25**]): Enlargement of the peripheral consolidative abnormality at the left lung base since [**8-24**] is consistent with increasing infection or infarction.
Mild edema persists at the base of the right lung.
V/Q SCAN ([**2130-8-25**]): Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2130-8-28**]): Left lower lobe opacification with associated pleural effusion, consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
On [**2130-8-22**], the patient underwent an open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
The patient was given an epidural for pain control, which controlled her pain well.
However, in the PACU, the patient required a transient phenylephrine drip, 2 L fluid bolus, and one dose of albumin due to a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, while mentating well and being entirely asymptomatic.
With adjustment of the epidural parameters, the patient was easily weaned off the phenylephrine, with stable blood pressures in the 90-100s.
General Brief Hospital Course:  Neuro: The patient orgiginally received an epidural on POD1, however, it did not control her pain, the epidural was split and then discontinued on POD2 at which point the patient was transistioned to oral pain medication with IV breakthrough.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was successfully transitioned to oral pain medications, and had good pain control thereafter.
Patient experienced another episode of desaturation to the 70's which also responded to supplemental oxygen however, this episode was associated with a change in mental status.
WBC was however elevated at 18 and the decision was made to transfer the patient to the ICU for a further w/u of altered mental status.
ABGs remained consistent with a picture of chronic COPD.
While in the ICU patient remaine stable from a cardiovascular standpoint, however, she continued to have episoded of altered mental status especially in the evening.
Workup (please refer to Pertinent Results section) proved negative for pulmonary embolism.
Imaging and clinical correlation was suggestive of pneumonia, and the patient was treated accordingly (please refer to ID section below).
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection throughout her stay.
As discussed above, the identification of pneumonia prompted requesting the input of Infectious Disease specialists.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
