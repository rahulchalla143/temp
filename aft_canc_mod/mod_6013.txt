He tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications and was brought to the SICU for post-operative management.
Liver US on POD#0 revealed patent hepatic vasculature, with no perihepatic fluid collections and 90cm/sec velocity in the donor main portal vein.
JP drain output was sero-sanginous and T-tube output bilious.
On POD#2, the patient was noted to have crackles on expiration and coarse breath sounds.
A CXR revealed low lung volumes, but aside from mild atelectasis at the left base, was essentially clear.
Repeat xray demonstrated persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Chest PT was initiated at this time, as well as aggressive pulmonary toilet.
On POD#2, due to LE swelling and shortness of breath, a bilateral lower extremity U/S was also obtained, with no evidence of DVT with bilateral lower extermities.
An ECHO was obtained on [**9-19**], with no significant intrapulmonary shunting, but symmetric LVH.
As a result, CT chest was obtained on [**9-18**], which revealed an interval slight increase in moderate/large right pleural effusion.
A CT chest was then completed which revealed atelectasis and/or pneumonic consolidation in the right lower lobe, with new multifocal ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes.
Differential diagnosis included pulmonary hemorrhage, less likely viral infection, drug reaction or aspiration pneumonitis.
The patient received a bronchoscopy on [**9-20**], which revealed small amount of mucoid secretions.
Bronchial washings were found to be negative for malignancy, with negative cultures to date.
At this time, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and zosyn were discontinued, as there was no evidence of bacterial pneumonia.
On POD#7, the patient received a cholangiogram, which demonstrated a cyanotic area at the level of the anastomosis probably due to mild edema, with a small amount of contrast material passing into the jejunum.
Upon transfer to the floor, he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, urinating without difficulty, and reported adequate pain control on oral dilaudid.
