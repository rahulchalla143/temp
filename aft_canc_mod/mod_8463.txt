Omentum of transverse colon (C,D):  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Spleen (80 grams) (E,F):  Capsular fibrosis; fresh hemorrhage in the hilar area.
V. Omentum (AD-AF):  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Margins     Proximal margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  180 mm.
Distal margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  170 mm.
Circumferential (radial) margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  55 mm.
