CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-2-11**] 10:44 AM IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without evidence for volume overload.
Findings are most concerning for a diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms.
Over the course of her treatment she was transition ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Her hypoxia was related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
For confirmation, she underwent CTA of the lung which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
The CT did show diffuse ground glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions consistent with the diagnosis of PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] her exertional hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or chest pain).

LFTs abnormalities were related to PCP pneumonia, fatty liver, or both.
