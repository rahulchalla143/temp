Admission Date:  [**2174-12-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-1-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Penicillins / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2175-3-4**]: Chest Tube Placement Tracheostomy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 50 year old female with multiple myeloma, s/p autologous stem cell transplant, transfusion dependent, presenting with fevers and upper respiratory congestion.
The night prior to admission, she developed a frontal headache, runny nose, nasal congestion, watery and red eyes and had difficulty sleeping.
She developed a temperature to 100.5 after one unit of blood transfusion.
The patient was admitted for febrile neutropenia.
She was followed expectantly with stable asymptomatic disease -[**9-/2170**] she developed back pain, anemia and an IgG level to the mid 3000 range.
MRI revealed an expansile lesion in the left iliac crest.
-She received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell priming.
-[**2-/2173**], she was noted to have a rising IgG level with progressive bone pain -bone marrow biopsy performed in [**4-/2173**] showed 90% plasma cell cellularity with amyloidosis by [**Country 7018**] red staining comprising approximately 40% of the marrow core.
-[**10/2174**], found to have progressive disease by skeletal survey.
Family History: M - skin cancer M - multiple sclerosis F - Alzheimer's  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: VS-100.7, 119, 22, 127/78 Gen-congested, red weeping eyes HEENT-bilateral injection, red eyes right>left, mouth sores on posterior pharynx Neck-supple, nontender Car-tachycardic, no murmur Resp-CTAB Abd-s/nt/nd/nabs no HSM Ext-no edema, ecchymoses over both forearms.
Mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses as described above.
Preseptal periorbital soft tissue edema and postseptal extraconal fat stranding, most consistent with a cellulitis.
Features consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis involving primarily the bilateral ethmoid sinuses and the nasal cavity, which are filled with presumably necrotic non-enhancing material, and extension into and post- septal involvement of the medial aspect of the right orbit.
Possible transgression of the cribriform plates with evidence of reactive pachymeningeal enhancement in bifrontal regions.
Mucosal thickening in sphenoid sinus and right maxillary fluid, with no definite direct extension of the ethmoid process.
No foci of abnormal enhancement noted in the brain.
[**1-1**]: MR orbit: CONCLUSION: Findings of some concern for progression of fungal infection with secondary mucosal abnormalities as noted above.
[**1-3**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Extensive sinus disease with increased density consistent with the history of fungal sinusitis.
[**1-24**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Persistent opacification of multiple paranasal sinuses with worsening of opacity within the sphenoid sinus.
Although no definite bony erosion is identified, increased subcutaneous air as well as air adjacent to the lamina papyracea on the left raises the question of breach of this structure, as well as transmission of infection via emissary veins, the latter mechanism being invoked to account for the tiny amount of left extraconal gas adjacent to the left lamina papyracea.
[**2175-2-26**] CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Minimally increased aeration of the paranasal sinuses since the prior of [**2175-1-24**].
No definite osseous erosions are present.
The subcutaneous air within the left nasolacrimal duct persists.
There is marked distention of the left nasolacrimal duct suggesting distal obstruction.
There is extensive opacification of the paranasal sinuses with minimal aeration of the sphenoid sinus, the maxillary sinuses, and up to the ethmoid air cells as seen on the CT from [**2-15**].
There is bilateral periosteal-based enhancement at the lateral aspect of the lamina papyracea both pre-septal and post-septal, unchanged from [**1-1**] and likely related to the fungal infection.
Large layering right-sided pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis/ collapse of a large part of the right lower lobe, and portions of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe.
There are high-density areas within this pleural effusion dependently concerning for hematoma.
Multiple bilateral patchy focal opacities in the lungs with associated ground-glass opacity consistent with an infectious/inflammatory process.
Small pericardial effusion.
Diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with multiple myeloma.
Decrease in size of large right-sided pleural effusion with improvement in previously noted atelectasis and collapse.
Again high-density area within this pleural effusion is concerning for hematoma.
New right-sided pleural drainage tube with small right apical pneumothorax.
Multiple patchy focal opacities within the lungs are again identified, likely consistent with an infectious/inflammatory process.
Diffuse osseous abnormality consistent with multiple myeloma.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old female with relapsed Stage 3A IgG kappa multiple myeloma, presented with neutropenic fever, hospital course complicated by GI bleed, invasive fungal sinusitis, and transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pleural effusion/hemothorax then underwent an allo-BMT [**2175-3-14**].
Thereafter she had a PEA cardiac arrest and was transferred to the ICU-east.
# Invasive fungal sinusitis: The patient's upper respiratory symptoms rapidly progressed to right eye swelling and discoloration.
ENT evaluation revealed necrotic turbinate and microbiology and pathology preliminary evaluations demonstrated hyphae.
She was started on high dose Ambisome and posaconazole for invasive fungal sinusitis.
Risk factors for this condition include prolonged neutropenia,  steroid-induced hyperglycemia and history of multiple transfusions.
A sinus CT on [**1-24**] showed worsening disease.
After that, pt seemed to stabilize until mid-[**Month (only) 404**], when pt began to develop worsening swelling around medial epicanthal disease.
Serial CT sinus and MRI orbit/head showed continued sinus infection, but no significant bony erosion on posaconazole and ambisome combination therapy.
Last bone marrow showed 95-100% plasma cells with amyloid.
She remained pan-cytopenic after therapy and continued to be transfusion dependant.
On [**2175-2-10**], pt remained neutropenic on G-CSF, repeat bone marrow biopsy done, appears that marrow remains fibrotic with collagen deposition, not nearly as cellular as previous marrow.
On [**3-1**]- repeat MRI sinus/orbit with marked distention of L nasolacrimal duct and continued extensive sinus disease, but no extensive bony erosion, pt decided to continue with BMT.
# Pseudomonal pneumonia: Had pseudomonas on sputum culture from [**4-22**].
Enterococcal and coag-neg staph bacteremia.
Blood cultures positive from [**4-18**] showing enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
EEG with diffuse encephalopathy, no epileptiform features.
Renal Failure: Potentially due to over-diuresis but patient is grossly edematous and total body overloaded.
Previous meds thought to potentially be related are gancyclovir and acyclovir which were d/c'd without much improvement.
Hypercalcemia:Possibly related to malignancy versus medication additions versus side effect of renal failure.
Likely secondary to renal insufficiency.
Transfused Plt>50 for active bleeding.
# Cardiac Arrest [**4-3**]: PEA vs asystole.
Most likely due to hypoxia due to supraglottis/vocal cord occlusion from black debris/clots as noted by anesthesia during intubation vs worsening CHF.
No h/o CAD to suggest ACS.
Initial concerns of anoxic brain injury were alleviated when her mental status improved significantly - she was awake and alert and conversing, albeit slowly.
# Code: DNR/I .
