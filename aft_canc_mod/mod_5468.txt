She denied any chest pain but did complain of weakness.
EMS was called and noted a left facial droop.
Per radiology, the well-circumscribed hyderdense lesion at the right cerebellar hemisphere is more consistent with meningioma rather than bleed.
Her initial CT evaluation did not show an acute bleed.
Past Medical History: Left atrial myxoma, pericardial effusion status post pericardiocentesis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on aspirin (large rectus sheath hematoma while on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p Guidant pacemaker placement for sick sinus syndrome, history of DVT, CHF, Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, CRI, hypothyroidism, aspiration PNA, right eye glaucoma, lung cancer on CT scan.
Social History:  Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where she lives, at baseline, she has dementia and difficulty with short term memory.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Exam on admission:  Limited due to patient being Russian speaking and interpreter having difficulty understanding her speech.
Vitals:  AF   HR 60   RR 18   BP 130/103 100% on RA No carotid bruits or thyromegaly.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, normal S2, no murmurs  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatomegaly, 1+ pedal edema bilaterally, palpable peripheral pulses.
Confrontational testing limited by shoulder pain but was able to hold up arms for 10 seconds and legs for 5 seconds.
There was no neglect and sensation to light touch and pinprick intact.
There was no ataxia with FNF.
R NLF flattening.
RUE w/ UMN weakness distribution, with wrist and FEs antigravity only.
Otherwise symmetrically weak throughout, but likely due to giveway/effort/attention impairment.
DTRs hyperreflexic on RUE, crossed adductor in LEs with increased tone.
Sensory: inattentive, can not distinguish R vs. L. Coordination and gati, could not assess.
Atrial mechanism is probably atrial fibrillation of [**2109-3-25**] there is no significant change.
Given the relatively well-defined margins, lack of edema, and attenuation slightly low for acute hemorrhage, a hyperattenuated mass with indolent growth is favored.
However, there is no significant mass effect, midline shift, or herniation.
As patient cannot undergo MRI (pacemaker), short interval followup head CT would be useful to assess for attenuation stability (hemorrhage evolves rapidly) and exclude rapid enlargement.
Stable high attenuation lesion in the right posterior fossa, most likely consistent with meningioma, less likely corresponds to hemorrhage.
CXR [**10-16**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2109-3-26**], there is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
IMPRESSION: Little overall change  EEG [**10-17**] - Preliminary - mild encephalopathy, no epileptiform discharges.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old left-handed woman with left atrial myxoma, pAfib on aspirin (large rectus sheath hematoma while on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p pacemaker placement for sick sinus syndrome, history of DVT, CHF, Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, CRI, and hypothyroidism, who presented with an episode of altered level of consciousness (no recorded witness account of what actually happened).
On admission her neurological examination was significant for a right facial droop and dysarthria, and this progressed to RUE weakness in UMN distribution on morning after day of admission, along with hypophonic speech, motor aphasia but intact comprehension.
Inintial Head CT was consistent with a meningioma (mass arising from dura), which did not match her neurological exam findings.
The possible etiologies included a Sz leading to alteration in level of consciousness (she is at increased risk given history of AD) or a small stroke.
She underwent a repeat head CT which confirmed the findings of a meningioma and also revealed a L posterior IC/thalamus hypodensity, most likely consistent with an  acute stroke.
Given the location, the most likely etiology was felt to be ischemic, although she is at a high risk of an embolic event (myxoma and afib).
Given prior significant bleeding with coumadin, she was maintained on ASA 325mg daily.
She underwent EEG to evaluate for encephalopathy which showed mild encephalopathy without epileptiform activity/evidence of NCSE.
On the day of discharge, patient remained encephalopathic, aphasic and dysarthric.
Encephalopathy was felt to be toxic/metabolic causes (hypernatremia, renal failure and/or possible UTI).
She has a history of dCHF and was found to be tachypneic on morning of admission, likely due to IVF administration for stroke protocol.
EKG was not concerning for ischemia and CXR was consistent w/ CHF, likely an acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation  She was maintained on home dose of lasix and provided with IV boluses.
Patient was noted to have aspiration by nursing even with nectar thick liquids.
Patient will require careful volume status monitoring and hyponatremia monitoring.
She is felt to be overall volume overloaded but intravascularly volume depleted.
Given patient's underlying dementia, recent stroke and CV comorbidities a goals of care discussion was held with the family.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with altered conscioussness, new right sided weakness and difficulty with speech.
You were found to have an incidental finding of a meningioma.
You were also noted to be in heart failure and with elevated sodium.
You will continue treatment for these conditions.
