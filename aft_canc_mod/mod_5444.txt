Admission Date:  [**2176-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-3-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: CC: Fever to 101  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy with BAL x 2 - Pulmonary biopsy on 2nd bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yo female h/o M4 AML s/p 7+3 and 4 cycles of HIDAC (last [**2176-11-26**]).
She reports that yesterday she started to feel nauseous and induced vomiting x1 (no hematemesis) without benefit.
She began to feel better last evening, but this morning she reports a continued upset stomach with nausea and found her temperature to be 101.
She denies abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation.
She has had a cough for the last 2 weeks and has been producing clear phelgm with yellowish tinge.
She has had no recent travel.
Her initial bone marrow was morphologically consistent with AML (type M4) with some monocytic differentiation and her cells were CD34, HLA-DR, CD11c, CD33, CD13, CD64, and CD117 positive and CD41, CD56, and glycophorin A negative.
In terms of cytogenetics, no mitoses were available for metaphase chromosome analysis.
On [**6-28**] she began 7+3 induction chemotherapy with three days of idarubicin 20 mg and seven days of cytarabine 170 mg. A day 14 bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of leukemia.
Patient's repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**7-30**] showed mildly hypercellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.
Family History: No family history of leukemia, mother dx w/ breast cancer at age 62 and 2 cousins also dx with breast cancer around age 50.
Physical Exam: T 101.9 P 95 RR 26 BP 103/60 98% RA Gen: WDWN woman lying in bed in NAD HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, OP clear, MMM CV: RRR nl s1, s2, no m/g/r Lungs: CTAB, no w/r/r Abd: BS+, soft, NT, ND Ext: no c/c/e Pulses: 2+ radial bilaterally, warm LE Skin: no rashes Neuro: A&O, CN 2-12 intact, [**4-11**] UE and LE strength, no gross deficits to Light Touch, FNF and HKS WNL, tandem walk normal  Pertinent Results: ECHO: [**2176-12-12**]: Conclusions: 1.
No evidence of endocarditis seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2176-7-9**], there has been no significant change .
ECHO: [**2176-12-31**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior reportof [**2176-12-12**], the left ventricle is now borderline dilated with a low  normal ejection fraction.
CT Chest with contrast: [**2176-12-13**]: Numerous ground glass and solid nodules with upper lobe predominance with more confluent areas in the right apex.
In this immunocompromised patient, an opportunistic infection such as invasive aspergillosis is considered most likely, but differential diagnosis includes mycobacterial, bacterial, and viral organisms .
Improving ground-glass and solid nodules, which have a right upper lobe predominance.
Again, in this immunocompromised patient the differentials are invasive aspergillosis, mycobacteria , fungal or virus infections.
Congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema with small bilateral effusions, cardiomegaly, and small pericardial effusion.
Decreased nodular opacities in the bilateral upper lobes representing improvement of infection, most likely fungal.
Increased pulmonary edema and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
New left basilar consolidation probably representing atelectasis.
A pneumonia cannot be excluded, particularly in an immunocompromised patient .
There has been significant improvement in the upper lobe opacities as well as the left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions seen on the prior studies.
There is a new micronodular pattern of predominantly centrilobular opacities diffusely involving the lungs, more so at the upper lobes than the lower lobes.
These findings are most suggestive of atypical infection, which include mycobacterial (tuberculosis or atypical), fungal, pyogenic bacterial, or viral infection.
Other causes such as parasitic or lymphoid infiltration are unlikely based on the imaging appearances.
Interval progression of diffuse interstitial and alveolar airspace opacities with new scattered areas of consolidation.
4.8-cm left adnexal cyst.
A followup ultrasound is recommended in six weeks to assess for resolution.
These likely represent cysts and could be further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI.
CT Head with contrast: [**2177-1-6**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
No abnormal post-contrast enhancement identified.
L Shin Biopsy [**2176-12-30**]: Septal panniculitis most consistent with erythema nodosum .
Bronchial Washings [**2177-1-3**]: An abundant monomorphic population of intermediate sized mononuclear cells with folded nuclei, pale chromatin and variably prominent nucleoli, are suspicious for involvement by the patient's AML.
Flow Cytometry of cells from Bone MArrow Bx of: [**2176-12-26**]: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with persistent acute myelogenous leukemia with an immunophenotype similar to that seen at first diagnosis.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, myeloid associated antigens CD33-bright, CD13-dim, CD117-dim  .
Bone MArrow Biopsy: [**2176-12-26**]: Markedly hypocellular bone marrow with large aggregates of myeloblasts, consistent with persistent acute myeloblastic leukemia.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, CD117, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD11c, CD64 (dim), CD15 (dim), CD13 (dim), and lack the myeloid antigen CD14.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yo woman with M4 AML, s/p 7+3 induction and four cycles of HiDAC consolidation who was initially admitted for febrile neutropenia and had a complicated hospital course.
M4 AML:    She was admitted for febrile neutropenia and was cultured and started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
The discovery of these blasts post HiDAC consolidation implied that she never entered a complete remission.
At this time, her WBC count started to climb exponentially rising to 57,000 and she began to develop DIC and leukostasis.
At this point she was reinduced with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) and, although her WBC count fell, she continued to have peripheral blasts.
At this time, potential treatment options were additional MEC or clofarabine.
In the background of this discussion was the knowledge that her cytogenetics now revealed an abnormality in the p53 gene, implying more aggressive disease.
Prior to starting clofarabine on [**1-3**], she developed a productive cough and was found to have multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules on chest CT, suspicious for fungal infection vs miliary tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis was ruled out with sputum samples and a bronchoscopy, including a transbronchial biopsy, was negative for an infectious source.
The BAL from the bronchoscopy was suspicious for malignant cells, suggesting that the pulmonary process was due to her underlying leukemia.
In this setting, as well as a rising WBC count, she was started on a five day course of clofarabine.
She tolerated clofarabine fairly well developing described side effects of elevated LFTs (one dose was held for one day) and palmar-plantar erythema-dysesthesia.
Initially her WBC count began to decrease, although she continued to have peripheral blasts.
Febrile neutropenia: On admission, she was started on empiric antibiotics but she continued to have low grade fevers around 100 to 101 with occasional elevations to 103-104.
It was eventually thought that her fevers were most likely due to her leukemia and when she was transitioned to comfort measures, she was given tylenol around the clock to control her temperature.
Pulmonary: She was relatively free of respiratory complaints until [**1-3**] when she developed a productive cough and was found to have multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules on chest CT.  A fungal or mycobacterial infection was suspected but all infectious studies, including induced sputums and a bronchoscopy, were negative.
Later imaging revealed bilateral basilar infiltrates more suggestive of a bacterial infection.
On [**1-16**] she began to have respiratory distress and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.
On [**1-18**] she again began to develop respiratory distress and was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Over the next several days, her wbc count began to rise and her CXR showed worsening bilateral infiltrates.
After multiple discussions with the patient and her family, given the refractoriness of her leukemia and her progressing respiratory distress, that the goals of care should be shifted towards comfort measures.
