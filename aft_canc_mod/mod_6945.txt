She then re-presented with pain in her sternum and a bone scan at that time showed spread to the sternal bones.
-GERD -History of endometrial hyperplasia status post biopsy in [**2098**] for postmenopausal bleeding -Status post cholecystectomy .
Past Medical History: HTN GERD Onc history: PER OMR History of metastatic breast cancer originally diagnosed in her early 30s when she palpated a left-sided lump.
She then represented with pain in her sternum and a bone scan at that time showed spread to the sternal bones.
CT of chest and abdomen show pleural thickening on the left, stable left pleural effusion, bilateral lung nodules, as well as several liver lesions and involvement of many vertebral bones and the right SI joint with metastatic foci.
No new pulmonary nodules are identified.
Moderate amount of pleural effusion.
The pancreas, spleen, adrenals, kidneys are unchanged, with multiple likely simple cysts in both kidneys.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
No free fluid present in the pelvis.
There is no evidence for obstruction.
BONE WINDOWS:  The osseous structures are grossly unchanged with innumerable bony metastases throughout the skeleton.
Family History: per OMR: Mother is alive with acid reflux and hypertension at 80.
Father died in his 70s of complications of end-stage liver disease from hepatitis C.  She had one brother who died at age 24 of complications of kidney transplant.

No ecchymoses.
Pertinent Results: UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Relatively stable x-ray again demonstrating left pleural effusion with left base opacity, likely atelectasis.
An underlying consolidation from pneumonia is difficult to entirely exclude but is less likely.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Single focus of hypoattenuation in the left superior frontal cortex of the superior frontal lobe as described above corresponds to the metastatic lesion noted on the MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2105-4-24**].
Direction comparison size is not possible due to technique related differences.
No other metastatic lesions are evident on CT.
No other intracranial pathology to explain patient's dizziness.
RENAL U.S.	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to suboptimal visualization of the renal parenchyma most significantly affecting the right side.
Within limitation, no hydronephrosis or obstructive renal calculi evident.
Diffusely infiltrated liver, with innumerable hepatic metastases, causing architectural distortion.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2107-12-4**]: IMPRESSION: Diffuse osseous metastatic disease, without pathologic compression or epidural disease.
No cord compression or significant compromise of the thecal sac.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2107-12-5**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast, which was not administered due to patient's renal failure.
Interval development of multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT	Study Date of [**2107-12-5**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Again there are low lung volumes with an area of increased opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
EEG	Study Date of [**2107-12-7**]: IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganization and slowing of the background and bursts of generalized slowing, along with bilateral independent sharp waves.
The first two abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
The sharp waves (more in the right central region than in the left temporal) indicate areas of cortical hypersynchrony and were occasionally rhythmic for a few seconds, but they did not include simple spike or sharp and slow wave complexes or definite electrographic seizures.
The sharp features suggest a risk for seizures but not any ongoing seizures at the time of the recording.
Appeared intravscularly depleted on exam, but did not demonstrate robust improvement in creatinine with fluid boluses.
There was no hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
Originally thought to be secondary to renal failure, but bowel and bladder incontinence were concerning for cord lesion.
Head CT showed no concerning changes.
However, MRI showed interval development of multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease.
The patient began XRT on [**12-6**], and is rec'ing second dose on day of discharge to floor ([**12-7**]).
# Infection: BETA STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP B (pan sensitive) grew from Port-a-cath culture.
If become positive, will need tohave line removed...  # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol and is likely steroid and infection induced.
FLOOR COURSE:   1) Metastatic breast CA: Patient with known metastatic disease to subcutaneous tissue, thyroid, lymph nodes, skin, pleura, bone, liver, and possibly the central nervous system.
3) Weakness/Confusion: Originally thought to be secondary to renal failure, but did not improve with hydration and HD.
MRI showed interval development of multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease.
4) Bacteremia and fungemia: BETA STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP B (pan-sensitive) grew from Port-a-cath culture performed in the ED.
5) Dry mouth and mouth pain: Patient reporting very dry mouth and mouth pain during floor course.
Likely some component of thrush contributing.
She was then covered by IV fluconazole indicated for her fungemia.
She received symptomatic relief with viscous lidocaine via swab to mouth.
6) Neutropenia: Likely due to marrow suppression from Taxol.
7) Anxiety: Patient reported one episode of anxiety on morning following transfer to the floor.
Oxycodone 20 mg/mL (1 mL) Concentrate Sig: 5-10 mg PO q2 hours as needed for pain: Sublingual.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 2646**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute renal failure Altered mental status Hepatic encephalopathy Multiple brain metastases Metastatic breast cancer Candidemia Group B strep bacteremia Neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Comfort measures only.
