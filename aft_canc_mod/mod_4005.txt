One month ago, he developed fever and cough at home.
An outpatient CT scan showed prominence in the head of the pancreas with thickening of the gastric wall and multiple liver lesions concerning for possible abscess.
He was started initially on metronidazole and Levaquin for possibility of hepatic abscess.
He underwent FNA of the liver lesion that revealed definite tumor cells.
Further typing was not possible given a high degree of necrotic material in the biopsy specimen.
Tumor markers showed unremarkable AFP, CEA, and a marginally elevated CA [**47**]-9.
Finding were discussed with oncologist who felt that multiple liver lesions and negative AFP made liver primary less likely.
The patient then underwent CT of the head and chest that showed no definitive primary tumor.
MRCP was done that showed no e/o pancreatic mass or ductal dilatation.
EGD was done that showed friable tissue in the stomach but no e/o carcinoma; biopsies were taken that were negative for malignancy.
Per d/c summary "consideration at presentation was given to hepatic abscess...there was no aspirate consistent with pus...[pathologist] confirmed that biopsy was negative for abscess."
Currently, patient endorses mild abdominal pain radiating around back that is unchanged from prior.
He also has mild nausea.
He denies bloody or melanotic stools.
He had a couple of episodes of vomiting at OSH that were non-bilous and non-bloody.
He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, lightheadedness or dizziness.
