Pullback cholangiogram demonstrates biliary leak at the posterior and inferior aspect of the right hepatic lobe with extravasation of contrast into the abdominal cavity.
There is no communication with vascular structures.
An ultrasound of the abdomen is recommended in order to determine if there is any abdominal collections in the right upper quadrant.
Previously described heterogeneous hepatic intraparenchymal lesions demonstrate hyperdense material within and it is difficult to tell whether this represents bleeding or recent contrast administration.
Poor evaluation of pancreatic head mass extending into portahepatus and portal vein thrombosis without IV contrast.
Increased size of small right pleural effusion.
Cholangiogram via existing catheter demonstrates decompressed intrahepatic ducts and good drainage of contrast through the catheter into the duodenum.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 F with Metastatic pancreatic cancer - with a complicated hospital ourse -  1.
Blood loss anemia - due to hemoperitoneum as a complication of the procedur (PTC) - after transfusion, hepatic artery branches were embolised with stoppage of bleeding.
Obstructive jaundice, s/p biliary drain placed by IR.
Cholangigram showed a bile leak.
Leucocytosis  - likely due to 3. above.
No other source of infection found.
Hypertension - po meds as below.
Metastatic pancreatic cancer - deemed inoperable by surgery.
The patient did not wish any further treatment for cancer and her goal was to go home with her family.
