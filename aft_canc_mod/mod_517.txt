Per the patient's wife, over the last week he has developed progressive abdominal distention and discomfort.
The pain is diffuse across his abdomen.
He denies nausea or vomiting.
He has also had progressive SOB over the same period of time.
He has been using his nebulizer up to every 2 hours with minimal relief.
A chest X-ray showed RUL infiltrate  consistent with pneumonia.
He developed new onset a fib and was started on diltiazem for rate control.
CT abdomen was performed and showed new ascites and worsening of his liver and omental mets.
They did not see signs of obstruction, felt that he had likely ileus from progressive metastatic disease and is not a surgical candidate.
He continues to have some abdominal discomfort with exam.
He denies chest pain, fever, cough, nausea or vomiting.
Past Medical History: 1) CAD s/p MI in [**2140**] by EKG diagnosis, no admission, no symptoms, ETT/MIBI [**2159**] showing partially reversible defect in RCA distribution.
No interventions performed.
2) HTN 3) Hyperlipidemia 4) COPD 5) DJD 6) Thoracic artery aneursym, stable 7) Nonsmall cell lung cancer (see below)  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 14194**] was in his USOH until [**2163-7-25**] when he presented with hemoptysis and weight loss of 10 pounds over previous 1-2 months.
He had a CT scan of the chest on [**8-21**] and it showed a 4.1 x 4.0 right hilar mass with subcarinal lymphadenopathy, 19 mm right axillary lymph node as well as multiple right lower lobe and left lower lobe nodules concerning for lung cancer.
On [**2163-8-28**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 771**] with chest pain and ruled out for a non-ST elevation MI.
He was seen by the hematology-oncology consult service while in the hospital and underwent FNA of the right axillary lymph node, the pathology of which showed nonsmall cell cancer, squamous cell type.
He was discharged on the third of [**Month (only) 359**] and then on [**2163-8-30**], he had a bronchoscopy done for evaluation of his hemoptysis as well as bronchial biopsy and the cytology confirmed metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Mother died of breast cancer complications at age 53.
Sister had breast cancer and lung cancer and died at age 80  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.2, BP 122/70, HR 97, RR 24, O2sat 93% on 4LNC, Wt 140 lbs, Height 62" GEN: Wearing NC, breathing with pursed lips on expiration.
NECK: Thin, suppple, no lymphadenopathy PULM: Diffusely decreased breath sounds and air movement.
No crackles or wheezes.
CARD: RR, nl S1, Sl S2, II/VI systolic murmur RUSB ABD: BS+, soft, NT, ND EXT: Clubbing of fingernails on hands bilaterally, no LE edema SKIN: No rashes NEURO: Oriented x 3, non-focal exam PSYCH: Patient upbeat with joking manner   Pertinent Results: [**2164-2-19**] CT abdomen Worsened metastatic disease with innumerable hepatic metastases,  enlarging and new implants adjacent to the stomach and spleen in the omentum and new ascites and omental deposits.
Progression of abdominal metastatic disease, partly visualized and better characterized on a CT from the prior day.
Right hilar mass with a similar degree of narrowing of segmental pulmonary arteries, but exerting greater mass effect on descending airways serving the right lower lobe, some of which are now occluded.
Patchy new peribronchovascular consolidation in the right lower lobe, most suspicious for post-obstructive pneumonia.
The appearance may reflect fluid overload or lymphatic congestion, but the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis on the right should also be considered.
If clinically indicated, it could be advanced to gain better purchase in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 81y/o M with metastatic non-small cell lung  cancer on chemotherapy with Alimta last given on [**1-31**] who presents with abdominal pain and SOB.
Shortness of breath:  This was likely multifactorial, with contributions from COPD, extensive lung cancer disease burden, possible post-obstructive pneumonia, and increased abdominal girth.
CTA chest negative for PE but showed tumor invasion of bronchi and pulmonary artery.
He underwent two 2-L paracenteses with some improvement in shortness of breath.
Several days into his hospital course he developed episodes of chest pain and increased shortness of breath without EKG changes, responsive to nitroglycerin and morphine.
These were thought to represent unstable angina with a possible contribution from aspiration events.
Morphine was given to help with shortness of breath and nitroglycerin as needed for comfort.
Abdominal distention: Found to have new ascites in setting of worsening metastatic disease to liver and omentum.
Also found to have ileus in setting of this and combination of these is likely contributing to his worsening discomfort.
After goals of care were revised, labs were no longer checked.
Non-small cell lung cancer: Widely metastatic with worsening disease despite Alimta.
Combivent MDI, every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Nitroglycerin SL as needed as needed for chest pain.
Prochlorperazine 10 mg every eight hours as needed for nausea.
