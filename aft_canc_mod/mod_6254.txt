Admission Date: [**2147-2-3**]        Discharge Date: [**2147-2-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-2-3**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB   Baby girl [**Known lastname **] is a newborn 33 and 5/7th week gestation infant, admitted to the NICU with prematurity and respiratory distress.
This pregnancy was complicated by diagnosis of large uterine fibroids at approximately 18 weeks.
The pregnancy was otherwise uneventful until [**2-2**], when the mother presented at [**Name (NI) **] Hospital with vaginal bleeding and preterm contractions.
She was treated with betamethasone which she completed the morning of delivery and magnesium, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] due to persistent bleeding.
At [**Hospital1 1444**] she was found to have ongoing bleeding although no contractions were noted and cervix was closed.
It was uncertain whether the bleeding was secondary to an abruption or fibroids, but due to the continued concerns the mother was taken for a [**Name (NI) 32007**] delivery.
No maternal fever was noted.
No sepsis risk factors were identified.
C-section was performed under general anesthesia due to concerns for possible postpartum hemorrhage.
The infant emerged with diminished tone and respiratory effort requiring vigorous stimulation and positive pressure ventilation before onset of regular respirations was noted.
The infant was admitted to the NICU with blow- by oxygen for further evaluation and management of prematurity and respiratory distress.
No masses, no lesions.
No masses palpated.
Respiratory:  Baby girl [**Known lastname **] initially had poor respiratory effort requiring vigorous stimulation and positive pressure ventilation for approximately 30 seconds.
Since, she has been on room air with no respiratory distress and comfortable respiratory effort.
She does continue to have occasional desaturations which are mild and infrequent.
She, on exam, has no appreciable murmur.
She did have an initial glucose 28, which was treated with a D10 bolus.
She has not had any spits and minimal aspirates.
Her phototherapy was discontinued on day of life #6 and a rebound bili remains pending.
Neurologic:  She has had no concerning issues neurologically.
#13 DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Will be transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital for further management of prematurity and fluid and nutrition issues that are consistent with her gestational age and clinical course.
3) Chronic lung disease.
4) Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age (and for the first 24 months of the child's life), immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Mild physiologic hyperbilirubinemia.
Fluids and nutritional issues consistent with     gestational age and clinical course.
Mild apnea and bradycardia with occasional     desaturations.
