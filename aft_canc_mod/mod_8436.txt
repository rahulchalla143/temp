Admission Date:  [**2189-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-7-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-2-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: A.C.E Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Pericardiocentesis - Pericardial drain placement - Pleurodesis   History of Present Illness: 68 year old male with lung cancer with malignant effusions s/p 4 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin who presents with worsening SOB over the past 5 days.
His wife noticed that he was more SOB and had difficulty walking between rooms and called an ambulance.
Of note, he had a malignant pleural effusion on that was tapped (Took out 2200 ml of fluid) in [**5-22**] and helped resolve his sx of SOB.
Of note, he had a recent CT scan of the chest that showed a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
CXR showed recurrent pleural effusion.
He was quickly taken to echo, and per report from attg ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), it appeared he had evidence of tamponade.
Past Medical History: Non-small-cell lung cancer s/p 4 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Chronic kidney disease, bl creat 1.5 Anemia Cataracts   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has an approximately 15-pack-year tobacco history, having quit smoking 30 years ago.
Family History: Anemia and diabetes mellitus in his father and diabetes in his mother.
Physical Exam: On discharge: 97.5  95  145/77  20  99%ra GENL: WD, WN, NAD Neuro: A&O x3, mae CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: decreased BS on R, clear on L anteriorly Abd: soft, nt, nd, +Bs Ext: no edema, 2+ pedal pulses   Pertinent Results: CXR [**6-26**]: The lobulated mass lesion in the lateral right upper lobe is again identified and stable relative to the CT dated [**2189-6-23**].
Again noted is a very large unilateral right pleural effusion.
The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and globular particularly on lateral view consistent with underlying pericardial effusion.
No pneumothorax is evident.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is right atrial collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-6-30**] 6:25 PM  IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
No acute infarction.
1.5-mm aneurysm at the origin of right anterior choroidal artery.
Bilateral mild maxillary sinusitis, right more than left.
Sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease in bilateral cerebral white matter.
DIAGNOSIS: Pericardium, excision: Adenosquamous carcinoma involving pericardium.
Morphologically, the tumor is compatible with a lung carcinoma in the appropriate clinical setting.

Pericardial effusion: Patient was admitted with SOB and found to have a large pericardial effusion.
Clinically he was hemodynamically stable, however echo showed RV collapse and cath showed equalization of diastolic pressures suggestive of tamponade physiology.
While in the cath lab a pericardiocentesis was performed with drainage of 450cc of serosanguinous fluid.
A repeat ECHO was done at that time which showed resolution of his effusion.
It was felt that his SOB was more likely secondary to his pleural effusion than his pericardial effusion as his symptoms did not improve significantly following pericardiocentesis, however he did not have an oxygen requirement.
Given he was symptomatic, a decision was made among his oncologists, thoracics and cardiology to perform pleurodesis in addition to pericardial window.
Following pleurodesis the patient developed acute neurologic changes (#4).
was seen by the medicine team and admitted for management of pericardial effusion.
The thoracic surgery team was consulted on HD 3 for management of a recurrant right sided pleural effusion.
was noted to have unequal pupils and stopped following commands - that he'd been inconsistently following earlier.
The CT showed no evidence of bleed or mass effect.
The MRI/MRA showed some evidence of small vessel disease but no abnormalities consistent with the pt.
The neurology team evaluated the patient in the morning and per the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**], it was felt the patient's neuro defecits as they were the prior evening were related to his recent surgery and resulting transient metabolic changes.
