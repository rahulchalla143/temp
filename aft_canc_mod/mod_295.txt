However, pneumonia cannot entirely be excluded.
Renal US [**2-7**]: Bilateral moderate hydronephrosis unchanged from prior study.
Within this limitation, no acute hemorrhage, large vascular territory infarction, or large mass seen.
Right Sylvian fissure hypodensity which may be volume averaging; however, MRI is more sensitive for the detection of small metastases or acute ischemia.
Probable chronic sinus disease.
Progressive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with vaguely defined soft tissue densities and surrounding fat stranding, accounting for obstruction of each ureter.
The appearance is most suggestive of retroperitoneal fibrosis associated with malignant lymphadenopathy and infiltration.
Mostly stable appearance of bony metastatic disease noting interval compression fractures apparently treated before with vertebroplasty.
New pleural effusions with a small amount of ascites and anasarca, a state of diffuse edema.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Findings consistent with congestive heart failure including cardiomegaly, moderate dependent bilateral pleural effusions and peribronchovascular and peripheral septal interstitial thickening.
5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule partly obscured by the left pleural effusion but appears new from [**2134-2-4**].
Three-month chest CT followup is recommended after diuresis to distinguish nodular atelectasis from a true lung nodule.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
Underlying mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema.
Numerous sclerotic lesions of the thoracic skeleton compatible with known metastatic prostate cancer.
A large subcarinal lymph node and other mediastinal nodes at the upper limits of normal in size may be related to congestive failure.
These can be reassessed at the time of pulmonary nodule followup.
CXR ([**2-19**]): There is dense retrocardiac opacity with moderate left effusion and patchy alveolar infiltrates in the right lower lung and left mid lung.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male with pmh of sCHF (EF 45%), DM, metastatic prostate cancer, htn, urinary incontinence s/p artificial sphincter, and chronic back pain s/p multiple surgeries presents with dsypnea and found to have post-obstructive ARF which improved following nephrostomy tube placement, complicated by acute LE DVT, GNR bactermia, and HAP.
# Acute renal failure: Patient presented to the ED with many symptoms consistent with uremia, and renal US showed b/l hydronephrosis consistent with post-renal obstruction.
He was hyperkalemic on presentation and treated in the ED.
On HD #2, he became oliguric and hyperkalemic, and CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast demonstrated retroperitoneal LA and metastatic retroperitoneal fibrosis.
The right tube began putting out ample urine, while the left tube was found to put out scant, bloody urine.
# GNR bacteremia: The patient was found mid-way through his hospital course to have GNR in his urine from the left nephrostomy tube and in also in his blood.
Likely he developed infection in his left kidney due to obstruction which caused the bacteremia.
He was initially covered with vanc/zosyn, which was switched to Cipro following GNR speciation (E. coli) with pan-sensitivity (this was changed back to vanc/zosyn after the development of a HAP).
# Left LE acute DVT:  The patient had swelling of his left LE and was found to have an acute peroneal DVT.
Anticoagulation was deferred given the prcedures necessary to relieve his renal obstruction and also a previous history of difficult to control INR when on coumadin in the past.
# Hospital-acquired PNA: The patient developed low-grade fever for which a CXR demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia on [**2-19**].
He remained asymptomatic with no bump in his WBC count.
He was started on Vanc/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia and Gram-negative coverage, given his hx of GNR bacteremia.
The pt remained afebrile following broad antibiotic coverage.
# Dyspnea:  Patient originally presented with worsening dyspnea.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to multiple factors including anemia, acute on chronic heart failure, and volume overload.
Dyspnea improved following diuresis, but pt experienced an acute decompensation on HD #8, during which time he was presumed to be in flash pulmonary edema, given large IVF replacement with his post-obstructive diuresis, or PE, given his known acute thrombus despite IVC filter placement.
He was placed on 15L O2 via face mask, CXR demonstrated some perihilar fullness as well as small L pleural effusion, and EKG demonstrated no acute changes.
Unremarkable CTA ruled out PE, and he was presumed to be volume overloaded with pulmonary edema.
# Anemia: Patient with a Hct of 23.9 on admission, baseline Hct ranges 26-30, likely due to decreased production given metastatic prostate cancer.
There was no clinical evidence of bleeding except from the left nephrostomy tube.
Likely secondary to uremia due to his acute renal failure.
Also hyperkalemic, treated with kayexalate, and hyponatremic, likely secondary to volume overload.
# Altered mental status:  Patient was very sleepy and somewhat confused during hospitalization, likely due to combination of factors: uremia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemic episodes, and increased serum concentrations of home benzos and pain meds given compromised renal function.
Head CT demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage or large mass, but did indicate small hypodensity at Sylvian fissure, and met could not be completely ruled out.
Hypoglycemic episodes were minimized and drugs renally-dosed to minimize iatrogenic contributions.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (non-ischemic): Patient with an EF of 45% on his last TTE and a BNP on admission of > 70,000.
He experienced an acute decompensation as described above.
# Multi-focal atrial tachycardia: Over course of hospitalization, pt developed persistent tachycardia that, on EKG, demonstrated evidence of MAT vs. PACs.
He endorsed some SOB during tachycardic episodes, and episodes responded well to 5 mg IV lopressor pushes.
Additionally, metoprolol regimen was increased to 100 mg TID from 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], to which the pt responded well with decreased episodes of tachycardia.
# DM: Patient is on insulin as an outpatient, however given his hypoglycemic episode in the ED, his decreased PO intake due to his anorexia, and his impaired renal function, his lantus and sliding scale were diminished.
Upon improving kidney function, patient developed hyperglycemia during which time his insulin was titrated back up towards his home dose.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# Chronic back pain s/p multiple surgeries:  Patient complains of back pain currently.
Given his altered mental status and ARF on admission, his home pain regimen was decreased his chronic home opiod regimen: morphine SR 60 mg tid (was on 100 mg tid) and oxycodone 30 mg po q4h prn (was on 60 mg q4h prn).
Uptitrated his regimen back to his home regimen once his renal failure improved.
# Pulmonary nodule: The patient was seen on CTA to have a 5 mm pulmonary nodule of unknown significance.
# Code: Full code, confirmed with the patient  Medications on Admission: Clonazepam 0.5 mg po tid prn anxiety Lasix 20 mg po daily Glucagon prn hypoglycemia Lantus 10 units qam Lispro Sliding scale Leuprolide q3 months lisinopril 20 mg po daily Lorazepam 0.5 - 1 mg qhs prn insomnia - is out of this medication now Metoprolol 100 mg po daily Morphine SR 100 mg po tid Oxycodone 60 mg po qid prn pain Pantoprazole 40 mg po daily ASA 81 mg daily Biscodyl 2 tab daily prn Colace 100 mg po daily senna 1 tab daily prn   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Acute renal failure secondary to obstruction from malignant peritoneal fibrosis -Deep venous thrombosis -E coli UTI and bacteremia -Hospital-acquired pneumonia -Acute on chronic systolic heart failure  Secondary: -Diabetes -Hypertension -Chronic back pain -Metastatic prostate cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital with acute renal failure due to obstruction of your ureters (the tubes that run from your kidneys to your bladder).
In order to relieve this obstruction, tubes were placed directly into both of your kidneys, and your acute renal failure has resolved following this procedure.
Also while you were in the hospital, you were noted to have a deep venous thrombosis, or blood clot, in a vein in your left calf.
A filter was placed in a large vein, called the inferior vena cava (IVC), to prevent the blood clot from dislodging and ending up in a place such as your lungs.
You also had a period of congestive heart failure with fluid on your lungs due to this rapid heart rate as well as fluid overload.
After starting this medication, your blood and urine have no shown any evidence of bacteria.
Finally, you were found on chest x-ray to have pneumonia in your left lung, for which we are treating you with two antibiotics given IV through your PICC line.
Please contact your doctor or return to the emergency department in the case of: chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, decreased urine output from your nephrostomy tubes, confusion or feeling "foggy", or any concerns you may have.
If you have questions or problems, please page the Interventional Radiologist on call anytime at pager [**Numeric Identifier 5603**].
