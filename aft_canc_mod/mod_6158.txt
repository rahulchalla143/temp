There is no free pelvic fluid.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images generated on an independent workstation were valuable in assessment for source of infection or bleeding.

New 7-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Cardiomegaly with enlarged right atrium and dilated IVC and hepatic veins, which can be seen in right-sided heart failure.
Upon arrival he developed respiratory distress in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and IVF administration in the ED, likely causing fluid overload in a patient with tenuous respiratory status at baseline, h/o COPD and on home O2, with recent PE.
He was diuresed with IV Lasix and showed improvement, O2 requirement decreased from 6LNC to 4LNC.
Chest X ray showed bibasilar opacities and air-space opacities consistent with atelectasis vs pneumonia.
He had a sputum which only showed mixed respiratory flora.
The patient was subtherapeutic on his coumadin so a heparin bridge was briefly initiated until he became therapeutic.
As he was not on oxygen prior to [**Month (only) 958**], it was thought that he was in acute heart failure with poor baseline reserve from his COPD, so he was aggressively diuresed with lasix.
He remained 2 L negative per day for 5 days with only mild improvement in his oxygen requirement (low 80s on RA - 94% 4L).
Chest Ct was obtained and showed bilateral pleural effusions, stable severe emphasema, cardiomegally, and a new 7 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
It was thought that his continued hypoxia was from acute CHF with a component of recent pulmonary events.
He had a positive blood culture at the rehab center and had his PICC line removed (per report the tip was cultured and showed no growth).
His first set of blood cultures obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] was positive for Enterococcus, pan-sensitive.
Surveillance cultures remained negative until [**2185-5-16**] when they showed one culture positive for gram positive cocci.
A transthoracic and trans esophageal echocardiogram were performed and showed no vegetations.
His PICC line was not centrally located at discharge but after discussion with pharmacy and nursing it was concluded it could be still be used as a midline for Ampicillin administration.
Atrial fibrillation: The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Hypertension: The patient was started on Dogoxin, and diltiazem in addition to his home dose metoprolol as above for rate control.
He was not started on an ACE inhibitor depite his low ejection fraction because he was heavily diuresed with lasix and his SBP remained 90's-110's after he was re-started on his PO lasix dose.
He should discuss with his PCP the need to start an ACE inhibitor due to his low ejection fraction.
Acute systolic CHF: The patient had an ECHO with EF 35%, similar to prior a study on [**4-2**].
It was thought that in the setting of sepsis and IV fluid administration as well as a fib with RVR, the patient had decompensation of his CHF.
# Urinary retention:  The patient had a foley placed in the ICU when he was being resuscitated.
There was no evidence of transformation.
# Pulmonary nodule: Seen on CT scan of the chest.

Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you were having fevers at your rehab center.
You were found to have a blood infection with a bacteria called ENTEROCOCCUS.
You also had an MRI which showed that there is no evidence of cancer in your gut that could have caused this.
You also developed an episode of shortness of breath while you were in the hospital and had to be transferred to the ICU.
It was thought that your CHF and COPD were contributing to your chronic shortness of breath.
You also developed some urinary retention.
We have made an appointment for you with the Urologist as an outpatient if your symptoms persist.
