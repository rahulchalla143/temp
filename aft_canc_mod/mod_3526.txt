Patient tolerated procedure without intra-operative complications.
Overnight he again desaturated, developed abdominal pain and spiked a temperature.
A CT scan showed evidence of an anastomotic leak and free fluid in the abdomen.
It was found that he had an ischemic anastomosis that had leaked and lead to fecal peritonitis.
His pain was controlled with fentanyl and then switched to PCA once he was able to use it.
His bladder pressures had been running high, and his CVP became elevated on POD [**1-24**] from his second surgery.
