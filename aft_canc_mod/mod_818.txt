HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18685**] is a 67-year-old male noted to have a right kidney mass consistent with a renal cell carcinoma after presenting with microscopic hematuria.
By imaging, he was noted to have bilateral renal cysts as well as a 2nd lesion in the right kidney that was consistent with a Bosniak III cyst.
The patient was subsequently prepared for a right partial nephrectomy with the knowledge of a possible right total nephrectomy.
Of note, the patient's more recent past medical history included a recent gastrointestinal bleed from a hiatal hernia ulcer for which he was found to be H. pylori positive and a pulmonary embolus in the setting of the gastrointestinal bleed where he had an IVC filter placed.
Coronary artery disease, status post left anterior descending artery stent in [**2144**], cardiac catheterization in [**2149-3-21**], status post stent and PTCA again of the left anterior descending artery as well as PTCA of the obtuse marginal.
Ejection fraction was 58% with anterolateral and apical hypokinesis.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease with a FEV1 of 54% of predicted, FVC of 80% of predicted, and FEV1/FVC ratio of 67% of predicted.
Pulmonary embolus as noted above.
Hernia repair in [**2138**].
His allergies include a question of an allergy to one of the medications in his Prevpak.
His examination on admission shows an elderly Russian speaking male in no acute distress.
His lungs show some diffuse scattered mild expiratory wheezes.
His abdomen is soft and nontender with a well-healed vertical incisional scar consistent with is previously known hiatal hernia repair.
He has no costovertebral angle tenderness.
He has slight bilateral lower extremity edema with easily palpable pulses.
His postoperative pain management included an epidural which appeared to be working.
At the initial night in the Intensive Care Unit, due to a postoperative temperature of 102 and a decreased respiratory rate felt consistent with his residual anesthesia and epidural.
Overnight he did well with good pain control.
However, in the afternoon, he developed acute respiratory distress.
He was transferred back down to the Intensive Care Unit, where he was intubated with a question of an aspiration pneumonia versus lobar collapse versus pulmonary embolus.
That night he subsequently underwent a chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT scan which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus and no evidence of postoperative bleed.
He was status post bronchoscopy which was unrevealing showing no inflammation of the bronchial mucosa.
He also underwent a thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance for which 500 cc of a bloody effusion on the right was obtained.
He was ambulating without difficulty.
He was on room air without any recurrence of respiratory distress or wheeze on auscultation.
He was subsequently discharged to home after verifying that there is no evidence of any deep venous thrombosis for his lower extremity edema with a lower extremity noninvasive test on the date of discharge.
He will follow up with his primary care physician to further workup his preoperative and postoperative pulmonary issues.
