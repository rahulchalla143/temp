Admission Date:  [**2149-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-12-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-5-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**] Chief Complaint: nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonic stent placement   History of Present Illness: 55yo F with stage IV colon cancer with metastasis to liver and lung, on capecitabine/oxaplatin who presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with progressively worsening abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea on [**12-6**] concerning for large bowel obstruction, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for colonic stent placement.
Patient had an NG tube placed on admission with feculent material retrieved.
A CT abdomen with contrast showed bowel obstruction secondary to lesion in rectum 20cm from anal verge, in addition to pneumatosis coli without free air.
Her abdomen remained soft with mild distension.
In addition, patient reports diarrhea which began 3 days prior to admission and increased in frequency over the past several days.
Outside hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which began on [**12-7**] (HD1).
Drop was attributed to dilution, as patient's baseline is high 20s (anemia of chronic disease based on outpatient lab studies).
Patient reports that she has nausea but no pain, and nausea is primarily due to NG tube.

Microbiology: C.difficile ([**2149-12-7**])- positive by PCR Imaging: EKG [**12-8**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature depolarizations.
Cannot exclude prior inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
KUB ([**2149-12-7**])- Massive large bowel dilatation with diameters of large bowel loops of up to 10 cm.
Thumb printing, a sign of bowel wall edema, is clearly present and indicates severe colitis.
Small colonic air-fluid levels on the lateral decubitus radiograph.
No safe evidence of free air.
No pathological calcifications.
As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive distention of colonic segments has minimally improved with regard to the ascending colon.
The transverse colon distention and left colonic loop distention, however, are virtually unchanged.
On the current image there is no evidence of free abdominal air or pathologic calcifications.
No air-fluid levels.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
KUB [**12-10**]: IMPRESSION: Distended colon with "thumb-printing" sign, concerning for colitis .
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Likely T4 rectal tumor 12 cm from the anal verge with tumor extending both anteriorly and posteriorly through the mesorectal fascia and into the peritoneal reflection.
Bilateral ovarian masses as described very concerning for metastatic disease with the right mass involving the ovary and on both sides of the mesorectal fascia.
Pedunculated lesion within the anterior surface of the uterus could reflect an atypical fibroid versus an additional metastasis.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas but there probably is ascites since bowel loops are clustered medially.
In the absence of cecal distention, there is unlikely to be distal colonic obstruction.
OSH: CT abdomen ([**2149-12-5**])- Since previous examination of [**2149-11-25**] there is now evidence of marked colonic obstruction.
There is now an associated calcification at the point of obstruction with the lumen more narrowed than on previous examination.
There is now noted to be pneumatosis coli probably secondary to this high grade obstruction on the right side of the colon.
The metastatic disease involving the liver, probably spleen and probably the left lung base nodule is stable over this interval.
Multiple pulmonary nodules.
No evidence of pneumonia or congestive failure.

difficile colitis: Per OSH records, CT abdomen showed signs of obstruction with transition point at area of adenocarcinoma.
Patient was C. difficile positive by PCR at OSH and had been started on IV flagyl prior to transfer as she was unable to take oral vancomycin.
An nasogastric tube was placed at OSH, and she continued to have non-bloody, bilious output from NG tube with no signs of acute abdomen on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
Given metastases, palliative surgical resection was considered, but the decision was made to treat the C. difficile infection and see if surgery could be avoided and colonic stent could placed given it being a lower risk procedure.
The patient was continued on treatment with IV Flagyl with improvement in abdominal pain and was able to take clear liquids and move her bowels.
Pt has baseline levels of abdominal pain [**2147-12-17**] similar to prior to admission.
Pt was converted to her home regimen of morphine SR 15mg [**Hospital1 **] with prn percocet which controlled her symptoms well prior to DC.
Pt was instructed that she may use colace and miralax for constipation (ok'd by GI).
There was some concern of GI bleeding prior to admission, that was likely due to colorectal cancer .
#Colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver and lung metastases/anemia/thrombocytopenia: Chemotherapy was held during hospitalization.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding plans for future chemotherapy.
Patient had stable anemia and thrombocytopenia during hospitalization which was felt to be due to chemotherapy.
Pt was not neutropenic during admission.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Patient was transiently in atrial fibrillation at OSH, but spontaneously converted, potentially responsive to 5mg IV lopressor.
There was low suspicion for pulmonary embolism as patient had been on heparin, and no lower extremity swelling or erythema.
A TTE was performed to evaluate baseline functioning which showed normal EF, mild symmetric LVH, borderline high PA systolic pressures.

Disp:*90 * Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 269**] Hospice [**Location (un) 270**] East  Discharge Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer Partial large bowel obstruction Malnutrition Clostridium difficile colitis  Secondary Diagnoses: Anemia Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized for a rectal mass causing partial obstruction of your colon.
You also had an infection of your colon called clostridium difficile.
You were also felt to have obstruction from your rectal mass and a colonic stent was placed by the gastroenterology team.
Since your colon was inflamed and the stent can only partially relieve an obstruction, it is very important that you keep to a diet of soft low residue foods to prevent pain, perforation, and recurrent obstruction.
It is very important that you call your doctor if you experience any fevers, chills, severe abdominal pain, or experience an inability to move your bowels or pass gas from below, or if you have severe nausea and vomiting.
