Admission Date:  [**2149-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-1-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-9-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6180**] Chief Complaint: admission for chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: chemoembolization transfusion of 3U of PRBC RIJ central line placement  History of Present Illness: 62 year-old man with morbid obesity, alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted for chemoembolization of his recently-diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a long history of alcoholic cirrhosis with a history of heavy consumption (>80 grs/day) of alcohol use over the past 40 years.
In [**2145**], he developed decompensation with evidence of encephalopathy, ascites and portal hypertension.
Over the subsequent 2 years, he had ongoing problems with advanced liver disease including admissions for encephalopathy, ascites, lower extremity edema, anemia and renal failure.
Recently he has had a decrease in his appetite and occasional nausea and vomiting.
An ultrasound in [**Month (only) 1096**] showed a large 13cm mass in the right lobe of the liver of 13 cm.
Biopsy of this mass was read as consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Given that he was not a surgical candidate with his cirrhosis and that he is not a transplant candidate, his options were extremely limited.
Post-procedure, patient report feeling slightly nauseous, but no vomitting, fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: -alcohol cirrhosis with encephalopathy and ascites, not a transplant candidate due to his morbid obesity -diverticulitis requiring hemicolectomy about 30 years ago -morbid obesity   Social History: Retired construction worker and singer.
Family History: no cancer  Physical Exam: PE on admission  Vital signs: temp 96.5, BP 112/palp, HR 54, RR 18, O2sat 98% on room air weight 156.8 kg Gen: middle-aged morbidly obese male in no acute distress HEENT: mucous membranes slightly dry, obese neck- difficult to assess veins, anicteric Heart: distant heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, unable to appreciate murmurs, gallops, or rubs Lungs: clear-to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly Abdomen: obese, nontender Extr: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in lower extremity.
warm, [**11-23**]+ distal pulses no groin hematoma Neuro: alert and oriented x3   Pertinent Results: [**2149-12-9**] WBC 5.9     Hgb 14.6       Plt Ct 207            MCV 98             Hct 42.7  PT 14.5       INR 1.3             PTT 34.3  UreaN 15        Glucose 121 Creat 1.0  ALT 98      TotBili 1.4    IndBili 0.8       Albumin 2.8 AST 397     DirBili 0.6    GGT 145 AlkPhos 184 Amylase 69  Ferritn 1322 AFP 7.0  EKG: NSR @82bpm, left axis deviation, normal intervals, flattened T waves in inferior leads.
CXR post procedure: clear  [**2150-1-1**] CT of ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION: 1) Large right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right groin and along the right flank.
2) High density material within the right lobe of the liver, opacifying mutliple tumor masses, consistent with chemoembolization performed on same date.
These findings are consistent with the patient's known history of hepatocellular carcinoma.
3) Persistent nephrograms within the kidneys, as well as excreted contrast within the renal collecting systems.
4) No bowel obstruction or perforation.
5) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
There was a high suspicion for retroperitoneal bleed given the patient's hypotension in relationship to the procedure.
An ABD/PELVIC CT was done which revealed a large right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right groin and along the right flank.
[**Date range (1) 28479**] During the patient's MICU stay, he developed acute renal failure with a creatinine increase from 1.1 to 2.0 as well as atrial fibrillation, both thought to be related to his hypovolemia and poor perfusion state [**12-24**] to his retroperitoneal bleed.
[**1-6**] A day after transfer, the patient developed a fever and was empirically started on levofloxacin.
The patient's respiratory status continued to worsen and he became hypotensive likely [**12-24**] to an overwhelming infection likely of intraabdominal origin from necrosis of liver post-procedure or pulmonary source due to his poor ventilatory status (body habitus and fluid overload).
His infection was treated with antibiotics and his pain was treated with IV morphine.
The patient expired on [**1-7**] from respiratory failure and PEA arrest.
Medications on Admission: propranolol 10mg PO BID furosemide 40mg PO once daily Aldactone 50mg PO once daily MVI folic acid vitamin B1 milk thistle ranitidine qpm  Discharge Medications: patient expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: respiratory failure [**12-24**] overwhelming sepsis alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy and ascites hepatocellular carcinoma morbid obesity s/p hemicolectomy   Discharge Condition: patient expired  Discharge Instructions: patient expired  Followup Instructions: patient expired
