He is status post two cycles of Decadron and thalidomide therapy, and one cycleof Decadron therapy alone, which had to be held for one month due to a perforated ulcer, on [**6-24**], during his second cycle.
His hospital course was c/b fluid leackage from his central line into the chest cavity and subsequent intubation.
Presented in hypertensive urgency in [**Month (only) 216**] with acute renal failure and progressive myeloma during admission pt received Cytoxan one gram per meter square and Decadron pulses.
Again presented in renal failure and was admitted to the hospital in [**Month (only) **] where he stem cell mobilization with high-dose Cytoxan.
This [**Date range (1) 66829**] admission for acute on chronic renal failure with SPEP demonstrating hypogammaglobulinemia but no monoclonal spike.
Renal biopsy with no evidence of cast nephropathy or amyloidosis.

No clubbing or cyanosis.
There is some apical vascular congestion, right-sided minimal layering pleural effusion is noted.The left-sided PICC line terminates over the normal course of the mid SVC.
No pneumothorax.
Mild CHF.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-9-26**] 9:59 AM The mediastinum is widened in the right paratracheal region without change from recent portable chest radiographs but wider when compared to an older study of [**2174-4-26**].
New subtle peribronchiolar opacities are present in the right upper lobe centrally, and there is also a questionable area of opacity in the right retrocardiac region.
These findings may be due to evolving pneumonia or aspiration.
Diffuse septal thickening, most consistent with a hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
Multifocal asymmetrical pattern of ground glass opacities and small foci of consolidation in the right middle and left lower lobes may be due to asymmetrical edema or superimposed infection.
Small pleural effusions, right greater than left, and a small pericardial effusion.
Diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2174-9-29**] 3:24 PM No evidence of DVT.
Partial resolution of left upper lobe ground glass opacities, but new multifocal areas of consolidation involving predominantly the right middle lobe, lingula and bilateral lower lobes.
This intermitently changing pattern and location of multifocal densities has a broad differential diagnosis, including atypical infection, eosinophilc lung, vasculitis, aspiration and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
Findings are not suspicious for neoplasia and are not typical for septic emboli.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions.
Persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions have been increased since previous exam being now of moderate degree.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-10-17**] 12:31 PM Mixed response of diffuse pulmonary abnormalities, with worsening consolidation and centrilobular opacities in the right middle and lower lobes, but interval improvement in the left lung.
Additionally, other superimposed process including aspiration and asymmetric pulmonary edema are also possible.
Anasarca and trace ascites as well as slight increase in right effusion, likely due to generalized fluid overload.
Increased pulmonary vascular congestion is identified.
Development of a substantial right-sided pleural effusion is identified with a smaller left- sided effusion also evident.
No definitive evidence of pneumonia is seen; however, there is basilar consolidation associated with the right-sided effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
CHF with increased pleural effusions, most significant on the right.
Small right-sided pleural effusion remains.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yr old male with kappa light chain myeloma diagnosed this [**Month (only) 116**] with multiple admissions for renal failure treated with thalidomide, prednisone, cytoxan presenting for autologous stem cell transplant with Melphalan, course complicated by renal failure, fevers and pulmonary edema.
Multiple myeloma- Presentation with acute renal failure which can be the presentation in 20-30% of patients.
Pt reports several fractures of bones in the past which could be related to osteolytic lesions present with increased osteoclastic activity associated with MM.
SPEP demonstrating hypogammaglobulinemia but no monoclonal spike.
Light chain with increased renal failure due to cast nephropathy, light chain deposition disease, Amyloid deposition, Fanconi's, but renal biopsy with no evidence of cast nephropathy or amyloidosis Did well on prednisone and thalidomide with some peripheral neuropathy.
Small amount of plasma cells lead to renal failure in pt.
Hydrated 200 cc/hr with bicarb when patient first presented given concern for nephrotoxicity on already damaged kidneys.
Lasix given sparingly as concern for further worsening renal failure, but diuresis necessary given pulmonary edema.
Course complicated by fever during time of engraftment [**9-23**].
Severe line pain, evidence of possible pulmonary infiltrate and continued worseing fluid overload with necessity of face mask for aid in breathing, also prolonged admission.
[**10-12**] Decreased Serum Kappa Light Chains compared to pre-transplant.
ID- Due to intense pain from left central line site, central line was pulled [**9-22**] with subsequent rigors, concerning for bacteremic, spread of infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on catheter.
[**9-23**] temp to 101.5, patient started on fluconazole, with evidence of thrush.
[**9-24**] patient neutropenic and febrile, with onset of shortness of breath during the night with desaturation to 87% on RA.
CXR with evidence of new peribronchiolar opacity in the right upper lobe and right retrocardiac opacity.
[**9-27**], low grade temps, sat's improving.
CT chest with ground glass opacities and septal thickening, focal consolidations, question PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**] etiology.
[**10-1**] bronchoscopy performed with evidence of slight erythema in right lower lobe without purulent secretions.
On [**10-13**] the patient developed a multifocal pulmonary process by CT, ?
Hypoxia- Sats to 85 % on RA over the course of 2 days after admission, CT chest performed [**9-28**] with evidence of fluid overload and infiltrate possible infectious etiology.
Considered ikely fluid overload in addition to infectious etiology possible [**Month/Year (2) 1065**], PCP.
Evidence of overload on CXR and clinically.
Hypoxia following BAL resolved with high dose steroids.
Chronic renal failure- Likely result of mulitiple myeloma nepthropathy as stated above.
Chronic renal failure with bouts of acute renal failure treated with pulse dose steroids and chemotherapy in the past.
Rasburicase given 6 mg given elevated uric acid to 13, which also led to slight decrease in creatinine.
Concerned for uric acid nephropathy, but no crystals evident on urine, bland sediment.
Acute renal failure as described above occurred in setting of prednisone taper raising suspicion for pulmonary-renal syndrome.
Pt was very sensitive to slight changes in his volume status with elevations in serum creatinine with only modest changes in fluid intake.
Had been admitted for hypertensive urgency in the past.
Lasix also improved BP as patient fluid overloaded during admission.
Pain- Several fractures and surgeries in the past, consider possible previous undiagnosed multiple myeloma, with lytic lesions.
Pain from line site as well.
Also severe pain post neupogen initiation as patient engrafted.
Pt was transitioned to IV dilaudid prn as pain improved.
Severe throat and esopageal pain though no severe mucositis as evidence on exam.
Esophageal pain improved with resolution of neutropenia.
At time of discharge pt required Fentanyl patch 75mcg q72hrs for relief of his chronic neck and back pain.
