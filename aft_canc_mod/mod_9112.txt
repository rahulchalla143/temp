ENCEPHALOPATHY:  Multiple possible explanations for encephalopathy were pursued; first of all for a question of dehydration the patient was given intravenous fluids.
The patient underwent an EEG which showed generalized slowing, however, no seizure activity.
The patient underwent an MRI of his head on [**9-17**], which showed no bleed and no significant swelling and an infectious etiology was also considered; however, chest x-ray, blood and urine cultures remained negative.
The patient's encephalopathy and gait disturbance seemed most likely consistent with irradiation somnolence syndrome, especially given his terminal status for his Boron neutron capture therapy.
As possible treatment for encephalopathy and gait disturbance, the patient was started on Sinemet.
His MRI on [**9-6**], and also on [**9-16**], did not show any findings that would be consistent with a GBM as the cause for the patient's symptoms of change in mental status and gait disturbance.
The patient complained of headache on [**9-23**] and a head CT scan was done which showed no intracranial hemorrhage and little change from prior MRI.
The patient also underwent an MRI of his spine on [**9-26**] to evaluate his lower extremity weakness and search for a possible metastases.
This MRI showed no evidence for marrow edema, pathologic compression or extrinsic cord compression.
The patient had continued lower extremity weakness throughout the rest of his admission and continues to require maximum assistance with all transfers.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM / ANTICOAGULATION:  The patient had been transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit after an event consistent with myocardial infarction by symptoms, however, in the Cardiac Care Unit the patient was sent for a CT angiogram of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism and multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli were found.
In the end, the patient was felt not to have had a myocardial infarction.
The patient was continued on heparin and then transitioned to warfarin for long-term anti-coagulation for pulmonary embolism.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had increased serum glucose while on dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day; this was treated with NPH insulin in the morning and at bed time and a Regular insulin sliding scale based on fingerstick glucoses four times a day at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and at bed time.
ANEMIA:  The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit from 37 to 30 while on heparin therapy.
Imaging was negative for a head bleed and for abdominal or retroperitoneal bleed.
No source of bleeding was found.
HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient also experienced a drop in platelets from 162 to 95.
SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
INTRAVENOUS ACCESS:  The patient had a right internal jugular central venous catheter that was removed on [**9-26**].
The patient will be transferred to the airport with a right midline intravenous in place as well as a peripheral intravenous.
Glioblastoma multiforme.
Change in mental status.
