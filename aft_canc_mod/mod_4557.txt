No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Additionally, there is mild ground-glass opacities as well as septal thickening suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
There are new bilateral pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe.
These findings are suspicious for metastatic disease.
Additionally, the degree of peribronchovascular thickening appears slightly out of proportion for mild pulmonary edema and lymphangitic spread must be excluded.
As a result, dedicated a chest CT is recommended after resolution of symptoms to assess the degree of metastatic disease.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
On subcostal supine and 45 degree head-up views, there is a <1 cm (in diastole) rim of pericardial fluid between the visceral pericardium/fat overlying the right ventricle and the diaphragm.
A larger rim of pericardial fluid (upto ~1.7 cm in diastole ) is seen apical to the apical right ventricular free wall.

# Goals of care discussion - After it was determined that the patient had signs of cardiac tamponade, family meetings were held with the patient, her husband, daughters, and palliative care.
# Cardiac tamponade - Pericardial effusion noted on CT, then tamponade confirmed with echocardiography.
Patient was never HD unstable - this finding prompted goals of care discussion as above given need of pericardiocentesis and then window if treatment desired.
Differential included chronic daily headache vs tension.
They recommended to try tizanidine 2mg TID prn headache for relief.
# GI bleed - The patient initially presented with dark stool - she had no hematochezia so GI felt this was less likely related to her radiation proctitis.
Chest pain, pleuritic: [**Month (only) 116**] have been related to pericardial effusion.
Cough/right pleural effusion: Likely due to new lung mets.
Culture returned positive for yeast as has priors - likely a colonization.
Stage IV cervical cancer - CT on admission showed new metastatic lesions in the lungs.
Hx benign pituitary adenoma s/p resection many years ago.

You came in because of chest heaviness and dark stools.
Unfortunately, a CAT scan of your chest showed new metastatic lesions from your cancer - it also showed fluid around your heart which was confirmed with an Echocardiogram.
