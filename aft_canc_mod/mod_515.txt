T98.2, Bp 151/78, HR 96   Past Medical History: 1) CAD s/p MI in [**2140**] by EKG diagnosis, no admission, no symptoms, ETT/MIBI [**2159**] showing partially reversible defect in RCA distribution.
No interventions performed.
2) HTN 3) Hyperlipidemia 4) COPD 5) DJD 6) Thoracic artery aneursym, stable 7) Nonsmall cell lung cancer (see below)  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 14194**] was in his USOH until [**2163-7-25**] when he presented with hemoptysis and weight loss of 10 pounds over previous 1-2 months.
He had a CT scan of the chest on [**8-21**] and it showed a 4.1 x 4.0 right hilar mass with subcarinal lymphadenopathy, 19 mm right axillary lymph node as well as multiple right lower lobe and left lower lobe nodules concerning for lung cancer.
On [**2163-8-28**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 771**] with chest pain and ruled out for a non-ST elevation MI.
He was seen by the hematology-oncology consult service while in the hospital and underwent FNA of the right axillary lymph node, the pathology of which showed nonsmall cell cancer, squamous cell type.
He was discharged on the third of [**Month (only) 359**] and then on [**2163-8-30**], he had a bronchoscopy done for evaluation of his hemoptysis as well as bronchial biopsy and the cytology confirmed metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.

No pulmonary embolism or secondary signs of embolism.
While the right hilar mass, multiple parenchymal lung masses, and thoracic lymphadenopthy have deacreased in size, intra-abdominal metastases, including hepatic metastases, have increased in size.
Emphysema with upper lobe predominant ground- glass opacity which may represent respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease.
Decreased right pleural effusion.
Known right hilar and right lower lobe masses re-demonstrated with persistent interstitial abnormality of the right lung concerning for possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
No evident new superimposed acute abnormality.
CXR [**2164-1-17**]: In comparison with the study of [**1-14**], there is persistent enlargement of the right hilum consistent with the mass seen on CT. Increasing opacification in the right upper lobe just above the minor fissure consistent with developing pneumonia.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o M w/ long smoking history, emphysema, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, CAD, who p/w respiratory distress from COPD flare.
#Respiratory distress: Secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Discussed with Heme/Onc to evaluate his leukocytosis and eosinophilia, which was thought likely [**12-26**] underlying cancer and unlikely related to tx with Alimta.
Captopril was discontinued (started during admission for elevated blood pressure).
# Urinary retention: Patient demonstrated urinary retention in ICU.
