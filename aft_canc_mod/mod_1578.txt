He denies any loss of bowel/bladder continence.
Has had significant diffulty maintaining appropriate glucose levels since starting on steroids.
Of note the patient has also developed a right axillary abscess over the past week.
A CXR showed no acute intrathoracic process.
Received home insulin and became slightly hypoglycemic.
Had a BP of 88 systolic and received 1L IVF with good response.
Got Vanc x1 for his abcess.
Somewhat hypotensive with BP ranging from 80-100 systolic.
Otherwise no acute complaints.
Otherwise denies any CP, palp, SOB, N/V/D, fever/chills, changes in bowel/bladder habits, weight loss, HA or vision changes.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY He [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] biopsy of a 1.84 mm thick primary melanoma without ulceration from his right mid back in 11/[**2114**].
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] sentinel lymph node biopsy without evidence of melanoma in his right axillary nodes.
He was well until [**12/2123**] when CXR revealed multiple new pulmonary nodules with CT confirmation.
He was referred to Interventional Pulmonary, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for bronchoscopic biopsy.
Brain MRI on [**2124-1-25**] revealed multiple brain mets and a PET/CT on [**2124-1-25**] revealed widespread metastatic disease, including a worrisome cervical spine lesion.
He was seen urgently by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] of orthopedics and felt not to be a surgical candidate.
He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] bronchoscopy and left adrenal biopsy on [**2124-1-26**] with the left subcarinal LN showing no malignant cells and the left adrenal bx c/w metastatic melanoma.
He had slow growth in the LLL lung lesion and [**Date Range 1834**] OR bronchoscopy on [**2126-2-11**] with for bronchoscopy, biopsy and debridement of tumor.
Pathology confirmed metastatic melanoma.
Pathology confirmed melanoma in the lung lesion, but margins were clear and 4 lymph nodes were negative for tumor.
C-spine MRI was performed in [**2126-5-12**] to evaluate LUE numbness (noted intermittently since rigid bronchoscopy on [**2126-2-11**]) with slight increase in size of C3-C4 mass, felt r/t inflammation from ipilimumab.
He subsequently developed progressive left shoulder, arm and neck pain and increased UE numbness, prompting ER evaluation on [**2126-8-14**].
C-spine MRI revealed slight increase in the C3-C4 mass and increased edema and he was started on prednisone.
His brain MRI and torso CT were stable without disease progression.
He was removed from the ipilimumab brain metastasis clinical trial due to symptoms and interval increase in the C3-C4 mass (although ipilimumab related inflammation rather than true disease progression was felt to be possible).
- [**8-22**] started on Temodar  Past Medical History: # Diabetes -- diagnosed in [**2113**] # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Vasectomy ([**2103**])   Social History: He is retired from the insurance industry and also taught computer at a private middle school on [**Location (un) 945**].

IMAGING / STUDIES: # CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2126-11-12**] at 5:30 PM): FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Likewise, the associated cord edema is unchanged, notably extending from C2 to C6 level.
At the level of the lesion, the spinal cord is expanded and there is unchanged severe spinal canal stenosis with loss of CSF signal.
There is no interval change with regard to multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes, most notably with moderate neural foraminal stenosis on the left at C4/C5 level and multilevel disc bulges at C3/C4, C5/C6, and C6-C7.
No evidence of new metastatic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of cervical intramedullary metastatic lesion with extensive cord edema.
# CTA ABDOMEN / PELVIS ([**2126-11-15**] at 5:23 PM): CT ABDOMEN: There is moderate subcutaneous emphysema along the right anterior chest wall, presumably post-procedural.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is multivessel coronary arterial disease.
Intra-abdominal visceral evaluation is highly limited on current examination due to significant streak artifacts.
However, allowing for such, there is no focal liver lesion.
Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber without wall thickening or obstruction.
There is no evidence of active intestinal hemorrhage on current examination.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis is present without diverticulitis.
Hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the infrarenal aorta.
There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
Subcentimeter external iliac and inguinal lymph nodes are stable.
A 3.7 x 2.0 cm mass in the right upper posterior chest wall soft tissues (3A, 12) is similar as compared to [**2126-8-19**].
BONE WINDOW: No focal concerning lesion.
No CT evidence of active lower GI bleed.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Likely post-procedural right anterior chest wall subcutaneous emphysema; correlation with any recent history of instrumentation is recommended.
As compared to the previous MRI from [**2126-11-14**] there has been no interval change in the size and morphology of intramedullary enhancing lesion at C3-C4 level.
Again noted is extensive cord edema surrounding the lesion extending from C2 to C6 levels.
No new metastatic lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in cervical intramedullary metastatic lesion with unchanged spinal cord edema.
# BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS ([**2126-11-28**] at 3:02 PM): FINDINGS: The common femoral, superficial femoral, and the popliteal as well as the deep veins of the calves on both sides show normal ultrasound appearance, compressibility and Doppler waveforms.
CONCLUSION: The ultrasound examination was negative for DVT in either lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course:  # Hypotension/hyperglycemia: FIRST ICU COURSE upon admission: The initial concern was for sepsis in the setting of an axillary abscess; patient's blood pressures responded well to fluids and he stabilized quickly.
In the ED patient's blood glucose was 500 so likely he was simply volume depleted secondary to osmotic diuresis in his hyperglycemic state.
He also had numerous electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatremia and hyperkalemia which were corrected prior to transfer to the floor.
SECOND ICU COURSE: Documented under GI bleed (See below).
THIRD ICU COURSE: On hospital day 10, patient developed hypotension and tachycardia in the setting of missing 2 doses of Unasyn due to loss of IV access.
He was intubated for airway protection, transfered back to the ICU and fluid resuscitated.
On his third ICU course, his hypotension was attributed to sepsis in the setting of Pseudomonas bacteremia, which was thought to be due to infection of the right axillary abscess with Pseudomonas (also isolated from culture of the axillary wound).
# Axillary abscess:  The patient developed an axillary abscess 1 week prior to admission which started spontaneously draining the day of admission.
After the patient's third admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the axillary abscess was noted to have grown Pseudomonas and Enterococci.
The source of the bleeding was presumed to be from a diverticular bleed.
Patient had a CTA of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of active lower GI bleed, but the presence of colonic diverticulosis.
On the floor, the patient had no further episodes of GI bleeding.
# RUE Weakness: Most likely due to the patient's C3-4 vertebral mass and related nerve impingment.
No other signs suggestive of cord compression.
Initially changed dexamethasone to hydrocortisone due to hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities but switched back to patient's original steroid dosing once he was stabilized.
Obtained MRI of c-spine and brain which did not show interval progression of metastatic disease, though the study was technically limited.
The patient right upper and lower extremity weakness improved through his hospital course while working with PT and OT.
# Acute kidney injury: Prior to hospitalization, patient had a baseline creatinine of 1.0.
Elevated creatinine was attributed to pre-renal status.
Per hematology/oncology recs, TPCH chemotherapy was held because of acute kidney injury.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient's finger stick blood glucose were checked with meals and prior to bedtime.
His evening Lantus dose was uptitrated several times, but he continued to have elevated fingersticks.
# Hypertension: Given the patient initial presentation of hypotension, his home Lisionpril was held during his hospitalization and discontinued at discharge.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient initially presented with thrombocytopenia thought to be due to chemotherapy.
He received platelets early during his admission to prevent GI bleeding with transfusion goal to keep platelets greater than 50.
# Elevated LDH: His LDH rose since his last admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His hematocrit remained stable as has his Tbili suggesting that the elevated LDH was not due to hemolysis.
Given the patient's Dexamethasone, it was possible that the rise in LDH may represent a PCP infection, though the patient denies shortness of breath, and he had been saturating well on room air.
LDH has also been used as a tumor marker for melanoma, so it is possible that the rise may present the patient's underlying metastatic disease.
# Hyponatremia: Patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hyponatremia thought to be due to poor oral intake.
Urine lytes were consistent with SIADH in the setting of his known metastatic melanoma.
Endocrine consult felt that an adrenal or thyroid etiology for his hyponatremia was unlikely, but that he will need a slow taper of his steroids given his prolonged high dose course.
He will need to follow up with Endocrinology soon after discharge for management of his steroid taper.
-- Slow steroid taper over several months per Endocrine recs.
