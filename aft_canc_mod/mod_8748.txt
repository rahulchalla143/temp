He was also seen by the stoma nurse who noted that he had some variceal veins at the edge of his stoma and that could be the cause of his bleed.
Obstructive Jaundice: Has had history of multiple cholangitis secondary to obstruction from his metastatic cancer.
Patient presented jaundiced but did not have any fevers, and no leukocytosis.
During the procedure, they performed a balloon sweep and found some hemobilia and pus in his ducts.
Given the hemobilia, it was thought that his bleed could have been secondary to that.
Metastatic colorectal cancer: Known end stage disease and he is currently DNR/DNI.
He also has some abdominal distension but we decided to hold off on the Lasix given his rise in Creatinine.
Acute Renal Failure: Patient's creatinine has been stable through most of his hospital course but on the day of discharge, it had bumped to 2.0.
