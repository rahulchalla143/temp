Admission Date:  [**2186-5-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-11-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis Chest tube placement by IP Intubation Radial atrial line placement  History of Present Illness: 40F w/ metastatic breast cancer (liver, lungs, pleural space, brain) who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-20**] with shortness of breath and increased LE edema.
Pateint reports she awoke on Saturday at 2-3am not feeling herself with increased SOB, orthopnea, and LE edema, associated with cough and mild chest pain with coughing but none at rest or with exertion.
Cough is rarely productive of white sputum and she has noted wheezing as well but no fever or chills.
Report symptoms dissimilar from previous episodes where she has had to have pericardial effusions drained.
She also had a head CT with brain mets and vasogenic edema (although improved) as below so decadron dosng was increased to [**Hospital1 **].
Currently, she reports that her breathing and edema are much improved although not yet back to her baseline.
Her chest pain has improved.
Has also had hoarse voice x 2 months.
Also reports right arm numbness related to an IV placed several months ago.
Metastatic breast cancer: Oncology History: Initially diagnosed in [**1-29**] when she found a breast mass in her left breast.
MRI completed in [**1-30**] showed increased size of her brain mets.
She was also diagnosed in [**1-30**] with a malignant pericardial effusion when she presented with tamponade, and was admitted to the CCU.
She again developed a pericardial effusion which was drained in the cath lab in [**3-30**].
She also developed a malignant pleural effusion which was drained.
H/o cigarettes one-half to one pack per day x 10 years, quite appx [**2173**].
There is a paternal grandmother who had colon cancer and maternal grandfather who might have had prostate or colon cancer.
The patient has no siblings.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.2 BP 129/82 P 124 R 24 98% 3L NC Gen: chronically ill appearing female, speaking in half sentences due to dyspnea but not in acute distress HEENT: MMM.
Cushingoid Neck: JVP difficult to appreciate but appeasr flat Lungs: Decreased breath sounds diffusely on the R ([**1-24**] way up)and at left base with dullness to percussion in these areas CV: tachycardic, regular, no murmur or rub Abd: soft, nt/nd, +bs Ext: 2+ BLE edema with cracking of skin on feet bilaterall, mild erythema Neuro: Right peripheral facial droop with decreased forehead wrinkling.
Mild 4+/5 RUE weakness.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion (?loculated).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-4-22**], no change.
If indicated, a cardiac MRI or CT may be better to assess for pericardial constriction/pericardial thickness.
Lung volumes remain very low, but allowing for this, cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged.
Known pleural and parenchymal metastases are not well visualized by radiographs, better demonstrated on recent CT of [**2186-4-19**].
New right lower lobe consolidative opacity consistent with pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions (increased on left) and persistent pericardial effusion.
No short interval change in widespread metastatic disease.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Slightly increased amount of vasogenic edema compared to prior MR, however, difficult to assess due to difference in techniques.
CRX [**6-9**] Mild pulmonary edema has worsened, left lower lobe is chronically collapsed, no appreciable right pleural effusion, pigtail pleural drain still in place, small left pleural effusion stable, heart size is normal.
Brief Hospital Course: In short, Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 40F w metastatic breast cancer and malignant pleural effusions, admitted with shortness of breath, transferred to the ICU in the setting of seizure and PEA arrest.
# Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: Dyspnea felt to be multifactorial and related to reaccumulation of large R sided pleural effusion, documented as malignant in [**2186-3-22**].
CT chest on admission showed increase pleural effusions with large loculated right effusion.
Her symptoms improved with this procedure as well as with diuresis prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was continued on Lasix 40mg PO BID for component of heart failure as well given association with lower extremity edema.
She required intubation with her PEA arrest advent.
She had a attempted extubation but quickly became too tachypneic and required reintubation.
She was diagnosed with a HAP MSSA PNA and was treated with a course of vanco and Zosyn initially and then continued on Zosyn.
Significant effort was made to diuresis the patient to improve her chance of extubation, but despite this she continued to fail repeat spontaneous breathing trials due to poor tidal volumes and tachypnea.
Despite aggressive and repeated treatment of pneumonia, pleural effusion, volume overload, daily wake-ups/SBTs the patient was unable to been weaned from the ventilator.
During her last week of the hospital stay, her weaning difficulty was further complicated by a decline in mental status which likely reflected a neurologic complication of the intra-cranial tumor (see below).
# Metastatic breast cancer: Patient has widely metastatic breast cancer including brain, liver, and pleural fluid mets with poor prognosis.
She was continued on home Decadron 8mg daily as well as Keppra and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
On night of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she had a witnessed seizure event followed by PEA arrest requiring <1 minute of CPR.
Then had agonal breaths requiring intubation (see above for resp course).
Five days prior to expiation she had a change in mental status and became less responsive.
There was concern that she had a progression of her brain mets or had a CVA.
# Facial droop: Pt reported a new facial droop and had facial weakness with peripheral Bell's palsy on exam.
He had expressed some paranoia and distress over the care of his wife.
During the final week of the [**Hospital **] hospital course, the patient's mental status appeared depressed, and we were concerned for a neurologic complication.
Given that the patient had intracranial tumor, the differential including bleeding into that area, edema, expansion, early herniation - to determine this, we attempted to perform a head CT scan but the husband refused for the reason that he felt it would not change her management.
He also began to refuse simple procedures such as a PICC line for access as the patient was running out of adequate access for medications.
On the day of the patient's death (see event below), it appeared that she had a neurologic catastrophe.
Thus, our suspicions that the patient had a complication related to the intra-cranial tumor at the beginning of the week were likely accurate.
Whatever process had evolved likely then lead to complete neurologic catastrophe on the final day of the hospital course likely reflective of brain herniation given the neurologic examination revealing fixed, dilated pupils with no corneal reflexes and no response to any stimuli (verbal, painful).
Events of expiration: 11:30 AM, pt's SBP dropped suddenly to 43.
Neuro exam showed mildly dilated and fixed pupils.
Pts husband was notified and no other heroic measures were indicated.
At 1340 pt had PEA arrest.
Pt has no heart beat or pulse.
Cause of death was metastatic breast cancer with immediate cause neurologic catastrophe likely secondary to complication of intracranial mass.
