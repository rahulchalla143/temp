Pt had been on azithromycin and prednisone taper for PNA and COPD exacerbation.
He then developed BRBPR and hypotension with an initial HCT in ED of 23.
Given history of endovascular repair concern for aorto-enteric fistula prompted a non-contrast CT which did not show a fistula, however did demonstrate an existing infrarenal AAA and a high density intraluminal material within right colon (?
Surgery did not feel there was an acute indication for surgerical intervention.

[**2110-3-5**] GI BLEEDING STUDY IMPRESSION: No GI bleeding noted in the 100 minutes of the study.
[**2110-3-6**] CT ABD& PELVIS CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural effusions and dependent atelectasis.
There are a few gallstones but no CT evidence of acute cholecystitis.
There is no free intraperitoneal gas or fluid.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and abdominal arteries.
Patient is status post endograft repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with graft material extending from below the takeoff of the renal arteries into both common iliac arteries.
There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.
High density material within the right colon may have been ingested but could represent intraluminal blood given patient history.
There are a few scattered colonic diverticula but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.
A left inguinal hernia contains fat.
Contusion of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the left flank, but no evidence of rib fracture or intra-abdominal injury.
High density intraluminal material within right colon may have been ingested but could represent blood given patient history.
[**3-10**] Colonscopy Edema and friability with contact bleeding were noted in the splenic flexure at ~45cm.
These findings are compatible with ischemic colitis.
Impression: Edema and friability in the splenic flexure at ~45cm compatible with ischemic colitis (biopsy) Additional notes: No obvious source of bleeding identified and no diverticuli seen.
Splenic flexure edema likely represents ischemic colitis.
No viral inclusions or tumor .
The mucosa could not be visualized due to the blood, and no active bleeding lesion could be identified.
The mucosa could not be visualized due to the blood, and no active bleeding lesion could be identified.

[**2110-3-15**] ABD US FINDINGS: Patient is status post endograft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and although evaluation is limited, there appears to be wall- to- wall flow within the aortic lumen without flow noted in the excluded thrombosed aneurysm.
No hydronephrosis or renal stone is identified.
Mild degenerative disease of the lumbar spine and hip joints bilaterally is incidentally noted.
These images demonstrate a small-medium sized duodenal diverticulum at the level of the third portion of the duodenum.
Evaluation of the terminal ileum demonstrates no focal abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of small bowel masses or irregularities.
Incidentally noted duodenal and jejunal diverticula.
Brief Hospital Course: # GI Bleed - Pt was admitted BRBPR and became hypotensive in the ED.
OG lavage was performed to rule out upper GI source and was negative.
The patient underwent EGD and colonscopy which were negative for source of bleeding.
He was found to have ischemic colities of splenic flexure however this was thought to be secondary to his bleed and hypotension, rather than the cause.
Given history of endovascular repair concern for aorto-enteric fistula prompted a non-contrast CT which did not show a fistula, however did demonstrate an existing infrarenal AAA and a high density intraluminal material within right colon.
Vascular surgery was consulted for question of aorto-enteric fistula.
The patient underwent capsule endoscopy to evaluate for bleeding of small bowel and was found to have active bleeding in distal small bowel.
Pt also had a negative adominal ultrasound.
Further evaluation for potential mass/diverticulum in small bowel was negative, including Meckel's scan and small bowel follow through.
His asprin was discontinued due to his risk of bleed with low platelet counts.
# Thrombocytopenia - Pt has history of thrombocytopenia over approx.
On admission, initially felt to be dilutional given large volume transfusions.
He was evalauted by hematology for thrombocytopenia, felt possible the patient has myelodysplastic syndrome as a cause for thrombocytopenia.
# Demand Ischemia - Pt presented with chest pain and elevated troponin in the setting of active GI bleed.
No significant ECG changes noted however the pt is v-paced.
His aspirin should be discontinued due to his history of thrombocytopenia and GI bleed.
# Diastolic CHF - Pt underwent TTE on [**3-12**] and was found to have significant diastolic dysfunction.
# CRI - baseline (2.4-2.8) Pt remained at his baseline .
# DM - The patient was maintained on SSI and NPH.
His home dose of NPH, 32U QAM and 5U QPM was decreased to 27U QAM and discontinued in the evening due to low fingersticks in the morning.
# COPD - The patient was recently treated for exacerbation and PNA.
# Hyperlipidemia - continue statin .
DuoNeb 0.5-2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Thrombocytopenia 3.
Demand Ischemia 4.
Diabetes Mellitus Secondary: 1.

Hypertension 3.
Coronary Artery Disease   Discharge Condition: Clinically improved, discharged to [**Hospital1 1501**].
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract and required multiple blood transfusion because of your large amount of bleeding.
Your EGD and colonscopy were negative for bleeding.
Your small bowel capsule endoscopy found bleeding from your small bowel but this was unable to be further localized by additional testing.
Your blood counts have been stable and there is no signs of continued bleeding.
You were also found to have a low platelet level.
Please return if you notice more bleeding in your stools.
You should also return or call your primary care physician if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath or fevers.
You should have a capsule endoscopy to evaluate your small bowel for evidence of bleeding.
Please follow up with Hematology as scheduled for further workup of your low platelet counts.
