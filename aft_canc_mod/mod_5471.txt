Admission Date:  [**2121-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-6-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-3-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: shock, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, STEMI, rhabdomyolysis, seizure.
History of Present Illness: 58M h/o meningioma w/ recent radiation therapy found unresponsive on bathroom floor by home health aide ~ 20:30, and had last been seen 8 hours prior.
CT head at OSH showed known tumor, otherwise no bleed.
Abd pelvis CT showed RLL infiltrate.
soft, NT, nd Ext: +2 b/l LE edema pitting.
Extra-axial hemorrhage adjacent to the right cerebellum in the patient's post-surgical site.
Additional focus of hyperdensity is seen in the right temporal lobe.
Hypodensity within the brain parenchyma at the surgical site may represent edema or encephalomalacic changes.
Technical baseline artifact.
Non-specific ST segment abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the infero-lateral, inferior and infero-septal segments.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
EEG Study Date of [**2121-6-4**] Abnormal portable EEG due to the focal slowing with some sharp features in the right frontal region and due to the slow background and bursts of generalized slowing.
The right frontal slowing suggests a focal subcortical dysfunction there.
Nevertheless, the higher voltages and sharper features could be due to the skull defect from earlier surgery, and there were no clearly epileptiform features.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-6-18**] 4:27 PM No new acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Minimal increase in ventricular size compared to the prior examination.
Upon admission to the MICU late on the night of [**2121-6-3**], pt was hypotensive (BPs=80s/60s) and unresponsive requiring ventilatory support.
The etiology of shock was felt likely secondary to seizure (given history of recent radiation therapy for meningioma at [**Hospital1 112**]), resulting in prolonged hypotension, which subsequently resulted in ARF (creatinine=1.6->5.2 ), STEMI (troponin peak=7.97), rhabdomyolysis (ck=96,400), and hypoxia (ABG=7.29/34/60) requiring ventilatory support.
Initial fluid support included bicarb in order to alkalinize the urine, however pt's urine output was minimal (<10cc/hr), resulting in progressive volume overload.
TTE showed poor LVEF=20% with global hypokenesis, akinesis of the infero-lateral/septal walls.
EKG showed ST elevation in II, II, V1, and V2.
Pt was treated with aspirin, b-blockade was deferred due to hypotension requiring 2 pressors.
Sepsis workup upon admission revealed consolidation in the RLL on CXR, GPC/GNR on sputum culture, concerning for aspiration pneumonia, and rising wbc count.
Given persistent hypotension, pt was also evaluated for adrenal insufficiency which revealed cortisol 18.6->20.0 after [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test.
A temporary hemodialysis catheter was therefore placed, with plan for dialysis on [**2121-6-6**].
Ventilator support was gradually weaned from AC to PS 5/5 with stable O2 sats, and plan was for extubation [**6-6**] or [**6-7**] after removal of some fluid with hemodialysis.
1) Resp failure   Respiratory failure improved on abx (see below) and after trial of PS, pt extubated [**2121-6-15**] on rounds and tolerated on 1 L face mask and then 4L NC.
2) Pneumonia   Initially had RLL infiltrate.
Pt treated with 10-day course and and then f/u CXR showed only mod bilat pleural effusions.
ID was consulted and felt that the acinetobacter did not need to be treated in the absence of symptoms, fever or WBC.
3) LUE paralysis   Non-contrast head CT ([**6-9**]) was negative for new process.
LUE does not move purposefully and has on occasion withdrawn from pain (proximal>distal).
4) ARF   ATN likely secondary to rhabdo, muscle breakdown.
Continued to be oliguric and HD performed almost daily.
Pt's fluid status remained overall positive but generalized edema significantly improved on transfer.
Felt that the patient may likely need cardiac catheterization following acute events here.
6) Seizure   It remained unclear if pt had a seizure.
Pt had no seizures during ICU stay.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
2.Rhabdomyolysis - secondary to being found down.
3.Acute Renal Failure now dependent on hemodialysis - likely secondary to Rhabdomyolysis.
5.Respiratory failure and PNA likely secondary to aspiration.
6.Paralysis - likely secondary to anoxic/ishcemic event when found down.
The patient has been steadily improving from a neurological perspective.
He moves his LLE at the hip and knee  and his RLE at the hip only.
While at the [**Hospital1 18**], there was evidence that you had a heart attack.
Will need wound care for decubitis ulcers.
