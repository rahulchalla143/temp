Admission Date:  [**2106-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2028-12-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Generalized Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 77 year old male with a history of CAD s/p MI in [**2090**] and recent CABG x 4 [**5-16**], cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma, PAF who was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2106-1-4**] after presenting with ocmplaints of generalized weakness.
The patient patient had been experiencing 1-2 months of pressive dyspnea and orthopnea in early [**2105**].
Ischemic ECG changes in the absence of typical anginal symptoms with nonspecific ST. Nuclear imaging only showed a small, fixed, moderate apical and distal septal defect.
He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revelaed 3VD, and subsequent CABG in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2105**] without complication.
Perioperative ECHO showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, and mild functional mitral stenosis from MAC.
The patient's post-operative course has been notable for conintuned progressive functional decline.
CT surgery follow up notes comment on continued persistent lower extremity edema and congestive heart failure symptoms with ongoing AF.
Additonally, he has demonstrated an overall picture of failure to thrive, with poor PO intake, and notable weight loss over the last 6 months.
He has had recent hospitalizations for acute on chronic renal failure as well as UTIs.
With progessive profound weakness, as well as pain in left knee and worseing erythema of chronic LLE ulcer, the patient presented to an OSH.
He was admitted for potential LE cellulitis as well as failure to thrive.
The patinet was found to have an enteroccocus UTI on admission, and was treated with a course of unasyn to cover both his urinary pathogen, as well as a potential LE cellulities.
Stool was sent for c.diff during the hospitalization, which returned positive.
The patient had several episodes of bleeding, including profound epistaxis requiring ENT packing, and a drop in his HCT from 30 to low 20s which aparently responded to several units of PRBCs.
In the setting of transfusing of multiple units of FFP, the patient developed respiratory failure believed to be due to acute pulmonary edema.

Large right and moderate left pleural effusion have probably increased in the right side allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened.
CXR Final Report HISTORY: CABG with increasing oxygen requirement.
The large right and moderate left pleural effusions persist with underlying compressive atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumothorax or vascular congestion.
Right PICC line remains in place and the extensive sternal wires remain aligned.
No definite focal pneumonia, though the area behind the heart cannot be properly evaluated on this single frontal view.
CT Head Final Report HISTORY: 77-year-old man with elevated INR and increased somnolence.
There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage, mass, or mass effect.
There are periventricular white matter hypodensities which are most likely attributed to chronic ischemic microvascular disease.
Also noted are focal hypodensities within the bilateral basal ganglia, most likely representing small lacunes.
There is diffuse parenchymal atrophy and ex vacuo dilatation of the ventricles.
Calcifications are noted involving the cavernous carotid arteries and bilateral vertebral arteries.
There is near- complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus which contains high density material.
Also noted is mucosal thickening and partial opacification of the bilateral ethmoid sinuses, most prominent in the right anterior ethmoid air cells.
No acute intracranial process.
The differential diagnosis includes blood products versus chronic fungal sinusitis.
Partial opacification of the bilateral ethmoid sinuses.
TTE The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regiona/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened with mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened with characteristic rheumatic deformity and minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-5-5**], mild aortic stenosis is now present and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure has increased.
Biventricular systolic function and the severity of mitral regurgitation are similar (mitral regurgitation was underestimated upon review of the prior study).
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-25**]:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion have increased substantially.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly has increased slightly and there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no edema.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 77M with a history of CAD s/p MI and recent CABG, dCHF with mod AR, CRI (Cr ~2.0) who presented to an OSH with failure to thrive, found to have a UTI, developed c.diff, unresolving coagulopathy requiring multiple transfusion, and acute pulmonary edema (sent to MICU), extubated transferred to the floor, then sent back to MICU for resp distress, worsening renal failure, finally made CMO and expired peacefully.
# Failure to thrive: pt has had chronic failure to thrive of unclear etiology since his CABG in early [**2105**].
ultimately, the pt was not tolerating POs, was placed on TPN, but was finally made CMO in the ICU given his continual decline with his coagulopathy, CHF, respiratory distress, and renal failure.
# Epistaxis - At [**Hospital1 18**], patient was seen by ENT who recommended leaving the OSH packing in place until [**11-23**] with epistaxis precautions in the meantime.
He was seen by heme/onc and outside results showed a likely acquired factor V inhibitor as the source for his coagulopathy.
He was continued on IV flagyl for his Cdiff and cefazolin as prophylaxis while he had nasal packing in place.
His nasal packing was removed by ENT without any bleeding complications.
# Coaguloapathy - INR of 5.6 at the OSH despite vit K and FFP.
Pt had a positive DILUTE [**Location (un) 39945**] VIPER VENOM TEST which suggests lupus anticoagulant and may interfere with the factor V inhibitor study.
The factor inhibitor may have been a sign of an underlying malignancy or perhaps exposure to bovine graft material during his CABG; however, all of these explanations are theoretical and there is no clear cause of why the pt had developed this inhibitor or even if he truly had it positive.
He did not suffer from any further bleeding diathesis other than his epistaxis mentioned above.
#  Diastolic CHF - Has had persisent LE edema and orthopnea since CABG surgery in [**Month (only) 116**], with escalating doses of lasix.
He required intermittent diuresis w/ IV lasix to improve his fluid overload and resp distress, while also balancing between his hypernatremia which was thought to be due to a lack of free water as well as his rising renal failure.
His home digoxin was held in the setting of renal failure.
#  Hypoxia:  Respiratory failure in the setting of high volume transfusions on [**1-15**].
Has bilateral R>L pleural effusions, likely due to fluid overload and poor nutritional status.
Low suspicion for pneumonia.
As mentioned above it was difficult to balance his pulm edema and pleural effusions given his renal failure and hypernatremia.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Had worsening of kidney function in setting of diuresis and acute disease.
Ultimately the pt decided to become CMO due to progression of renal failure and coagulopathy.
# C.Diff: C-diff positive at OSH, started on IV flagyl / PO vanc on [**1-11**].
The pt ultimately continued to have diarrhea in the setting of poor PO intake otherwise, so he was placed on PO vanco and initially had a flexiseal placed.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fribrillation: Was noted to be in Atrial Fibrillation throughout hospitalization, but adequately rate controlled with dilt and metoprolol.
# CAD:  had h/o CABG mentioned above.
no concern for ACS during admission.
# Patient was made DNR/DNI on [**1-21**] and then CMO on [**1-29**] due to rising renal failure, persistant coagulopathy, respiratory distress due to chronic CHF/fluid overload, and chronic cachexia.
