Admission Date:  [**2131-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-10-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: 47M with right ventricular mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Evacuation of right ventricular hemorrhage  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 78604**] is a 47 y/o male with no prior past medical history who describes three episodes of acute restlessness with a need to walk non-stop and nasal congestion lasting 1-3 hours followed by a headache.
During that admission he was ruled out for an MI and had a normal stress test.
The latest symptom occurred this am at 0430 when he awoke him from sleep - he was congested, felt restless and then developed a mild headache that he describes as a sinus headache (has had intermittently for years).
No smoking, rare alcohol   Family History: Mother died at 59 of =lupus and emphysema.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pulmonary embolism to the large subsegmental pulmonary artery branches.
Assessment of more distal branches is limited due to suboptimal contrast opacification.
6-mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe.
[**2131-5-14**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Approximately 3-cm mass within the right lateral ventricle, with associated noncommunicating hydrocephalus and mild transependymal leak of CSF.
Differential diagnosis includes an ependymoma, intraventricular meningioma, periventricular astrocytoma, or other intraventricular tumors.
This is not typical location for metastatic lesion.
[**2131-5-14**] brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study due to termination because of  claustrophobia.
However, intraventricular mass in the right lateral ventricle may represent an intraventricular meningioma, ependymoma, or intraventricular astrocytoma.
[**2131-5-15**] CTA: Findings: The right anterior choroidal artery is asymmetrically prominent and appears to be supplying the intraventricular tumor.
There are no intracranial aneurysms, stenoses, or occlusions.
Note is made of an infundibulum of the left posterior communicating artery.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdense enhancing mass within the right lateral ventricle causing trapping of the temporal and occipital horns of the right lateral ventricle.
There is also adjacent edema of the right frontoparietal lobe.
This tumor appears to receive arterial supply from a prominent right anterior choroidal artery.
The differential is as given previously, but intraventricular metastasis could also be considered, especially given the history of pulmonary nodule.
[**5-16**] NCHCT s/p resection: FINDINGS: There has been an interval right parietal craniotomy, with an associated small amount of pneumocephalus.
Additionally, there is interval postoperative hemorrhage within the right lateral ventricle, filling the occipital and temporal horns, with slight expansion of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and leftward shift of normally midline structures of 5 mm relative to the prior study.
Dilatation of the temporal and occipital horns of the right lateral ventricle is similar in appearance from the prior study.
Additionally, there continues to be residual vasogenic edema of the right frontoparietal lobe.
There is no evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes, with a large amount of hemorrhage within the right lateral ventricle, with slight expansion of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and leftward shift of normally midline structures.
[**5-17**] s/p hematoma evacuation: Findings: There has been interval evacuation of an acute hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of free hemorrhage.
There has been resolution of the left fourth midline shift.
There is no evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Successful evacuation of postoperative hemorrhage with normalization of midline shift and no evidence of significant hemorrhage.
[**2131-5-17**] brain MRI for residua: Findings: Blood products and expected postoperative pneumocephalus are identified adjacent to the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Lateral to the pulvinar, there is a focus of restricted diffusion in a site of increased FLAIR signal.
These findings are consistent with vasogenic edema, or possibly a small focus of ischemia.
No other mass or unexpected hemorrhage is identified.
There is no unexpected enhancement after contrast administration.
IMPRESSION: Increased FLAIR signal and restricted diffusion lateral to the right pulvinar is consistent with vasogenic edema, or possibly a small focus of ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ED a chest CT revealed a 6 mm nodule in the right middle lobe.
A NCHCT and MRI of the brain on admission revealed a right ventricular mass.
A brain CTA revealed no aneurysms, stenoses, or occlusion.
Patient went to the OR for resection of the mass on HOD#3.
Postoperatively (POD#0), a left lateral visual field defect was noted during the postop check.
His EOMs were intact and he continued to have a left lateral visual field cut.
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
Please make an appointment to see your PCP to discuss 1)Your hospitalization and surgery 2)Your high blood pressure 3)You have a nodule in right middle lobe.
