She noted excoriation of this area secondary to frequent urination post chemotherapy and mild swelling and erythema that developed on the day of admission.
Due to rapid extension of the right labial erythema and edema, consults to Surgery and Gynecology were obtained.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were significant for no air in the soft tissues and both consult services agreed with medical management and close observation.
Past Medical History: Mantle Cell Lymphoma diagnosed in [**10-29**] s/p 2 cycles of hyper-CVAD s/p cholecystectomy [**1-31**] Tonsillectomy (age 8) via XRT Recurrent ENT Infections as child TAH/BSO - [**Hospital1 112**] [**2170**] SCC Lower Lip s/p Resection [**2172**]   Social History: Patient lives with her husband and has one son.
No recreational drug use  Family History: No known leukemias or lymphomas.
No FHx of early MI's.
Physical Exam: T=103.9, HR 118, BP 92/43, RR 18, O2 sat 100% on RA Gen- non-toxic appearing HEENT-PERRLA, EOMI, sclera anicteric, OP clear Neck- no LAD, JVP est < 5 cm H2O Chest- slight decreased breath sounds at the left base.
no murmur or rub.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly Ext- no clubbing, cyanosis, or edmea.
Genital- right labial swolling with erythema and induration over the inferior aspect.
No flocculence.
No focal gas collections to suggest the presence of necrotizing fasciitis.
No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis within the pubic symphysis.
Asymmetric enlargement of the right labia majora, with edema and asymmetric thickening of the medial aspect of the right labia.
This may be secondary to an infectious or inflammatory process, but direct involvement by lymphoma should be considered.
No evidence of abscess or fasciitis.
Superficial subcutaneous edema involving the anterior aspect of both thighs.
Heterogeneous bone marrow signal within the proximal portions of both proximal femurs, likely related to the patient's history of lymphoma.
Small free fluid in the pelvis.
She was volume resucitated with 5LNS with improvement in tachycardia and blood pressure.
Two out of four blood cultures (both from the P-AC) were positive for E. coli, and pt was placed on broad antibiotics.
The Surgery and Gynecology Consult services continued to follow the patient, beginning while in the MICU, and medical therapy was recommended, particularly given concern for introducing infection in the setting of her neutropenia.
CT scan showed no evidence of fasciitis or abscess.
As there was further concern per surgery team to rule out abscess or fasciitis, an MRI was also performed, which showed neither of these processes.
After the switch, pt was afebrile for the next 48 hours and showed continued signs of improvement.
On discharge, there was complete resolution of erythema on her thigh and mons; persistent induration along the R labia, with a round, ~1cm area of ulceration on the posterior R labia with an intact eschar overlying the ulceration.
Of note, pt's pain was controlled with Tylenol.
She reported that her pain was tolerable with Tylenol.
2.  mantle cell lymphoma - pt was status post her second cycle of hyperCVAD.
She was neutropenic initially, but her counts recovered, and her G-CSF was stopped.
She was transfused for anemia and thrombocytopenia as needed.
3.  supraventricular tachycardia - While in the MICU, pt's course was complicated by runs of SVT consistent with AVNRT, requiring adenosine to terminate the rhythm and initiation of metoprolol.
4.  hypertension - Pt's BP was in the 130s-140s, even with metoprolol.
Eschericia coli sepsis, resolved 4.  hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating po, ambulating  Discharge Instructions: Please return daily for ceftriaxone intravenous infusion for the next few days; your last day of treatment will be [**5-23**], to complete a 14-day course.
If you notice fevers, chills, worsening pain, or increased redness of your vulva or leg, please go to the emergency room.
