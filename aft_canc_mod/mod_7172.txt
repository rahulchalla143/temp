Admission Date:  [**2200-10-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-10-19**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy and increasing dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with history of hairy cell leukemia in remission and recent resection of an invasive malignant thymoma with left phrenic nerve resection complicated by new oxygen requirement and left pleural effusion who presented to the emergency department with lethargy and dyspnea on exertion.
The patient had progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and also has had increasing oxygen requirements from 2 to 3 liters nasal cannula.
Also complains of poor appetite with decreased p.o.
intake and increased sputum production.
He subsequently was intubated with Succinyl Choline and Etomidate for respiratory distress and increased work of breathing.
He had a chest x-ray which showed right multi-lobular consolidations as well as a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Malignant thymoma, squamous cell type, status post radical thymectomy with left phrenic nerve resection on [**2200-9-19**] complicated by left pleural effusion and oxygen requirement.
Hairy cell leukemia diagnosed in [**2184**], treated with Interferon in remission.
Hypocellular marrow with chronic leukopenia.
Recent supraventricular tachycardia on [**2200-9-29**].
Cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 30%, no known coronary artery disease.
Diabetes mellitus on oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Question of cerebrovascular accident in [**2199**] verses transient ischemic attack.
Right eyelid droop.
Cholecystectomy status post hernia repair.
Prozac causes nausea and vomiting.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for glaucoma and diabetes.
Chest has rhonchi anteriorly with decreased breath sounds at right base, crackles on the left side.
No murmurs audible.
His electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm at 90 with no significant morphologic changes.
On chest x-ray with diffuse infiltrates and consolidation on the right with right sided patches especially at the right base.
Chest CT with no pulmonary embolism, right greater than left sided infiltrates with alveolar opacity of the entire right lower and upper lobes with mild involvement of right middle lobe.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy with maximum size up to 1.5 cm which is increased prior (compared to [**7-17**].)
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient became hypotensive upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit but responded to fluid.
An attempt to readjust his Endotracheal tube resulted in extubation and the patient was re-intubated with decreased O2 sats immediately following intubation to 60% and subsequent hypertension.
Chest x-ray on [**10-15**] showed improved infiltrates, bilateral pleural effusions.
This was felt to be likely secondary to sepsis as well as intravascular depletion.
Cardiac echo was obtained which showed a depressed ejection fraction from 20 to 30%  The patient was intermittently placed on pressors but then became hypotensive despite maximal dose of Levothroid, Dopamine and fluid resuscitation on [**2200-10-19**].
The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound given elevated liver function tests which was negative and a chest CT showed no evidence of abscess.
ID was consulted after the development of gram positive cocci and blood cultures on [**10-15**] which ended up being coag negative staph.
Acute renal failure.
The patient had an elevated creatinine with electrolyte abnormalities which was evaluated by renal consult team and felt to be secondary to a combination of ATN as well as pre-renal.
Renal ultrasound was negative for any stones or significant hydronephrosis.
Change in mental status.
The patient then re-required re-sedation given necessity of paralysis for ventilation.
A CT of the chest did not show any fluid collection underneath the suture sites.
On [**2200-10-19**] a meeting was held with the family given the patient's continued deterioration with hypotension despite maximal pressor support and difficulty ventilating.
Acute renal failure.
