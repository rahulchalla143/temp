Perforated duodenal cannot be excluded, although no extraluminal air is identified.
Pancreatitis with secondary duodenal inflammation is less likely.
Progressed appearance of inflammation with increased ascites.
Regarding pancreatitis or renal pathology, recommend correlation with labs since this may be a secondary inflammatory process.
No conclusive evidence for perforation but given the inflammatory changes around the duodenum, the appropriate clinical setting, could consider a repeat scan in [**1-30**] hours to evaluate for extravasation and perforation.
Extensive inflammatory change in the peritoneum and retroperitoneum, with free fluid and stranding as previously, though no evidence of extraluminal leak of oral contrast.
Increase of right pleural effusion .
Progression of intra-abdominal free fluid and minimal change in the overall degree of intra-peritoneal stranding.
There is no evidence of extraluminal leak of contrast or obstruction.
Progression of right lung effusion and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities which may be secondary to the diffuse process involving the abdomen though should be clinically correlated for possible infection in the setting of neutropenia.
Interval worsening of the consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes.
This finding may represent atelectasis, however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Interval increase in the amount of ascites since the prior exam with a moderate amount now present.
This may represent atelectasis, however, superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are improved.
Mild jejunal wall thickening is non-specific but could reflect opportunistic infection.
Persistent moderate intra- abdominal ascites, with no evidence of loculated abscess formation.
Thrombosis of the left basilic vein with no upstream extension.
Hypoechoic well-defined mass of the right forearm measuring 1.8 cm.
Most recent portable CXR [**2201-7-12**]: There are low lung volumes which slightly limits assessment, particularly in the lower lungs which have some associated volume loss.

New right frontal hemorrhagic contusion with probable small regions of adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Known external soft tissue swelling.
No skull fractures.
This study done on [**2201-7-15**] at 03.43Am is available for review on [**2201-7-15**] at 9.30am and wet rea dwas given to the physician as mentioned above.

Labs On Discharge: [**Month/Day/Year 34887**]:  WBC 4.9 HBG 9.6* HCT 27.7* Platelets 377 COAGS:  PT 14.6* PTT  28.3 INR 1.3* Chem 7:  Gluc 91 BUN 16 Crn 0.8 NA 138 K 3.8 CL 101 HCO3 25  Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 78266**] is a 49-year-old male with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy, being treated with ATRA and was admitted with febrile neutropenia and diarrhea and found to have GNR sepsis and duodenitis.
# Febrile Neutropenia, GNR sepsis: The patient was initially covered empirically with vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl with concern for a GI source given his recent diarrhea and history of anal fissures.
He had no respiratory or urinary symptoms on presentation and initial chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.
Initial CT scan on [**6-21**] was concerning for duodenitis and the patient's antibiotic regimen was broadened to include ciprofloxacin and micafungin and [**5-2**] blood cultures from the previous day were positive for gram negative rods.
Surgery was consulted early on the morning of [**6-22**] given continued fevers and worsening abdominal pain.
An abdominal ultrasound was obtained and showed no evidence of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease or intrahepatic duct dilatation.
The patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**6-22**] that consisted of black-colored liquid.
A repeat CT scan in the evening with gastrograffin demonstrated increased inflammation, but negative for duodenal perforation.
In route to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], a CT ABD was done which showed extensive inflammatory changes in the peritoneum and retroperitoneum.
Repeat CT the following day showed progression of intra-abdominal free fluid and minimal change in the overall degree of intra-peritoneal stranding.
His abdomen continued to be distended and tender, and he was increasingly short of breath and hypoxic.
Filgrastim was also started for neutropenia.
Neutropenia resolved as of [**7-1**].
Patient was treated for a total of two weeks of Vancomycin and Meropenum following recovery of his counts on [**2201-7-2**], consequently last day of therapy was [**2201-7-16**].
Patient continued to have low grade fevers while on Meropenum and Vancomycin.
#  LUE DVT:  During the workup for the patient's fever on meropenem and vancomycin, the patient was found to have DVT in the left upper extremity at the site of a PICC.
Low grade fevers felt to be secondary to clot, and eventually resolved.
#  Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated in the setting of abdominal distension and pain, no obvious primary pulmonary process.
# Thrombocytopenia: Initially related to the patient's recent chemotherapy.
Once his acute illness resolved, his platelet count was maintained over the next week without transfusions.
# Acute promyelocytic leukemia: The patient was initially continued on ATRA per his home regimen, however, his dose was reduced to 30 mg PO BID on the morning of [**6-22**] given the worsening of his acute illness.
The patient was given protamine and vitamin K. Head CT showed small subarachnoid hemorrhage and Neurosurgery was consulted.
# Dysuria:  No evidence of UTI on UA or urine cultures.
Used lidojet and pyridium for symptomatic relief.
