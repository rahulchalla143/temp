Information was gatherered from patient and OSH notes.
Had associated nonproductive cough in the setting of reduced PO intake but denied any fevers, chills, chest pain or palpitations.
On arrival to OSH, initial VS were BP 169/53 HR 88 RR 32 and initial ABG revealed respiratory acidosis with PCO2 in 80s.
CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and he was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime there.
On arrival to the ICU, patient states that his breathing feels somewhat improved however continues to have significant difficulty with breathing.
Denied orthopnea or PND.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI and recent sick contact with granddaughter who was diagnosed with mono (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Diabetes complicated by neuropathy - COPD on home O2 - Prior CVA with right-sided residual paraparesis - Hepatocellular CA diagnosed in [**2114**] (never been treated [**2-25**] comorbidities) - Cirrhosis diagnosed at an outside hospital - Depression - Seizure Disorder  Social History: Lives with daughter and her boyfirend at home.
Vitals: 128/68 60 24 98% on [**10-29**] BiPAP at 50% FiO2 General: Alert, oriented, moderate respiratory distress off BiPAP more comfortable on BiPAP, cachetic, appears older than stated age HEENT: Sclera anicteric, very dry MM, oropharynx clear, prominent eyes, poor dentition Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Prolonged expiratory phase, with inspiratory wheezing heard prominently anteriorly, diminished breath sounds on left base posteriorly with scattered rhonchi CV: Difficult to discern heart sounds from loud breath sounds Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: No foley Ext: Cool, 2+ radial and femoral pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  DISCHARGE EXAM: EXPIRED.
Sinus tachycardia.
Inferior and precordial ST segment depressions with T wave abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities are now more prominent.
Mild generalized interstitial thickening, combined to mild distention of the pulmonary vessels, likely to be caused by a combination of COPD and fluid overload.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities, no larger pleural effusions.
There continues to be a diffuse interstitial abnormality with more focal changes at the right base which are felt to likely be post-inflammatory.
No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
No large pleural effusions.
The lungs are somewhat hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms, which could reflect an underlying component of emphysema.
T wave abnormalities in lead aVF are less prominent  CXR [**3-16**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent diffuse interstitial abnormality, most prominent in the right lung base demonstrates interval regression from [**2117-3-14**].
No new focal consolidation or opacity.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No acute intracranial process.
Two small hypodense lesions in the left pons that may represent old lacunar infarcts.
Sulci and ventricles are mildly prominent consistent with atrophy.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2.Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, bronchial fluid and/or mucus plugging involving the bilateral lower lobes, with intralobular septal thickening and centrilobular ground-glass nodular densities in right and left lower lobes and lingula.
Findings are suggestive of aspiration and/or superimposed atypical infection.
New nodules in the right upper and superior segment of right lower lobe measuring 5 and 7 mm are worrisome for metastases in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Findings consistent with subacute fractures of the right seventh and eighth ribs.
UPPER EXTREMITY U/S [**3-20**]: No evidence of hematoma in the right upper extremity at the site of swelling.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fractures.
The ventricles and sulci are moderately enlarged, consistent with moderate involutional changes.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: 68M with a PMH significant for oxygen-dependent COPD, alcoholic cirrhosis with untreated likely metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (diagnosed in [**2114**]), prior CVA with right-sided residual hemiparesis, seizure disorder, diabetes mellitus (complicated by neuropathy), depression, HTN, HLD who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure with COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia which was complicated by altered mental status, [**Last Name (un) **], toxic metabolic encephalopathy requiring intubation, continuous seizure activity and hypotension requiring pressor support.
At 3/16 at 215pm, the nurse again went into his room and found him pale, warm and pulseless without spontaneous respirations.
In addition, the patient had no history of significant cardiac disease or arrhythmia.
He was pronounced dead at 220pm [**4-9**] from presumed respiratory failure from mucous plugging versus fatal arrhythmia (no hx of this during the admission).
