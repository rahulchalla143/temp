Admission Date:  [**2118-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-2-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness, arm tingling, weakness, and LLE weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Head CT  History of Present Illness: 58 yo man with h/o DMII, HTN, and metastatic rectal cancer with metastases to the lung, liver, and cerebellum presents with worsened unsteadiness and 2 episodes of left sided tingling, and possible dysarthria.
He initially had his cerebellar mets diagnosed due to headache on a CT in [**2118-10-20**] and had a VP shunt placed by neurosurgery.
He reports that for the last 2 weeks, he has had worsened unsteadiness and has been very tired, sleeping a lot.
He also had pain in that arm and felt as if a snake was wrapped around his arm and squeezing it.
At about the same time, his LLE was also weak, but this apparently started after his arm weakness and only lasted ~25 minutes before resolving.
On admission, he has a mild global headache and feels unsteady as he has for the last 2 weeks.
He has no other issues at this time.
ROS: Patient denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, neck pain, visual changes, hearing changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vertigo.

Pertinent Results: Admission labs: CBC: WBC-8.9 RBC-4.50* Hgb-13.5* Hct-41.4 MCV-92 MCH-30.0 MCHC-32.6 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-274 Diff: Neuts-87.1* Lymphs-9.3* Monos-3.2 Eos-0.4 Baso-0.1 Coags: PT-12.5 PTT-22.0 INR(PT)-1.1 Chem10: Glucose-816* UreaN-25* Creat-1.1 Na-129* K-5.9* Cl-93* HCO3-27 Calcium-9.1 Phos-2.3* Mg-2.0 cardiac enzymes negative x 2  Imaging: CXR ([**11-22**]): Unchanged appearance of advanced metastatic disease, without discrete foci of consolidation.
No radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.
Again seen is the large left cerebellar mass measuring 22 mm, similar in appearance to the previous study.
Also seen is the right cerebellar mass, similar in size, with new high density foci suggesting interval hemorrhage.
Additionally, there is interval prominence of the extra- axial space outlining the right lateral frontal cerebral convexity, measuring 5 mm in thickness and exerting mild mass effect, though there is no shift of the normally midline structures.
The volume of the lateral ventricles has decreased since the last examination.
No evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
Ethmoid air cells and other sinuses are clear.
Interval appearance of high-density material within the right cerebellar known metastasis representing hemorrhage.
Similar appearance of left cerebellar metastasis to last exam.
New 5-mm crescentic subdural fluid collection along the right frontal lateral cerebral convexity, exerting very mild mass effect.
However, there has been a marked change in the appearance of the lateral ventricular bodies since the [**2118-10-26**] study, which now appear more slit-like.
In additon, there is a moderate-sized subdural collection layering over the right cerebral convexity, new, which may be seen with "intracranial hypotension."
Three cerebellar enhancing metastatic lesions are identified, two in the left cerebellar hemisphere and one in the right.
The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion measures 2.7 x 2.4 cm and is largely unchanged.
The larger of the two left cerebellar hemisphere lesions measures 2.6 x 2.7 cm and is slightly increased in size compared to the prior examination where it measured approximately 2.6 x 2.2 cm.
The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has an area of susceptibility artifact which corresponds to increased attenuation seen on the recent CT scan.
Increased attenuation in the left cerebellar hemispheric lesion demonstrates decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
No susceptibility artifact is noted in this left cerebellar hemispheric lesion.
There is a small amount of subdural fluid seen extending over the entire right cerebral convexity.
There is no change in the position of cerebellar tonsils on the sagittal image.
Increased right subdural fluid and enhancement of the dura with decrease in size of the ventricles suggest intracranial hypotension.
Multiple cerebellar metastatic lesions.
The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has an area of susceptibility artifact and corresponding to increased attenuation on the CT suggestive of intratumoral hemorrhage.
The left hemispheric lesion has decreased T2 signal intensity corresponding to increased attenuation on the CT and likely represents calcification in a mucinous metastasis.
MRI c-spine: wet read: No evidence of metastatic bone disease to the C-spine.
No cervical cord compression or major cervical canal stenosis.
Mild multilevel degenerative disk changes.
EEG: official read pending, wet read no abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: 58yo man with metastatic rectal ca and known cerebellar metastases and hemorrhage into mets, presents with two discrete episodes of left arm "tingling" or "twisting" into extension, no LOC, lasting 30mins, followed immediately by left leg weakness.
This is most consistent with seizure, possibly from the right-sided subdural fluid collection seen on MRI.
He was initially admitted to the ICU for closer neurologic monitoring given the abnormalities of his posterior fossa.
An MRI brain showed three cerebellar metastases with new hemorrhage into one of these metastases, as well as a new right-sided subdural fluid collection and small ventricles.
MRI of the cervical spine was also performed, which showed no evidence of brainstem compression or cervical canal stenosis.
The radiologists raised the question of overshunting, but this was discussed with the neurosurgical team and determined to be of no concern and requiring no change in management.
He was discharged to [**Last Name (un) **] for an appointment with diabetic teaching.
