Story of recent febrile illness with respiratory symptoms treated for 2 days with Azithromycin.
On day of admission was noted by staff to be non-verbal and responsive to pain only.
EMS was called, per EMS report patient was found agitative and combative, warm and dry, with tachypnea to the 30's, audible upper airway congestion and scattered ronchi, with hypoxia to 85-90% on RA, BP 130/90, HR in the 90's.
CXR was notable for bilateral LL infiltrates especially impressive on the right.
Labs were notable for leukopenia WBC 2.1, 83% neutrophils, lactate of 2.7, Cr: BUN 2.0:60 (from 1.2:26 at baseline), Cefepim + Vanco were given.
-BPH - CRF - aspiration pneumonia - esophagitis .
GEN: intubated and sedated on Fentanyl 100mg/h and Midazolam 4mg/h, unresponsive HEENT: pinpoint pupils minimally responsive to light, anicteric, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly RESP: CTA anteriorly b/l CV: RRR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e, good peripheral pulses SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no cellulitis NEURO: limited exam, sedated.
EKG:  sinus rythm, rate 70, border line left axis ~ 30*, SRWP V1-V4, low voltage limb leads, normal intervals, no signs of acute ischemia.
There are extensive bilateral basilar opacities, which presumably in the acute setting may represent aspiration and/or pneumonia with edema less likely.
HEAD CT [**2108-2-14**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Mild maxillary and sphenoidal sinus disease.
No pulmonary embolism, or acute aortic injury.
No abnormal fluid collections at the lung bases, or in the upper abdomen.
Multifocal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation concerning for multifocal pneumonia, likely in the setting of aspiration.
Air in the hilum of an atrophic left kidney.
No sign of obstruction.
Air-filled large bowel with minimal stool.
Radio-opaque density projecting over the stomach is of uncertain etiology but metallic density newly appeared on [**2108-2-20**].
RUQ U/S [**2108-2-25**]: IMPRESSION: Limited right upper quadrant examination with nondistended gallbladder and no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
CXR [**2-28**]-HISTORY: Possible foreign body over stomach.
Decreasing right lower lobe opacity.
Unchanged left lower lobe opacity.

# Multifocal Pneumonia with Sepsis: ESBL Klebsiella and MRSA growing out of sputum.
He had persistent Staph growing from his sputum.
His platelet count continued to increase to 750 which was likely evidence of an acute phase reactant and sign of an infection.
Hypoxic respiratory failure prior to admission likely due to pneumonia and possible aspiration, complicated by underlying parkinson's.
Baclofen is being used for intractable hiccups.
He is [**Location 94979**] positive ~9 L and could tolerate further diuresis, but has likely had significant insensible losses due to his fevers.
However, shortly after ICU stay while on medical floor, pt began to experience episodes of acute hypoxia, tachypnea and occasional stridor.
He then developed a 3-4L oxygen requirement.
Oxygen requirement remained stable at 3-4L but patient continued to experience episodes of acute tachypnea, excess secretions.
Given continued acute episodes of tachypnea/hypoxia and excess respiratory secretions, decision was made by HCP to allow current level of care (antibiotics, suctioning, oxygen, parkinson's meds) but to use pRN morphine for acute episodes of apparent discomfort described above.
He has a hyperechoic density in his abdomen somewhere between his spleen and stomach.
Radiology reviewed prior images that suggest that patient had more dental fillings in the past compared to present.
Urine cultures from [**2108-2-17**], [**2108-2-18**], and [**2108-2-20**] showed no growth.
There was air in the left kidney on CT [**2108-2-21**], which was concerning for pneumopyelonephritis, but per final CT read this was likely iatrogenic and not pathological.
# Parkinson?????
?s:  Levodopa/Carbidopa readjusted to home dose, continued Comtan, and restarted Rivastigmine (PO instead of patch for concern of overdosing in the setting of fevers).
# BPH: Initially held Terazosin and Doxazosin in the context of hypotension on presentation and continued infection.
# Acute on Chronic RF: pre-renal physiology with increased BUN:Cr ratio and FeNA = 0.19%, likely [**1-25**] to dehydration in the setting of febrile illness in an incapacitated patient who is unable to increase his water intake in response to thirst.
No signs of active bleeding.
Likely ACD and acute inflammation.
#code-On [**2108-3-1**], he was confirmed to be DNR/DNI, no reintubation, no escalation.
Morphine for acute episodes of respiratory distress.
