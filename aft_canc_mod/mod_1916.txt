## Hypotension: The etiology of her hypotension was likely multifactorial in the setting of potential blood pressure medication changes, sepsis, or hypovolemia from poor oral intake.
Unfortunately the patient developed hypoxia secondary to pulmonary edema in this setting (see below) and required BiPAP.
## Pulmonary edema: In the setting of aggressive fluid hydration, the patient developed hypoxia with pulmonary edema shown on chest x-ray and required BiPAP.
An echo showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular function with increased severity of known mitral regurgitation.
She was started on antibiotics for possible pneumonia or sepsis in the setting of her hypotension.
However no evidence of pneumonia was reported on repeat chest x-ray, and blood and urine cultures show no growth to date.
On discharge patient was afebrile and WBC was downtrending at 14.2.
## Vascular stenosis: Patient had uneven blood pressures in her right and left arm (left SBP 90s, right SBP 130s) concerning for aortic dissection in the setting of her low blood pressures.
An MRI chest however showed no evidence of aortic dissection.
Vascular surgery thought this was most likely due to arterial stenosis and recommended no intervention at this time as patient was asymptomatic.
## Rule out hypopituitarism: MRI brain showed a partial empty sella, which was concerning for secondary adrenal insufficiency in the setting of her hypotensive episode.
Prolactin slightly elevated which is difficult to interpret in the setting of illness.
## Rhabdomyolysis: Patient had mild rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase on admission secondary to prolonged time down after her fall.
This was consistent with her urine analysis which showed gross hematuria but only 1 RBC.
## Acute on chronic kidney failure: Patient's creatinine was elevated on admission (3.0) from her baseline (1.6-2.1) likely secondary to prerenal azotemia.
## Lower extremity weakness/falls: Most likely this patient's fall was secondary to an exacerbation of her left leg weakness, which she has at baseline as a sequelae of polio.
However due to concern for cerebrovascular accident, neurology was consulted and an MRI brain showed sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease without any acute intracranial process.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] ruled out a cord lesion.
# DM2: Patient had high blood sugars on this admission, so her Levemir insulin was increased to 16 Units at night.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 1952**], [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Fall, hypotension, community acquired pneumonia, hypoxic respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema, acute on chronic kidney failure, rhabdomyoloysis, diastolic heart failure, vascular stenosis  Secondary diagnoses: Hypothyroidism, insulin dependent diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia, gout, uterine fibroids, polio, hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had x-rays of your pelvis and spine, which showed no fractures.
A brain MRI was done, and no evidence of stroke was seen.
In particular we found no evidence of adrenal insufficiency, which we were most concerned about.
On admission you had low blood pressure, so we gave you fluids.
Unfortunately some of the fluid went to your lungs, so you had trouble breathing.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit, where they helped you breath with a respiratory mask called BiPAP.
We also gave you lasix, which is a medication that helps you urinate out the extra water, and your breathing improved.
A vascular surgeon saw you and believes that this difference is due to narrowing of the vessels in your left arm ("vascular stenosis"), which is likely related to your diabetes and hypertension.
At this time, they recommended no interventions.
Furthermore you had increased white blood count on admission, which can be a sign of infection.
A chest x-ray showed possible pneumonia, so we treated you with antibiotics called cepodoxime and azithromycin.
This can occur when there is muscle breakdown from the fall as well as low blood pressure.
(2) Continue your antibiotics cefpodoxime and azithromycin for 1 more day (last dose 5/24) (3) We decreased your furosemide dose to 20 mg because you did not have any leg swelling on this admission.
