Likely pneumonia or aspiration.
Otherwise stable appearance with stents overlying the right mid lung zone and near entire collapse of the right hemithorax from known squamous cell malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 72-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (diagnosed in [**2178**]), non-massive hemoptysis (s/p right fifth posterior intercostal artery embolization on [**2191-1-12**]), and recent admission for weakness ([**2191-1-14**] to [**2191-1-18**]).
Hypoxia:  Most likely related to new LLL infiltrate on chest xray, though other possibilities include aspiration event or health-care associated/community acquired PNA.
She was also treated for influenza with oseltamivir given her poor pulmonary reserve.
A DFA for flu and urine legionella antigen were sent.
She was given maximal 02 with venti mask, but still had increased work of breathing.
After long discussions with family, it was decided to make patient DNR/DNI and not place invasive central venous catheters for pressure support.
Throughout the night on [**1-23**] patient had increasingly labored breathing and the family was called to the bedside.
Moreover, she developed a pronounced cardiac arrhythmia toward the end of her life, which also contributed to her poor cardiac output.
Urinary tract infection:  UTI on admission might also be contributing to septic picture and altered mental status.
An ABG in ED showed respiratory acidosis at 7.30/59/215.
Most recently has had course complicated by non-massive hemoptysis s/p embolization.
Family understood gravity of the situation and Ms. [**Known lastname 68912**] strength thus far, but still hoped for a miracle.
