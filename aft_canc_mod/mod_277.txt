| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S NITROFURANTOIN--------  <=16 S TETRACYCLINE----------  =>16 R VANCOMYCIN------------     2 S  ============= Radiology ============= CT Head [**4-18**] Extensive chronic microvascular infarct without evidence of neoplastic or infectious process; however, MRI remains more sensitive for this indication.
Prominent mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is slightly less bulky along the right paratracheal region but unchanged in the subcarinal region.
Since [**2144-3-31**], there has been interval near-complete resolution of right pleural effusion but the patient now has new small to moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
However, no evidence of new pneumonia.
Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, but no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
Small hiatal hernia.
No acute infarction.
No focal lesions in the brain parenchyma to suggest neoplastic or infectious etiology.
Nonspecific white matter changes in the cerebral white matter on both sides, likely due to sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease, with other etiologies being less likely, due to lack of IV contrast enhancement.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Periventricular white matter changes, stable from prior, likely representing chronic microvascular disease.
No acute intracranial process.
Stable patchy confluent nonenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensities within the subcortical white matter, centrum semiovale, corona radiata, and periventricular regions.
This is nonspecific and likely represents chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes.
No evidence for acute infarct or hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: # Fever and Neutopenia: Patient initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Culture data only revealed Eneterococcus in the urine sensitive to Vancomycin.
As mental status progressively deteriorated (see below) antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Acyclovir for meninigitis coverage.
# Altered mental status: Patient's mental status worsened and eventally became non-responsive.
LP was not consistent with bacterial meningitis, but since WBC was poly predominant meningitis doses of antibiotics were administered.
An MRI head revealed signs consistent with CNS lymphoma and CSF revealed atypical cells.
Pt c/o itchiness however only topical sarna lotion was used in favor of avoiding sedating medications.
[**4-30**]: Pt became febrile to 100.5 early morning of [**4-30**].
Pt appeared very uncomfortable.
Acyclovir was started for concern of HSV encephalitis.
[**5-2**]: CT scan did not show any acute changes.
A lumbar puncture was performed for interval check of lymphoma in CNS and pt was also given IT Ara-C. [**5-4**]: Pt remained in status despite the multiple anti-epileptics and pt was transferred to the ICU for phenobarbital administration.
This was likely secondary to persistent phenobarbital, as levels were high.
Neuro has said that there is no role for rpt imaging.
# Seizures/Status Epilepticus:  She was initially on continuous EEG monitorring.
# Ventilatory support.
:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.
# Bacteremia:  On [**4-14**], patient developed leukocytosis and low-grade fever.
On [**4-15**], blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in short chains and pairs, suspicious for VRE.
# Hyponatremia: Urine lytes and osms were consistent with SIADH, likely secondry to her intracranial process.
# Hypertension: well controlled on metoprolol  # Goals of care:  Given poor prognosis of her T-cell lymphoma as well as the complicated ICU course including bacteremia, the patient's family elected to extubate and move toward comfort measures.
Pt was given morphine drip for comfort and valium to suppress any seizure activity.
