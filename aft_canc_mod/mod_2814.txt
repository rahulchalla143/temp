Admission Date:  [**2115-9-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-9-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-1-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 35 year-old male admitted on [**2115-9-17**] status post motor vehicle accident head on collision, unrestrained driver with positive loss of consciousness, no air bag deployment.
His only complaint was of a left head pain where he had an obvious avulsion of his scalp.
There was a large left parietal laceration avulsion down to the galea starting at the left forehead 3 cm inferior to the hairline extending back in a crescent shape to an area just proximal to the left ear.
There was no crepitus in the neck, chest.
The extremities were without any gross deformities and he was able to move them without any pain.
Back was without any thoracic tenderness or step off.
INITIAL RADIOLOGY:  CXR and PXR, which were negative for any acute disease.
Head CT revealed a 2 to 3 cm of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal area without shift or compression of the ventricles.
Detailed neurological revealed no deficits.
Repeat head CT the following day revealed no interval change in the size of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Neurosurgery recommended an MRA and MRV as well as a gadolinium contrast MRI to further characterize the head lesion.
Eventually this was felt to be a venous angioma, but did not require immediate intervention and which only had a low risk of future bleeding.
The patient's large left scalp avulsion was thoroughly irrigated and primarily closed on the day of his admission with numerous simple interrupted stitches after local irrigation with 1% Lidocaine followed by a compression dressing to prevent hematoma formation.
