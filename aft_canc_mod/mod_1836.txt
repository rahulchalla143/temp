She was further worked up with a bone marrow biopsy and CAT scan and diagnosed with a low-grade lymphoma and thought most consistent with a splenic marginal zone lymphoma.
Otherwise, she has had no symptoms, no nausea, vomiting, no exacerbating or alleviating symptoms.

Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with small   left pleural effusion.
No cardiomegaly.
No pulmonary edema.
Markedly abbreviated study due to poor patient noncompliance.
Non-occlusive thrombus in the main PV.
Thrombus in splenic vein remnant.
Colonic wall thickening, likely due to underdistention, but could represent colitis in the right clinical setting.
Multiple hepatic and renal cysts.
Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right.
Otherwise, bilateral pancake atelectasis with small pleural effusions are unchanged.
CXR ([**2168-9-7**]): Neg for PNA or effusions  Pending labs: spleen for pathology  Medication changes: none  The patient was admitted for observation after laparoscopic splenectomy that was converted to open.
An epidural was placed by the Acute Pains Service (APS) post-operatively for pain control which provided moderate pain relief.
However, she developed confusion and this was d/c'd and started on vicodin with IV morphine for breakthrough.
POD#2 she developed low grade temperature with leukocytosis of 15,000 with a HCT drop from 29.6 to 26.8 and worsening abdominal pain.
There was concern for possible venous thrombosis so an abdominal U/S was performed.
However, this was suboptimal study limited  views due to pain but did demonstrate lack of flow through the portal vein.
A follow-up CT scan demonstrated an occlusive thrombus in the portal vein and non-occlusive thrombus in the splenic vein remnant.
APS was paged and the epidural was removed and she was transferred to the SICU for observation and was started on Heparin drip.
Heme/Onc was consulted to assist with management and transfusion requirements in patient post-splenectomy with history of thalassemia minor.
She was placed on regular diet and a morphine PCA for pain control.
POD#5 the foley was removed and she was voiding without difficulty.
She continued to have mild O2 requirements via nasal cannula likely due to decreased ambulation.
The oxycodone was stopped because she was overly sedated and she was placed on scheduled Tylenol and PRN tramadol of which she only needed 1 dose.
POD#8 she did have temperature of 101.0, CXR was negative for infiltrate and UA was negative.
She remained afebrile therafter, her WBC continued to trend down and her INR trended down to 3.4, and she developed post-splenectomy thrombocytosis with platelet count of 840 on discharge.
Discharge Instructions: Call the surgery clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3201**]) or go to the Emergency Department for the following: Temperature greater than 101.4; increasing redness, pain, swelling, or discharge from the incision sites; blood in your stool or black tarry stools; inability to tolerate food or drink; worsening abdominal pain; or any other concerns.
Incision Care: *Please call your surgeon or go to the emergency department if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower and wash incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
