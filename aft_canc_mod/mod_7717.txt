Admission Date:  [**2158-4-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-4-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-9-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: bradycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Company 1543**] DDD Sensia pacemaker placement via cephalic vein   History of Present Illness: 81 yo M w/ HTN, HL, DM type 1 (A1C 9.4%), bladder cancer, dementia and long standing history of RBBB/LAFB who now presents to the ED with weakness and malaise, found to be in CHB but asymptomatic, now being transferred to CCU for observation after another episode lasting 30 mins w/ 6 sec.
Thereafter, he reports feeling generalized weakness and fatigue.
He returned home and continued to have similar sensation of near faintness.
No CP, SOB, though does note feelings of SOB when laying flat, that improves with clearing of his nose.
He has chronic nasal congestion.
No recent med changes.
Upon arrival, his BP was wnl by report and HR was noted to be 30-40s, with high degree AV block.
He c/o of a right sided HA w/o vision changes.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains.
No recent fevers, chills or rigors.
No exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes type 1, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension 2.
- Memory loss - Bladder cancer - vascular vs. mixed dementia with paranoid delusions apparent but improved - chronic constipation with motility disorder associated with bloating, distention, and significant diverticulosis - Sciatica   Social History: perOMR and confirmed.
Sclera anicteric.
arcus senilis, conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EOMI, no nystagmus, mild upgaze limitation.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Multiple overlying wires are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation, though allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
No signs of congestive heart failure.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable with atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR (prior to discharge): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-27**], there is no interval change in the appearance of the heart and lungs or the pacemaker device.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen, especially at the left base.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M w/ HTN, HL, DM type 1, bladder cancer, dementia and long standing history of RBBB/LAFB who now presents to the ED with weakness and malaise, found to be in CHB but asymptomatic, transferred to CCU for observation after another episode lasting 30 mins w/ 6 second pause, now s/p dual chamber pacemaker placement.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# High degree AV block.
Likely infra-AV nodal block, at times it seems to be 1:3 but not consistently so, it appears paroxysmal given spontanous conversions.
On one telemetry strip he is noted to go into block s/p a VPC with no escape rhythm with a pause of ~ 6 seconds.
Etiology of this is uncertain, but likely related to chronically diseased conduction system (given RBBB/LAFB he was already at high risk of high degree AVB).
His sx are most likely due to block and appear to have been going on for at least a couple of months (no signs to suggest seizure or posterior circulation disease).
He was taken by the Electrophysiology service for a dual-chamber pacemaker placement without complications.
# PUMP:  No evidence of CHF, last ECHO w/ concentric LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.
He was restarted on valsartan for afterload reduction once pacer was in place, but it was held initially given potential for low BPs.
TTE showed LVEF of 40% with mild mitral regurgitation.
E/A ratio <1 concerning for diastolic dysfunction.
#  Bladder CA: Work-up is currently in progress as an outpatient.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES .
# Follow-up: He will follow up with Device Clinic (electrophysiology) and his providers as previously scheduled.
15. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO at bedtime as needed for constipation .
Disp:*16 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Complete heart block hypertension diabetes mellitus type 1 hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had episodes of dizziness that we think is caused by complete heart block, a slow rhythm of the heart.
A pacemaker was placed to prevent your heart from beating slowly and should prevent these severe episodes.
Start taking clindamycin four times a day to prevent an infection at the pacer site 2.
Start taking tylenol as needed for pain at the pacer site  Followup Instructions: Department: GASTROENTEROLOGY When: WEDNESDAY [**2158-7-5**] at 11:20 AM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1983**] Building: LM [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) [**Location (un) 858**] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage  Department: GERONTOLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2158-9-21**] at 10:00 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2847**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 719**] Building: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Location (un) **] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage  Department: SURGICAL SPECIALTIES When: THURSDAY [**2158-9-28**] at 1:30 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 275**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**], M.D.
