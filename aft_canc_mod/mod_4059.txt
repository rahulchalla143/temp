During her last hospitalization, initial plans for cardiac intervention were deferred due to sepsis, hypotension, and the discovery of high grade MRSA bacteremia.
On [**11-15**], the patient developed shaking chills, fever to 102, and hives while being administered Vancomycin.
She also had loose stools for a period of days, and anorexia.
Her hospital course was notable for periods of hypotension (SBP 70-80s), requiring IVF and low dose neosynephrine.
The patient was given empiric treatment with Flagyl for C. difficile colitis.
Repeat blood cultures from the outside hospital have grown [**4-18**] gram positive cocci in pairs/clusters, with preliminary ID consistent with Staphylococci.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management of her hypotension and infectious issues.
Past Medical History: CAD (anterior-inferior defects noted on previous stress tests), s/p STEMI on [**2179-10-24**].

ECHO disclosed EF 40-45%, and possible RV free wall depression.
Staph aureus bacteremia, [**10-18**], complicated by mitral valve endocarditis.
Source of MRSA bacteremia not identified, although may have been secondary to MRSA pneumonia (see below).

Patient now transferred from OSH for further evaluation of leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and hypotension requiring neosynephrine/IVF.
Sepsis: Pt had been recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with MRSA endocarditis and bacteremia, and prior to this admission it was discovered at the OSH that she continued to have MRSA bacteremia.
The day of her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she had [**4-18**] blood culture bottles positive for MRSA at the OSH and was started on Linezolid at that institution.
Her PICC line was thought to be a likely nidus for her continued bacteremia and was d/c'd and cultured, but failed to grow an organism.
ID felt that her continued bacteremia was much more likely due to an absces than to resistance to Vancomycin, and recommended that we search for such a collection.
The [**Month/Day (4) **] revealed worsening endocarditis as well as a new abscess near the mitral valve.
MRSA endocarditis/abscess: [**Month/Day (4) **] revealed MV abscess and worse endocarditis of MV as well as possible involvement of the AV.
They also recommended getting a head CT to r/o emboli prior to her likely needed surgery for abscess drainage.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] was initially recommended cath in prep for surgery given recent STEMI, but then after further review was not convinced that the pt had a true abscess requiring surgery.
CAD, s/p STEMI: In prep for her operation, the patient underwent a cardiac cath that revealed 90% stenosis of her LAD.
The cath was complicated by a post-cath R groin hematoma that resolved on its own but required the transfusion of one unit of PRBCs.
Acute renal failure: on admission the patient was in ARF, which was determined to be prerenal in origin and which resolved with hydration.
Respiratory distress: on the first night of admit, the patient become acutely SOB with RR to the 40s and hypoxic to the 80s.
It was felt that a large part of her distress was secondary to CHF in the setting of her worsening MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
She responded well to Lasix diuresis, though became SOB on occassion throughout her stay.
Each time she did, it was in the setting of either too much fluid or a elevated heart rate and blood pressure.
She was found to have many small microemboli in her cerebrum and cerebellum, c/w showering from her endocarditis.
Given the risk of bleed from these lesions will anticoagulated from heparin on CP bypass, CT [**Doctor First Name **] was reluctant to take her to the OR but eventually agreed.
Supratherapeutic INR: pt had been on coumadin as an outpatient for a h/o PEs, but had not had a recent INR check.
L upper lip basal cell carcinoma: Patient is followed by Dermatology, and it has been recommended that she have lesion removed.
She has cancelled numerous appointments to have the lesion addressed.
On the final day of hospitalization, the issue of percutaneous intervention of the LAD stenosis was addressed with patient and again, patient refused any further intervention, surgery, catheterization, or otherwise.
Ipratropium Bromide 18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation QID (4 times a day) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Disp:*900 mg* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 11496**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Endocarditis, with 3+ mitral regurgitation Congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease, left anterior descending coronary artery lesion 90% occluded Acute on Chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Fair - continued episodes of mild pulmonary edema due to valve defect as well as chronic congestive heart failure.
As she declined surgery, the definitive treatment for her extensive endocarditis, she will likely remain on lifelong antibiotics.
- Please be vigilant for the develpment of muscle aches or weakness.
Patient has declined cardiac surgery or percutaneous intervention (and given embolic cerebral infarctions is not a candidate for thrombolysis or anticaogulation) for severe endocarditis and coronary artery disease, therefore fever and unstable angina are to be expected.
