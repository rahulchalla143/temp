Admission Date:  [**2115-7-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-7-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-9-7**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL MICU  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Dyspnea and left lung collapse.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a 90 pack year smoking history who had worsening dyspnea and cough for several months which worsened in the three days prior to admission at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2115-7-9**].
She had chest x-ray in [**2114-11-6**] showing no abnormalities besides healing rib fractures.
She had endorsed losing 15 pounds over the six months prior to admission because of loss of appetite.
On admission to [**Hospital1 1562**], the chest x-ray showed complete opacification of the left lung.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a rigid bronchoscopy with possible stent intervention by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
History of narcotic dependence.
History of a left hip fracture in [**2114**].
The patient has also been requiring narcotics for her left hip fracture since last year and had evidence of dependence.
General:  She was a well appearing intubated woman in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae and dry oropharynx.
There was some red bloody secretions in the endotracheal tube.
Chest:  The chest revealed some very decreased breath sounds at the left upper lobe.
Cardiac:  The cardiac examination revealed a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no distention.
Extremities:  No pedal edema.
Neurologic:  The patient moves all extremities and is intermittently agitated and will try to sit up from the bed.
She does not respond to voice nor follows commands but is currently sedated.
LEFT BRONCHIAL MASS:  The patient was kept intubated for signs of hypoventilation upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] and MICU.
She was stable over the weekend and did not experience significant [**Hospital1 **] loss from the biopsy at the outside hospital.
She continued to have agitation while on the ventilator but was easily sedated with Ativan, morphine, and propofol drips.
She was taken for CT of the airway with reconstruction as well as rigid bronchoscopy on [**2115-7-15**] where the left main stem bronchus lesion showed a 70% luminal narrowing and no distal airway patency.
She remained intubated showing signs of hypoventilation.
She was also treated for MSSA pneumonia with Oxacillin initially.
She also was treated with vancomycin for a temperature while on Oxacillin.
It should also be noted that a pleural effusion was noted on the left lung and 800 cc were drained in the OR during rigid bronchoscopy when a left chest tube was placed to that side.
Cytology is pending on that specimen but was thought to be most likely a malignant pleural effusion.
