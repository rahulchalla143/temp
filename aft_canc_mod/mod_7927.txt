Sigmoid anastomosis seen in the pelvis, appears unremarkable.
Left pleural effusion.
Further evaluation is recommended with chest radiograph  [**2189-12-4**]:  Upper GI:  SINGLE CONTRAST UPPER GI: Water-soluble contrast and thin barium passes freely through the esophagus into the proximal jejunum without evidence of leak.
