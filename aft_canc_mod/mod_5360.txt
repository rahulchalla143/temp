A  CT scan revealed a 7 cm x 6 cm x 5 cm left renal clear cell cancer with focal sarcomatoid features, grade III-IV with no capsular perivascular, or renal vein invasion.
[**10/2176**]-CT scan revealed development of 1 cm left lung nodule in  the left lung pleural-based density at the costophrenic angle.
There was also a new 10 cm mass in the left adrenal gland.
[**5-/2177**] - developed a left parotid gland mass and increased adrenal mass as well as lung nodules.
FNA of the left parotid mass was nondiagnostic.
[**2177-10-27**] - underwent superficial parotidectomy and pathology was consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He was ineligible for the sorafenib/bevacizumab trial and for high-dose  IL-2 given his ventricular tachycardia in ETT.
However, his left parotid mass demonstrated enlargement during the interval between [**2178-4-20**] and [**2178-6-20**] during which his remainder of systemic disease got smaller.
[**3-27**] - Sorafenib discontinued due to disease progression.

Conclusions: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild  (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
