No intrahepatic bile duct dilation.
Unchanged 8 mm dilated pancreatic duct.
[**2160-7-18**] CXR CONCLUSION:  Mild left lower lobe opacities have improved since the morning.
This is mostly due to atelectasis or aspiration.
There is no new consolidation.
Interval progression of hepatic metastases, more numerous and confluent since [**2160-6-20**].
Continued occlusion of superior mesenteric vein.
New moderate intra-abdominal ascites and increase in pelvic ascites.
New small bilateral pleural effusions.
Right colonic edema, could relate to reactive changes in the setting of new ascites, although colitis cannot be entirely excluded.
Slight increase in size of the known infiltrative pancreatic head/uncinate process mass with continued encasement of the superior mesenteric artery resulting in narrowing but no evidence of occlusion.
New nodular density in left lower lobe may relate to subsegmental atelectasis given new bilateral pleural effusions.
Equivocal filling defect in a left lower lobe pulmonary artery, inadequately evaluated on this examination which is not targeted for evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature.
Further evaluation could be obtained with repeat chest CTA if clinically indicated.
Brief Hospital Course: 78yo previously functional woman with DMII, HTN, RA, recently diagnosed with pancreatic ca with liver mets, last admitted [**Date range (1) 20941**] for ERCP with stent placement to relieve N/V come in this admission for poor po intake and weakness, found to have a Na=117 and unexplained leukocytosis.
# Hypovolemic hyponatremia: The etiology of the patients hyponatremia was likely due to nause and vomiting and poor po intake.
She had no neurologic symptoms.
She remained without neurologic symptoms but remained with decreased po intake and intermittent N/V.
Given that she had a normal mental status and was without pain or discomfort it was felt that this may allow more quality time with her family.
# Mild hypothyroidism in setting of multinodular goiter s/p I 131 TSH was found to be elevated and her free T4 was at the lower limits of normal.
# Anorexia with intermittent N/V: Persisted despite recent biliary stent placement.
RUQ US showed no significant change from prior, and stent confirmed to be in proper position.
# Pancreatic ca with liver metastases: Pt was to start chemotherapy on [**7-18**] but she is too weak and deconditioned, with intermittent N/V as above.
CT torso final read showed equivocal left lower lobe opacity in branch of pulmonary artery, could not rule out PE.
Clinical picture not consistent with PE, and after discussion, did not pursue additional imaging.
Patient has follow up with her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], on [**2160-8-7**] at 1 p.m.  # Leukocytosis with cough: Pt developed cough, mostly nonproductive, prior to her hospitalization for ERCP.
Her antibiotics coverage was narrowed to augmentin/azithromycin and then discontinued when repeat CXR showed no infiltrate.
The ERCP team was informed of her elevated t. bili on [**2160-7-20**] and they elected to follow it and did not feel as though another stent was indicated at this time.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of weakness and falls.
You were found to have a low sodium which was treated with IV fluids and supportive care.
As part of your laboratory work up your were found to have low thyroid hormone.
You also received a few days of antibiotics while we were investigating a possible pneumonia, but these were stopped when a repeat chest X-[**Hospital1 **] showed no evidence of pneumonia.
