In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
No definite pneumothorax is appreciated at this time .
RUE US [**6-3**] - IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus within the right brachial, axillary and subclavian veins along the PICC line.
Small left-sided pneumothorax.
Free intraperitoneal air and moderate amount of high-density ascites with extraluminal bowel contents noted in the left mid abdomen at the anastomotic site consistent with leak .
Moderate global left ventricular systolic hypokinesis.
Due to suboptimal image quality a regional wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No clinically significant aortic or mitral regurgitation.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
PATH [**5-17**] - Ileocolic anastomosis and omentum (A-J): - Ileocolic anastomosis with transmural acute and chronic inflammation consistent with perforated viscus.
- Omentum with acute inflammation.
Small-bowel obstruction, secondary to acute on chronic Crohn's flare in the pelvis.
There are multiple short segments of narrowing with a longer segment of wall thickening and mucosal hyperenhancement, compatible acute disease and multifocal underlying chronic strictures.
Distally, again seen is long segment fibrostenotic disease involving the distal and terminal ileum,  unchanged from MR [**First Name (Titles) 9961**] [**2115-12-4**].
No evidence of abscess or fistula formation.
The key site of obstruction is probably a long chronic stricture in the right lower quadrant with severe polypoid mucosal enhancement 2.
New compression deformity of T11 vertebral body, not present on last imaging [**2115-9-17**], though with sclerosis suggesting a degree of chronicity.
Small-to-moderate hiatus hernia, with oral contrast seen in the distal esophagus.
Interstitial abnormality at the right base could thus reflect aspiration.
Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts, unchanged   Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course by systems while in the ICU: OPERATIVE: - [**5-17**]: Anastamotic dehiscence and bleed, s/p takeback to OR.
Saw dusky large and small bowel in OR, - second look - [**5-20**]: GT placement/IVC/closure - [**5-23**]: bilat chest pigtail placement  CARDS: - [**5-17**] Off neo, decreasing levo.
Also went into SVT, adenosine given with brief response.
Brief runs of Afib overnight as well as decrease in plts and FSs (to teens).
ECHO showed decrease in EF 70% to 35%, trending CEs (0.05, 0.04).
Repeat ECHO showed decreased pulmonary pressures to 30, increased EF to 60s.
RHEUM: - On [**2116-5-30**] a Rheumatology consultation was requested by the family for Raynaud's treatment options in setting of relative hypotension secondary to sepsis and several ischemic appearing distal digits  HEME: Pt has a known hx of PE with distant use of anti-coagulation.
She was found to have non-occlusive b/l LE DVTs on ultrasound.
- [**5-17**] LENIs showed likely chronic DVT in the R CFV - will discuss anticoagulation vs IVC filter.
[**5-21**]: Given albumin x2 for low UOP.
[**5-22**]: good UOP today, on PS/CPAP but tachypneic and requiring PS 20. switched back to AC overnight to rest.
[**5-23**]: 2 pigail chest tubes placed.
UA with trace LE and few bacteria.
Tried to wean to CPAP [**5-8**] x 2 times, but RR to high 30s and discomfort, respiratory alkalosis -> went back to CMV.
[**5-24**]: hydrocot weaned to 25, difficulty with CPAP, elevated TF residuals.
[**5-25**]: started oxycodone liquid for pain mgmt in attempt to wean off IV fentanyl.
Ostomy/wound consult called- large wound under ostomy dressing.
Decreased TFs to 50 over the day and held at 3am for extubation.
Became hypotensive with low UOP after dilaudid, received 1L bolus and 12.5g 25% albumin with good effect.
Failed bedside speech and swallow.
CXR shows increased basilar atelectasis, but no increased effusions.
[**6-1**]: cont'd leak from G-tube site-> to IR for GJ.
PT & speech & swallow consults.
She had large pleural effusions that persisted and pigtail catheters were placed for drainage.
She continued to have a persistent enterocutaneous fistula and remained minimally responsive to commands on the floor.
She was found to have bacteremia on [**6-10**] from her CVL line, cultures of which grew GPCs and yeast.
Hematology was consulted for RUE thrombus and treatment course.
ID was also consulted for persistent bacteremia.
She continued on only pain control and minimal interventions, and died a few days later on [**2116-6-17**].
