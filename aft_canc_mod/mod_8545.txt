Patient was doing well at rehab and was scheduled to go to [**Hospital1 336**] for a surgical Gtube but had a sudden Hct drop/acute renal failure/worsening pulmonary function/waxing mental status and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
She then had increased ventilatory support, CT chest [**11-26**] show large right pleural effusion.
Renal team felt that her ARF was due to hypotension on [**11-19**] in the setting of low HCt.
She was also treated for MRSA and stenotrophomonas PNA with vancomycin and bactrim.
She also has significant proximal muscle weakness b/c steroid use.
She also had multiple hypotensive episode, likely from primary brainstem lesion in combination with sedation, blood loss and also after large volume thoracentesis.
She also developed anemia and thrombocytopenia with neg HIT and eventually stabilized.
She also deveoped bilateral large pleural effusion which was tapped, cytology showed atypical cells, concerning for adenocarcinoma.
Family History: No history of stroke or other neurologic disease.

Markedly increased subcutaneous edema in chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Status post tracheostomy, with slight overinflation of the balloon at the level of thyroid gland.

Partial opacification of the sphenoid sinus and total opacification of the mastoid air cells which was also demonstrated on the CT scan of [**2111-9-20**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with contrast.
15 cc of Gastrografin was subsequently infused through the gastrostomy tube and immediate scan of the gastrostomy site was performed followed by delayed imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.
CT ABDOMEN: There is a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion with associated basilar atelectasis.
No contrast is seen within the bowel.
No pelvic free fluid is identified.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
There is a large amount of free air and small amount of free fluid along the left pericolic gutter.
Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.

DR.

Right-sided effusion is not significantly changed.
Again, there are diffuse pulmonary opacities, more on the left than the right, largely due to effusion with combination of atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
**FINAL REPORT [**2112-1-26**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2112-1-26**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN SHORT CHAINS.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: 73yo F with history of metastatic breast cancer, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and amiodarone, GIB from AVM, ulcerative colitis with ileostomy, adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, transferred from rehab for hypotension: .
During last admission, she has multiple hypotensive episode in the setting of sedation, blood loss and large volume thoracentesis.
Pt had had R thoracentesis and pigtail cath placed on the day before admission.
CT abdomen showed small ascites, but no retroperitoneal bleed.
Pt had pancreatitis with elevated amylase/lipase, and was treated with IVF, NPO, analgesia, but Hct was stable.
Pt was on Levophed from admission until [**2111-12-6**], and then after sepsis cleared, pt was diuresed with stability in BP.
BAL showed Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas.
She had another episode of uti with pseudomonas and was treated for a 7 day cousre.
She was ruled out for an MI, and ruled out for a PE (pt has metastatic breast ca).
On [**1-6**] there were difficulties with trach seal.
She did not have any further problems with the trach.
##  Acute renal faiure: Patient was admitted in acute renal failure, which was found to be prerenal in the setting of hypotension.
After stabilization of BP and treatment of infection and weaning off of Levophed, patient was diuresed gently with Lasix gtt.
The edema however did not resolve with lasix gtt.
She will need to be diuresised further as her BP and renal insufficiency tolerates it.
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease.
She had one episode of hct <20, hemolysis labs were negative, anca negative and there was no clear source.
She was later found to have a L chest wall hematoma, her INR was supratherapeutic at the time and was held thereafter.
Surgery was consulted who suggested monitoring the hematoma as there would be a chance of wound infeciton.
There were no further episodes like this.
Given her anemia of chronic disease she should be started on epogen after discharge from hospital.
##  Atrial Fibrillation: Metoprolol and Diltiazem did not work well for patient's AFIB, because her BP would decrease below 80.
Anxiety (Ativan) and pain (dilaudid, morphine, percocet) medications also served to decrease patient's HR.
Pt ordinarily took Coumadin as an outpatient, but coumadin was held during admission, for hematocrit drop as above.
She had several episodes of tachycardia and cardiology was consulted who recommended digoxin.
##  Diabetes mellitus 2: Patient was maintained on insulin gtt, and then insulin sliding scale starting [**12-3**] until discharge.
Ultrasound x 2 showed choroidal detachment as [**Street Address(1) 33553**].
Cytology from R pleural fluid had shown cells suspicious for malignancy, but pleural fluid sent at [**Hospital1 **] did not show malignant cells.
GI was consulted, who confirmed that pt does not require prednisone for her UC since her colon has been resected.
##  Gallstone: Patient had elevated alkaline phosphatase, amylase, lipase, with gallstones visualized in GB.
Patient was treated by NPO, IVF, and Dilaudid, morphine, percocet for pain control.
## UTI: Episode of pseudomonas UTI, treated with ceftaz for 7 days, last day ~[**2111-1-14**].
Surgery was consulted several times for PEG placement, however given her anasarca and ascities they believed that her risk for peg complications would be high.
##  Communication: HCP (brother) [**Name (NI) 429**] [**Name (NI) 33962**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100992**])  On [**1-14**] /[**2111**]  percutaneos G tube was attempted and it was felt not to be optimal procedure for this reason it was further studied and found to have a leak for this reason several days it was observed by the IR and medical ICU team, following that the tube and then manipulated and interrogated and found to have a leak again on [**1-18**], on [**1-22**] a CT scan was ordered and the results were called to the team that the G-tube was freely out in the peritoneum.
and was transferred to the ICU thoughout this post operative course she continued to have a fluid requirement her creatinine rose steadily and she eventually became anuric in ATN, throuout this period she developed a pressor requirement that steadily increased and her pulmonary status worsened.
After placement of the dialysis line she continued to have spetic appearing physiology but had an additional pressor and blood requirement having a crit drop of several units.
This cycle of sepsis and increased blood requirement continued and again extensive discussion was taken with the family regarding the goals of care.
She continued to progress and have failure of all organ systems having a continued blood product requirement from potential retroperitoneal bleed related to line placement, DIC related to sepsis, and vent dependent pulmonary failure, as well as acute renal failure all the while on maximum pressor suport.
