>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-12-16**] 2:54 PM Reason: eval masses, bleed Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman with F w/new cerebellar lesions on CT with Bleed.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left cerebellar lesion, for further evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: As seen on the previous CT, there is an area of hemorrhage seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle with some effacement of the left side of the fourth ventricle.
Following gadolinium, subtle adjacent enhancement is suspected on the medial aspect of the lesion, but the evaluation is limited secondary to motion artifacts.
There are moderate changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus is seen.
There is no evidence of acute infarct on diffusion images.
IMPRESSION: Left cerebellar area of blood products with surrounding edema and mild effacement of the left side of the fourth ventricle.
Subtle enhancement is suspected surrounding the lesion suspicious for underlying abnormality.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone postoperative changes with the left-sided occipital craniotomy.
Blood products are seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of air from recent surgery.
There is edema seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere with minimal mass effect on the left side of the fourth ventricle which has remained unchanged from previous study.
There is no other abnormal area of enhancement seen.
There is mild-to-moderate prominence of ventricles identified with prominence of temporal horns.
There is periventricular hyperintensities visualized as before.
There is no midline shift seen.
Bilateral extensive soft tissue changes are identified in the mastoid air cells.
Status post resection of left cerebellar mass with blood products at the surgical site with small amount of air from recent surgery.
No change in the appearance of edema or mass effect identified.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-12-24**] 8:04 AM Reason: LEFT CEREBELLAR MASS RESECTION, EVALUATE FOR POST OP CHANGES  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman s/p Left cerebellar mass resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: post op changes CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Status post cerebellar tumor excision.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Left occipital craniotomy is consistent with the history of left cerebellar resection.
Pneumocephalus in the resection site is slightly decreased compared to the prior exam and there is a similar degree of mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
No evidence of tonsillar herniation is seen.
High-density foci at the biopsy site are consistent with hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Cerebral periventricular hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
Moderate-sized left parietal subgaleal fluid collection has appeared, compared with the prior examination, measuring 9 mm in greatest diameter; however, there is no high-density material within it to suggest acute hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Stable post-biopsy changes in the posterior fossa, without evidence of new hemorrhage, herniation or mass effect.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior wall.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Multifocal ventricular premature beats.
Myocardial ischemia cannot be ruled out.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C  Reason: r/o occult primary malignancy, patient has clinical hyperand Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman with L cerebellar lesion, possibly metastasis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o occult primary malignancy, patient has clinical hyperandrogenemia, please evaluate adrenals & ovaries.
INDICATION: 77-year-old with left cerebellar lesion and possible metastasis.
CT OF THE CHEST: A 13-mm hypoattenuating lesion within the right lobe of the thyroid is seen.
The thyroid gland is mildly enlarged.
Heart size is within normal limits; however, there is extensive coronary artery calcification in the LAD, left circumflex, and RCA.
There are no focal consolidations or evidence of pulmonary edema.
Scattered nodularities are seen throughout the lungs, including 4- to 6-mm nodules within the right lower lobe (3:42), and a 6-mm nodule within the left lower lobe.
There is also dependent atelectasis at the lung bases with some areas of nodularity within this.
Small axial hiatal hernia is noted.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are two 1-cm hypodensities within the right lobe of the liver which do not meet CT criteria for cysts and may represent cysts or hemangiomas.
Prominence of the left adrenal gland, without a discrete nodule, likely reflects left adrenal hyperplasia.
There is a 1- cm simple cyst within the upper pole of the right kidney.
The small and large bowel loops are normal, and there is no free air or free fluid.
The aorta is tortuous and aneurysmal measuring up to 3.9 x 3.1 cm below the level of the renal arteries (3:72).
There is extensive atherosclerotic plaque throughout the aorta and the iliac vessels.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis is noted.
There is no lymphadenopathy in the pelvis.
Trace free fluid is noted.
Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the lower lumbar spine.
Facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy create moderate canal stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1.
No evidence of intrathoracic or intraabdominal malignancy in this patient with a cerebellar mass.
Small bilateral ground-glass nodules within the lungs are likely inflammatory or infectious, and attention should be paid to these on followup exams.
Extensive coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
Hepatic hypodensities which cannot be further characterized and may represent cysts or hemangiomas.
Small axial hiatal hernia.
Thickening of the left adrenal gland, without discrete nodule, likely adrenal hyperplasia.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgical service for Left Cerebellar mass and monitored in ICU.
MRI required intubation secondary to agitation.
CT torso showed no malignancy, however, findings as reported previously in note.
She had an episode of atrial tachycardia [**12-19**], was seen in consulatation by cardiology and cleared for surgery.
On [**12-21**] she underwent Left-sided suboccipital craniotomy for resection.
Post op CT showed Post-operative changes in the posterior fossa without evidence of hemorrhage, herniation or new mass effect.
She will follow up with oncology, radiation, dermatology and opthomology for ?ocular melanoma as well as brain tumor clinic.
