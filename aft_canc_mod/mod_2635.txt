The patient reports mild dyspnea x 1 month.
On the night before admission, he experienced acute onset SOB after walking from his car into his house.
CTA was attempted but patient became SOB in the supine position, so this study was aborted.
After discussion with the family, the patient's wife requested that the patient be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible therapeutic thoracentesis.

There was initial concern at the OSH for pulmonary embolism given the pts c/o chest pain and pain which worsened with deep inspiration.
The pt had a lactate of 4.2, WBC count greater than 40,000 and new ST-T wave changes (flattened T waves) in V3-V5 when compared to prior EKG.
The pt was initially empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected urosepsis, but his UA was negative and his urine culture on [**7-29**] grew out ampicillin resistant enterococcus.
Levofloxacin was started on [**7-29**] for a possible pneumonia given this could not be ruled out with large overlying pleural effusions.
CT angiogram on [**7-30**] ruled out pulmonary embolism and heparin gtt was discontinued at this time.
The pts R sided pleural effusion was tapped on [**7-29**] with 2 L of output, and his L pleural effusion was tapped on [**7-31**].
The effusion from [**7-29**] was slightly exudative, while the effusion from [**7-31**] was borderline transudate/exudate.
The pt was clear that he did not want any evaluation for pleurodesis or semi-permanent drain.
The elevation in the pts troponin was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia and resp.
The pts WBC, platelets, and red cells all dropped over the course of several days, c/w his recent CHOP regimen.
The pt was advised that we wanted to watch him in the hospital for a little while given his UTI and abdominal wall cellulitis, but the pt insisted on discharge.
As UA revealed yeast on [**7-31**], the pt was discharged home on a 7 day course of fluconazole.
