Patient reports increasing ascites, but no fever, abdominal pain, n/v, SOB, CP or latered mental status, disorientation.
Denies fevers, abdominal pain or back pain but endorses long-term loose stools.
Patient has had additional previous admissions for hyponatremia.
Rectal exam revelaed normal tone; normal LE strength; no neuro deficits on exam.
Bedside abdominal US revealed a ?distended bladder which was difficult to differentiate from surrounding ascites; moderate hydronephrosis on R, L kidney poorly visualized.
No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Hepatic cirrhosis and evidence of portal hypertension with varices.
hepatic dome lesion better evaluated on contrastenhanced studies.
She was well oriented and in no discomfort.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss .
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Peripheral edema/?
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Diabetic gastroparesis.
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
Abdominal hysterectomy.
Family History: Father died of colon cancer early 70s.
Sister died of breast cancer in her 40s, mother died of ovarian cancer in her 50s.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera icteric, Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: distended belly, no pain, fluid thrill +, no tenderness/guarding.
Hepatic cirrhosis and secondary findings of portal hypertension including patent umbilical vein, extensive varices, and large amount of ascites, as above.
No free air seen.
No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Extensive soft tissue edema consistent with anasarca.
Small umbilical hernia containing fluid.
Interval improvement in aeration with some linear opacity at the left base, which likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.
No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Subtle high T1 signal in bilateral basal ganglia, likely related to hepatic insufficiency.
Abnormal signal intensity adjacent to the third ventricle just to the left of midline, might be related to a dilated tortuous basilar artery indenting the third ventricle.
Although the prior outside studies are not available for comparison, the cystic lesion described on the previous study in the region of hypothalamus appears to be due to a prominent perivascular space, due to indentation in the region of hypothalamus by basilar artery tip.
No mass lesion is seen in the hypothalamus nor is there evidence of pituitary micro- or macroadenoma.
MRA of the head demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm or vascular malformation.
A tortuous basilar artery indenting the hypothalamus is visualized.
Cirrhosis with sequelae of portal hypertension including multiple varices, ascitis and splenomegaly.
Nondistended gallbladder with gallbladder wall thickening which is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in cirrhosis.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation .
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Sequelae of cirrhosis including moderate ascites and extensive varices.
Brief Hospital Course: 60F w h/o cirrhosis, [**3-12**] PBC and autoimmune hepatitis, c/b HCC and diuretic resistant ascites, on transplant list, admitted with weakness and increasing ascites and found to have hyponatremia.
Admission complicated by anemia, acute injury, and worsening volume overload.
EGD and colonoscopy showed no evidence of active bleed.
Capsule endoscopy was positive for active bleed in the duodenal bulb.
However, repeat EGD was without evidence of bleed.
The patient underwent attempted TIPS without success and IR was not able to identify a bleeding vessel to embolize.
Urine was positive for vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus [**12-23**].
During her admission, TIPS procedure was attempted, but was unsuccessful due to small size of liver and technical difficulty.
The patient was started on albumin, midodrine, and octreotide for presumed hepatorenal syndrome vs. contrast induced nephropathy.
She became oliguric and was transferred to the ICU for possible initiation of dialysis (CVVHD).
Abdomen was left open due to massive edema.
No biliary ductal dilatation was seen.
Physical therapy assessed her and recommended rehab due to debilitation.
Abdominal incision was dry and intact with staples(to be removed in f/u at [**Hospital1 18**]).
Of note, she had history of small hypothalamic cyst, followed by [**Hospital3 328**] neuro-oncology, first discovered in [**6-18**].
5. glucagon (human recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
