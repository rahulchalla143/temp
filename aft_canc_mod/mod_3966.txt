She had no hematemesis during her hospitalization and had a "minimal" amount of black stool since admission.
The patient was occasionally bradycardic with episodes of pauses, but she was never symptomatic and often sleeping.

It is unclear what the etiology of this is, but possibilities include a fistula, hemangioma or pelvic kidney.
GI bleed: After the patient's initial presentation with melena, she still had small amts of melena (averaging 1 episode of approx 30-50 cc/2-3days).
Etiology of the patient's GI bleed remained cryptic after EGD which revealed mild gastritis.
Repeat colonscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a polyp in the proximal ascending colon, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, blood in the entire colon and terminal ileum.
Repeat EGD at [**Hospital1 18**] showed large hiatal hernia, in the upper potion of the hiatal hernia a healed linear erosion, in the antrum a partially healed linear ulcer.
It was recommended that the patient continue on proton pump inhibitors and the general impression was that the bleeding site was either of the two abnormalities seen because they were healing.
A tagged red cell GI bleeding was also performed which showed a focal area of increased tracer uptake in the anterior right pelvis which did not appear to be within the GI tract.
It was unclear what the etiology of this is, but possibilities include a fistula, hemangioma or pelvic kidney.
The patient was sent for a small bowel follow through to evaluate for possible strictures or Crohn's, but the study was normal, without any evidence of strictures, dilatation, or mucosal abnormality.
After discussions with the patient, her niece, and the GI service, it was thought that the morbidity of exploratory laparotomy to find source of bleeding would carry too much of a risk for the patient.
Empiric hormonal therapy with estrogen could be tried next if the GI bleeding continues.
Lasix was held given hypovolemia and likely pre-load dependence given moderate AS.
Hypernatremia - Na 153 on admission was likely secondary to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
Daily monitoring revealed no repeat episodes of hyponatremia.
CRI - The patient carried a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creat of 1.8, but this value improved to 0.8 on iv fluids.
Bradycardia - The patient had rare episodes of sinus bradycardia with occasional pauses and junctional escape rhythm.
One episode was associated with hypotension but on iv fluid resuscitation, blood pressure were within normal limits.
The patient was evaluated by cardiology and bradycardia as well as syncopal episode at [**Hospital3 4298**] were felt to be likely vasovagal and did not recommend a temporary pacemaker.
