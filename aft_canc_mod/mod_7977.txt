Upon arrival, she was hypertensive and had a temp to 99.8.
She subsequently became hypotensive to 90/40 and received IVF bolus.
She had intermittent, mild hypoxia 93-96%.
She was thought to have a transfusion reaction (work-up ordered) but her labs were notable for neutropenia and she was referred to the ED for admission.
hemolysis labs negative.
CXR revealed mild interstitial edema.
Her only concern is a bruise/canker sore in her L mouth which is mildly tender.

Imaging: ======== [**4-1**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Calcified pleural plaque is better assessed on the prior CT.
There is mild interstitial edema with no large effusions or pneumothorax.
No signs of pneumonia.
[**4-1**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Stable gallbladder polyps versus a focus of adenomyomatosis within the gallbladder fundus.
Patchy bibasilar opacities within the lung bases, with subpleural scar formations and bronchiectasis within the lung bases.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Slightly dense appearance of the cortex lateral to the Sylvian fissure ( se 2, im 12) is likely related to volume averaging rather than hemorrhage; a follow up can be considered if necessary.
Bilateral mastoid opacification from fluid/mucosal thickening  .
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Small left adrenal adenoma.
Unchanged Focal celiac artery and aortic dilation as described above.
Colonoscopy: ============ [**3-1**] Colonoscopy prior to this admission: Abnormal mucosa in the colon.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
A small posterior rectal fissure was noted in the anal canal.
Blood and stool throughout colon.
Non bleeding posterior anal fissure.
[**2195-4-13**] colonoscopy: Blood in the whole colon.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Given the risk of uncontrollable bleeding in the setting of low platelets, the clot was not removed.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen, diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**] in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon Plasma coagulation.
She required a second colonoscopy for repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to the cecum.
She remained stable for a while then had frequent bloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar drip for 8 hours.
The patient developed BRBPR, and was found to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s/p APC.
Specifically, repeat colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively bleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp.
Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on [**2195-4-3**].
After remaining stable, she was transferred back to the floor however she had the same situation again and was transferred back to the ICU where she had her second colonoscopy which showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around the clot.
GI recommended surgical consult for possible resection however given her underlying disease and low platelet counts, they felt this will not be a favorable management.
Following this, she did not have any further significant bloody stools.
# thrombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS/AML concerns.
Concern for consumptive process following transfusion of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs. TTP however Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers.
She was found to have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions.
# transfusion reaction/PRA positive: The patient had transfusion reaction to platelet transfusion (once in clinic, and once while on the floor).
Sister was a potential donor however it wasn't suitable given her anti-platelet therapy as above.
# MDS with AML transformation:  While the patient was on the floor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and her neutrophil count was trending down.
The patient tolerated the Dacogen well, with little side effects.
12% blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge.
# constipation:  The patient has a history of severe constipation, however, her home medications were held in the setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given resolution of bloody bowel movements.
Transitional Issues: - The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a blood bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA positive; she will require HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions.
Miralax 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: One (1)  PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ml PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myloid leukemia cecal atriovenous malformations Lower GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had a transfusion reaction after getting platelets at clinic.
While you were here, you also developed some bleeding from your rectum.
You were transferred to the intensive care unit and they gastrointestinal doctors looked into your intestines with a camera and found some areas of bleeding called AV malformations that were clipped.
Second colonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to your colon in the same area where the AVM's were clipped.
While on the floor, you had a few loose bloody stools that subsequently resolved.
We also noticed some changes in your blood work that made us think that your leukemia was acting up again; because of that we started you on another five day cycle of chemotherapy.
