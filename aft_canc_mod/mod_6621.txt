Admission Date:  [**2133-11-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-8-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**] Chief Complaint: Left parapharyngeal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: On [**2133-11-12**]: 1.
Facial nerve monitoring.
Laryngeal nerve monitoring.
Left Mastoidectomy with sigmoid decompression   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 38 yo female with bilateral carotid body tumors and a large left skull base paraganglioma/left vagus glomus tumor.
3D CT angiogram [**2133-8-31**] demonstrated a glomus vagale 4.1x 2.2x 1.8cm that extends from below the region of the carotid bifurcation and up to the skull base.
She also has a small carotid body tumor on the contralateral side that is 1.7x 1.3x 2.1cm.
An octreotide scan had tracer uptake in the area of the left glomus vagale.
However, the carotid body tumor had no uptake.
The SPECT/CT images also demonstrate a 5-mm nodule in the left anterior lung without evidence of tracer uptake.
Head injury [**2130**].
Family History: Postive for FH of paragangiomas and pheochromocytomas.
Brother treated for malignant paraganglioma.
Pertinent Results: [**2133-11-11**] 09:01PM   WBC-16.0* RBC-3.58* HGB-11.2* HCT-31.5* MCV-88 MCH-31.1 MCHC-35.4* RDW-12.8 [**2133-11-11**] 09:01PM   PLT COUNT-251 [**2133-11-11**] 09:01PM   PT-12.8 PTT-25.0 INR(PT)-1.1  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 38 year old woman with history of bilateral carotid body tumors and left glomus vagale who was admitted pre-operatively on [**2133-11-11**].
She had undergone pre-operative embolization, which she tolerated without issue.
She was taken to the OR on [**2133-11-12**] for left mastiodectomy, sigmoid decompression, transcervical resection of left glomus vagale tumor and resection of left carotid body tumor with facial and laryngeal nerve monitoring.
The patient tolerated procedure without complications.
Regarding her cranial nerve exam, post-operatively, she was noted to have some weakness with tongue movement to the left (left CN XII) as well as paralysis of the left true vocal cord, deceased peristalysis of left pharyngeal wall with some pooling of secretions on that side which was anticipated given intra-op resection of the left vagus nerve.
As a result of anticipated difficulty with POs, an NGT was placed on POD #1; on POD #4, after evaluation by speech and swallow, a diet was initiated with compensatory maneuvers (see below) for her nerve deficits.
CV: She had elevated BP to SBP 160-180 in the initial post-operative days which were attributed to pain and hemodynamic re-adjustment after carotid body removal.
She used suctioning as needed to help with any excess oropharyngeal secretions and arrangement were made for suction machine at home.
GI: In light of vagus nerve resection secondary to the tumor, she was initially kept NPO pending further evaluation.
Speech/swallow was consulted on POD #4 and she underwent a video floroscopic examination to evaluate pharyngeal swallowing mechanism and aspiration.
She had decrease mobility of the left side of her pharynx with some pooling on the left side, but this was compensated for by head turn to left, chin tuck and hand pressure to left neck.
GU: The patient voided throughout admission without signs of retention or UTI.
Her wound remained clean, intact and with erythema or signs of infection.
She was afebrile throughout her hospital stay.
Her neck incision is closed with sutures which will be removed as an outpatient.
Her wound remained clean, dry and intact.
Patient is being discharged [**2133-11-17**], POD #5, to home with VNA services: afebrile, tolerating regular tube feeding via NGT with pureed, moist food with thin liquid oral diet, pain well controlled on oral/per tube medication, voiding, and ambulating well.
Suction machine Suction machine for suctioning of excess oral secretions 5.
Carotid body tumor left neck.
Discharge Instructions: Seek immediate medical attention for fever >101.5, chills, increased redness, swelling or discharge from incision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything else that is troubling you.
No strenuous exercise or heavy lifting until follow up appointment, at least.
