Admission Date:  [**2107-5-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-5-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2033-3-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, [**2106**], status post four cycles of fludarabine, Rituxan, Cytoxan, with the last treatment done on [**2107-4-14**], who presents with fevers and night sweats, fever as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit for the last five days, fevers were associated with headache, relieved with aspirin.
The patient did not complain of any neck stiffness nor photophobia, no rigors.
cough, shortness of breath, nor any upper respiratory infection symptoms.
The patient does not note any myalgias, no frequency, no dysuria, no abdominal pain, no constipation, no diarrhea, no vomiting, no nausea, nor any pain with bowel movements.
Therefore, the patient was pan cultured except for urine and admitted for IV antibiotics and for further workup.
History of benign prostatic hypertrophy.
HEENT:  No lesions.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No hepatosplenomegaly noted.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No groin lymphadenopathy.
The patient has palpable distal dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
The urinalysis was negative for evidence of a UTI.
The urine culture collected on [**2107-5-2**] showed no growth.
Blood cultures drawn on [**2107-5-2**], anaerobic and aerobic bottles, showed no growth.
Chest x-ray showed a patchy increased opacity of the left lung base, which could have represented early pneumonia, as well as linear opacities in the retrosternal regions, more suggestive of discoid atelectasis and/or scarring.
The findings showed new extensive ground glass opacities in both lung fields suggestive of some nausea components.
It was also noted that there was decreased mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
It could either represent lymphomatous involvement or a renal cell carcinoma, along with unchanged prostatic enlargement as well as slightly increased left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
It was noted also that the left lower lobe nodule was increased to 8 mm from a previous of 6 mm preadmission.
Based on these findings, the patient was taken a urine sample for Legionella serology as well as an induced-sputum sample that was also done.
Also, bronchoalveolar lavage, preliminary results showed +1 polys, no micro-organisms.
An EKOH stain showed no evidence of fungal organisms.
ID from [**2107-5-4**] showed multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
The patient was started on amphotericin to cover for possible Aspergillosis as well as other fungal diseases given the patient's immune status.
On [**2107-5-8**], the patient had a temperature spike to 102.5 as well as decreased 02 saturation to the high 80s despite 6 liters of nasal cannula.
A CT of the chest was done and repeated on [**2107-5-8**] and showed worsening ground glass opacities consistent with either hemorrhage versus pulmonary edema versus infection.
On the same day, [**2107-5-9**], the patient also had a video-assisted thoracoscopy which was done along with the left upper lobe and left lower lobe wedge biopsy.
Findings included a fibrotic appearing lung, palpable nodules were noted.
The specimens were collected and sent for viral, bacterial culture, and pathology.
Antibiotics included levofloxacin, ceftazidime, as well as AmBisome for wide empirical coverage.
The patient had episodes of hypotension for which, in addition to IV fluid transfusion, Neo-Synephrine at 2 micrograms per kilogram was started.
Initial findings were suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, question of etiology, infectious versus inflammatory, hemorrhage noted, suggested to be in the region of intra-alveolar level.
On [**2107-5-10**], the patient was continued on ceftazidime, day number eight, levofloxacin, day number seven, ampicillin, day number five, as well as acyclovir for wide empirical prophylaxis.
Meanwhile bone marrow biopsy Gram's stain were negative for micro-organisms.
Left lower lobe Gram's stain showed positive 1 polys and no micro-organisms.
Left lower lobe Gram's stain also showed +1 polys, no micro-organisms.
On preliminary cultures, viral cultures for the lung biopsy showed negative viral cultures, negative viral results (no growth) for left upper lobe as well as left lower lobe biopsies.
On [**2107-5-12**], the patient was also discontinued for levofloxacin.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable without pressors.
During the hospital course, the patient needed multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells as well as platelets during the hospital stay to maintain a hematocrit above 21, as well as a platelet count above 50,000 as per transfusion protocol guidelines for being in the ICU for evidence of active bleeding.
On [**2107-5-13**], bone marrow biopsy results showed no evidence of any viral inclusions nor granulomas.
Acid-fast bacteria stains as well as fungal stains and CMV stains were all negative.
Bone marrow biopsy also showed a negligible amount of B cells as well as mature T cells which did not suggest an active lymphoma process.
Also, on [**2107-5-13**], it was shown that three out of four bottles grew positive gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
It was also noted that the patient had a metabolic alkalosis from diuresis that was done that day.
The cause of the etiology of the metabolic alkalosis was probably due to volume depletion from diuresis from previous days to increase the patient's volume status in preparation for anticipated extubation.
Also, there was a question of whether collection of the positive blood cultures is accurate with respect to septic versus aseptic collection technique.
Per the patient's observation, it was noted that the person collecting the blood cultures did not perform collection in an ideal aseptic technique.
Therefore, there is a question of contaminated cultures.
Sensitivities noted that cultures grew out Staphylococcus coagulase negative sensitivities which was suggestive of Staphylococcus epidermidis, likely a contaminant.
On [**2107-5-16**], the patient was finally successfully extubated without complication.
All cultures from lung samples as well as marrow biopsy samples were negative for any evidence of infection.
The patient had a right upper extremity ultrasound to rule out DVT which proved to be negative for DVT or any evidence of infiltration.
Also, overnight, on [**2107-5-15**], the patient had a temperature spike to 101.5.
His temperature spike was concerning in light of the patient having an indwelling Foley catheter as well as an arterial line as well as other peripheral lines in place.
Blood cultures grew sensitivities for Staphylococcus coagulase negative, methicillin-sensitive and sensitive to gentamicin, vancomycin, Rifampin, as well as tetracycline.
In light of a continued productive cough and secretions, this likely was due to transient mucous plugging which was cleared by coughing.
