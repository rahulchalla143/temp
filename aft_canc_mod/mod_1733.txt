Admission Date:  [**2182-5-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-8-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Fentanyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**] Chief Complaint: flank pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ  History of Present Illness: 51yo female with a history of hepatic cirrhosis due to alcohol, alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and asthma was admitted from the Emergency Department with flank pain.
She reports that she has had multiple falls over the last 1.5 weeks due to gait instability and dizziness.
Then on the morning of admission she developed marked worsening of her pain for which she drank two drinks of vodka and cranberry juice on the morning of admission.
Of note, she has had the following multiple admissions since [**12-28**]: - [**Date range (2) 31375**] - pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and alcoholism  - 1/22-27/09 - hematemesis requiring endoscopy with banding - 2/14-17/09 - abdominal pain - 2/23-26/09 - abdominal pain, alcohol intoxication - 3/27-27/09 - nausea and vomiting, signed out AMA when narcotics were not given - [**Date range (1) 31376**] - hematemesis with EGD demonstrating varices - [**Date range (1) 31377**] - nonspecific abdominal pain - [**2182-4-2**] - abdominal pain and alcohol intoxication .
Her exam was notable for generalized abdominal pain.
CT scan in the ED was notable for patchy ground glass opacities throughout the lungs, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, and air in the biliary tree.
Chronic pancreatitis 3.
ETOH abuse - history of DT's in the past 4.
Asthma - history of intubation in the past 5.
Chronic pancreatitis 3.
ETOH abuse - history of DT's in the past 4.
Asthma - history of intubation in the past 5.
Uterine and cervical CA s/p hysterectomy - s/p hysterectomy ([**2166**])   Family History: - Mother - died in her early 70s from GI bleeding; EtOH - Father - died in mid-70s from cancer, possibly mesothelioma as he worked in shipping yard; EtOH   Physical Exam: Gen: no acute distress, resting comfortably in bed, smelling of alcohol, occasional slurred speech HEENT: Clear OP, dry mucus membranes NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi ABD: + BS, Soft, diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound or guarding EXT: trace lower extremity edema.
- [**2182-5-11**] - ECG - sinus rhythm at ~80bpm, normal axis, no acute ST changes - [**2182-5-11**] - CT Head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
- [**2182-5-11**] - CT C spine IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Peripancreatic inflammatory stranding with peripancreatic fluid, most compatible with acute pancreatitis.
Cirrhotic liver, with evidence of portal hypertension.
Patchy bilateral airspace ground-glass opacities, which may be infectious or inflammatory in etiology, with a suggestion of a tiny right pleural effusion.
Cirrhotic liver with new thrombosis of the main portal vein which was not present on the multiphasic CT of the abdomen of [**2182-3-28**].
No gallstones.
CXR: Lung volumes are lower, mediastinal vasculature is appreciably more distended and pulmonary vessels are mildly dilated, all suggesting volume overload and borderline cardiac decompensation.
Findings compatible with cirrhosis with fatty change in the liver.
There is mild heterogeneous enhancement of the head of the pancreas.
Findings are probably due to pancreatitis.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis at the lung bases, right greater than left.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
No evidence of ascites, with a note made of a right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 51yo female with history of alcoholic cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, and chronic pancreatitis was admitted from the ED with septic shock.
Septic Shock  Etiology of her septic shock is likely GPC bacteremia.
Plan is the following:  - follow-up final read of CT scan and [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US -> findings c/w pancreatitis, PV thrombosis, a few ground glass opacities  - follow-up blood and urine cultures  - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cipro/flagyl,  - pain control with IV morphine for now  - IVF resuscitation with NS to aim for MAP > 60, goal UOP 30mL/hour    2.
Acute Pancreatitis The patient was initally hypotensive in the ED with SBP's in the 70's.
The patient had findings consistent of pancreatitis on CT scan, most likely related to alcoholism.
Additional possibilities include gallstone pancreatitis, although no significant findings of gallstones were seen on [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US.
She underwent MRCP that was also consistent with pancreatitis.
She also underwent a repeat [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] that did not show obstruction or ascites.
She initally required pain regimen with IV dilaudid and was transitioned to po dilaudid for pain control.
Pneumobilia Patient has findings of pneumobilia on CT scan of unclear etiology.
Differential diagnosis includes a recent ERCP, although no record of recent procedure.
Infection with gas-forming organism, cholangitis, or emphysematous cholecystitis were other possibilites.
Alcohol Intoxication Patient has evidence of alcohol intoxication on exam and also with serum alcohol of 162 on admission.
Acute Renal Failure The patient's creatinine was 1.1, which is increased from baseline of .5-.7.
Etiology is most likely prerenal in the setting of infection, although she is still at risk for ATN given hypotension in the ED.
There was no evidence of urinary obstruction on CT Abd/Pelvis.
She was guaiac negative, hemolysis labs were negative, and no obvious source of bleeding was seen.
Cirrhosis Patient has known alcoholic cirrhosis with associated complications of varices, portal gastropathy.
She did not have any symptoms of encephalopathy during her admission.
She did complain of continued lower extremitiy edema following aggressive fluid resucitation in the MICU.
The patient was ambulating without difficulty.
Portal Vein Thrombosis Patient has findings on [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US with new portal vein thrombosis; however given her history of variceal bleed in the past, she was not started on anticoagulation.
Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis Alcohol Abuse Cirrhosis Ascites   Discharge Condition: ambulating, tolerating minimal po   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with pancreatitis and low blood pressure.
Your kidney function was mildly impaired, but this corrected with fluids and albumin.
It was felt that the risk of bleeding by putting you on blood thinners, however, was too great, given your falls and alcohol use.
You had an isolated episode of fast heart rate, that was due to anxiety and improved with valium.
