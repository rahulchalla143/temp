Her work-up was significant for locally advanced gallbladder vs. biliary CA and is now s/p palliative external biliary drain placement and duodenal stenting.
Abd soft, +BS, NTND, b/l drain sites clean, secure with no erythema, swelling.
Post-operatively, upon arrival to PACU, the patient developed respiratory distress with HTN/tachycardia.
Placed on BiPAP for 45 minutes with clinical improvement.
Admitted to TSICU on 4LNC, hemodynamically stable for overnight monitoring of CHF exacerbation likely in setting of hyperdynamic response post-op.
Her cardiac markers were negative and a formal echo done showed mild aortic stenosis.
The cardiology service saw the patient and reported that her pulmonary edema may have been due to diastolic dysfunction in the setting of hypertension and tachycardia.
A formal echo done on [**6-15**] confirmed the presence of mild aortic stenosis.
Fluoroscopic analysis of the pt's two stents revealed that both stents were clogged.
These were left draining on HD 2 with the plan of clamping them for 24 hrs and if no complications developed sending the pt home on HD 3.
The right drain had moderate output and was clamped on HD 2.
[**2124-6-16**]: Pt underwent another cholangiogram by IR and it was then decided to leave both drains clamped  [**2124-6-17**]: LFTs were found to be stable on HD 4 w/ no e/o biliary obstruction after clamping the tube o/n.
Both drains were left clamped during HD 4 and the patient tolerated a regular diet and did not develop constitutional sx's.
The drains will be left for 7-10 days to ensure patency of her biliary tree and then removed by IR as an outpatient.
