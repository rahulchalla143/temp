Admission Date:  [**2184-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-5-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-8-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Status-post MVA.
History of Present Illness: The pt is a 62 year-old gentleman with stage IV lung cancer with bone metatases who presented after being found wandering at the site of his recent automobile crash.
He was brought from the scene to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where he was found to have left facial and left sided weakness arm>leg.
CT of the abdomen showed a splenic laceration.
Here, a CT scan was repeated which showed a question of a basilar artery hyperdensity over the pons (but this was post-contrast).
Second, he has a splenic laceration and was recently in a traumatic MVA.
The admitting trauma team called their attending who told them he did not want to pursue thrombolysis no matter what the concern for basilar thrombosis given the high possibility that he would bleed from his spleen which could be fatal.
This was then discussed with the stroke fellow who felt that an acute scan should be performed given the high morbidity from a basilar artery thrombosis.
The surgical team felt differently and strongly that a CTA should not be performed given the risks and lack of thrombolysis to be performed.
The patient's exam was suggestive of a right-sided stroke, but he had a significant left neglect.
Family History: No neurologic disease.
Orientation: Oriented to person, place, and date(1 day off) Attention: Very inattentive Registration: Unable Language: Fluent with moderate comprehension and repetition.
Mild dysarthria.
Forehead wrinkles bilaterally.
Left arm with variable tone, but seems increased.

There are also areas of increased signal seen on diffusion images in the right frontal lobe and in the watershed distribution and small areas of hyperintensity are seen in the left occipital lobe and both cerebellar hemispheres.
However, other abnormalities are small and no definite low ADCs identified in these regions which may suggest T2 shine-through.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
No hemorrhage is identified.
IMPRESSION: Acute right MCA infarct.
Small areas of increased signal in both cerebellar region on diffusion images could be due to T2 shine-through, but given the small size acute infarcts could not be excluded.
Increased signal seen on diffusion images in the right frontal lobe appears to be due to chronic infarct.
No mass effect is seen.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery near the bifurcation.
The left ICA shows demonished flow signal with narrowing of the supraclinoid portion indicatinve of intrinsic atherosclerotic disease.
No stenosis is seen.
There is hypoplastic A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery, which could be a normal variation.
Narrowing of supraclinoid left ICA.
MRA NECK W&W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN FINDINGS: The right carotids show a somewhat tortuous appearance but no evidence of stenosis is seen.
Both vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal without stenosis or occlusion.
There appears to be low position of the left carotid bifurcation.
The left internal carotid artery is small in size which could be due to high-grade stenosis the origin.
The CT angiography can also help for further evaluation of great vessels of the thoracic outlet which are not visualized on the MRA.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat tortuous but normal vertebrals and right internal carotid arteries.
Deminished flow signal caliber of left carotid due to high grade stenosis at the origin.
No evidence of acute dissection on the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck and MRA of the neck.
MRI CERVICAL SPINE No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen.
Subtle increased signal in T1 and possibly in T2 vertebral bodies could be secondary to marrow edema from trauma.
Changes of cervical spondylosis are noted with minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord at C3-4 level by disc bulging.
No evidence of intraspinal hematoma seen.
There is a wedge deformity of the T12 vertebral body with associated cortical defects suggestive that this is an acute wedge fracture.
No definite metastatic lesions are identified within T12.
There is no evidence of spondylolisthesis.
There are moderate degenerative changes with anterior osteophytes at multiple levels.
Mild endplate sclerotic change is noted at T11/12 and T7/8.
A 1.5-cm lytic lesion of the T10 vertebral body is consistent with metastatic disease.
The visualized portion of the lungs demonstrates [**Hospital1 **]- apical consolidation, worse on the right.
No definite metastatic lesions identified within T12.
1.5-cm lytic focus of the T10 vertebral body consistent with metastatic disease.
There is no evidence of acute fracture or spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine.
There are multiple aggressive-appearing lytic lesions of the bilateral iliac bones and sacrum.
These findings are consistent with metastatic disease.
There are calcifications of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.
No acute fracture or spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine.
Multiple destructive lytic lesions of the sacrum and ilii consistent with metastatic disease.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Stroke: Further history after admission elucidated that the pt actually developed left-sided weakness prior to the automobile accident.
Neurologic examination on admission was notable for left facial droop and left sided hemiplegia.
MRI of the brain on admission demonstrated acute right MCA infarct.
MRA of the neck vessels with fat sats demonstrated no evidence of dissection, but did demonstrate somewhat tortuous but normal vertebrals and right internal carotid arteries.
Diminished flow signal caliber of left carotid due to high grade stenosis at the origin was also noted.
TTE revealed no evidence of thrombus or focal hypokinesis.
Throughout the hospital stay, the pt remained encephalopathic but gradually improved.
The etiology underlying the encephalopathy was thought to be due to stroke location, pneumonia, and overuse of narcotic analgesics while in the intensive care unit.
Discussion with the pt's oncologist and radiation oncologist revealed that this lesion had actually been receiving palliative radiation therapy, so likely represented a pathologic fracture.
Per trauma surgery, it was a grade I laceration and required no further intervention.
He was in the midst of undergoing palliative XRT to bony metastases in the thoracic spine and sacrum.
Right lung pneumonia: The pt was discovered to have right lung infiltrate on CXR.
