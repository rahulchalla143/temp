History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 104012**] is a 54 yo female with metastatic breast cancer s/p right mastectomy and XRT who presents with shortness of breath over approximately the past week.
The patient reports this may have been going on for a few weeks at most but that it has been most obvious over approximately the past week when she has been unable to sleep at night due to an inability to lie flat without shortness of breath.
She reports that she called the clinic who thought this was most likely secondary to anxiety so she was given "something to sleep" that didn't work well.
She also reports she would have dyspnea on exertion so that on climbing a single flight of stairs she would become short of breath.
Also she has generally been more fatigued over the last month or so, but says this may have been related to recent chemotehrapy.
Patient has a longstanding cough since last fall that briefly improved with PPI and speech and swallow consult but has worsened again recently.
Usually non-productive but occasionally associated with thick, white sputum.
She denies any night sweats or frank fevers though she reports "low grade" fevers to 99.
No night sweats.
She has lost approximately 60 lbs over the last two years as she has dealt with her metastatic carcinoma.
She denies any chest pain, palpitations, leg swelling, pre-syncope, or syncope.
Because of her recurrent respiratory symptoms a chest radiograph was checked at the outpatient clinic and showed possible worsening of her right sided pleural effusion as well as an enlarged cardiac silhouette so the patient was referred for outpatient TTE on day of admission.
After this echo showed a large pericardial effusion she was sent to the ED to be seen by cardiology.
She was seen by cardiology who took her for pericardiocentesis.
In the cath lab 670 cc's of serosanguinous fluid was drained.
Post-procedure TTE showed only slight residual effusion.
On arrival to floor patient reports less dyspnea and generally feeling well except for mild pain at drain site.
ROS ---- On review of symptoms, she denies any history of coronary artery disease or problems with her heart though she has been on lisinopril in the past.
She denies any melena, hematochezia, or noted increase in the size of her abdomen.
In [**2192**] known metastatic disease to spine, supraclavicular node, and right hip.
She has tried and failed multiple chemotherapy regimens, now cycle 1, day 16 of Herceptin/Xeloda 2) Anxiety 3) Hypertension (has been on lisinopril but stopped on own) 4) s/p appendectomy 5) Hypothyroidism   Social History: Social history is significant for no tobacco since [**2165**].
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Her father died of a AAA rupture.
There is a history of cancer in multiple family members.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS: T 97.8 , BP 162/84, HR 116, RR 29, O2 99 % on 4L Gen: Well attired, appropriately groomed middle aged woman in NAD HEENT: NC,AT; Sclera anicteric, PERRL, EOMI; conjunctivae non-injected; oropharynx benign without pallor, petechiae, or exudates Neck: Supple with no JVD appreciated, Port-a-cath noted in Left chest, site is non-tender and C/D/I CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line; Tachycardic but regular rhythm with normal s1 and s2, no m/r/g Chest: Respirations unlabored without accessory muscle use; on auscultation there are no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales but there are decreased breath sounds at the right base Abd: Obese, soft, NT, ND; No HSM or masses appreciated.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: MEDICAL DECISION MAKING EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with rate of 123 with normal intervals and axis and no ST or T wave abnormalities appreciated but overall low voltage.
The tachycardia and low voltage are new when compared with prior dated from [**2185**].
TELEMETRY demonstrated:Sinus tachycardia .
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion measuring 2-3cm anterior to the right ventricle and 1.5-2.5cm around the apical and lateral left ventricle and 1.5cm inferior to the left ventricle.
There is right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology.
Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.)
female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with shortness of breath and found to have a large pericardial effusion as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
# Cardiac tamponade: The patient had a large (2-3 cm) pericardial effusion on echo and demonstrated tamponade physiology.
Patient had 670 cc of serosanguinous fluid drained from her pericardium and a drain left in place on the night of admission.
She tolerated this procedure well with minimal pain afterward.
There was some interval improvement in her shortness of breath with the procedure, though she continued to be somewhat dyspneic, probably due to her continued pleural effusions.
With confirmation that this was a malignant effusion further management was discussed with her primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**], who felt placement of pericardial window would be reasonable given the likelihood that this would re accumulate.
This was performed on [**2198-7-27**] by the thoracic surgery service and after which she was transferred to their service as she had no structural heart disease and a normal EF and thus no active cardiac issues.
Her pain was managed with PO pain medication.
# O2 requirements/Cough:  The patient had a persistent oxygen requirement and cough after having her pericardiocentesis.
This was thought most likely due to continued pleural effusions.
There was interval worsening of these effusions in the hospital possibly due to fluid resuscitation vs continuing disease.
On [**2198-7-26**] a CT chest was performed which better demonstrated a large right sided pleural effusion.
# Breast Cancer: On day 16 of Herceptin/Xeloda at presentation and on drug holiday.
Disp:*50 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] [**Hospital 269**] homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Malignant pericardial effusion Malignant pleural effusion Metastatic carcinoma of the breast .
Secondary Diagnoses - Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were short of breath.
This was most likely due to the fluid around your heart and lungs.
