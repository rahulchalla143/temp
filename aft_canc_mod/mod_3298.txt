Several streaks of air in the right colon suspicious for pneumatosis.
MRI LUE [**2134-9-25**] at LGH showed: Extensive SC edema which may represent cellulitis.
Extensive edema within the muscles of the posterior compartment of the LUE may represent myositis.
Findings of diffuse small bowel dilatation up to 4.5 cm with segments of decreased bowel wall enhancement, pneumatosis of the small bowel and cecum, mesenteric edema, free fluid and celiac axis origin stenosis concerning for ischemic small and right sided large bowel.
Diverticulosis of the descending and sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
Complex small pericardial effusion might represent hemopericardium.
**FINAL REPORT [**2134-10-4**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2134-9-28**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.

TTE [**2134-9-29**] showed: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global LV hypokinesis.
There may be a small mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve - best seen on image #45.
It could be a scallop of the mitral valve or an acoustic artifact or a small vegetation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is seen.
TEE [**2134-9-30**] showed: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.

Fluid along the superficial fascial planes of the biceps and brachialis muscles.
No deeper fluid or organized fluid collections.
Degenerative changes of the left shoulder.
Bilateral pleural effusions, with collapse of left lower lobe and atelectasis of the right lower lobe, incompletely evaluated.

Small ascites.
Mild anasarca.
Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis again showed pneumatosis coli, and on the [**2134-9-28**], he was brought to the operating theater where necrotic right colon was found and resected.
Echocardiogram showed no vegetations.
He was extubated with post-extubation atrial fibrillation with RVR and pulmonary edema, intractable to diltiazem gtt, improved with metoprolol boluses, switched to amiodarone gtt.
The ostomy nurse followed him closely during his stay as he had a little superficial necrosis and some skin separation at the mucocutaneous fistula from 8 - 3 o'clock approx 0.2 cm with minimal depth.
There was a 2 cm depth at 3 o'clock with fascia intact.
He was treated with a course of Daptomycin which ended on [**2134-10-8**] and he was afebrile with a normal WBC.
He received 7 UPC during his hospitalization, the most recent being on [**2134-10-8**] for a hematocrit of 23 and complaints of fatigue and lethargy.
