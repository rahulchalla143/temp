Aside from severe scarring and radiation-induced bronchiectasis in the left upper lung, lungs are clear.
Preoperative leftward tracheal deviation due to this scarring is partially obviated by the left pleural effusion.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post device closure of the ASD There is no flow demonstrable across the interatrial septum with color flow doppler.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Successful placement of Perclose Proglide in left femoral arteriotomy.
