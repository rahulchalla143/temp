It showed a new large left cerebellar brain mass with ring enhancement.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
No dysmetria noted.
A small hypodensity is seen in the region to the surgery with small areas of blood products from surgery.
No large hematoma or interval new blood products are seen.
There remains some mass effect on the left side of the fourth ventricle, which is unchanged.
A right frontal ventricular drain extends to the third ventricle which is unchanged and minimal prominence of temporal horns is also unchanged.
Overall no significant change in the mass effect on the fourth ventricle without evidence of new hemorrhage.
The previously seen left cerebellar enhancing lesion has been resected.
There is persistent cerebellar edema and mass effect on the left ambient cistern with evidence of upward transtentorial herniation.
There is a thin left subgaleal fluid collection, measuring up to 6 mm in thickness, containing fluid and air.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is susceptibility artifact within the right lateral ventricle, consistent with air.
Following contrast administration, there is faint enhancement at the edge of the resection cavity, which could be seen in the postoperative setting, however continued followup to rule out recurrence is recommended.
Status post resection of left cerebellar lesion with small amount of blood products in the surgical bed and faint enhancement at the edge of the cavity, which may be related to post-surgical/inflammatory changes, however continued followup is recommended to rule out residual tumor.
Small subgaleal postoperative fluid collection.
Persistent edema in the left cerebellum with a mass effect on the ambient cistern.
Head CT [**7-10**]: FINDINGS" There has been an interval left occipital craniectomy with mesh in place overlying the left cerebellum.
There is expected pneumocephalus and high attenuation material within the resection cavity consistent with blood products.
There is expected pneumocephalus and air within the right lateral ventricle.
There is no major midline shift.
Outside of the resection site, there is a now new hemorrhage.
There is no edema outside the resection site.
IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes with no significant shift of midline structures or abnormal dilatation of ventricles.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Neurosurgery service started on Decadron for a new brain mass he underwent a torso CT to assess for any sign of malignancy which was negative.
He was monitored in the ICU for three days, treated with antihypertensives and slow EVD wean.
He complained of neck pain, from the incision fo which he was started on Valium.
Post operative MRI showed complete resection.
Differential diagnosis included: hemangioblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma pathology is pending.
Overnight he had no difficulties only neck incision pain, he ambulated without difficulty and was tolerating a regular diet.
Diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for neck pain/spasm.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
