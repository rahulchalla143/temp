# Tachypnea and respiratory distress - CXR during acute hypoxic event showed pulmonary edema vs. aspiration.
The initial differential included acute heart failure, ARDS, aspiration, or CAP.
Cardiac orgin was of highest concern given her inability to report chest pain, a prior history of MI and a new LBBB in ED.
Enzymes were not intially available however admission labs had been notable for an elevated AST in presence of normal ALT.
ASA, heparin gtt and IV lopressor were also initiated prior to results for high suspicion of ACS.
Labs showed elevated cardiac enzymes with CK 1536, MB 116, MBI 7.6 and TN-T 6.51 and ECG showed LBBB with ST depressions in lateral leads.
