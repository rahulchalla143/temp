Briefly, the patient is a 74 year old male with B cell lymphoma, status post four cycles of chemotherapy, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 536**] on [**2107-5-2**], with approximately ten days of fevers.
No organisms grew from his blood cultures, nor from his sputum cultures.
He experienced respiratory decompensation one week after admission and CT scan of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities.
Video assisted fluoroscopy with biopsy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Post extubation one week ago, he had done well and had not experienced any respiratory distress.
He still has occasional blood tinged sputum and occasionally will desaturate to around 90% oxygen but he has a good cough and is always able to cough up secretions (he also is always aware if he has any plugging).
He spiked a fever on [**2107-5-19**], and chest x-ray showed right mid lung zone infiltrates likely representing aspiration pneumonia.
He has done well and has not spiked any fever since then.
These values are all felt due to bone marrow toxicity from his chemotherapy.
He does not have any history of coronary artery disease so this level of hematocrit is acceptable.
On telemetry, he often has asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia to the mid 40s at night.
For his diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, he was switched from intravenous to oral steroids on [**2107-5-23**].
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Respiratory failure requiring intubation.
