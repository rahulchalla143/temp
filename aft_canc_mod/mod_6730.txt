History of Present Illness: 67 year old female with past medical history of metastatic lung cancer with spinal metastases had L1 anterior resection on [**8-24**] and then posterior fusion on [**8-28**] transferred to medicine for management of elevated INR and pain.
The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2113-11-18**] on work-up for back pain.
Patient presented to [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital with worsening back pain in [**Month (only) 205**] and underwent hyphoplasty on [**2114-8-7**].
Biopsy was negative at that time for metastatic disease.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening pain and recieved anterior approach resection/cage on [**8-24**] with posterior fusion of L1 on [**8-28**].
Imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] is suspicious for metastatic disease to T10, T11 and L1 on MRI.
Throughout her hospital course here at [**Hospital1 18**], patient has had pain on her right hip/thigh that has been constant.
She states no aggravating/relieving factors.
The pain has been treated as neuropathic.
Of note, she has had nausea for the past 3-4 days limiting her ability to tolerate PO intake.

| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S NITROFURANTOIN--------  <=16 S TETRACYCLINE----------  =>16 R VANCOMYCIN------------   <=1 S   Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with PMhx of Lung Cancer, (s/p right upper lobectomy, middle lobe wedge resection, 4 cycles chemo + adjuvent radiation) with lower back and right hip pain since [**6-26**] (s/p kyphoplasty) transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of lower back pain and possible metastases to the spinal column at L1.
# Lower Back Pain - Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital for evaluation by Ortho Spine for possible intervention for her new L1 compression fracture.
Pateint was initially treated for her pain with Dilaudid PCA while undergoing evaluation.
Palliative care was instrumental in detailing an effective pain management plan.
The procedure did not have any complications.
Pain was fairly well controlled.
Again, there were no complications with this procedure.
Pain was managed with dilaudid PCA.
The patients lower back pain gradually improved after this second procedure.
# Right Hip Pain - Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred with another pain complaint involving her right hip and radiating down her anterior thigh and into her groin, not travelling below the knee.
After evaluation by multiple services, the pain was thought likely to be in the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
Post-op CT did not point to any specific pathology consistent with her pain distribution but the right psoas muscle had a fluid collection that could be consistent with post-op inflammation or infection.
Initially pain management for this right hip pain was with dilaudid PCA, as above, with low dose neurontin.
After her procedures, the right hip pain exceeded any pain from her back.
Chronic pain service was consulted prior to discharge to consider a nerve block or cryo to the affected nerve.
Again, there was notation that fluid collection near right psoas muscle was concerning for infection as well as a new tumor that was infiltrating the right L1/L2 forama, possibly compressing L1--which more acurately described her L1 distribution pain syndrome .
Ultimately, an MRI T- and L-spine with contrast were done to rule in/out infection.
MRI showed no infection of the psoas, but instead tumor infiltrating the psoas as well as into the epidural space with ventral cord compression.
Instead, Rad-Onc was called for possible radiation therapy.
The idea was discussed with Ortho who agreed to radiation within a 3 week operative window due to symptoms and good wound healing to date.
# Metastatic Lung Cancer - Patient was treated for primary lung cancer from [**Month (only) 404**]-[**2114-5-18**].
After admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the results of OSH's biopsy of pt's Left Iliac Crest indicated adenocarcinoma consistent with primary lung.
Due to quick failure s/p chemo and poor functional status during this admission, the patient was not considered for further chemotherapy.
On [**9-13**], she was discharged to home hospice with follow-up planned with her outpatient oncologist for management of possible palliative radiation.
# Pulmonary Embolism - After Mrs.[**Known lastname 82814**] first surgery, she was noted to be tachycardic.
She had some low-grade fevers, but no signs of infection.
Initially, she was treated for her sinus tachycardia with a beta-blocker.
After her second procedure on [**8-28**], she remained tachycardic and was transferred to the Internal Medicine service for an unrelated elevated INR.
She continued to be tachycardic and it was attributed to pain.
Due to the tachycardia and fever, bilateral LENI's were done, which were negative for DVT.
3 days post-operatively from her second procedure, patient became tachycardic into 150's and triggered.
CTA chest showed subsegmental PE bilaterally.
# Fever - Patient had intermittent low-grade fever throughout her admission after her operative procedures.
Likely multifactorial, but include PE, malignancy, post-operative atelectasis or infection.
Additionally, CXR had no acute changes and CT spine showed right paraspinal mass and not psoas infection.
MRI TL-spine was doen and showed no infection, but instead rapidly progressive tumor.
She also became hypotensive, requiring Levophed for a brief time until resuscitated with fluids.
# Tachycardia - Patient remained tachycardic after initial procedure on [**8-24**].
Tachycardia was felt to be multi-factorial due to poorly controlled pain, PE, and possible hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.
Tachycardia improved after initiation of heparin for PE with intermittant elevation in heart rate when pain was not controlled.
Patient remained mildly tachycardic throughout her admission.
# Rising INR: Patient with acute change in INR from [**8-28**] to [**8-29**].
Possibility for nutritional deficiency given poor PO intake, intermittent Abx for periop PPx, low albumin, low BUN.
# Anemia - Patient admitted with normal Hct, however in light of two surgeries, patient developed a mild anemia.
Due to operative blood loss on [**8-28**], patient was transfused 2 units PRBC's.
All imaging throughout admission was negative for acute hemorrhage.
