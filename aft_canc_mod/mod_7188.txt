FINDINGS: Persistent right middle, right lower, and left lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged.
A moderately large left pleural effusion is stable.
The right pneumothorax is moderate in size, relatively unchanged since [**2164-4-30**], a right hydropneumothorax, best seen on the lateral projection on yesterday's radiograph appears loculated and persists on the current study.
The nasogastric tube and median sternotomy wires are unchanged in satisfactory position.Extensive subcutaneous emphysema has slightly decreased in severity.
Persistent right middle and lower lobe and left lower lobe collapse.
Moderate left pleural effusion.
Cardiac echo: [**2164-4-23**] Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal akinesis to dyskinesis (the apex is not well seen).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Preop carotid studies showed a 50-99% right carotid stenosis and a stable 40-50% stenosis on the left.
She continued having chest pain with EKG changes at rest and was waiting for a plavix washout.
She was slow to wake from anesthesia and was extubated early in the morning of POD#1.
She had been weaned off Epi but then she had a decreased cardiac output.
An echo revealed dysynchrony of the septum and she was restarted on Epi and Milrinone was added.
on [**4-20**] she developed atrial fibrillation at a rapid rate which was alternating with a junctional rhythm.
She also developed a right pneumothorax and had a chest tube placed.
She developed subcutaneous emphysema over the next day which eventually required intubation.
Throughout this time she remained on low dose milrinone and had an intermittent junctional rhythm.
She had a swallowing evaluation and did not tolerate any solids or liquids.
The following morning she had a 15 second pause after she had a run of rapid AF and was transferred back to the ICU.
She continued to have pauses and had a [**Company 1543**] DDD pacemaker placed.
