He also felt dizzy and lightheaded occasionally.
He denied vomiting or bloody stools.
His EKG showed rapid Afib.
He had a CXR that showed a RLL opacity, consistent with mucoid impaction.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea or wheezing.
Denies constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.

Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals:  98.2  84  95/60  17  95%/RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, II/VI systolic murmur at RUSB, no extra heart sounds.
Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding  GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, gait deferred.
The right lung base linear opacity is similar to multiple prior examinations, compatible with chronic mucoid impaction.
Known right lower lobe nodule is not clearly visualized on this exam.
Small right pleural effusion is present, similar to prior.
No radiopaque foreign body.
Multilevel thoracic spine degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung linear opacity, similar to prior and likely reflects chronic mucoid impaction.
Small right pleural effusion is also similar to prior.

At time of discharge, pt was clinically stable with resolution of neutropenia.
# Afib with RVR: - The patient has a history of Afib s/p DCCV in [**5-/2146**] and is on disopyramide for rhythm control and metoprolol for rate control.
Fever and neutropenia likely precipitating factors.
No role for cardioversion unless pt is hemodynamcially unstable.
- Continue disopyramide.
- telemetry; reviewed EKG with cardiology, who reports no acute issues with EKG findings.
# Hypotension: resolved with IVF and rate control; maybe associated with infection.
# Febrile neutropenia: Resolved [**2146-9-17**].
- Likely urinary source with e coli (essentially pan-sensitive) in urine.
Post VATS CXR shows RLL field opacity, likely associated with resection.
# Hyponatremia: Resolved due to hypovolemia.
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Stable.
# Hyperlipidemia - continue pravastatin  Patient will follow up with oncology and cardiology as instructed.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to infection from having a low immune system due to the chemotherapy for lung cancer.
You also had complications of a rapid heart rate due to atrial fibrillation.
A urine source of infection was discovered and you were treated with appropriate IV antibiotics, and you will complete an additional 3 day course of oral antibiotics while at home.
Your heart rate was also very fast and needed aggressive intervention with multiple medications.
If you have any questions or concerns please call the office.
