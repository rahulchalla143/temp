Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male with hx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension who was admitted s/p elective PVI for altered mental status in setting of labile HTN.
# Altered Mental Status Thought to be hypertensive encephalopathy on presentation.
Patient was noted to have altered mental status s/p elective PVI.
He was noted to be somnolent with visual field changes and global aphasia.
Head CT was negative for bleed but showed a CVA of indeterminate age; pt has known hx of CVAs.
MRI showed no signs of PRES or CVA.
MRA showed no flow-limiting lesions.
He was re-intubated for airway protection in setting of altered mental status and transferred to the CCU for monitoring.
Once transferred to the floor, the patient had a vasovagal episode in the setting of low blood pressure with somnulance that was slow to clear.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Patient has hx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is s/p elective PVI.
No complications during procedures, bilat groin sites without bruit or hematoma.
# Severe Hypertension Patient has history of labile, difficult to control blood pressures.
A brief workup for HTN was done.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
# Low Back and Coccyx Pain Patient has a history of spinal stenosis for which he has had chronic pain and has taken vicodin at home.
He had continued severe pain in his back and coccyx and was unable to walk for two days before discharge.
No acute changes were noted but the Ortho team felt pt would benefit from an outpt MRI of spine to r/o worsening of known spinal stenosis.
Pain was moderately well controlled on oxycodone, tylenol ATC, Lidoderm patch and Tramadol [**Hospital1 **].
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation Severe Hypertension Low back pain, Spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had a pulmonary ablation and was very slow to wake up after anesthesia.
There was no evidence of an acute stroke on any of your tests.
You had low back pain after you woke up that we feel is because of your spinal stenosis and possibly from a coccyx injury 1 week ago.
You will also take Tramadol and Tylenol on a regular basis to keep the pain from getting worse.
If you notice that your back pain is worsening and the oxycodone is not helping, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7389**].
Take 5 mg oxycodone every 4 hours for your back pain, if the pain is very severe, you can take 2 tablets (10 mg) 2.
Take Tyleonol every 6 hours and Tramadol twice a day to prevent the pain from getting severe.
