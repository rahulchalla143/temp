Admission Date:  [**2138-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-1-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2138-3-19**]: Right Craniotomy for tumor   History of Present Illness: This is a 82 year old female with a 10 day history of left facial droop and left arm weakness.
She had left arm numbess.
She had no new difficulty walking but she reported a baseline gait disturbance for 10 years where she favors the left side.
Language: Speech slightly dysarthric at times, good comprehension and repetition.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Left Lower extremity and right upper and lower extremities are [**6-5**] in all muscle groups.
Sensation: loss of light touch sensation in left upper extremity, decreased sensation in left lower extremity, Normal sensation on right upper and lower to light touch.
Coordination: dysmetria on left finger-nose-finger, normal on right  Exam upon discharge: A&Ox3 PERRL EOMs intact Subtle L sided facial droop LUE grasp 5-/5, L biceps 5-/5, otherwise full L pronator drift Incision c/d/i  Pertinent Results: [**2138-3-11**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis No evidence of mass lesion or lymphadenopathy in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
[**2138-3-13**]:CTA head 3.5 transverse x 3.1 AP x 2.6 CC cm right parietal mass with adjacent edema and mass effect similar to recent MRI.
[**2138-3-17**] Functional MR [**Last Name (Titles) 47159**] mass lesion centered in the lower aspect of the right frontal lobe with vasogenic edema extending in the parietal region, apparently unchanged since the prior head CT dated [**2138-3-13**].
The ASL technique demonstrates hyperperfusion in the tumor capsule, more significant in the anterior and lateral aspect of this lesion.
The functional MRI demonstrates poor activation in the primary motor cortex during the movement of the left hand with supplementary areas in the left frontal lobe, no significant activity (BOLD), is demonstrated adjacent to the mass lesion during the movement of the left hand, and left foot.
The language paradigm demonstrates the majority of the activation on the left opercular region, likely related with dominance.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave change.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 104 152 86 326/403 59 29 28  [**2138-3-19**] MR head Limited study re-demonstrating the 3.4 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm intra-axial mass in the right frontotemporal region, as detailed above.
Post-surgical thin right frontoparietal and left parietal subdural hematomas, as well as right frontoparietal and left frontal subdural pneumocephalus causing displacement of the frontal lobes- attention on close followup as clinically indicated.
Right parietal surgical cavity with surrounding vasogenic edema (from tumor, ischemia/infarction/post-surgical changes)causes midline shift to the left by about 2.5 mm and effacement of the sulci of the right cerebral hemisphere.
Unchanged left parietal and right frontoparietal thin hematomas with vasogenic edema ( from tumor/ischemia-infarction/post-surgical changes) surrounding a surgical evacuation site in the right parietal region.
Residual rim enhancement at the resection margin may represent postoperative change or residual tumor and interval followup with perfusion imaging is recommended.
Linear focus of decreased diffusion extending centrally from the resection may relate to a small focus of infarction/ post-surgical changes.
3.Mild meningeal enhancement.
She remained with left facial droop, left pronator drift and weakness L grip.
She underwent CTA of the head to determine the vascular supply of this right parietal lesion to help with surgical planning.
On [**3-17**] she underwent a functional MRI without difficulty.
She was prepared for surgery and underwent surgical resection on [**3-19**] without complication.
She was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU for post-operative monitoring.
She had a post-op head CT which showed no acute hemorrhage and expected post-op changes.
Around 4am she was noted to be plegia with her LUE and a STAT head CT was obtained which showed no change.
On morning rounds of [**3-20**] her LUE was grossly [**3-8**] and she had a left facial droop.
She had a post-operative MRI of the brain which showed rim enhancement and expected post operative changes as well as vasogenic edema.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] at [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right brain mass   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-10**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and/or a wound check.
