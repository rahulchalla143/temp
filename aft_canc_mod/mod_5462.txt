She was transferred from [**Hospital6 42638**] last night with the question of an obstructing lesion at the end of her tracheostomy tube.
Past Medical History: 1. thyroid cancer dx in [**3-/2173**]- Papillary cancer with positive nodes status post sternotomy and partial right and total left thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**].
Prior to this, the patient had neck swelling for 2 days which occurred in conjunction with administration of Actos for newly diagnosed diabetes.
A CT scan of the chest and neck revealed a goiter with airway compression.
TSH was elevated at 7.13.
Path showed the patient to have papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with extrathyroidal invasion and nodal involvement, status post rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement on [**2173-4-14**], status post open tracheostomy on [**2173-4-16**], status post bronchoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2173-5-3**].
2. s/p trach for tracheal stenosis 3.
Pansensitive enterococcus in urine [**4-12**] 5.
Nosocomial PNA [**4-12**]: nosocomial pneumonia with sputum cultures positive for Acinetobacter, pan-resistant, as well as Enterobacter cloacae, pansensitive, treated with imipenem and tobra 7. atrial flutter during last hospitalization 8. newly diagnosed DM 9.
HTN 10.sinusitis diagnosed during last admission 11. h/o R PTX last hospitalization requiring CT placement (d/c'd) 12.
?hypoxic brain injury with paresis and cognitive deficit 13.
Apparently she was independent with mobility and basic ADL prior to her last hospitalization.

TECHNIQUE: Videotaped oropharyngeal swallowing study.
Various consistencies of barium were administered orally.
With all consistencies, the patient showed limited laryngeal elevation and a lack of epiglottic deflection.
There was some spill-over with all consistencies as well, including delayed aspiration of residue, to a trace to mild extent, of both thin liquids and pudding.
IMPRESSION: Trace-to-mild aspiration with multiple consistencies, with ineffective cough clearance.

Pt was admitted to OSH with worsening SOB and increased upper airway secretions, thought to have URI.
PMH includes thyroid CA, tracheal stenosis with trach, UTI, PNA, DM, HTN, possible hypoxic brain injury, CVA, asthma, B-cell lymphoma s/p chemo, hiatal hernia.
Pt was unable to tolerate placement of the Passy Muir Valve due to severe upper airway obstruction which prohibited her from being able to exhale adequately via the upper airway (nose and mouth) around the tracheostomy tube.
With regards to swallowing, the pt had FEES exam completed on [**2173-5-31**] that revealed "moderate pharyngeal dysphagia at with overt aspiration of secretions, thin and nectar thick liquids.
While aspiration of puree material could not be confirmed due to limited appreciated of the trachea and vocal cords, there was frank penetration of purees, indicative of risk for aspiration with this consistency as well.
The pt's limited abduction of the arytenoid cartilages made it difficult to appreciate vocal cord movement, but also made it highly unlikely that the pt could tolerate a speaking valve or even finger occlusion, regardless of the current trach tube."
We were consulted this admission for a Passy Muir Speaking Valve.
However, it was noted on the bronchoscopy completed on [**2173-8-21**] that there was "supraglottic edema" though the vocal cords looked "functional and normal in appearance".
There was  stenosis around the entry site of the tube and the bronchoscope could not be passed "alongside the tracheostomy tube even with the cuff down on the tracheostomy tube".
The bronchoscope was passed "down the tracheostomy tube" where "absolutely no stenosis or foreign body occluding either the lumen of the tube or the airway of the distal trachea down to the segmental airway level bilaterally" was appreciated.
Given the pt's prior h/o inability to tolerate the Passy Muir Valve with this current trach tube, supraglottic edema, and the limited airspace around the trach tube such that the bronchoscope could not be advanced around the trach tube, it is not felt that the pt will be able to tolerate the PMV at this time.
for be unable to tolerate the PMV at this time given her stenosis and her current trach tube.
Additionally, given the documented supraglottic edema, I discussed that I could not be sure that she would be able to exhale out the pharynx even if she had adequate airflow around particular trach that would be inserted, just that the pt was scheduled for a bronch/trach change today.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy, supraglottic edema, subglottic edema and tracheal stenosis.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was obtained, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] was brought to operating room thereafter where general anesthesia was employed by anesthesia in order to insure comfort and safety throughout the procedure.
As we approach her oropharynx with the tracheoscope there was redundant soft tissue at the level of the oropharynx, at the level of the supraglottic area the false vocal cords were edematous and difficult to visualize.
The tracheoscope was advanced into the vocal cords and we could appreciate an area of subglottic edema, mild stenosis.
The patient should remain with her current tracheostomy tube and should return to the special procedures unit within 4 to 6 weeks for a flexible bronchoscope and reassessment of her airway anatomy.
Pt was admitted to OSH with worsening SOB and increased upper airway secretions, thought to have URI.
We were initially consulted for a Passy Muir Valve, however the pt's prior h/o inability to tolerate the Passy Muir Valve with this current trach tube, the limited airspace around the trach tube such that the bronchoscope could not be advanced around the trach tube, and the current findings from yesterday's bronch that revealed supraglottic edema, subglottic edema and tracheal stenosis, it was felt that the pt would not be able to tolerate the PMV.
Palatal elevation was symmetrical.
Laryngeal elevation was difficult to palpate due to presence of the trach tube.
No coughing or throat clearing was appreciated.
Vocal quality cannot be assessed as the pt is unable to voice with her edema/stenosis.
No return of po material was appreciated via the trach tube after suctioning.
However, given her prior h/o aspiration and dysphagia and current tube feeding dependency, would recommend that the pt receive a video swallow study prior to any advancement to a po diet at this time.
Premature spillover was consistently seen into the pharynx prior to initiation of the swallow.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There was a mild to moderate delay in initiation of the pharyngeal swallow.
Laryngeal elevation was moderately reduced.
A spontaneous repeat dry swallow cleared this to a trace amount or a coating.
Aspiration occured after the swallow and it was due to trace residue mixing w/secretions and dropping into her airway.
Due to her trach which can not be capped with a Passy-Muir valve due to severe tracheobronchomalaica, she was unable to cough to clear material from the airway.
SUMMARY: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is not safe to take anything PO because small amounts of residue remaining in her mouth, on her base of tongue and in her valleculae mix with pharyngeal secretions causing a small amount of aspiration after the swallow with all consistencies.
She is unable to cough and clear the aspirated material because her trach can not be capped due to her severe tracheobronchomalacia.
