No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No other mass in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LV.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe free wall hypokinesis.
There is a echogenic mass in the right ventricle (6.8cm x 4.6cm, measured in 4 chamber view).
The mass is encroaching into the RVOT, and the pulmonic valve appears free from tumor.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no paravalvular leaks.
The RV cavity has some echogenic 1cm x 1cm masses which are consistent with papillary muscle.
There is no VSD or RV to pericardial leaks.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease.
There was no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension.
Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia in a pattern concerning for aspiration etiology.
Stable left superior mediastinal mass and multiple lung nodules as a result of metastatic melanoma.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed non-obstructive coronary disease.
On [**2171-12-6**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent removal/debulking or his right ventricular mass and replacement of his tricuspid valve with a tissue.
