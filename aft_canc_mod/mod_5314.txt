She was brought to OSH where a R-fibula fracture was noted as well as a L-thalamic bleed.
She denies headache, or pain in her extremities when she is laying (when moving her R leg is hurts though).
She denies nausea or vomiting; no chills or recent fevers.
ROS: denies any fever, chills, weight loss, visual changes, hearing changes, headache, neckpain, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, tingling, numbness, bowel-bladder dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.
ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended EXTREMITIES: extensive bruises and some laceration on the extr on the R. fracture R fibula  MENTAL STATUS: Awake somewhat lethargic, cooperative with exam.
Language: fluent; repetition: intact; Naming intact; Comprehension intact, but difficulties with complex tasks; mild dysarthria, no paraphasic errors.
[**Location (un) **]: intact; No Apraxia.
Disc margins sharp, no pappilledema.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, no fasciculations.
Mild postural tremor LUE  Full strength LUE and LLE.
Left  2  2  2  3  2 Toes: down on L; unable to test on the R due to fracture  SENSORY SYSTEM: Sensation intact to light touch, pin prick, temperature (cold), vibration, and proprioception in all extremities.
No significant midline shift identified.
There patchy hypodensities in the periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel ischemia more likely chronic.
- repeat head CT @2:10pm "17mm hemorrhage with a rim of edema but no significant resultant mass effect or intraventricular extension, essentially stable."
On admission: [**2179-3-18**] 01:15PM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-4.43 Hgb-11.9* Hct-37.5 MCV-85 MCH-26.8* MCHC-31.6 RDW-20.6* Plt Ct-247 [**2179-3-18**] 01:15PM BLOOD Neuts-89.0* Lymphs-5.2* Monos-5.6 Eos-0.2 Baso-0.1 [**2179-3-18**] 01:15PM BLOOD PT-12.9 PTT-23.8 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2179-3-18**] 01:15PM BLOOD Glucose-93 UreaN-73* Creat-6.1* Na-139 K-5.7* Cl-106 HCO3-20* AnGap-19 [**2179-3-18**] 01:15PM BLOOD ALT-19 AST-28 AlkPhos-69 TotBili-0.2  Other: Cholest-181 Triglyc-121 HDL-65 CHOL/HD-2.8 LDLcalc-92 %HbA1c-5.9 TSH-0.69  Imaging: x-rays: No bony injury to the shoulder, elbow, or wrist.
There is a cast over the lower leg and ankle obscuring fine bony detail.
No proximal fibular or other knee fracture is identified.
There is no joint effusion.
There is suggestion of chondrocalcinosis, likely from underlying calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.
There is clearly an oblique minimally displaced fracture of the lateral malleolus extending to the level of the tibial plafond.
There is also suggestion of a transverse fracture of the medial malleolus.
No further fracture is definitively identified.
IMPRESSION: Bimalleolar fracture externally reduced as above.
No definite mortise disruption.
Repeat: Distal fibular fracture on the current examination appears in adequate alignment.
Medial malleolar fracture obscured by overlying casting material.
Scattered calcific plaque is noted in the cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid artery.
Intracranially, consistent with the given history, there is a 17 mm diameter focal high attenuation consistent with hemorrhage centered over the posterior limb of the left internal capsule with a thin rim of surrounding low attenuation representing edema.
No significant mass effect results.
There is baseline mild age-appropriate global atrophy which accommodates the small hemorrhage.
Mild scattered foci of low attenuation are noted throughout the periventricular white matter likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is an ovoid low- attenuation focus in the region of the right choroidal fissure which likely represents a small neuroepithelial or arachnoid cyst.
IMPRESSION: Consistent with the given history, there is a small left hemorrhage involving the basal ganglia with a rim of edema but no significant resultant mass effect or intraventricular extension.
RUE u/s: Noncompressible vein in the right neck medial to carotid artery and internal jugular vein which connects into internal jugular vein, representing thrombosis probably in the superficial vein.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-3-18**] atrial fibrillation has appeared and the rate is increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 59yo handed woman with ESRD, HTN, bladder ca, Afib (thought to be off coumadin for procedure - but reports still taking it), hyperlipidemia, psychiatric disease who is transferred from OSH for L-thalamic bleed.
Also has R-fibular fracture.
On exam she has a low grade fever, is lethargic, and at times a bit inattentive.
She most likely had a hypertensive hemorrhage.
Vascular risk factors were evaluated; she was started on lipitor 10mg daily for elevated cholesterol and HbA1C was normal.
She had a drop in her blood pressure after hemodialysis and antihypertensives on [**3-24**], which resolved with lying down.
Psych: She was treated with her home dose of perphenazine (initially held to monitor her mental status).
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 246**] Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left caudate hemorrhage Right bimalleolar fracture Hypertension End stage renal disease Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable; still with right hemiparesis, some improving speech and improving movement of her right face.
Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have any chest pain, palpitations, difficulty breathing, new weakness, difficulty speaking, change in level of consciousness, fever, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
