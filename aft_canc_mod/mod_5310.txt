no flatus > 24hrs (but says doesnt usually pass much).
A KUB was done which showed dilated small bowel loops and airl fluid levels.
She has 8 children (4 sons, 4 daughters) all in [**Name (NI) **] or [**Location (un) **]   Family History: Mother with breast cancer in her 60's, died at age 80 of "old age", Father died of MI age 59, sister with protein losing enteropathy, brother with CAD  Physical Exam: afebrile, VSS NAD RRR, CTAB abd: soft, NT, no rebound no guarding, very distended/tympanitic no c/c/e   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: UA+ Na139  101  30  90 4.0  25  0.7  ALT: 12 AP: 182 Tbili:  Alb: 3.1 AST: 14 LDH: 166 Dbili:  TProt: 6.1 [**Doctor First Name **]: 54 Lip: 65 WBC6.6  12.6  428 HCT 39.1 PT: 12.1  PTT: 27.1  INR: 1.0  KUB: air fluid levels and idlated SB loops  CT [**2191-5-4**] IMPRESSION: 1.
High-grade small-bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right pelvis, very similar in appearance to the study of [**2191-3-8**].
Small amounts of ascites as described above.
Increase in the size of a lobulated right lower lobe lung lesion.
Two lung lesions are suspicious for malignancy, a 16-mm right upper lobe lesion contiguous with an area of partially-resolved pneumonia, unchanged since [**2191-2-25**] and a nearly 3 cm subpleural right lower lobe mass increased in size slightly in the interim.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema.
Multifocal pneumonia substantially cleared and pleural effusions decreased or resolved.
One small liver lesion warranting ulstrasound study.
[**5-16**] CXR  In comparison with the study of [**5-12**], the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially decreased.
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, much worse on the left.
Probable atelectatic changes at the bases, again more prominent on the left.
There is some patchy opacification just above the minor fissure on the right.
In view of the high fever, this could represent a developing pneumonia and should be carefully evaluated on subsequent studies.
[**5-17**] KUB Air-fluid levels are consistent with ileus; no evidence of complete bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to Red Surgery for management of her SBO and abdominal pain.
The patient failed conservative management, so the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and an EBL of 100cc.
Post operatively, the patient was hypotensive and started on a Neo drip, and she was then transfered to the TICU for further care.
On [**5-12**], she developed new AF w/RVR, was started on a dilt/lasix gtt, and an ECHO done was normal.
Furthermore, secondary to the patient's poor po intake, TPN was continued.
On [**5-20**] a PICC was replaced via IR without complication.
Upon discharge, the patient was afebrile with all vitals stable other than O2 saturation, ambulating on O2 independently, tolerating po feeds but still on TPN, and with pain controlled on po pain medication.
The patient progressed well with physical therapy, but the ultimate decision was made to d/c the patient home with oxygen [**2-26**] desaturations to the mid 80's on ambulation.
