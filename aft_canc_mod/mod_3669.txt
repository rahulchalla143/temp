In [**Month (only) 958**], she developed mid-abdominal pain.
She thought it was consistent with her previous diverticulitis.
At that time, she went to [**Hospital6 6640**] and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2140-3-26**] showed transverse colitis.
However, it also showed diffuse cystic replacement of the pancrease of uncertain etiology.
She stayed in the hospital for IV antibiotics and the abdominal pain abated.
It was recommended that the patient get an MRCP, however, she was unable to get that secondary to severe claustrophobia.
She had an ERCP done on [**2140-4-19**] which showed numerous areas of pancreatic ductal dilatation directly communicating with the pancreatic duct.
It also showed that the pancreatic duct was enlarged and slightly irregular in contour.
At that time, the differential diagnosis included an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

Her father nad with coronary disease and an aunt had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer versus a polyp.

Ascending thoracic aorta is dilated but mildly tortuous.
There is no pleural effusion.
In reviewing prior chest radiographs I note that the pre-operative study on [**2140-8-4**] may show a 1-cm wide pulmonary nodule projecting over the third left anterior interspace.
Brief Hospital Course: She went to the OR on [**2140-8-11**] for: Total Pancreatectomy with Splenectomy; Open Cholecystectomy; Open Liver Wedge Biopsy  Resp: She was admitted to the SICU for ventilation and hemodynamic support and monitoring after a prolonged 10 hour surgery.
On POD 5, she was noted to have crackles on exam about half way up and was given Lasix with good effect.
Pain: She was started on an Epidural and was having lots of pain issue and so a PCA was also started.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] for pancreatic insufficiency and he recommended [**5-15**] Creon20 caps with large meals and [**3-13**] caps with smaller meals.
