History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old man diagnosed with T3 N1 adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation who presents for elective esophagectomy.
Significant asbestos exposure in past.
Family History: Half-brother died of lung cancer at age 47.
Father died of leukemia at age 75.

Eleven lymph nodes, no carcinoma seen.
Subcarinal lymph node (R):  One lymph node, no carcinoma seen.
Paraesophageal lymph node (S):  One lymph node, no carcinoma seen.
Spleen, 75 grams (T-V):  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Histologic Grade:  Not applicable due to irradiation.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:  1 mm (Circumferential).
The grossly described nodule which measures 2.2 cm shows scattered tumor nests with very prominent fibroblastic reaction.
There are rare, small mucinous collections in the adventitia of the esophagus with no associated tumor cells as being evaluated by immunostains.
Clinical:  Esophageal cancer - status post chemotherapy.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]" and the medical record number and "esophagogastrectomy specimen" and consists of a segmental resection of esophagus and proximal stomach measuring 26 cm in length.
There is a stapled proximal resection margin measuring 2.5 cm in length and a stapled distal resection margin measuring 8.5 cm.
The specimen is opened to reveal a fungating pink tan mass measuring 2.2 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm at the GE Junction along the side of the greater curvature.
The mucosa from the GE junction appears tan, [**Location (un) 2452**] and irregular, suggestive of Barrett's esophagus and extends for 12 cm.
There is an irregular Z-line that lies 10 cm from the proximal resection margin.
It is bisected and entirely submitted in S.  Part 4 is additionally labeled "spleen" and consists of a 75 gram spleen measuring overall 8.5 x 6 x 2.5 cm.
The specimen is sectioned to reveal unremarkable beefy red cut surfaces.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The patient was resuscitated with crystalloid and packed red blood cells POD 1 due to low urine output.
He was maintained on a heparin drip for his paroxysmal afib and received nutrition via tube feeding.
On POD 16 he passed his bedside swallow evaluation for pureed foods and nectar thick liquids.
If signs of infections such as purulent discharge from wound, increased pain and redness at wound, please call or go to the emergency room.
If signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction, such as abdomenal pain with vomiting and distention, please go to the emergency room.
[**Month (only) 116**] have thickened fluids.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] to do so may result in dangerous levels of the anti-coagulation medication that can result in complications such strokes, internal bleeding, and easy bruising.
