RESP: Diffuse exp wheezes, b/l basilar rales.
CV: Distant heart sounds, nl s1 s2, no mrg.
No rebound or guarding.
EXT: 3+ pitting edema to thighs b/l SKIN: rash unchanged   Pertinent Results: ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CT chest ([**12-2**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral upper [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
2) Cavitary nodules within the right lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] with extensive lymphadenopathy involving the axilla, mesentery, and retroperitoneum.
Small hypodensity also seen within the spleen.
These findings raise the possibility of an infectious process, particularly a fungal infection, tuberculosis, or atypical organism.
Dedicated CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was recommended for further evaluation of the lymphadenopathy and to assess for extensive disease.
3) Small right pleural effusion.
4) Left hydronephrosis vs. peripelvic cyst.
[**2100-12-3**]: CT Abd CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated within the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] are three cavitating lesions with central areas of low attenuation, likely representing necrosis, unchanged since the prior exam.
A small right pleural effusion persists.
Additionally, in the lingula and left lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] are two tiny, less than 5 mm, pulmonary nodules seen, present in the prior study, which are nonspecific findings.
In the left kidney, there is a large parapelvic cyst which measures approximately 3.9 x 4.2 cm in greatest tranverse dimensions.
There is no hydronephrosis.
Additionally, on series 2, image 37, there is a second fat containing well defined lesion which appears to be in the wall of the duodenum which measures approximately 5 mm, which may represent a second duodenal lipoma.
The remainder of the small and large bowel appears unremarkable without evidence of wall thickening, bowel obstruction, or surrounding fat stranding.
There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
Several other of the fat containing lesions appear to be surrounded by soft tissue density, and may represent lymph nodes with central areas of fat.
One of these lesions is seen within the left periaortic region, best seen on series 2, image 55, which measures 3.5 x 3.3 cm.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen within the pelvis are several enlarged lymph nodes along the iliac chains.
Some of these lymph nodes appear to have tiny amounts of fat within them.
There is no free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, likley related to the known chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
However, some of the nodes appear to contain fat within them.
Additionally, there are several predominantly fat containing lesions scattered throughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum as well as possible duodenal lipomas.
cause of the fat within the nodes and mesenteric lesions is uncertain.
Low density(necrotic0 nodes can be seen in [**Doctor First Name **] or tuberculosis infection.
The presence of fat containing lymph nodes, however, is unusual for these atypical infections.
Fat containing lymph nodes can be seen in Whipples disease but this is not relevant to this patient and the small bowel is normal.
Given the patient's cavitary lesions within the right lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] atypical infectious process is favored in a setting of CLL.
Possible small lipomas within the duodenum.
Small right pleural effusion, stable since the prior exam.
Bilateral renal cysts.
[**2100-12-9**]: bronchial bx Right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] bronchial biopsy:         a.  Ulcerated bronchial mucosa with viral inclusions consistent            with herpes simplex infection.
No malignancy identified.
[**2100-12-9**]: bronchial brushings NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive bronchial epithelial cells, squamous epithelium,   neutrophils, red blood cells, pulmonary macrophages and   proteinaceous debris.
No viral cytopathic effect identified.
No organisms identified on silver stains .
[**2100-12-13**]: CTA CT CHEST WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST: There are residual small filling defects within the left upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] segmental pulmonary artery, as well as within the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and mid [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, markedly decreased in size in the interval.
No other filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
Calcified atheromatous changes are seen again within the aortic arch and descending aorta, and unchanged.
A small pleural effusion is again demonstrated on the right side, and unchanged.
There is centrilobular emphysema unchanged.
There are new ill-defined nodular opacities within the right upper and mid lobes that were not seen in the prior scan.
Again is seen extensive axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally and multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, consistent with the known diagnosis of CLL, unchanged.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
IMPRESSION:  1) New ill-defined nodular non-specific opacities within the right upper and middle [**Month/Day/Year 3630**].
2) Regression in size and number of filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature, improved PE.
3) Small right pleural effusion and posterior right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] cavitary lesion unchanged.
4) Lymphadenopathy consistent with the known diagnosis of CLL.
[**2100-12-15**] bronchial washings: Highly atypical squamous cells, pulmonary macrophages,   inflammatory cells, and fungal spores.
IMPRESSION: Gas filled loops of large and small bowel.
Given the patient's history, this is most in keeping with aspiration pneumonia.
But consideration to other forms of infection, or secondary to the patient's recent BAL procedure is given.
A right-sided subclavian line is in-situ, but there is no evidence of perivenous abnormality to suggest extravasation.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Background changes of extensive pan-lobular and inter-lobular emphysema are identified.
Bibasilar pleural effusions are identified, larger on the right.
In addition, atelectasis is identified bibasilarly , p[articularly within the right.
Within these areas of atelectasis in the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**], is again identified a focal rounded hypo-intense areas consistent with either pulmonary infarcts or cavity formation.
There is evidence of multiple moderate-to-large axillary lymph nodes, that are consistent with the patient's history of CLL.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are also identified.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  There is evidence of large and small bowel dilatation.
There is no evidence of an obvious transition point.
No evidence of bowel ischemia is identified, and no bowel masses are identified.
As before, multiple fat-filled lymph nodes are identified, as is a general haziness in the patient's mesentary consistent with lymphoma.
A small amount of free fluid is identified.
CT BONES W/CONTRAST  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormality is identified.
Interval development of significant air-space consolidation in the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**], worrisome for aspiration pneumonia, although consideration to other causes is also given.
Background bibasilar atelectasis/infarction with reactive pleural effusions is seen as before.
Interval development of significant large and small bowel dilatation, without evidence of a significant transition point, most consistent with ileus.
He also  experienced chills/rigors and flushing.
Chills, chest discomfort may occur in the first hour of the infusion and respond to cessation of the infusion for 30 minutes and resumption at a slower rate.
Fatigue, fever, or nausea after infusion may last up to 24 hours.
Other side effects include dizziness, leg or muscle cramps, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and wheezing.
However, given his complex medical history and respiratory and cardiac status, his underlying illness as a component cannot be entirely  excluded.
[**2100-12-25**] CT chest FINDINGS: There has been interval worsening of the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] pneumonia with new involvement of the anterior segment.
There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
There is a stable appearance of multiple moderate to large axillary lymph nodes, consistent with the patient's history of CLL.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are also stable.
CT BONES WITHOUT CONTRAST: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities identified.
IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of the air-space consolidation in the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] with areas of cavitation.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.
[**2100-12-29**]: skin bx Subcorneal/intraepidermal pustule with associated keratinocyte necrosis and overlying scale-crust (see note).
Note: Gram stain and PAS stains are negative for bacteria and fungi.
The changes are not specifically diagnostic, however the presence of individual cell necrosis of  keratinocytes raises the possibility of an herpetic infection.
There are numerous enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes again seen.
These are located within the prevascular, right paratracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and right and left hilar distributions.
In comparison with the previous examination, the degree of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy appears stable-to-slightly increased in prominence.
The largest of these, located in the left axilla, measures 1.6 x 2.1 cm (previously 1.8 x 2.5 cm), and contains internal hypodensity suggestive of necrosis.
The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.
There is prominent calcification of the thoracic aorta, consistent with atheromatous disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, right slightly greater than left.
The right pleural effusion appears decreased in size from the previous examination.
The left pleural effusion is stable.
There are multiple scattered nodular densities within the anterior segment of the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] (series 102-B, images 96 and 102), which appear unchanged from the previous examination.
Within the posterior aspect of the superior segment of the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**], there is again seen a focus of cavitary pneumonia, as well as additional peripheral nodular densities.
These are possibly consistent with additional foci of consolidation and infection, or, alternatively, necrotic areas of pulmonary parenchyma related to the patient's known prior pulmonary emboli.
Heterogeneous linear opacity at the left base is consistent with compressive atelectasis, although pneumonic consolidation within this area cannot be entirely excluded.
Additional pleural-based, peripheral opacities within the superior segment of the left upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] medially (series 102-B, image 84) may be consistent with peripheral atelectases vs. small foci of consolidation.
A nodular density within the left upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] laterally (series 102-B, image 92) appears unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Stable-to-slight improvement in cavitary pneumonia within the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and superior segment of the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**].
Peripheral based densities within the posterior aspect of the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**], possibly consistent with areas of pneumonia vs. pulmonary infarcts related to prior PE.
Decreased size of right pleural effusion.
Stable small left pleural effusion.
[**2101-1-3**]: KUB dilated loops of colon.
no free air in abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 71 yo man with pmh significant for CLL and COPD who originally developed SOB after discharge from OSH where was treated for COPD flare, was re-admitted to that hospital and found by CT to have pulmonary nodules with cavitation and multiple pulmonary emboli and by bronchoscopy to have lesions consistent with HSV.
Ultimately pt had a bronchoscopy here with BAL positive for aspergillus and pseudomonas; bronchial biopsy with HSV; and gram stain with gram positive cocci.
Unfortunately, while on the floor pt had a transient hypoxia, became tachypnic and agitated and was transfered back to the MICU within that same day where his respiratory status improved to baseline after diuresis.
After this stabilazation patient was felt again ready for transfer back to the floor on [**2100-12-24**] but after having some respiratory distress during infusion of IVIG (which he routinely receives for CLL treatment) it was decided that pt should stay in the MICU.
He subsequently recieved IVIG without incidence.
Shortly after this the patient developed a distended abdomen.
GI was consulted and colonoscopy was performed with diagnosis of ileus and treatment with decompression with rectal tube.
During this period the patient also developed a rash on his left lower extremity which Dermatology consultants biopsied and felt was associated with either bacterial or fungal infection.
Also during this period pt developed marked lower extremity edema thought secondary to increased IV fluid load on background of diastolic CHF.
Throughout the hospitalization pt was on heparin drip to treat the pulmonary emboli and was ultimately transitioned to coumadin.
Resp distress-Etiology of pt's respiratory distress is multifactorial [**3-8**] COPD, pseudomonas and aspergillus PNA, and PE.
Repeat Chest CT performed on [**1-2**] showed stable to slightly increased lymphadenopathy consistent with CLL and stable to slight improvement in cavitary PNA of RUL and superior segment of RLL.
Pt was treated for his respiratory distress as outlined by issues listed below.
COPD: Continue to treat COPD flare with albuterol, atrovent, Flovent, Spiriva, salmeterol.
PE: Recent chest CT from [**1-2**] showed peripheral based densities within the posterior aspect of the right lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**], possibly consistent with areas of pneumonia vs. pulmonary infarcts, related to prior PE.
Diastolic heart failure and LE edema - Pt became fluid overloaded after bronchoscopy with 3+ lower edema bilaterally.
[**12-20**] Abd CT scan showed diffuse dilated small and large bowel.
Of note, pt's dilantin levels are affected by his hypoalbuminemia and voriconazole.
Anemia/CLL- No evidence of GIB or hemolysis.
On [**12-23**], pt developed respiratory distress during dose of IVIG requiring him to stay in MICU.
Pt received another infusion thereafter, without incident.
Respiratory distress was most likely secondary to pt's other medication issues.
He became hypernatremic on fluid restriction w/TPN.
PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Chest CT Pt needs to get a chest CT 3 weeks later, prior to being seen in [**Hospital **] clinic   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: pulonary embolus COPD chronic lymphocytic leukemia Aspergillosis Pneumonia Pseudomonas Pneumonia Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Contact your physician if you develop any more trouble breathing, chest pain, leg pain.
