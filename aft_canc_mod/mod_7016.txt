Physical Exam: VS: T 98.6, BP 109/67, HR 79, RR 15, 99% NRB weaned down to 98% 3L nc GENERAL: Articulate, cachectic, appears sleepy HEENT: OP clear with dentures, no LAD, no thyromegaly or masses LUNGS: Rales bibasilar and halfway up left lung, secretions clear with coughing HEART: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur, prominent precordium, no r/g ABDOMEN: Discomfort with palpation over suprapubic area, soft, thin, normoactive BS, ND, NT EXTR: No c/c/e, 2+ DP pulses NEURO: Pain in feet bilaterally from ankles to toes, did not assess gait SKIN: Erythematous areas on arms  Pertinent Results: CXR [**2149-10-1**] FINDINGS:  There is interval development of right perihilar, right middle lobe and left lower lobe ill-defined opacities.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Heart appears mildly prominent, as compared to prior study, likely related to technique.
IMPRESSION:  Interval development of bilateral opacities which could represent aspiration versus atypical pneumonia, which in this HIV positive patient, can represent pneumocystis pneumonia.
CXR [**2149-10-3**] Interval increase in right lower lobe infiltrate is demonstrated with no significant change in left perihilar and lower lobe infiltrates.
Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of congestive heart failure is present.
There is no pneumothorax.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes and regional/global systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Repeat CXR [**2149-10-7**] Multifocal opacities demonstrate improvement, specifically improvement of the right lower lobe apical segment and left lower lobe consolidation.
Findings are consistent with multifocal bronchopneumonia, probably bacterial and potentially due to aspiration.
Additional considerations include Nocardia and fungal infection.
Small left-sided pleural effusion.
Small right pericardial fluid collection likely represents a pericardial cyst.

Bilateral aspiration pneumonia secondary to respiratory depression/intoxication: The patient was status post admission at [**Hospital1 112**] where he was intubated for hypoxemia, found to have a bilateral aspiration PNA, and started on levo/flagyl starting [**2149-9-27**], but left AMA on [**2149-9-30**] after not being given his home dose of fentanyl patches.
CXR showed multifocal PNA.
Patient was restarted on antibiotics, starting with vanc/levo/flagyl and patient improved to having O2 sats of 95% on 2L, afebrile with Tmax 99.4.
On the medical floor, he was still spiking low grade fevers on levo/flagyl, so restarted on vancomycin.
All blood cultures and urine cultures were negative for bacteria.
On [**2149-10-7**], ID was consulted after the patient continued to spike more low grade fevers or unknown origin.
Several samples for induced sputum was also sent which was contaminated by epithelial cells for a proper culture and gram [**Last Name (LF) 2733**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no organisms were isolated.
Induced sputum were negative for AFB and negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient improved symptomatically and stopped spiking fevers on 4 days of vancomycin/zosyn/azithomycin.
CT chest taken on [**2149-10-7**] showed multifocal bronchopneumonia, probably bacterial and potentially due to aspiration.
He also had incidental findings of a small pericardial fluid collection, likely a pericardial cyst.
Three days prior to discharge, the patient was switched to an oral regimen of levofloxacin and flagyl, to which he continued to improve symptomatically was afebrile for greater than 48 hours.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] where he can be followed up on resolution of the pneumonia and also for further evaluation of the pericardial fluid collection.
Thrombocytosis - The patient was found to have a likely reactive thrombocytosis throughout his hospital stay.

Further management of his pain control would be managed as an outpatient by his PCP and infectious disease physician.

He had no sources of bleeding or bruising.
Stool guiac negative.
Hemolysis panel was also negative.
Hypotension - The patient's SBP ranged between 80-90s during his hospital stay, which per patient, was his baseline.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Alcohol abuse Secondary diagnosis: Hypotension, at baseline Human immunodeficiency virus infection Hepatitis C Anemia Peripheral neuropathy Pancreatitis Gastrointestinal reflux disease History of substance use  Discharge Condition: Good.
No shortness of breath on ambulation, no fever for 48 hours on oral antibiotic regimen.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with worsened fever, chills, cough from your pneumonia when you were off antibiotic treatment.
Your pneumonia was likely due to aspiration after having depressed respiratory function from a substance overdose.
You were switched to oral antibiotics and then transferred to the general medicine floor where you continued to have low grade fevers so we restarted the IV antibiotics for several days and did a workup to make sure you had no other source of infection, which you did not.
While you were here, you had discussions with our social worker regarding following up on the substance use.
If you experience any new or worrisome symptoms such as fever, chills, increased shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, lightheadedness please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or return to the hospital.
