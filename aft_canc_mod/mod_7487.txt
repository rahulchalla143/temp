C/o vertiginous symptoms.
She had a head CT that showed cerebral mass.

Intra- versus extra-axial location of this mass is difficult to determine.
Hypodensity in the surrounding cerebellum is present, likely representing edema, with a focal hyperdensity superiorly (2:12).
Mass causes mild effacement of the fourth ventricle which is displaced towards the right and asymmetry of the quadrigeminal plate cistern.
No downward or upward herniation is visualized.
No abnormality is seen of the subjacent osseous structures.
Well-defined hypodensity in the anterior left frontal lobe is compatible with an old infarction.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No fracture is identified.
The visualized paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities, and mastoid air cells appear patent.
IMPRESSION: Large left posterior fossa lesion, most compatible with a mass.
Probable adjacent cerebellar edema with a focal hyperdensity superiorly.
The lesion causes mild effacement and right lateral shift of the fourth ventricle and asymmetry of the quadrigeminal plate cistern.
No evidence of metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Post-surgical changes within the left lower lobe from prior resection with adjacent atelectatic lung.
There is a small adjacent loculated pleural effusion.
Prominence of the intrahepatic biliary ducts and common bile duct may relate to gallbladder resection, however, correlation with liver function tests is recommended to exclude obstruction.
Intermediate density right renal cyst is likely proteinaceous, however, further characterization with ultrasound is recommended.
MRI Brain [**2106-7-16**]: FINDINGS:  There is a heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in the left cerebellar hemisphere measuring 4.1 x 3.6 cm (10:7).
There is extensive edema surrounding this lesion, which extends into brainstem, exerts mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
No hydrocephalus.
Mild cerebellar tonsillar herniation is noted.
Susceptibility artifact within this lesion signifies hemorrhage.
There is associated restricted diffusion within this lesion, which likely relates to hypercellularity.
No additional intracranial lesion is identified.
Sulci and ventricles are slightly prominent, likely age-related involutional changes.
Bilateral FLAIR hyperintensities in subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter distribution likely reflect sequela of small vessel ischemic disease.
IMPRESSION: A large heterogeneously enhancing, hemorrhagic mass centered in the left cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema and mass effect, as described above, is most compatible with metastatic disease.
No additional intracranial lesions identified.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No interval increase in pleural effusion demonstrated.
CT head [**2106-7-20**] Expected small amount of blood at the surgical site in the left cerebellar hemisphere with expected postoperative pneumocephalus.
No hydrocephalus.
MRI [**2106-7-21**] Post-operative changes related to left suboccipital craniotomy and resection of the left cerebellar mass.
Small amount of hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, and minimal hyperenhancement within the resection bed, is likely post-surgical, however follow-up with MRI with and without contrast is reccommended.
[**2106-7-23**] NCHCT: In comparison to [**2106-7-20**] exam, there is interval removal of external ventricular drain.
Small amount of pneumocephalus has improved since prior.
Post-surgical changes related to suboccipital craniotomy and resection of left cerebellar mass are noted.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 F with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p chemo/XRT (finished [**3-/2106**]) and recent LLL wedge resection ([**2106-6-22**] with biopsy +adenoca at [**Hospital1 34**]), COPD, [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital3 5365**] where she presented with frontal headache x 3 for cerebellar mass.
On [**7-16**], she had a Brain MRI/WAND study that confirmed the cerebellar mass, associated edema was noted, but the 4th ventricle remained patent.
She had a follow up CT which showed no hemorrhage.
Neurologic deficits were at baseline as listed in the physical exam.

?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
