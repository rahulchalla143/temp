The seminal vesicles were without malignancy.
Margins were negative, and perineural invasion was noted.
- [**2190-3-10**] PSA 0.2 - [**2190-11-9**] PSA 0.6 - [**2191-6-18**] PSA 6.8 - [**2191-7-6**] CT demonstrated pulmonary nodules within the visualized lung bases, new from [**2187-12-10**].
- [**2191-8-3**] VATS resection of nodule - pathology from demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastasis from a prostatic origin based on immunostains that demonstrated tumor being positive for PSA and cytokeratin cocktail.

Displaced left clavicular fracture, as described above.
No pneumothorax.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
L. clavicle xray [**2194-12-29**]: IMPRESSION: Displaced distal left clavicular fracture in patient with diffuse osteoblastic metastases.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
CT chest w/ contrast [**2194-12-30**]: IMPRESSION: As compared to the previous CT examination from [**2194-11-11**], there are newly appeared bilateral multifocal diffuse parenchymal opacities.
The morphology of these opacities suggests multifocal pneumonia.
The morphology is neither typical for pulmonary edema nor for metastatic disease.
No pleural effusions.
No other relevant change as compared to the previous examination with regard to size and distribution of visible lymph nodes and the appearance of the heart and the large mediastinal vessels.
Diffuse metastatic bone disease that is, overall, stable, with the exception of a newly evident displaced left clavicular fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4509**] is a 70 y/o M with hx of metastatic prostate cancer with known mets to the lung and extensive involvement of his thoracic and lumbar spine who presents with left clavicle fracture and hypoxemia.
# Hypoxemia/multifocal pneumona: CXR showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
Bronchoscopy showed evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
# Left clavicle fracture: Likely pathologic fracture in setting of osseus involvement of disease.
No evidence of neurovascular compromise distal to fracture.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Due to DIC as patient with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: End-stage metastatic disease with bone marrow involvement.
Palliative care consulted to help with pain and dyspnea control.
