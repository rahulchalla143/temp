Admission Date:  [**2182-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-9-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-3-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: Ischemic right lower extremity  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2182-8-24**] OPERATION PERFORMED.
Abdominal aortogram.
History of Present Illness: 66 M w/ PVD with rest pain s/p Right [**Name (NI) 1793**] PTA/stent ([**8-5**])-failed.
There was no improvement in rest pain and patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for angiogram and possible bypass with arm vein.
Pt c/o pain in right lateral calf, worsening.
Has parasthesias chronically bilateral.
HTN 3.
There was no improvement in rest pain and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for angioplasty and possible bypass with arm vein.
Pt had continued critical limb ischemia and possible calf tissue loss and is now s/p right SVG fem-BK [**Doctor Last Name **] graft [**8-24**].
Speech was mildly dysarthric.
Voice was clear but with reduced volume.
He had difficulty increasing volume with cuing.
He did not have any overt coughing, throat clearing or changes in vocal quality and denied the sensation of aspiration or pharyngeal residue.
Laryngeal elevation felt timely and wfl to palpation.
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Known lastname 65140**] did not have any overt signs of aspiration and can be advanced to thin liquids and regular consistency solids once cleared medically.
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 6, wfl with modified independence.
Abdominal aortogram.
PATIENT ID:  This is a 66-year-old man who had previously had rest pain of the right foot.
He presents with continued rest pain and evidence of limb threat with sensory loss in the right foot.
Micro sheath was used to access the left external iliac artery and followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire in abdominal aorta and a 4-French short sheath in the left external iliac artery and Omni Flush catheter in abdominal aorta.
We had elected to proceed with a femoral to contra tibial artery bypass graft.
It had no pulse in it and is consistent with our finding of a firm post bypass pro patent graft.
Vessel loops were used to control the common femoral artery, the superficial femoral, the profunda femoris artery, and the circumflex femoral vessels.
Dissection was carried down using electrocautery and the anterior tibial artery is identified and all side branches of the anterior tibial artery were carefully controlled with 2-0 silk ties and proximal and distal control was controlled with vessel loops on the anterior tibial artery.
The anterior tibial artery appeared quite soft at this level, although there was some atherosclerosis within the walls.
A subcutaneous tunnel was created in the lateral aspect of the leg and the greater saphenous vein was harvested via ligating side branches between 4-0 silk ties.
Backflushing and fore flushing of four vessels were performed prior to completion of the anastomosis.
There appeared to be a flap of tissue within the anterior tibial artery proximally that was retrieved.
A 1.5 mm coronary dilator was passed distally into the anterior tibial artery which allowed good backbleeding from the anterior tibial artery.
Anastomosis completed, Doppler exam of the flow vessel showed excellent signal within the vessel and we were happy with our results.
Therefore, hemostasis achieved at all wounds and  the wall incisions in the groin was closed in three layers with 2-0 Vicryl and staples distally within the medial incision.
The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a single deep layer and a 4-0 Monocryl for the skin and Dermabond for the skin.
Normal-appearing abdominal aorta.
This appeared to be     patent with rapid transit of contrast.
The above-knee popliteal artery occludes before the knee     joint and multiple collateral arteries existed at this     level which does provide some perfusion to the lower     leg.
Some retrograde     filling of the peroneal artery is seen, although the     peroneal artery is very diseased throughout its proximal     half of its course.
Distally the peroneal artery runs     off into the foot with very small plantar and tarsal     vessels.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Localized discontinuous erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the stomach body.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis and NGT.
These findings can not explain Hct drop and melena.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum  Colonoscopy ([**2182-9-4**]): Results: Impression: Friability and erythema in the rectum Polyp in the sigmoid colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Polyps in the rectum Diverticulosis of the descending colon and sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum  Wound cultures:right bypass incision:  GRAM STAIN (Final [**2182-9-9**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
______________________________________________________   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66-year-old man experienced previously rest pain in his right foot and  had undergone surgery for  a right femoral patch angioplasty and subsequently right femoral to below-knee popliteal pro patent bypass graft at [**Hospital3 **]([**2182-8-23**]).
He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with continued rest pain and evidence of limb threat with sensory loss in the right foot.The patient was consented for a arteriogram and possible bypass graft nerve to achieve limb salvage.
Abdominal aortogram.
One day after surgery the patient became increasingly restless and agitated.
Over the course of the next 5 days the patient remained agitated and delirious requiring large doses of Benzodiazepines.
On postoperative day five the patient was noted to pass  dark, loose, guaiac positive stools.
An EGD and a colonoscopy were scheduled after his acute alcohol detoxification on the ([**2182-9-3**]).
The performed EGD failed to explain his HCT drop and melena.
Colonoscopy was performed one day later and showed a diffuse continuous friability and erythema in the rectum however no bleeding was noted.
No further bleeding occurred so that he was transferred to the floor on [**2182-9-7**].
He is hemodynamically stable at the time of discharge, no shortness of breath and tolerates a regular diet.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
