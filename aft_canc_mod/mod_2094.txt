Admission Date:  [**2158-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-2-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41182**] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: 69yoM with h/o prostate ca s/p radiation and hormonal therapy and radiation induced proctitis who presents with sudden onset of 20 episodes of BRBPR/clots and watery stool starting around 530pm and occuring q 15-30 mins, for which he called EMS and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
DRE showed BRBPR on the glove.
He had no further bleeding episodes in the ED and his systolics were 89 to 107 in the ED without any reflex tachycardia.
He was offered admission for blood transfusions but the pt refused and started TID ferrous sulfate.
He was then seen in the ED early [**9-/2158**] for chest pain, SOB/DOE, chronic rectal bleeding with admission for transfusions (4u with Hct increase from 23.7 --> 33.8) with symptomatic improvement.
Due to CP, he was stressed which was positive for L elbow/subscapular pain, 0.5mm inferolateral depressions on the treadmill, and reversible inferobasilar perfusion defect with enlarged left ventricle and transient ischemic dilation (LVEF 46%) on nuclear.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 16937**] notes, it appears pt had a stress test 2 yrs ago which showed "previous inferior MI."
Plan was apparently medical management, and pt was only symptomatic with the anemia.
ROS: Pt currently endorsing lower back pain from straining while working in his warehouse, and feeling the need to defecate, but otherwise feels well and ROS is completely negative otherwise.
Past Medical History: - depression - hypertension - hypercholesterolemia - prostate cancer s/p radiation treatment (completed [**9-/2156**]) and hormone shots (last [**12/2156**] per OMR notes) - diarrhea and abdominal pain responsive to pancreatic extracts - rectal bleeding with colonoscopy [**4-3**] showing radiation proctitis; acute anemia in [**8-/2158**] with repeat colonoscopy again showing radiation proctitis s/p Argon therapy of proctitis [**2158-10-27**] - Stress test/echo [**2156-3-29**] resting inferior wall abnormality c/w old MI.
Exercise induced ischemia in distal LAD distribution.
- Nuclear perfusion [**9-/2158**] depressions on treadmill and reversible inferobasilar perfusion defect on nuclear   Social History: Lives at home with his wife and has 2 sons, 2 daughters.
EOMI, no scleral icterus No JVD CTAB no w/c/r/r RRR with clear S1 and S2, no murmurs or gallops.
Radial pulses are easily palpable Abd obese NT ND, BS+, benign Extrems are without edema, 2 well placed 18 g PIV in bilateral AC's, warm and well perfused, no palmar cyanosis and good cap refill CN2-12 intact, no focal neuro deficits noted, moving all extremities, mental status lucid and conversant   Pertinent Results: 139  104   46 -------------- 184 4.3   26   1.6  WBC 8.6  N75 L15.6 E4.2 o/w normal Hct 31 MCV 82 Plts 311 Coags 14.3 / 31.7 / 1.2 UA pending  Imaging: [**2158-10-27**] Coloscopy and EGD showing diffuse increase in vascularity in distal rectum from 2 cm above dentate line to 10 cm, consistent with the appearance of radiation induced proctitis.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Congestion and erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy within normal limits).
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  EKG: NSR 64bpm, normal axis and intervals, prominent inferior Q's and suggestive Q's in V5-6 which correlate to known recent stress results.
No acute ischemic appearing changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 69yoM with h/o radiation proctitis who presents with BRBPR from likely lower GI source, hypotension resolved with IVF's and ARF also resolved with IVF's.
Lower GI bleed: With BRBPR seen on digital rectal exam, negative NGL in ED, increased vascularity of distal rectum consistent with known radiation proctitis (also seen in [**3-/2158**] colonoscopy) and also grade 1 internal hemorrhoids seen on colonoscopy 2 wks ago, most likely source is lower GI tract/rectum.
Likely exacerbated by straining while working at his warehouse to the point of hurting his lower back, and thus raising intra-abdominal pressure and rupturing his superficial rectal vasculature.
GI was consulted and felt that the bleeding was likely due to scar tissue breaking off from the rectum after the recent argon-plasma beam coagulation treatment for the radiation proctitis.
Hypotension: Was not tachycardic and no evidence of end organ ischemia other than Cr 1.6 from normal baseline, which responded to IVF's back to normal.
Acute renal failure: With Cr 1.6 up from baseline Cr 1.1.
Suspect pre-renal etiology in face of volume loss and elevated BUN/Cr (however BUN may be elevated due to GIB).
Diet was advanced on the first hospital day without complication.
PO three times a day as needed for diarrhea.
9. zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
13. lisinopril  Oral  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Radiation proctitis  Secondary Diagnoses: Depression Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Prostate cancer s/p radiation treatment and hormonal therapy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The bleeding was felt to be secondary to recent argon-plasma coagulation and scar tissue that developed around the sites of this therapy.
