He was discharged home with no medications.
He has remained sleepy and confused since discharge.
His emesis is non-bloody, non-bilious.
He has been having vomiting for about 1 month.
He has some lower abdominal pain that is sharp and comes and goes.
He has had no chest pain.
He has some shortness of breath with any exertion.
He is on dialysis for renal failure and has not voided in 2 days, however he is still producing urine.
In addition he has developed a decubitous ulcer which is painful.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for fatigue, leg pain, and abdominal pain.
On that admission he was found to have a new L3 compression fracture (after a fall in the hospital).
HAs some LBP but it is well controlled.
Metastatic prostate CA, last PSA 183, refractory to hormonal therapy 2.
HTN 4.
ONC history: Diagnosed with prostate CA 1 year ago after he had a CVA.
He had back pain that was initially felt to be musculoskeletal.
At that time an MRI showed metastasis to his back.
No Etoh, no smoking.
Family History: No cancer, father died at 52 from heart disease, mother died at 60 from heart disease   Physical Exam: VS: Tm 99.4 Tc 97.1 Pulse 91 (91-103), BP 131/78 (108-131/66-78) RR 20, 94% on RA FS 97, 87 Gen: alert, oriented male in NAD answering questions appropriately and appearing comfortable HEENT: MMM, OP clear, PERRL Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: RRR, nl S1S2, +rub Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, NABS Ext: no edema Neuro: MS: alert and oriented x 3, slowed responses but with fluent speech, appropriate, but with poor memory for medical history.
CN: II-XII tested and intact Motor: [**5-12**] Upper and Lower extremities proximal and distal except hip flexor on R where the exam in pain limited.
Coord: FNF intact Sensory: No level, no dermatomal loss, no perianal anesthesia Reflexes: UE and patella 1+ bilaterally, ankles could not be elicited.
Pertinent Results: CXR: Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions, with apparent loculation on the left.
A component of pleural thickening is also possible.
There is no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
Note, no acute intraabdominal pathology demonstrated.
Diffuse metastatic disease involving lungs, pleura, liver, adrenal glands, left retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes, pericardial nodes and bones.
The pattern of metastasis is not typic for prostate cancer.
Other type of primary malignancies should be considered including lung cancer, colon cancer and renal cell carcinoma.
Hypodense lesions in the kidneys were not well characterized by CT. MRI couldbe performed if indicated.
Of concern is a destructive soft tissue mass in the vertebral body of T12, which extends into the posterior elements and into the spinal canal, possibly causing compression of the cord.
Bone Scan [**4-3**]: Findings suspicious for multifocal osseous metastases.
The intense lesion in the left mid femoral diaphysis may be at risk for impending fracture and assessment of structural integrity could be performed with radiographs.
