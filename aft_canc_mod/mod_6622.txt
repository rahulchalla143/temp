On POD 1 the patient did have a seizure and neurology was consulted.
He developed atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was started.
He did become drowsy after a dose of Ativan and required BIPAP at night.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Repeat brain MRI showed No evidence of acute infarct, moderate-to-severe atrophy and small vessel disease.
By the time of discharge on POD 9, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
