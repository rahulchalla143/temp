woman with history of newly diagnosed T cell lymphoma ([**2148-7-4**]) who presented on day 10 status post CHOP.
At that point she felt tired but otherwise well without localizing symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, etc...).
She awoke [**8-3**] with a temperature of 102 F with chills as well as dizziness and "eyes burning."
On arrival to the floor she reported feeling thirsty as well as mild abdominal cramping and some mild headache.
She had just finished steroid taper and had been on levofloxacin for suppressive therapy.
Past Medical History: Peripheral T cell lymphoma: She presented with fevers and elevated LFT's in the spring of [**2148**].
She denies using tobacco or alcohol.
Family History: Father has a history of benign adrenal mass and skin cancers removed.
Her mother has hyperparathyroidism and hypertension.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: T 98.6, HR 104, BP 96/58, 97% RA RR23 Gen: well appearing NAD HEENT: MM dry.
mild mucositis.
No photophobia or nuchal rig Cards: RRR no murmurs.
CTAB Abd: BS+ mildly tender diffusely.
no rebound or guarding.
Mild RUQ tenderness.
Over course of hospitalization she had interval development of right wrist drop and decreased sensation in webspace of right hand.
The lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma admitted for neutropenic fevers and hypotension between her first and second cycle of CHOP.
Because of bone marrow infarcts during her last cycle G-CSF was held and her counts dropped.
Given concern for advancing disease given continued fevers and no signs of infection she had a series of LP's.
The second and third LP showed atypical cells that likely represented CNS disease.
She tolerated these therapies well with only some GI toxicity and mild mucositis after the methotrexate.
After receiving high dose methotrexate she again began to have fevers and chills leading to another infectious work-up which was negative except for an enterococcal bacteremia (see below).
She also had slightly elevated liver enzymes so repeat MRI of the abdomen was obtained and showed no focal involvement of the liver.
She ended up on broad spectrum antimicrobials for fevers as her neutropenia reached its nadir.
At the same time work up of her right radial nerve palsy (see below) led to suspicion of progressive neurologic disease despite previous chemotherapy.
Thus as she began to recover from her nadir with the help of G-CSF the plan was made to start steroid therapy for her suspected continued neurologic disease and proceed to IT AraC and ESHAP.
Fever: On presentation there were no localizing symptoms on imaging or testing so her fevers were thought to be non-infectious and probably due to bone marrow infarcts vs drug fever vs continued disease activity.
Her brain MR was negative for focal findings but additional work up with lumbar punctures revealed CNS disease and required additional treatment with [**Hospital1 **] and intrathecal methotrexate on day 1 and high dose methotrexate on day 10.
After high dose methotrexate she again became febrile and thus yet another infectious work up was initiated.
This revealed an enterococcal urinary tract infection for which she was treated with vancomycin and then ampicillin after sensitivities returned.
As her cytopenias resolved and a high suspicion of progressive neurologic lymphoma arose her antimicrobials were eventually decreased to levofloxacin and voriconazole, which she continued on discharge.
At this point progressive lymphoma was considered the most likely etiology of her fevers but she was continued on antimicrobials given the inability to completely rule out infection.
Hypotension:  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on presentation with hypotension as well as fever.
It is unclear if the hypotension was due to sepsis of some infecting organism or some other etiology.
Bone marrow infarction: Around day +10 from her first cycle of CHOP and while on treatment with G-CSF she developed rapidly rising LDH, severe bony pain, and fever.
She received supportive care with fluids, analgesia with a Dilaudid PCA, and fever control.
The main complication of this was urinary retention requiring the placement of a Foley catheter.
She was continued on Morphine SR for continued bone pain throughout her hospitalization and with this the pain was well managed.
5 HSV Active oral lesions on admission.
She was reduced to prophylaxis dose and maintained on that dose without complications thereafter.
)Neurologic symptoms:  She had UMN signs on the left early in admission and later weakness and LMN signs of right wrist and hand with decreased extension of her fingers.
Two LP's were obtained the first of which was normal and the second of which showed atypical cells.
She was also having intense pain in her right arm at this time.
Consideration was given to an inflammatory process vs a chemo induced or paraneoplastic neuropathy but no clear etiology was found.
Because of no improvement in the right arm symptoms with treatment with [**Hospital1 **] and high dose Methotrexate, Neuro-oncology was consulted and diagnosed a right radial nerve palsy.
Neuro-onc suspected neoplastic involvement of the nerve and MRI of the right arm did demonstrate this.
The patient had received only a few sessions of XRT at discharge and no interval change in right radial nerve palsy though in regards to function and pain it was much improved with use of a soft splint.
There was a concomitant elevation in alk phos, LDH, and GGT.
Ultimately it was believed that this was due to liver involvement by lymphoma, which was a component of her original presentation.
Bilateral neuropathic pain in lower extremities: This may have been due to lymphoma versus side effects of vincristine.
The pain responded well to gabapentin and amitriptyline therapy and she was discharged on these medications.
These flared with some incidents of diarrhea during her [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy and had large inflamed hemorrhoids.
Given cytopenias were worsening these were observed and managed with [**Last Name (un) **] baths and steroid cream with good improvement particularly as diarrhea resolved.
Mucositis: Had some mild mucositis during HD methotrexate therapy.
Access: The patient initially had a right sided PICC line that developed pain and poor function.
A right upper extremity ultrasound on [**2148-8-22**] revealed a right cephalic vein thrombosis with no extension of time.
She received local therapies for pain and this resolved.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis was acyclovir as described above.
She never received antibacterial prophylaxis as she was always was on treatment doses of antibiotics for fevers when she became neutropenic.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: -------------------- T-cell lymphoma Neutropenic fever   Discharge Condition: Good, afebrile, tolerating PO's   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for very high fevers.
Your fevers were thought most likely related your lymphoma and your recent chemotherapy.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection for which you received adequate treatment.
We still thought it was most likely you had your fevers due to your underlying lymphoma.
While you were admitted to the hospital, you also had severe bone pain which was controlled with narcotic pain medication and also thought due to your lymphoma.
This pain improved significantly while you were in the hospital.
In the hospital you also had problems with nerve pain, which was thought due to your chemotherapy and possibly your lymphoma as well.
You also had paralysis of one nerve and a scan of this area revealed involvement of your lymphoma.
We put you on several medications for nerve pain with some improvement and you were also started on radiation therapy to attempt to help your nerve recover from the lymphoma involvement.
You have also been started on DEXAMETHASONE to help manage your fevers and help your nerve recover.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop fevers > 100.4, shaking chills, night sweats, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, worsening or changing bone pain.
You have an appointment with the ophthalmologist [**Name6 (MD) 6131**] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD on [**2148-9-18**] at 12:45 pm to assess for ocular involvement of your lymphoma.
