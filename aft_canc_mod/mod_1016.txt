Admission Date: [**2124-3-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2124-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-1-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old female, recently diagnosed with a right femur osteosarcoma, status post 1 cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin and cisplatinum on [**2-28**], and a history of ulcerative colitis, status post total colectomy and ileostomy in the past, who presented to the Emergency Room with acute sharp abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Total abdominal hysterectomy.
Ulcerative colitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.
There was no gross blood, and it was heme positive.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
Chest x-ray showed COPD with no pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
CT of the abdomen was done and showed thickening and stranding of the distal ileum with some fluid in the abdomen.
She became tachycardic and intermittently hypotensive.
In view of these symptoms and her very concerning CT scan, it was decided to take her the operating room.
She was found to have ischemia of the distal small bowel to the stomach from previous adhesions and small bowel obstruction.
NEURO:  Initially, her pain was controlled, and she was    sedated with a fentanyl drip.
This was later weaned and    changed to prn morphine as needed, and prior to discharge    her pain was well-controlled on Roxicet prn, and very    small amounts of Ativan prn.
On postoperative day 19, as    she was beginning to wake-up and drips were weaned off,    she was noted not to be moving her left side as well, and    had left side neglect with right-sided gaze.
A CT was    done and showed recent infarctions in the middle cerebral    arterial territory and left occipital territory.
Further    work-up for what seemed to be embolic strokes included an    echo which did not show any source of emboli.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Her immediate postop course was    significant for septic shock and need for vasopressors    which were gradually weaned as she stabilized.
She    developed atrial fibrillation which was converted back to    sinus on an amiodarone drip.
She has remained in    sinus and stable hemodynamically for many days.
RESPIRATORY:  She had prolonged respiratory failure and    vent dependency.
She still required some suctioning    and chest physical therapy, but had been stable with good    saturations, and normal respiratory rate, and seemed very    comfortable on the trach mask.
GU:  After her initial resuscitation around surgery, the    patient significantly volume overloaded.
Her    creatinine was slightly elevated to peak of 1.4, but had    returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge.
HEME:  As noted on admission, the patient was    significantly neutropenic and just needed to be supported    by G-CSF.
Throughout her hospitalization, she did require    intermittent transfusions of blood and platelets, but none    in the period prior to discharge.
ID:  Of note, her immediate postop course was significant    for sepsis and septic shock.
Her OA positive culture was 1 out of 2    bottles of blood culture from the 22, the day of her    admission, which grew presumptive Clostridium septicum.
Once afebrile and her white counts were normal, this    regimen was stopped.
On [**3-28**], she had a low-grade temp    and a slight elevation in her white count.
Her catheter, as well as 1 out of 4    bottles of blood grew Staph coag-negative, and her sputum    on that day grew Pseudomonas and MRSA.
Work-up for that included an ultrasound    which was negative for DVT.
She was    seen by the oncology service, radiation oncology service    and the orthopedic service here for questions regarding    further treatment of her osteosarcoma.
It was felt that    at this point treatment, the patient would not be a good    surgical candidate for an amputation, but would possibly    benefit, at least initially, from radiation treatment, but    even that should wait until the patient further recovers.
Continue PT, OT and respiratory rehabilitation.
Ischemic small bowel.
Respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy.
