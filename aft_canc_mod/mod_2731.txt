[**2169-4-7**] Pa/Lat CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Nodular opacities in the left lower lung with additional small ground-glass opacities bilaterally may represent infection.
Abdominal wall varices of indeterminate etiology.
Coronary artery calcification .
Left upper lung parenchymal consolidation likely pneumonia.
Multiple ground-glass and mixed solid and ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs may be infectious in etiology although the differential includes neoplasm.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications 3.
Right subpectoral node.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Chest wall collateral vessels.
Coarse calcification in the SVC could relate to chronic thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD MWF, thyroid cancer, GERD and HTN, admitted with gram negative sepsis and acute leukemia, found to have AML.
She underwent CT chest that showed hilar and pretracheal lymphadenopathy, likely consistent with leukemia, although possibly related to infection.
Labs consistent with early tumor lysis syndrome.
Given tumor lysis syndrome prior to initiation of chemotherapy, she was transferred to the ICU for leukophoresis to decrease WBC count burden prior to initiating chemotherapy.
WBC count decreased from 78 to 28 with leukophoresis, and the patient became more awake with decreased peripheral cyanosis.
S/p chemotherapeutic regimen, patient still had a significant number of blasts in peripheral blood, signifying a very poor prognosis.
ENT consulted on pt and did endoscopy of pharynx, confirming structural defect.
Dilaudid PCA was initiated for symptomatic relief.
# Agitation / delirium: On approximately hospital day #12, patient had significant agitation and delirium, likely secondary to difficulty in achieving equilibrium with new IV medications, in the setting of severe mucositis.
On admission, she was found to have gram negative bacteremia with enterobacter cloacae.
She also had ground glass opacities on CT.
Patient with hypoxia and mild hypotension (to SBP 92 from 130s), concerning for developing sepsis.
She was then broadened to posaconazole to cover for possible pulmonary fungal infection.
She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL to further evaluate her ground glass opacities.
4 days into admission, the patient developed a firey-erythematous blanching rash on her back, that spread to cover her trunk and proximal thighs.
Patient with chronic left arm fistula, on coumadin at home for fistula thrombosis prevention - this was discontinued on admission for impending chemotheraphy-related coagulopathy.
With increasing tumor burden, she experienced tumor lysis syndrome with hyperkalemia to 6.7, and received 2 extra sessions of dialysis for electrolyte correction.
However, it was discontinued, as it likely caused LFT elevations and may have been responsible for the patient's rash.
# Transaminitis:  The patient developed worsening transaminits on admission, attributed to drug effect in the setting of initiation chemotherapy and allopurinol.
The patient had no right upper quadrant pain, and right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for obstruction.
Allopurinol was discontinued, and transaminitis improved, making it the likely culprit of her laboratory abnormalities.
# Rash:  Early in admission, the patient developed a fiery-red blanching rash on her back that spread to the remainder of her torso and proximal thighs.
The patient was evaluated by dermatology who felt the rash was likely a drug rash from meropenem or allopurinol.
#HTN:  Patient with a history of hypertension on labetalol.
The patient became borderline hypotensive on admission, and labetalol was held.
#Anxiety:  Patient with chronic anxiety, worsened acutely in the setting of new diagnosis.
Transitioned to ativan on admission, given potential for nausea with chemo.
