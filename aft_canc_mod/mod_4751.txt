LUNGS: CTA(B) COR: RRR ABD: Subcostal incision with steri strips c/d/i.
No definitive mass identified but vague hypodensity in the pancreatic head and short occlusion of the upper superior mesenteric vein raise concern for a subtle presentation of malignancy, particularly if there is no potential alternative clinical explanation such as a history of pancreatitis.
Occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein without evidence of involvement of the superior mesenteric artery.
[**2155-5-9**] Pre-Op CXR: The heart is normal in size and the lungs are clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.

**FINAL REPORT [**2155-5-25**]** GRAM STAIN (Final [**2155-5-21**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
MODERATE GROWTH.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for treatment of a pancreatic head mass and superior mesenteric vein occlusion.
On [**2155-5-14**], the patient underwent classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple), open cholecystectomy, staging laparoscopy, and placement of fiducials for a pancreatic head mass as well as resection of superior mesenteric vein with left common femoral vein interposition graft, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Post-operatively, he was admitted to the TICU, where he was NPO with an NG tube, intubated on mechanical ventilation, on IV fluids and Sub-Q octreotide, with a foley catheter and JP drain in place, and a Fentanyl drip for pain control.
He received 2 units of PRBCs for a post-operative HCT of 23 consistent with acute blood loss anemia with resultant post-transfusion HCT of 26.8.
When stabilized, the patient was extubated, and transferred to the inpatient floor on POD#1 still NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and JP drain in place, and now on a Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with the Dilaudid PCA, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
On POD # 7 patient developed severe nausea and hiccups, he was made NPO, NGT was placed and patient was received IVF for hydration.
Patient continue to receive TPN for nutritional support.
On POD#16 patient able to tolerate regular diet, feeling well, he was discharged home with VNA services to continue motor his wound healing.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
