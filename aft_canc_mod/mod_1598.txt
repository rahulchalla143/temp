No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, + tremor Rt hand.
No pronator drift.
[**2175-1-31**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring session because of diffuse mild background slowing indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
There are occasional broad- based left central epileptiform discharges indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in this region.
[**2175-2-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-31**] through [**2-1**]: Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased, producing mild leftward mediastinal shift.
No pneumothorax.

[**2175-2-6**] Ultrasound BLE: DVT of right popliteal vein.
[**2175-2-6**] EEG PRELIM: IMPRESSION: This portable routine EEG was abnormal due to the presence of a slow, disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings are suggestive of a diffuse encephalopathy, indicating widespread cerebral dysfunction, of nonspecific etiology.
No epileptiform features were seen.
Postsurgical changes status post left parietal craniotomy with resection of left frontal lesion.
There is a 3.5 mm focus of slow diffusion in the inferior aspect of the surgical bed likely representing postoperative cytotoxic edema.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
[**2175-2-9**] EEG: PRELIM: This is an abnormal ICU continuous video EEG due to the slow and disorganized background of [**5-7**] Hz indicative of a diffuse moderate encephalopathy.
There are infrequent generalized and bilateral frontal sharp wave epileptiform discharges indicative of frontal and generalized cortical irritability and increased propensity to seizures.
Compared to the previous day's recording, there is a slight decrease in the frequency of epileptiform discharges particularly during the night.
Stable post-operative changes in the left frontoparietal region with small amount of blood products and edema in the left frontal lobe.

During the foley catheter placement in the OR, she was noted to have a vaginal abrasion.
CT head revealed no hemorrhage and biopsy was consistent with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
An EEG which showed generalized slowing, but no seizure activity.
On [**2175-1-30**], EEG revealed persistent eliptiform waves.
CXR revealed white out of the right lung, so she was started on levofloxacin.
BNP was slightly elevated at 361.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and thoracocentesis yielded 1600cc of milky white fluid, consistent with chylothorax, cytology negative.
There was a question of an 8mm right apical pneumothorax post-procedure.
Cytology from the pleural fluid were negative for malignancy.
Due to continued R sided weakness a Head CT was ordered which was negative.
The patient remained with flat affect and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] communication, intermittantly following commands.
This was thought to be due to recurrent seizures.
She developed a fever to 100.5F on [**2175-2-2**] and was cultured, CXR showed re-accumulating effusion, but she remained well oxygenated.
During the evening of [**2175-2-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname 24298**] became acutely more encephalopathic and unresponsive.
EEG [**2175-2-6**] showed diffuse slowing, but no seizure.
Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin for a positive urine culture growing vancomycin resistant enterococcus ([**Month/Day/Year **]).
Paracentesis performed [**2175-2-8**] also negative for infection.
EEG on [**2175-2-9**] also showed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy without seizures.
Hypernatermia resolved with IV fluids, then recurred.
Hypercalcemia resolved with IV fluids, calcitonin, and pamidronate.
On [**2175-2-5**], her RLE was noted to be swollen and ultrasound revealed a new popliteal DVT despite prophylactic SC heparin.
Despite her high risk for bleeding due to recent brain biopsy and recent admission to [**Hospital1 112**] for GI bleeding while receiving warfarin, she was anticoagulated with heparin gtt after discussion with the Neurosurgery service, her primary medical physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 24301**], and health-care proxy [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
EEG [**2175-2-6**] showed diffuse slowing, but no seizure.
No improvement with correction of hypernatremia or hypercalcemia.
No other infections found.
# Fever and [**Month/Day/Year **]/staph UTI: Fever resolved.
Diagnostic pleurocentesis [**2175-2-4**] negative for infection.
- F/U cultures.
Urine osm consistent with hypovolemia.
No elevated triglycerides, cytology negative.
# Seizures: EEG [**2175-2-6**] diffusely slowed, but no seizure activity.
EEG [**2175-2-9**] also slowed, but seizure propensity present.
Levetiracetam stopped as possible cause of encephalopathy.
- Seizure precautions.
# Hypercalcemia: Initially improved with IV fluids and calcitonin but recurred until treated with pamidronate 90mg after correction of hypovolemia.
No repeat thyroid labs given goals of care.
# Recurrent pleural effusion: Repeat thoracentesis [**2175-2-4**] consistent with chylothorax.
# Metastatic pancreatic cancer with brain metastasis: CA [**81**]-9 2618 on [**2175-2-1**].
Health-care proxy does not want any further tests/treatment due to failure to improve, poor quality of life, poor prognosis, and suffering.
# Anemia: Microcytosis, hypochromia, ferritin 38, retic 0.8, Fe sat 13%, haptoglobin 45, consistent with iron-deficiency anemia.
# Coagulopathy: Likely due to DIC.
Likely due to DIC and splenomegaly/infection.
# RLE DVT: She is at high risk for bleeding given her recent brain bx and GI bleed (EGD & colonoscopy negative at [**Hospital1 112**]).
# Abuse investigation: First-degree 1cm superficial perineal laceration at posterior forchette in the midline discovered during foley placement in OR for brain biopsy.
# Bipolar disorder: Stopped valproate (surrogate for lithium) given goals of care.
Use haloperidol for agitation prn.
# GI PPx: PPI IV.
# DVT PPx: Stopped heparin drip for DVT given goals of care.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 24302**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer) Brain fetastasis (cancer spread to the brain) Pleural effusion (fluid in your lung) Ascites (fluid in your abdomen) Seizures Urinary tract infection (bladder infection) Encephalopathy (loss of conciousness, altered mental status) DVT of right lower extremity (blood clot) Hypernatremia (high sodium) Diabetes (high sugar) Hypercalcemia (high calcium) Thrush (yeast infection of the mouth) Bipolar disorder Anemia (low red blood cells) Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (abnormal blood clotting)  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Unresponsive.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a brain biopsy which showed you have metastatic pancreatic cancer to the brain.
You were started on whole brain radiation therapy but were unable to continue due to a change in mentation (encephalopathy).
You became very drowsy and could no longer answer questions or follow commands.
You also were found to have seizures, so valproate (Depakote) was given to control this.
No cause of the altered mental state was found despite extensive tests including CT, MRI, and spinal taps (lumbar puncture) and covering with antibiotics.
High calcium was treated with medications (calcitonin and pamidronate), high blood sugars treated with insulin, and high sodium treated with IV fluids.
You had fevers that were from a urinary tract infection that was treated with IV antibiotics.
You developed a blood clot in your right leg that has been treated with IV heparin, a blood thinner, but this was stopped early when you left the hospital considering no improvement in your overall condition.
Your bipolar disorder is being treated with valproate (Depakote) instead of lithium.
You also were given an anti-fungal medication fluconazole for thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth.
Stop pancreatic enzymes.
Lorazepam as needed for seizures, nausea, or anxiety.
Morphine for pain or shortness of breath.
