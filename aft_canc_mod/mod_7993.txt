Pulmonary emboli in the subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe and anterior left upper lobe with no evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarction.
New patchy consolidation in the dependent portion of the right upper lobe likely represents pneumonia or aspiration.
Ground glass opacities in a bronchovascular distribution in the left upper lobe may represent multifocal pneumonia or significant aspiration event.
No brain metastases identified.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage; however, subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be excluded on this study due to circulating intravenous contrast.
Status post right lower lobe resection with subsequent volume loss of the right lung.
Presence of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
No pulmonary edema.
Unchanged right apical pleural thickening and blunting of the right CP angle are likely postoperative changes.
