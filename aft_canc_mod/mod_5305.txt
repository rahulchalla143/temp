Admission Date:  [**2104-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-6-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3645**] Chief Complaint: Decreased Sensation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: XRT to spine, C5-T4 fusion, posterior decompression of C6-C7 to T3-T4  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo M w/Stage IIIB Multiple Myeloma dx at time of lumbar compression fx now s/p C5 Decadron [**Date range (1) 68404**] and nightly Thalidomide who presents with numbness.
The patient reports feeling fairly well except for he has noted diffuse chest/rib pain on the days off steroids including starting on [**2-1**].
Also on [**2-1**], he noted numbness in addition to the pain in his right breast/anterior shoulder.
They noted he had decreased sensation to the nipple and wanted him to have an MRI but the machine was broken so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
They suggested a MRI of the Tspine which was notable for severe cord compression at T2.
He denies urinary/fecal incontinence but notes constipation on narcotics.
He denies weight loss.
His pain did not improve on NSAIDs, narcotics so he went to his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP ordered an MRI which was significant for a compression fracture of L1 and L2 and abnormal bone marrow signal in all vertebral bodies consistent with abnormal marrow replacement.
SPEP revealed an IgG lambda paraprotein at 23 mg/dL with decreased IgA and IgM at 69 and 22 respectively.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow with extensive involvement by CD 138 positive plasma cells and plasma blasts.
In [**11-23**], he developed a DVT in his RLE and was started on coumadin.
Family History: Father had an MI in his 50s.
3 healthy children  Physical Exam: T 97.6 BP 128/61 HR 70 RR 16 O2 Sat 100%RA GENL: NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, no nystagmus.
Sclera anicteric.
No OP lesions.
NECK: Supple, No JVD, No LAD BACK: minimal spinal tenderness T1-T6, no stepoff CHEST: CTA b/l, no w/c/r CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmurs appreciated.
Brisk reflexes - biceps, patellar, toes downgoing, no clonus.
S -decreased appreciation for PP across chest and down abd to top of thighs b/l.
MRI T-spine IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with diffuse metastatic disease throughout the included spine with near total involvement of the T2 vertebral body with severe compression deformity and retropulsion of fragments causing severe central canal narrowing at this level.
There is a large soft tissue mass extending to the right of the T2 vertebral body with extension into the prevertebral space, to the right neural foramen, and into the epidural space.
No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Numerous lytic lesions throughout the cervical vertebral bodies consistent with history of metastatic disease.
Multilevel metastatic disease with many compression deformities most severe at T2,-T9, and T11 through L1 with paraspinal mass at T2 which appears to infiltrate the spinal canal and as demonstrated on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 68405**] the cord at this level.
Multilevel degenerative disease as noted above.
Diffuse metastatic involvement of the lumbar spine with multilevel compression deformities.
Multilevel degenerative change with mild compression of the thecal sac and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at multiple levels as noted above.
Rounded calcific density in right upper quadrant likely representing a gallstone within the neck of the gallbladder.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo M w/ Multiple Myeloma s/p C5 Decadron [**Date range (1) 29272**], on daily Thalidomide p/w decreased sensation in the chest/abdomen; found to have compression fx and cord compression at T2 .
# Multiple Myeloma: On admission, he was found to have new T2 compression fx and spinal cord compression by tumor.
His pain was controlled with MS Contin and Morphine for breakthrough.
He was taken emergently from MRI scanner to OR for pathologic compression fracture T2 with spinal cord compression and spinal cord injury with lower extremity paralysis.
The patient had a cardiac arrest while prone on the table.
After surgery, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not wake up very well possibly secondary to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and myoclonus.
# H/O DVT - Diagnosed in [**2103-11-18**], he was supratherapeutic on admission, thus his coumadin was held.
#CODE - Full  Medications on Admission: 1) Thalidamide 200mg QHS 2) Coumadin 2mg QD 3) Vicodin 2 tabs Q3-4H:PRN 4) MS Contin 45mg QAM, 30mg QPM 5) Dexamethasone 40mg 4 days on, 4 days off 6) Bactrim 1 tab 3x/wk  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: deceased, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and myoclonus  Discharge Condition: Deceased  Discharge Instructions: None  Followup Instructions: None   Completed by:[**2104-3-5**
