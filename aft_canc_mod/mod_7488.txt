Admission Date:  [**2124-8-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-8-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-10-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: occipital headache, incoordination in left hand, slurred speech, and a left cerebellar mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: suboccipital craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 47-year-old right-handed woman, with no significant past medical history, who is seen in consultation as requested by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 91692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 518**] for occipital headache, incoordination, and a left cerebellar mass.
Her neurological problem began in mid-[**2124-7-21**] when she developed occipital headache.
A head CT on [**2124-8-16**] revealed a mass in the left cerebellum; this was followed up with a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History:  She had asthma when she was a child.
She has chronic low back pain.
Family History: Her parents are alive; her mother has [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease and breast cancer while her father is healthy.
She has one sister and 2 brothers; her older brother has kidney failure and is a recipient of a transplanted kidney from her sister.
Her extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no nystagmus or square wave jerks.
Motor Examination:  She does not have a drift.
Coordination examination reveals dysmetria in the left upper extremity with overshoot and tremor on intention.
She does not have a Romberg.
A 2.7 x 3.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with moderate to marked surrounding edema and mass effect on the left side of the fourth ventricle and distortion of the brainstem with hydrocephalus involving the dilatation of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricles.
A smaller satellite nodule noted posterior to this lesion, measuring approximately 4 mm.
Given the multiplicity of the lesions, these are concerning for metastatic lesions; vs multifocal primary.
A cystic focus on to the right side of the third ventricle with indentation on the third ventricle, 1.4 x 1.3 cm.
It is unclear if this is located in the adjacent parenchyma/related to an outpouching from the third ventricle versus an arachnoid cyst.
Post-operative status with resection of the largest lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with residual mass effect on fourth ventricle.
Mild enhancement of the periphery of the resection cavity on post-contrast images, this likely represents post operative change.
Close follow up is advised to rule out residual neoplasm.
Two small lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere, which are unchanged as compared to the prior study.
