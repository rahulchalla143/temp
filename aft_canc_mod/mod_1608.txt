MICU course over the last 3 days has been significant for CT demonstrating growth of tumor, bronchoscopy which revealed mucus obstruction as well as clot, and also substantial growth of known tumor.
post-obstructive PNA with vanc/zosyn and vanc has been continued in the setting of MRSA in sputum/bronchial washings.
His pain is well controlled.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic history: -Mediastinal Synovial Cell Sarcoma-Pt presented in [**5-4**] with cough and DOE and CT showed a large central mediastinal mass with near occlusion of the left main stem bronchus.
He had a stent placed by pulmonary and EBUS -guided FNA of the mass which was c/w synovial cell sarcoma.

No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Interval increase in size of mediastinal synovial sarcoma with new splaying of the pulmonary artery and compression of the right pulmonary artery and right atrium.
The mass invades the tracheobronchial tree at the carina with complete left main stem bronchus occlusion causing left lung collapse and moderate pleural effusion.
Right main stem bronchus is patent with right perihilar radiation change.
Small right basilar atelectasis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Very small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59 yo M with mediastinal sarcoma, s/p radiation, chemo, hx left mainstem stent, continued tumor progression admitted in respiratory failure, now extubated, with shift in goals of care toward comfort measures only.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt was initially admitted for increased work of breathing.
CXR with complete white out of left lung concerning for compression left main bronchus which was confirmed with CTA of chest.
IP did a rigid bronch in the setting of collapse lung and possible stent placement.
He also presented with new pleural effusion and hemopsis.
Pt had flex bronch in the MICU which showed a patent left mainstem stent with no evidence of mucus plug or intrastent thrombosis.
He was also found to have MRSA pna and was tx with vancomycin until discharge.
Unfortunately given the fast growth of the tumor and that he would longer be a candidate for radiation since he had max dose during prior tx.
# TACHYCARDIA: pt has been tachycardic since admission with increase in HR to 120s-130s when coughing or with increase WOB.
He has been treated for infection and did not appeared septic.
# Mediastinal Synovial Cell Sarcoma: Followed by [**Hospital1 18**] H/O.
Interval worsening on CT. As noted above, unfortunately given the fast growth of the tumor on his chest and involvement of pulm main stems and pulmonary artery, he is not a surgical candidate.
