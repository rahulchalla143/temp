Admission Date:  [**2196-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-2-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement  History of Present Illness: 80M HTN, Dementia, recent diagnosis of suspected metastatic disease (unknown primary), 5 weeks diarrhea, hx of facial melanoma presents to the ED following a liver biopsy.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 74756**] (Atrius) in early [**2196-7-10**] with complaints of intermittent diarrhea, nausea and vomitting.
The patient was suspected to be suffering from diverticulitis given LLQ discomfort and he was given 1 week of abx.
With no resolution of symptoms from the antibiotics the patient underwent a CT abdomen that revelaed multiple nodules within his liver as well as an IPMN of his pancreas which was confirmed on MRI.
The patient re-presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2196-8-8**] where he was found to be orthostatic and was given 2L of D5NS which resolved his orthostasis.
Per report there were no complications.
5 minutes post procedure the pt reported chest pain [**7-19**] substernal chest pain with radiation to the back.
This pain was not reponsive either oxycodone or dilaudid.
Initial exam notable for right basilar crackles, distended non tender abdomen.
The patient continued to note pain and was given SL Nitro at 12:43 at which time he was triggered for SBP in 60s in both arms.
The pt was found to have bilateral PEs and started on a Heparin gtt, but then the patient had a drop in hematocrit.
After discussion with the vascular and general surgery teams, the heparin gtt was discontinued and an IVC filter was placed by general surgery, the heparin gtt was not restarted, with the thought of waiting 48 hours post procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding.
His blood pressure improved overnight and he received 2 units PRBC's and then his hematocrit remained stable so he was called out to the floor.
He continues to complain of shoulder pain, and has abdominal pain with movement.
Denies any chest pain, pleuritic pain or fever/chills.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes  Past Medical History: # Liver Mass # Pancreatic Cyst # HTN # Dementia # s/p facial melanoma [**2194**] # Fibromyalgia  Social History: Non-Smoker (Never).
Family History: No known family of liver disease  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2: General: AOX3, Squinting in pain with turning.
Supple Lungs: bilateal dry crackles at bases but otherwise clear without focal rales, wheezes or rhonchi, CV: Brady, RRR, S1 + S2, No appreciable loud P2 or RV heave.
GU: + Foley Ext: warm, no appreciable cord.
LLE with ecchymosis along medial aspect of leg.
Trace bilateral pedal edema.
No evidence of intracranial metastasis on this non-contrast study.
If there is clinical concern for intracranial metastatic disease, an MRI of the brain with and without intravenous contrast is recommended.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Incidentally noted are degenerative changes of the cervical spine with anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and C4 on C5, with retrolisthesis of C3 on C4.
Right pulmonary emboli and possibly left pulmonary embolism, as above.
No evidence of acute aortic dissection.
Eccentric mural thrombus with possible small focus of ulcerated plaque at the aortic arch.
Extensive marked mediastinal lymphadenopathy(lymph nodes measure up to 5 cm),left pulmonary nodularity, as above, and associated left pleural effusion raise high concern for metastasis.
Small amount of slightly high density perisplenic fluid, which tracks into the pelvis with trace pelvic fluid, most likely relates to patient's recent liver biopsy.
Ill-defined hypodensity within the liver, not well assessed, but new since the prior study, may relate to biopsy with possible intrahepatic hemorrhage.
No active extravasation seen.
Lucency in T11 vertebral body of indeterminate age, given history of metastatic melanoma, metastasis is not excluded.
Mild compression of the superior endplate of T12 vertebral body of indeterminate age.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2196-8-20**]): FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU course: 80M with HTN, Dementia presenting with chest pain following liver biopsy and found to have bilateral PEs on exam and hypotension.
# Hypotension: occured secondary to receiving nitroglycerin and IV morphine for treatment of chest pain.
The patient also likely bled into the liver biopsy site after being started on anticoagulation (see above CT abdomen report).
# Submassive Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism: After a non-contrast head CT was negative for large intracranial pathology the patient was started on a heparin gtt and admitted to the MICU.
His risk of mortality from residual clot was weighed against his risk of mortality from bleeding into the liver biopsy site and a decision to stop anticoagulation was made.
LENIs showed significant clot burden so an IVC filter was placed by general surgery on [**8-17**].
No other evidence of end organ ischemia or emboli.
Continued to monitor clinically, no intervention.
# Atrial fibrillation: When the patient arrived to the floor he was in atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled with PO metoprolol.
# Metastatic melanoma: upon speaking with pathology regarding the liver biopsy, it was evident that his metastatic disease with unknown primary was melanoma.
This brought up concerns regarding the danger of re-initiating anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolisms and lower extremity deep venous thromboses.
Palliative Care was consulted and provided recommendations.The patient's pain and symptoms were controlled with appropriate medications and the patient expired on [**2196-8-21**].
# Clostridium Difficile colitis: prior to discussions of goals of care, a stool sample was sent for C diff toxin assay, which returned positive.
