Considerable consolidation is still present at both lung bases, small-to-moderate right and left pleural effusions are stable and there is no pneumothorax.
The persistent abnormality in the lower lungs has been attributed to asymmetric edema, but the chronicity now begins to suggest pulmonary hemorrhage, less likely pneumonia because both areas were atelectatic when larger pleural effusions were present.
