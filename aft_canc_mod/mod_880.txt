CT imaging demonstrated new left hydronephrosis with a 10.4 cm prevertebral mass at the point of the ureteral obstruction.
PET scan in [**7-/2146**] confirmed disease  recurrence near the sigmoid anastomosis causing the ureteral obstruction.
She additionally had evidence of metastatic disease to the mesentery and mesenteric nodes.
[**Known firstname **] completed two cycles of FOLFIRI and on CT [**2147-4-14**] she had disease progression involving the known omental metastases and innumerable pulmonary metastasis.
- [**2147-6-20**]: Discussion for participation to a clinical trial with Cisplatin / V1 inhibitor - [**2147-7-21**]: left sided nephrostomy tube replacement - [**7-/2147**]: nephrostomy tube removal - [**2147-8-23**]: Start on Capecitabine - Left hydronephrosis with 2.4 cm prevertebral mass at the point  of apparent ureteral obstruction in pelvis.

Diffuse pulmonary nodular metastases.
Right lower lobe pneumonia and trace effusion.
Apparent increase in size and number of metastatic pulmonary nodules at the lung bases.
New heterogeneously hypodense liver.
This could represent fatty infiltration, but congestive edema and/or diffuse metastases are not excluded.
New mild-to-moderate right hydronephrosis, with incompletely visualized transition point in mid right ureter, suggestive of obstruction by peritoneal metastasis.
Chronic left moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis and atrophy, secondary to obstruction by left L5 paravertebral mass.
Multiple prominent fluid-filled small bowel loops, suggestive of ileus or partial obstruction secondary to increasing mesenteric adhesions.
Diffuse omental and peritoneal implants.
Fibroid uterus.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 53yo female with w metastatic colon cancer admitted with acute ureteral obstruction secondary to metastasis, now status-post bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, hospital course complicated by pyelonephritis and community acquired pneumonia, treated with antibiotics, made comfort measures only, discharged to home with hospice care .
ACTIVE # Acute Kidney Injury: Patient was admitted with a creatinine of 7.2 secondary to obstructive uropathy from compression by peritoneal metastases.
The patient had good UOP from right urostomy, but poor output from L nephrostomy tube (<100cc/day) which was thought to be secondary to known chronic hydronephrosis.
The R tube was not capped, given continued high output from the R nephrostomy tube, thought to be secondary to known compression of the bladder by peritoneal metastases.
# Community Acquired Pneumonia: Admission CXR demonstrated RLL consolidation, for which the patient received 5d augmentin, 14d doxycycline.
# Metastatic Colon Cancer:  Primary issue during hospitalization became pain [**12-27**] multiple metastases.
With palliative input, pain regimen of dilaudid and fentanyl patch was started.
