Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)   History of Present Illness: 56M with hx of hepatitis B, fatty liver presents with one week of abdominal discomfort and fevers.
3 days prior to admission he began to be unable to sleep at night and noticed that he had photophobia to the lights at work.
He also had abdominal pain with deep inspiration located in the right upper quadrant and remarked that his abdomen increased in size - "I had a beer belly and I wasn't drinking beer".
He denies melena and hematochezia, but he isn't sure because his urine has been dark red to brown.
Past Medical History: * Hepatitis B, last hep B surface ag positive in [**2135**]; negative since; biopsy in [**2123**] (at [**Hospital1 336**]) showed chronic active Hepatitis with fibrous bridging * fatty liver * hx of diverticulosis * hx of colon polyp (bx showed leiomyoma) * HTN * borderline high cholesterol   Social History: no hx of etoh,tobacco, or drug abuse; not married, no children; works for the state in information systems  Family History: father died of liver cancer in his 70s; mother and sister both with colon cancer, sister diagnosed at age ~45; no hx of clotting disorders  Physical Exam:  temp 99.5, BP 100/48, HR 109, R 21, O2 94% RA I/O: 3.2/200 Gen: NAD, AO x 3 HEENT: scleral icterus, MM dry, EOMI, PERRL Neck: no JVD Chest: decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases, R>L; dullness to percussion at right base; no wheezes CV: RRR, no g/m/r Abd: +BS, distended, tender to palpation in RUQ; palpable liver edge 3cm below costal margin; ?

This could represent right portal venous thrombosis or markedly slow flow.
Multiple small gallbladder stones and polyps with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Worsened echogenic and heterogeneous liver echotexture with multiple hypoechoic lesions seen diffusely consistent with worsened cirrhotic changes.
No focal lesions.
Given changes within the liver and quetion of right portal vein thrombosis, would recommend multiphasic CT or MR to further evaluate for both right portal vein thrombosis and for liver parenchymal disesae--including worsening cirrhosis, abscesses, or less likely metastasis or infarct.
Left lower lobe consolidation, representing either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Persistent small right pleural effusion.
Innumerable subcentimeter low attenuation lesions within the liver, which are too small to characterize, likely simple cysts or biliary hamartomas.
1.7 low-attenuation cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas concerning for carcinoma.
Further characterization with a dedicated abdominal MRI is recommended.
Colonic diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, small on the left, and likely moderate on the right with a probable subpulmonic component.
Focal right basilar opacity which may be due to atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
Rim-enhancement of the intrahepatic biliary ducts with an isolated probable ring-enhancing abscess within segment V of the liver.
Smaller peri- biliary cysts are visualized as well, this raises the possibility of underlying caroli's disease, or parasitic infection.
Ill- defined parenchymal infiltrates throughout the liver.
This constellation of finding is most likely compatible with cholangitis, liver abscess and secondary edema throughout the liver; however, an infiltrating hepatoma cannot be excluded and MRI followup after patient's clinical condition stabilizes is recommended.
Approximately 1.5 cm septated lesion within the pancreas, likely an Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumor (IPMT) for which one year followup is recommended to assess for stability.
[**2151-6-16**] ERCP Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis.
Successful balloon extraction of common duct stone.
Brief Hospital Course: 56M with history of hepatitis B, fatty liver, family hx of colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma admitted on [**6-9**] to the MICU and transferred to CC7 on [**6-12**] from the MICU following fevers, jaundice, RUQ abdominal pain, and severe sepsis.
His diagnoses on this stay included cholangitis secondary to common bile duct stone (removed via ERCP [**6-16**]), pancreatic mass seen on MRCP (likely IPMT), and a 1.5 hepatic abscess (treated with 4 weeks of Levo).
He also has a RLL effusion and an unexplained blood loss (OB+ stool) will be followed up as an outpatient.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] will also follow his pleural effusion with an xray in a week.
Please return to the hospital if you have a fever greater than 101.0 degrees Farenhite of if your abdominal pain recurrs.
As you know, your chest x-ray and physical exam are consistent with some fluid surrounding the right lung.
Rather, he wants to follow up with you in 1 week to do a repeat chest x-ray and see if the treatment of your infection and gall-stone disease isn't sufficient for the resolution of this finding.
