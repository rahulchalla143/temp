Past Medical History: - NSCLC IIIB (T2N2M0): Initially noted to have a right middle lobe lung nodule on chest x ray done for pneumonia in [**2173-4-19**] with subsequent chest CT on [**2173-5-8**] showing a 2.4 x 1.6 cm right middle lobe nodule as well as bibasilar infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (1.9 x 1.3 cm left paratracheal and 1.8 x 0.8 cm subcarinal).
Repeat chest CT on [**2173-7-28**] was interpreted as persistent right middle lobe nodule grossly unchanged to slightly larger in size with the mediastinum commented as stable.
On [**2174-5-2**] a repeat chest CT showed an increase in size to 4 x 2.3 cm of the spiculated nodule abutting the hemidiaphragm without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Subsequent PET/CT on [**2174-5-5**] showed FDG-avid uptake in the nodule with peak SUV 7.3 as well as in a small right hilar lymph node with peak SUV 4.8 without other areas of abnormal uptake identified.
Underwent cervical mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage on [**2174-5-16**] with pathology positive for adenocarcinoma in level 7 lymph nodes (CK7 positive, CK20 and TTF negative).
Lymph nodes from levels 2R, 4L, and 4L were negative for malignancy.
Cytology from bronchoalveolar lavage from the right middle lobe was also positive for adenocarcinoma.
Started definitive chemoradiation on [**2174-6-16**] with weekly carboplatin and taxol and XRT.
