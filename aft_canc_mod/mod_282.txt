[**2162-9-2**] Blood Cultures pending  Brief Hospital Course: 76yo M PMHx recent arthroscopic knee surgery 1d prior to presentation, recent cystoscopy 9d prior to presentation, presenting w fever to 104.1, hypotension  # Hypotension / Sepsis - Patient presented with hypotension, fever, tachycardia, meeting SIRS criteria, on review of likely infection sources, UA appearing most likely source, especially given recent cystoscopy 1wk prior to presentation, although would lung and knee s/p arthroscopy were also considered.
Urine was grossly positive with cultures + for GNRs, no sensitivites performed because felt to have fecal contamination.
Of note while on floor patient had episodes of asymptomatic Sys BP to 80s overnight after being fluid diuresed for flash pulmonary edema after surgey (see L femoral neck fracture section) During first episode patient was given fluid boluses with response.
However, as patient was asymptomatic also not tachycardic, episodes of hypotension also felt to have dysautomic component.
Patient's BPs were monitored with no episodes of hypotension after the previously mentioned event.
The patient was continued on ciprofloxacin and meropenem and a second urine culture was negative for growth.
# Elevated Troponin - Pt never had chest pain but w troponins elevated in ED in setting of sinus tachycardia; EKG w ST depressions in V4-V5; no prior cardiac history, likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia, hypotension, chronic kidney disease; no suspicion for STEMI.
# L femoral neck fracture - The patient was incidentally found to have L femoral neck fracture on CT abd on [**2162-8-27**], acute in appearance; patient denying any recent trauma; pt w h/o osteoporosis; orthopedic surgery was aware and performed a hemi-arthroplasty on [**2162-8-31**].
During surgery the patient received 1700mL, as well as blood products and the patient developed shortness of breath and an oxygen requirement from pulmonary edema as evidenced on CXR, he was sent to the MICU and diuresed with improvement of symptoms and transferred to the floor over night.
The patient also complained of pain at hip after surgery, Pain service was consulted and a pain regimen was instituted with standing oxycontin, oxycodone PRN, and dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Patient continued on Fludrocortisone, Baclofen, Gabapentin continued however at lower dose for concern for hypotension and lethargy.
# Tremor - Essential Tremor, chronic, stable: carbidopa-levodopa.
Held primidone, and initially propranolol in setting of acute illness.
Propanolol restarted, he became hypotensive which responded to 2 - 500cc boluses and he was stable thereafter.
Held quetiapine in setting of acute illness.
# GERD: cont metoclopramide and pantoprazole  # h/o DVT - Restarted Coumadin which was held for arthroscopy.
We restarted at a reduced dose to 4mg in setting of systemic antibiotics.
# Chronic Abd Distention: continued bowel regimen, simethicone.

Activity Status: Bedbound- Patient is a paraplegic at baseline and during this hospitalization had a hemi-arthroplasty for a left femur fracture.
You were treated for an infection; you recently had a knee arthroscopy and a bladder cystoscopy.
Our orthopedic surgeons came and saw you and we felt the likely the source of your infection was your urine.
You were kept in the ICU briefly because of the infection and sepsis (infection in your bloodstream) and placed on IV antibiotics.
While here you were also found to have a fracture of your left femoral neck.
