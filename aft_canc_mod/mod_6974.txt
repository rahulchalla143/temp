Admission Date:  [**2146-3-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2146-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-9-7**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  73-year-old male with a history of hormone resistant prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2137**], failed radiation seeds and Lupron therapy presented to he Emergency [**2146-3-22**] with three weeks of progressive shortness of breath.
The patient stated that over the past six months he has noted poor exercise tolerance, inability to lie flat but denied back pain, neurologic compromise, cough or hemoptysis.
The patient's shortness of breath acutely worsened in the past three days and the patient came to the Emergency Room.
The patient denies fever, chills, sweats or chest pain.
In the Emergency Room the patient was noted to be hypoxic with paradoxical breaths and he was placed on pressure support mask, ventilation and had three liters of grossly bloody fluid drawn off the from the right lung by the Intensive Care Unit team under supervision of Interventional Pulmonary.
Repeat chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax and clear lung fields except two perihilar masses.
The patient was taken to the medical floor for further management but this morning the patient was noted to be tachypneic, hypoxic with an arterial blood gases revealing the following numbers 7.31, 60, 78, with O2 sats in the 94% range on two liters nasal cannula with patient using accessory muscles and the patient was noted to be quite lethargic and somnolent.
Floor team noticed decreased breath sounds halfway up in the right lung field and a third of the way up in the left lung field with dullness to percussion with a respiratory rate at that time 25.
A chest CT was performed which revealed numerous metastatic processes within the lungs and mediastinum with some constriction of the right pulmonary artery.
The patient was seen once again by the Interventional Pulmonary team who checked a repeat chest x-ray which revealed rapid re-accumulation of effusion and at that time the recommendation was made to consider admission to Intensive Care Unit secondary to the patient's persistent tachypnea and relative hypoxia.
Prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2137**], status post radiation seeds, Lupron treatment, PSA still climbing despite therapy.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Decreased breath sounds up one third of the way up in left lung fields.
Abdominal exam:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding.
Pleural fluid analysis gram stain, no organism, no growth, no Acid fast bacilli.
CTA:  No PE, enumerable metastatic processes bilaterally throughout lungs and mediastinum, bulky lymphadenopathy in the hilar region.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit service for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Mask ventilation was continued to prevent respiratory compromise.
Cytology revealed the patient had metastatic prostate cancer and it was thought that this was the cause of the patient's rapidly re-accumulating pleural effusions.
The patient was also found to have a post obstructive pneumonia and aggressive chest physical therapy and bronchoscopy was considered for sputum removal.
Ultrasound was performed by Interventional Pulmonary service to ascertain if he had re-accumulated any pleural effusion for further thoracentesis and it was found at that time that the patient's right diaphragm was greatly elevated which was the cause of his decreased breath sounds on the right.
It was thought that there was probable phrenic nerve involvement of the metastatic process and this had caused diaphragmatic compromise on the right.
The Interventional Pulmonary Team felt there would be no benefit in thoracentesis since pleural effusions were small and probably not compromising the patient's oxygenation and ventilation significantly.
It was thought that the patient's metastatic process was causing the patient's pulmonary compromise.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and myself had a thorough discussion with the family, explained these findings and given the fact that the patient's pulmonary function was severely compromised due to metastatic process which could not be resolved it was thought that intubation and cardiac resuscitation would not be appropriate.
Respiratory failure secondary to metastatic prostate     cancer.
Post obstructive pneumonia.
