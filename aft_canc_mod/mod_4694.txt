She states that her headache is frontal across the brows.
She denies recent falls, loss of consiousness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness or tingling sensation, bowel or bladder incontinence.
CT imaging showed a right frontal hemorrhage and she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch except L5 decreased bilat, propioception, pinprick and vibration bilaterally.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: finger-nose-finger slower on left, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin slightly slower on left  CT [**2148-10-6**]:right frontal CVA verses hemorhage with 7 mm midline shift.
Will need MRI with and without contrast to evaluate for underlying lesion.

Will need MRI with and without contrast to evaluate for underlying lesion.
Dominant cystic-necrotic mass, largely replacing the right frontal lobe with predominantly cystic and acute hemorrhagic components, involving the rostrum and crossing the midline to involve the left forceps minor.
The lesion extends superficially with evidence of pial transgression and probable pachymeningeal involvement.
Small necrotic "satellite" lesion in the right precentral gyrus, consistent with above.
Subfalcine herniation, with 12mm leftward shift of midline structures, but no evidence of uncal or more central herniation.
Three punctate acute infarcts in the territory of the distal A2 and A3 segments of the right ACA, as a consequence of extrinsic mass effect and compression of the neighbouring vessels by the right frontal mass.
No evidence of vascular territorial infarction.
Aspiration with nectar-consistency barium.
She did well on this day and plan was for MRI with and without contrast for further evaluation of this R frontal mass.
She was started on dilantin 100mg every 8 hours for seizure prophylaxis and plan was to check a level [**10-7**] a.m .
MRI on this day showed R frontal enhancing mass suspicious for glioma.
Her chest x ray showed a RLL consolidation and she was started on triple antibiotic therapy for hospital aquired pneumonia.
The family wished to continue [**Hospital 17073**] medical management of her pneumonia throughout the weekend and re-evaluate her status on Monday [**10-14**] with the possibility of CMO if she did not improve.
The final plan was to continue [**Hospital 17073**] medical management of her pneumonia and discharge to home with and bridge from home VNA to hospice care.
Her last dose of IV antibiotics for treatment of her pneumonia will be on [**10-18**].
