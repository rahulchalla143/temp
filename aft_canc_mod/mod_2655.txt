Admission Date:  [**2164-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-6-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-2-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction), and cerebrovascular accident who originally presented on [**6-11**] from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with painless jaundice and a 55-pounds weight over the past year here for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
The patient noticed gradual jaundice since [**2164-5-25**].
No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills.
An abdominal computed tomography on [**2164-5-31**] from the outside hospital was reported to have shown moderate ascites, a large liver and spleen, and dilation of the biliary tree, with a question of intrahepatic malignancy.
An abdominal ultrasound at the outside hospital on [**2164-6-1**] showed splenomegaly, ascites, gallbladder wall thickening, and dilated ducts in the liver.
A magnetic resonance imaging on [**2164-6-2**] at the outside hospital showed dilation of the biliary tree and a 4-cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**6-11**] performed at [**Hospital1 69**] showed an intraductal mass, and plastic stent placed.
The mass was brushed and cells were sent to cytology which were positive for adenocarcinoma.
Additionally, the patient was found to have an increased creatinine while admitted.
The patient was treated multiple times with Kayexalate for a high potassium.
A paracentesis was performed on [**6-13**] which showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
During the course of hemodialysis the patient became hypotensive in the 80s/40s, and was subsequently volume resuscitated with 2.2 liters of fluids.
His blood pressure did not increase, and the patient began to experience shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction.
A catheterization performed in [**2162-5-23**] showed no significant coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram performed in [**2162-5-23**] showed diastolic dysfunction without systolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Cerebrovascular accident with a right facial droop.
Left hydronephrosis; chronic ?
Mild spinal stenosis at L4-L5.
Left anterior temporal lobe small arachnoid cyst.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No intravenous drug abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was not significant for gastrointestinal problems or [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Chest examination revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally/anteriorly.
Mild expiratory wheezes.
A [**1-26**] holosystolic murmur heard at the left fifth intercostal space midclavicular line.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Positive fluid wave.
A right femoral Quinton catheter.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Positive asterixis bilaterally.
Specific gravity was 1.016, large blood, 100 protein, moderate bilirubin, trace leukocytes, greater than 50 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells, few bacteria, and amorphous crystals.
Microscopic examination from ascites taken from [**6-13**] revealed no growth, no polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no organisms seen on Gram stain, 55 white blood cells, and 3045 red blood cells.
Brush on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography taken from [**6-11**] was positive for malignancy cells adenocarcinoma.
Urine cultures from [**6-12**] and [**6-13**] revealed no growth.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**6-12**] revealed sludge in the gallbladder, negative [**Doctor Last Name **] sign, liver shrunken with increased echogenicity, enlarged spleen, and portal vein was patent.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen performed on [**6-11**] (although limited by the patient's claustrophobia), revealed massive ascites, left greater than right small bilateral pleural effusions, liver nodularity (consistent with cirrhosis), 3.6-cm X 4.8-cm mass with increased signal in segment 4A liver, spleen mildly enlarged, varices along the stomach (portal hypertension), gallbladder with no stones and no ductal dilatation.
A chest x-ray on [**6-14**] revealed right internal jugular in place and pulmonary edema.
No infiltrate.
No pneumothorax.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   In summary, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular accident who presented with painless jaundice and a 55-pound weight loss, status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent, now with cirrhosis and acute renal failure and probable cholangiocarcinoma.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with hypotension and shortness of breath.
Hypotension was most likely secondary to sepsis.
The patient's pulmonary status was monitored closely while receiving fluid boluses for blood pressure so as to prevent a flare of pulmonary edema.
Shortness of breath differential diagnoses  included cirrhosis, renal failure, ascites (atelectasis), possible congestive heart failure or fluid overload.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES: No aspirin was given at this time as the patient was coagulopathic with an increased INR.
Mild congestive heart failure was seen on chest x-ray on [**6-11**].
Findings included left atrium was mildly dilated, left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size were normal, hyperdynamic, right ventricular size and motion were normal, aortic valve leaflets were thickened, no regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  Intraductal mass was positive for adenocarcinoma by cytology.
The patient's treatment options and prognosis were discussed at length with the patient and his family.
Total bilirubin and liver function tests were checked daily to assess for obstruction.
If these values were to increase significantly, could possibly replace stent with a more permanent stent via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to relieve obstruction.
RENAL ISSUES:  Acute renal failure; question as to etiology - acute tubular necrosis; status post contrast for computed tomography versus hepatorenal syndrome.
No fluid was removed in hemodialysis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was originally started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl for presumed cholangitis causing a septic picture with increased white blood cells, hypotension, and hypothermia.
Urine cultures from [**6-12**] and [**6-13**] showed no growth.
Ascites from [**6-13**] showed no growth.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient remained coagulopathic secondary to liver disease.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient received fluid boluses for a decreased blood pressure; yet remained saturating well on 4 liters nasal cannula oxygen and had no complaints of chest discomfort.
The patient will most likely either be discharged to the floor in a private bed or go home soon with some kind of hospice care or visiting nurse assistance; pending Social Work evaluation and discussions with the family and the patient.
Acute renal failure.
Coronary artery disease/congestive heart failure.
