There was a large overlying blood clot which could not be cleared by aggressive irrigation.
Full circumference of ulcer could not be visualized given size and presence of large clot- decision made not to inject or cauterize.
Impression: Ulcer in the proximal bulb Recommendations: High risk for large re-bleed.
[**2127-8-5**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Progressive fullness in the right lower paratracheal region could be due to seriously engorged azygos vein and possible accompanying adenopathy.
Previous right upper lobe edema or consolidation has largely cleared since [**8-4**].
Differential diagnosis of transient lobar edema includes acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary venous thrombosis.
Heart size is normal and there is no left pleural effusion.
Following the removal of the left central venous catheter there has been no generalized mediastinal widening to suggest hemorrhage.

# UGIB: Patient found with significant HCT drop from most recent admission 45-->23 and BRBPR on admission.
EGD in unit per GI on night of admission showed a large 3.5cm ulcer was found on the posterior duodenal bulb with a very large adherent clot.
Gen surgery was consulted that evening, however given his commorbidities of metastatic Lung CA with brain mets they deferred invasive surgical intervention.
On up titration of Diltiazem, patient experienced episodes of hypotension.
By [**8-11**], his BPs were at his presumed baseline (110-140 systolic), though he was found to be slightly volume overloaded on lung exam.
# Acute on CRF: Patient w/ baseline cr of 1.1 - 1.9, sustained acute renal failure secondary to hypotension in setting of UGIB.
#Onc: Patient w/ known metastic lung cancer to brain.
Continued supportive care, pain control prn.
# Respiratory Distress: Likely result of worsening albumin status with fluid extravesation into lungs on top of poor clearance of oral secretions and likely aspiration.
# UTI: The patient was found with urinary frequency, sometimes complaining of pain as well.
UCx revealed Enterococci (Sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, Vancomycin; Resistant to Tetracycline), so he was begun on a 7-day course of Amoxicillin, beginning on [**8-10**].
Urinalysis showed [**2-24**] WBC and moderate bacteria.
As of [**8-13**], he continued to complain of pain on urination.
# Depression/Mental Status Changes: Patient with known baseline of anxiety and depression.
Episodes of confusion, and combativeness, especially at night occurred throughout admission.
Current confusion most likely related to known brain metasteses and UTI.
# PPX - Patient was continued on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and then switched to oral PPI once daily on discharge.
# ACCESS - Left IJ cordis removed on [**8-7**] without complication.
# DISPO - To hospice for end of life care.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Q6HR prn fever #.
Haloperidol 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Lung Cancer Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate Upper Gastrointestinal bleed   Discharge Condition: Seriously ill with respiratory compromise.
Discharge Instructions: You have been treated for a gastroentestinal bleed during your hospital stay with IV fluids and blood and embolization of an artery in your stomach.
You experience no further bleeding episodes after this point.
During your stay you also had a rapid irregular heart beat that was complicated by low blood pressure.
You were treated with diltiazem with resolution of your rapid heart rate.
