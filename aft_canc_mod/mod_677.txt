Admission Date:  [**2199-3-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2199-3-28**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old male with significant cardiac history who presented with three weeks of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
On the day of admission, he had shortness of breath while laying in bed and was seen by his primary care physician who referred him in to the Emergency Department for evaluation.
He denied chest pain or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers or chills.
Coronary artery disease status post four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2189**].
Myelodysplastic syndrome with thrombocytopenia.
Basal cell carcinoma of the face.
History of dysplastic colonic polyps.
Cataracts bilaterally.
Degenerative joint disease with L4, L5 discharge herniation.
Aortic stenosis with moderate aortic insufficiency.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 40% on echocardiogram in [**2198**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for a brother with muscular dystrophy.
ALLERGIES:   Ciprofloxacin, demerol and morphine, all of which cause nausea and vomiting.
In general, he was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
Mucous membranes were moist with notable conjunctivitis with some mild exophthalmus.
Oropharynx was notable for poor dentition.
His neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.
His heart was irregularly irregular with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur in the right upper sternal border.
His lungs were notable for coarse rhonchi; no wheezes or crackles.
His extremities had petechiae on the left leg with onychomycosis and no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
LABORATORY:  His laboratory data on admission included a CBC with a hematocrit of 29.5, white blood cell count of 8300, platelet count of 94.
Chest x-ray showed new linear atelectasis in the left mid lung zone with no obvious evidence for congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the sixties, normal axis and intervals and no acute changes since prior examination of [**2198-12-8**].
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital 139**] Medical Service for management of his shortness of breath given his complex cardiac history.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted with the presumptive differential diagnosis of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure versus pneumonia versus anemia.
He was also ruled out for myocardial infarction as the potential cause of his congestive failure.
He had no obvious evidence for pneumonia and improved slightly with diuresis; however, given his aortic stenosis as a potential source of his increasing shortness of breath, Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was called.
After stabilizing his shortness of breath with diuresis in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient was transferred to the floor for preoperative management of his aortic stenosis.
On [**3-12**], he was taken to the Operating Room for a dental extraction which he underwent without complication.
The patient had been on a heparin drip for his atrial fibrillation which was held for the procedure.
Shortly after he resumed heparin drip, the patient had bleeding from the extraction site which will be discussed further under the Hematology and anemia section below.
The remaining following week of his hospitalization, the patient had continued improvement, however, upon re-evaluation for cardiothoracic surgery, the patient as well as the Cardiothoracic Surgery Team felt that he was not at a stable enough place for surgery.
He had no further bleeding or complications.
The following day, the patient was in excellent spirits and had no complications from the procedure.
He will start his 2.5 mg of warfarin following a 24 to 48 hour window with no evidence of groin hematoma or complication of the valvuloplasty procedure.
He will continue on his home medications as per admission for his other cardiovascular conditions including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
Of note, the patient was kept on Telemetry during his stay in the hospital and had alarms for atrial fibrillation which was stable; in addition, the patient had episodic runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which lasted between four and ten beats and converted spontaneously.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's shortness of breath was initially not felt to be caused by pneumonia and chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Early on in his hospitalization when he was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient spiked a fever to 102.0 F.  The possible sources included community-acquired pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia and a possible intravenous site cellulitis.
He was maintained on the antibiotics for 21 days while waiting to rule out any potential endocarditis or infection prior to potential surgery.
The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out any endocarditis prior to cardiothoracic surgery.
The echocardiogram showed no evidence of valvular vegetations.
Other Infectious Disease issues were that the patient was initially admitted with conjunctivitis and was continued on Levofloxacin eye drops which were switched to erythromycin eye drops.
At the time of this dictation, he remains free of any conjunctivitis or ocular complaints.
The patient remained afebrile from his transfer from the Cardiac Care Unit and for the remaining two weeks of his hospitalization.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome with thrombocytopenia.
He was initially continued on his Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and was switched to a heparin drip pending further procedural work-up.
He was transfused three units of packed red blood cells for the initial blood loss as well as an additional unit for equilibration.
Based on his bleeding risks in conjunction with potential cardiovascular surgery, he was evaluated by the Hematology Service who recommended testing of his platelets as a potential support preoperatively.
NEUROLOGIC / PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient had episodes of delirium early in his hospital course which were felt to be secondary to initially to his shortness of breath and also secondary to medications.
He had responses with confusion and agitation secondary to receiving sedating medications including Ambien and other benzodiazepines as well as opiate narcotics.
He had a head CT scan which showed no active bleed.
He also had a significant reversal of his sleep cycle and was awake most of the nights, sleeping most of the day.
GOUT:  The patient has a history of gout and had a flare of gout significantly on his right toe and more moderate pain on his left toe.
Based on his flare and attempts to improve his pain while ambulating, the patient was started on colchicine.
The colchicine was mildly effective, however, was complicated by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
These symptoms improved upon discontinuation of the colchicine.
At the time of this dictation, his gout remains tolerable, but it is recommended that he continue with oral hydration and may need further treatment for his gout flare if it continues in the future.
