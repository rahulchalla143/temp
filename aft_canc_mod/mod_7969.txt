Her pain improved and was well controlled on tylenol.
After her third operation she was volume overloaded and remained on the ventilator while she was aggressively diuresed.
Due to her persistent tachycardia a CTA of her chest was obtained, which revealed no pulmonary embolus.
This decline along with a substantial leukocytosis prompted a CT scan on [**9-15**] which revealed a large abdominal fluid collection surrounding the anastomotic site.
A repeat CT scan on [**9-18**] showed a new LLQ fluid collection which was percutaneously drained with a pigtail catheter and the current RUQ drain was exchanged.
