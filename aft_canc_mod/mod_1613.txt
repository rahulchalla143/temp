Over the next few days he developed a dry cough, which by 3 days PTA became productive of yellow/green sputum.

CTA showed a small LLL PNA with no evidence of PE, and enlarging right apical tumor.
He was admitted to the floor and had a slowly increasing O2 requirement to the point that this AM was satting 86% on 6L NC, requiring an NRB.

Mild biceps and finger flexion weakness.
Post-surgical changes related to prior right upper thoracotomy and reconstruction as well as right upper lobectomy are again noted.
There is subtle increased nodular opacity at the left lung base, which raises concern for pneumonia.
No large pleural effusions are seen, though the right CP angle is excluded.
Left humeral head prosthesis is noted.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for left basilar pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] was a 54 yo man with HIV on HAART (viral load undetectable, last CD4 in [**3-11**] 374), stage IV squamous lung CA s/p RUL s/p lobectomy, chemo/XRT, local and distal recurrence, HCV who presented with worsening fatigue, weakness, increasing dyspnea, new pleuritic chest pain, sputum production and confusion.
# Stage IV lung CA: On presentation, Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] had an apical mass expanding, adrenal mass on CTA suspicious for metastasis and radicular symptoms in right arm likely [**1-3**] nerve compression but per Pain Clinic.
On hospital day six, Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] reported significnt concern over a new foot drop on the right which progressed to include right leg paralysis and numbness.
An MRI of the Spine revealed metastatic tumor cord compression at C7 to T3 with significant stenosis at T2.
Neuro-Surgery determined that he was a poor surgical candidate because of the extensive surgical debridment required or and high-risk nature of the surgery.
Radiation Oncology evaluated him and determined that re-radiation was unlikely to improve his symptoms because of poor tumor response in the past.
# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC - He was found to have a LLL consolodation consistent with a LLL pneumonia.
He recieved 7 days of imperic antibotics with azithromycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl which seemed to have resolved the pneumonia, but he continued to [**Known lastname 28148**] difficulty oxygenating.
And a Bubble study and Echo did not further identifying cause of hypoxia.
In the setting of his lobectomy and recurrent lung cancer, his new hypoxia was believed to represent a new baseline oxygen need.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS ??????
Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28148**] several paroxysmal episodes of profound agitation and combativeness that responded best to zyprexa 5mg.
These may have occured due to metabolic derangement in setting of tumor burden or possibly brain mets.
# HCV: unknown VL.
Bx in [**2193**] -chronic viral hepatitis C with grade 2 inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis.
No stigmata of acute liver failure or cirrhosis.
# HIV/AIDS on HAART: CD4 374 in [**3-11**] with undetectable VL.
Has had apthous ulcers recently.
