Note:  Sections reveal histiocytes and giant cells within the interstitium of the superficial dermis.
There is associated mild lymphocytic inflammation.
There is marked elastophagocytosis within the giant cells.
Special stains (PAS, GMS, AFB, [**Last Name (un) 18566**], and gram) are negative for organisms.
Skin, left 2nd finger, biopsy (B):     Interstitial neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation, see note and comment.
Note:  Sections reveal histiocytes and giant cells with associated clusters of neutrophils within the interstitium of the superficial dermis.
There is marked elastophagocytosis within the giant cells.
Special stains (PAS, GMS, AFB, [**Last Name (un) 18566**], and gram) are negative for organisms.
The differential diagnosis includes a palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis which may be observed with a number of underlying systemic disorders including as a paraneoplastic process which may be associated with leukemias and lymphomas and as a reaction pattern associated with various autoimmune disorders, in particular rheumatoid arthritis, and less likely sarcoidosis.
There is a case report describing elastophagocytosis in association with Sweet's syndrome, therefore, due to the neutrophilic component and mild papillary dermal edema, Sweet's syndrome (or due to the acral site - neutrophilic dermatosis of the hands variant of Sweet's) is possible.
An interstitial granulomatous drug reaction is considered less likely.
The pattern is not a typical pattern observed with infections, however, due to the finding of mixed granulomatous and neutrophilic inflammation infection cannot be excluded.
Special stains were negative, however, if the process persists, a re-biopsy for culture may be helpful as culture is a more sensitive method to detect organisms than histologic special stains.
[**10-20**]: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY DIAGNOSIS:      Erythroid dominant myelodysplastic marrow with excess blasts.
Respiratory-type mucosa and fibrovascular tissue with mild chronic inflammation and surface epithelial degenerative changes.
No organisms identified by PAS or GMS stains.
Respiratory-type mucosa, bone, and vascular tissue with mild chronic inflammation.
No organisms identified by PAS or GMS stains.
NOTABLE IMAGING .
Tiny 9 mm fluid collection with possible rim enhancement anterior to the left sternocleidomastoid muscle may be at the site of prior central line insertion and could represent a superficial abscess.
No thrombus within the left internal jugular vein to suggest Lemierre's disease.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities within the upper lungs are incompletely evaluated, but are concerning for an infectious process, less likely pulmonary edema.
Hepatomegaly with a nodular contour to the liver and prominent porta hepatis lymph nodes.
The morphology suggests chronic liver disease, although no diagnostic features of PSC are seen.
Dilated common bile duct measuring up to 1.2 cm without a definite cause seen.
This appearance could be due to a choledochal cyst versus ampullary stenosis, the latter is considered less likely given the normal caliber of the pancreatic duct.
Distended endometrial canal as seen on the prior CT.
This could be further evaluated by pelvic ultrasound if clinically appropriate.
Cluster of cysts in the left adnexal region, also seen on the recent CT. Again, this could be clarified with dedicated ultrasound if deemed appropriate.
[**10-31**] LUE LENI CONCLUSION: There is thrombus in the left axillary vein as well as in the basilic vein, although intervening brachial vein appears to be patent.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 56872**] is an 82 year old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis recently hospitalized with hypoxemic respiratory failure, at which time she was diagnosed with pulmonary histioplasmosis and myelodysplastic syndrome (RAEB-2), who presented on [**2124-10-13**] with fevers and left sided neck pain, found to have idiopathic granulomatous disease, hospital course complicated by 1 episode severe epistaxis.
She was originally admitted to the floor, transferred to the ICU for respiratory decompensation, out to the floor on the BMT service once stabilized, back to the ICU for epistaxis requiring 4U PRBC transfusion and nasal balloon placement, then to the BMT service for further workup.
Her primary problem was determined to be fever [**1-5**] idiopathic granulomatous disease, diagnosed during this admission.
# FEVER Fevers started two days prior to admission.
Multiple potential sources of fever were identified and treatment without improvement in fevers, as follows: .
#NECK ABSCESS Patient c/o left sided neck pain on admission, was found to have 9mm fluid collection concerning for superficial abscess at the site of a previous central venous line.
Fluid G/S was positive for leukocytes and Gram positive cocci in pairs but culture was ultimately negative.
#IDIOPATHIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE Given the patient?????
?s h/o ulcerative colitis, rash, previous biopsies showing granulomatous disease in the skin and bone marrow, and persistence of fever despite appropriate antibiotic treatment of multiple infections, as above.
Sarcoidosis was suggested as a plausible diagnosis given granulomatous disease, EN, and mediastinal adenopathy; ultimately, rheumatology consult determined that the patient's cluster of symptoms and pathology findings of granulomas in multiple anatomic sites could be explained by a unifying diagnosis of Idiopathic Granulomatous Disease.
#NEUTROPHILIC DERMATOSIS The patient developed a rash on her legs and hands during her previous admission with biopsy revealing erythema nodosum, consistent with h/o UC.
During this admission, she again developed erythematous papules on bilateral hands and thighs.
Repeat biopsy revealed neutrophilic dermatosis suggestive of Sweet?????
?s syndrome, deep fungal infection or atypical mycobacterial infection; these were treated with 2 weeks of topical steroids with good effect.
In addition to what is described, she had hypoxia requiring intubation.
PNA identified on CXR was treated with antibiotics with good resolution of symptoms and successful extubation.
Additional episodes of tachypnea & tachycardia thereafter resolved rapidly; the ICU team felt mucous plug and/or panic disorder might explain these transient symptoms given rapid resolution without significant intervention.
Suffered multiple episodes of L sided bleeding that lasted 1 hour and stopped spontaneously.
ENT packed the L nares lesion at 1 AM w cautery and advised avoidance of NC O2 administration.
She had an estimated blood loss of [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56875**] cc.
Resuscitation was limited by peripheral access.
She was noted be tachycardic to 110s and hypertensive to SBP 160s.
CT of the sinuses was done to rule out fungal infection which showed no obvious source.
No recurrent epistaxis.
#LEFT ARM PICC-ASSOCIATED DVT PICC placed [**10-31**]; patient developed pain and swelling in her left arm overnight that night - doppler ultrasound showed DVT, which was seen to have been present (but smaller) on imaging earlier during this admission.
PICC was replaced in the right arm for frequent blood draws and antibiotic administration; it was tolerated without problems during admission and removed prior to discharge.
No anticoagulation was given for this line-associated clot given concominant severe epistaxis.
#DIARRHEA Having loose stools throughout admission, although this was difficult to differentiate from her baseline.
Stool studies were negative for C. Diff, bacterial, parasitic or viral infection.
Started empirically metronidazole without improvement.
*Hx HISTOPLASMOSIS INTERMEDIATE-POSITIVE URINE ANTIGEN Pt carried a diagnosis of histoplasmosis from previous admission for which she was being treated with voriconazole.
CT of the chest revealed overall improvement in previously seen opacities, although it was notable for some slightly increased adenopathy.
She also developed a rash in her extremities.
Biopsy was obtained out of concern for disseminated fungal infection, but culture revealed no growth of bacterial or fungal organisms.
# ELEVATED Alk Phos/POSITIVE GGT: Noted during this admission, with biliary ductal dilatation on ultrasound.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis was high on the differential given h/o Ulcerative Colitis (s/p colon resection many years ago).
MRCP [**10-24**] showed no biliary dilatation, no obstruction, and was most c/w chronic liver disease plus porta hepatis lymphadenopathy.
Despite MRSC negative for PSC rheumatology felt symptoms and labs could be consistent with biliary inflammation below the level of detection of imaging.
There was concern that her fevers might be due to transformation of underlying MDS, but BM biopsy showed no leukemia.
#HARD PALATE VESICLES Patient noted to have asymptomatic clustered vesicles on her hard palate on [**10-29**].
Expect possible recurrence given inflammatory etiology; will need intermittent treatment.
[**Month (only) 116**] need reimaging to document resolution of line-associated DVT.

Secondary Diagnoses: Myelodysplastic Syndrome Epistaxis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had an abscess in your neck which resolved with antibiotics after drainage.
You had pneumonia which was also treated with antibiotics.
You were evaluated by rheumatologists who felt that your persistent fever and many of your other symptoms could be explained by a diagnosis of Idiopathic Granulomatous Disease (IDP), which is likely related to your ulcerative colitis.
These symptoms improved with steroids.
We started you on antibiotics to prevent viral and fungal infections.
You were recently diagnosed with Myelodysplastic Syndrome.
You had a bone marrow biopsy because we were concerned that your symptoms might be related to your Myelodysplastic Syndrome.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome can sometimes develop into leukemia, but the bone marrow showed that you do not have leukemia.
You also had an episode of nosebleeding which required 4 blood transfusions and nasal packing.
STARTED MODIL (DIPHENOXYLATE-ATROPINE): TAKE 1 TAB EVERY 6 HOURS AS NEEDED FOR DIARRHEA.
