IMAGING: * Chest CT [**2125-4-28**]: A 1.3 x 1.6 cm left upper lobe nodule is re-demonstrated, abutting a left rib without causing cortical breakthrough.
Throughout the lungs are multiple cysts, mostly peripherally based in the lateral lobes and apparent honeycombing adjacent pattern although this may also represent pneumonia in emphysematous lung.
In the right lower lobe, there is a spiculated focus of increased opacification.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There are prominent prevascular nodes measuring to 9 mm in short axis dimension.
Subcarinal nodes are enlarged at 1.5 cm maximal short axis diameter.
A paratracheal node measures to 1.7 cm, and bilateral hilar nodes are also noted, most on the left.
Heart and great vessels are essentially unremarkable excepting for vascular calcifications and some atherosclerosis.
There is a central line with its tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC.
There is a 5.2 cm low-attenuation cystic lesion in the right kidney.
* CXR: The patient has known emphysema and interstitial lung disease.
Given the underlying emphysema, edema may assume atypical configuration and the overall appearance may be due to failure.
However, the more confluent areas particularly in the lingula in left lower lobe raise the concern for possible pneumonia as well.
13 mm nodule in the left upper lobe with SUV of 5.5 representing known lung cancer, with multiple mediastinal nodes with FDG avidity as described above.
A focal uptake in the left nasopharynx with SUV of 11.2 of unknown significance, for which clinical correlation and possible direct visualization is recommended.
A focal area of FDG uptake with the SUV of 5.4 in the vertebral body of T8 without CT correlate, suspicious for metastasis.
Bilateral peripheral parenchymal opacities with cystic changes and bronchiolectasis with the SUV ranging from 3.7-5.5, likely due to interstitial lung disease such as drug related lung disease with inflammatory activity.
Superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded and clinical correlation is recommended.
Uptake in the left proximal femur is noted with the SUV of 2.8, representing known metastasis, proven on biopsy.
Cytology lefet femur [**2125-3-8**] - POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS (consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma).
Pathology L fever - [**3-8**] - Metastatic, poorly-differentiated carcinoma with focal necrosis (This immunophenotype is compatible with a lung origin and raises the possibility of a poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.)
TTE [**2125-4-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild biventricular cavity dilation with grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14887**] was a 70-year-old man with likely non-small-cell lung cancer with metastasis in left femur, status cycle 2 of carboplatin and paclitaxel on [**2125-4-12**], who was admitted after fainting in his oncologist's office with hypotension.
# Pneumonia with septic shock: The patient had SBP in the 70s on admission and was admitted to the ICU.
Chest imaging studies revealed bilateral honeycombing pattern, concerning for pneumonia in the setting of emphysematous lungs versus pulmonary fibrosis.
There was a concern for a chronic underlying lung disease such as IPF, but the diagnosis would not change management at this point.
He was originally on 4L NC but was weaned down to 1L NC without any respiratory difficulty.
Cytology from femur showed adenocarcinoma, but path raised concern for poorly differentiated squamous verus large cell neuroendocrine tumor.
# Diastolic heart failure: EF > 55% on echo on [**2125-4-27**].
He displayed no sign of failure and his furosemide was held.
# Syncope at oncologist's office: likely due to hypotension from sepsis.
Might also be due to atrial fibrillation with SVT.
Sinus rhythm here.
# Anemia and leukopenia: likely from recent chemotherapy.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
