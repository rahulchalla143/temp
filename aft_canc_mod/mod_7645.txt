Perforation of the lower thoracic esophagus with evidence of active oral contrast extravasation in to a large multiloculated fluid- and air-containing collection extending from the posterior mediastinum into the majority of the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe of the lung.
Ground-glass and more confluent opacities throughout the right lower lobe, consistent with an infectious process.
Necrotic right paratracheal lymph node, measuring up to 13 mm in short axis.
The stomach is grossly unremarkable aside from a 3.8 cm segment of concentric wall thickening at the level of the pylorus (3:63), which could still represent hypertrophic muscle.
Cystic 1.6 cm partially enhancing lesion superior to the pancreatic tail is concerning for a necrotic lymph node .
Moderate quantity of simple free fluid in the pelvis is a nonspecific but abnormal finding, possibly related to the esophageal perforation.
Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery with ectasia of the ascending thoracic aorta, as described above.
Moderate right and small left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
Simple left renal cyst with additional tiny bilateral renal hypodensities that are too small to characterize but also statistically represent simple cysts.
No pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
A necrotic right paratracheal node could relate to known squamous cell esophageal cancer.
Dilation with debris within the upper thoracic esophagus.
Please see the accompanying CT torso from [**2169-1-7**] for a full description regarding lower thoracic esophageal perforation into the right lower lobe of the lung.
Moderate non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion.
Ectasia of the ascending thoracic aorta.
Periapical lucencies scattered throughout the maxillary dentition could represent odontogenic disease.
CXR [**2169-1-9**]: FINDINGS: Homogeneous opacity extends from the minor fissure to a partially obscured right hemidiaphragm, with associated signs of volume loss.
Observed findings likely represent collapse of the right middle lobe and partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe, the latter coexisting with known complex fluid collection and consolidation based on review of recent CT.
Moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size in the interval.
New bilateral asymmetrical perihilar opacities worse on the left than the right could reflect pulmonary edema or new sites of aspiration or infection.
Dense left retrocardiac opacity and a small left pleural effusion are also new.
EGD with Stent [**2169-1-9**]: There was an extensive ulcerated mass from 29 cm to 41 cm from the incisors.
Since the prior radiograph, there is overall minimal change in the right lower lobe consolidation, right pleural effusion.
Since [**2169-1-7**], there is interval progression of left mid and lower lung consolidation.
Mild pulmonary edema is also present contributing to the parenchymal opacification.
Esophagram [**2169-1-10**]: CONCLUSION: Esophageal stent in place and there was no evidence for contrast extravasation or fistula to the bronchial tree.
LLE DUPLEX U/S [**2169-1-12**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis .
PET CT [**2169-1-13**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Extensive FDG-avid disease in the chest.
Because of the known esophageal perforation, the FDG uptake in the right lung may be secondary to infection/inflammation OR tumor involvement.
2) FDG-avid sub-carinal mass extending distally along the esophagus as described above, consistent with neoplastic disease.
4) Focus of FDG uptake at the GE junction, distal to the esophageal stent which is non-specific and may be related to local inflammatory disease, but can not rule out a rest of neoplastic disease.
5) No evidence of abnormal FDG uptake between the stomach and pancreatic tail at the site of the questioned node on the recent CT. 6) No evidence of distant metastatic disease.
7) Bilateral pleural effusions and extensive focal FDG-avid ground glass opacities, throughout the lungs, new since the recent CT and therefore likely secondary to infection/inflammation.
8) Elevated serum glucose, decreasing the sensitivity of this study for small foci of neoplastic disease.
LEFT KNEE PLAIN FILM [**2169-1-16**]: IMPRESSION: No fracture or significant degenerative changes.
No evidence of right-sided heart strain at this time.
Large abscess formation at right lung base related to esophageal rupture seen on [**2169-1-7**] exam, has substantially improved.
There is residual right lung base consolidation at the site of prior abscess formation.
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has resolved.
Interval placement of an esophageal stent with large amount of secretions within its lumen.
Large soft tissue mass surrounding the stent, likely correspond to patient's known history of esophageal carcinoma.
Ill-defined bilateral ground-glass opacities predominantly in upper lung zones, are most likely related to recurrent aspirations given large amount of secretions within the esophagus.
R knee xray [**2-2**]: Mild tricompartmental degenerative changes with a joint effusion.

# Esophageal fistula: On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was comfortable without complaints.
CT torso, CT neck showed esophageal perforation, active contrast extravasation into parenchyma of RLL lung, which has multiple loculated fluid collections including one 11x7x10cm, bilateral simple pleural effusions, simple fluid in the pelvis, also 2x1x1 cm cystic mass on pancreas.
Patient made NPO and transferred to MICU [**Location (un) **]/[**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for a rigid and flexible bronchoscopy by IP with therapeutic aspiration of tracheobronchial secretions and diagnostic upper GI endoscopy without identification of fistula.
While in MICU [**Location (un) 2452**], microbiology notified team that abscess was growing thin branching gram + rods concerning for norcardia.
ID was consulted who recommended continuing unasyn and adding high-dose bactrim for nocardia coverage.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ERCP team performed an EGD which showed an extensive ulcerated mass from 29 cm to 41 cm and narrowed lumen.
On Day 10 of Unasyn the patient developed a diffuse morbilliform rash covering the torso and back, non-pruritic, non-painful and most c/w with a drug reaction.
# Hypotension: Thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO intake although sepsis also possibility given given esophageal fistula and lung abscess.
Blood pressure was fluid responsive in the ICU and required no pressors.
However, given CT chest findings with concern for necrotic abscess and esophageal perforation, his abx were broadended initially to Zosyn/Levofloxacin, then to unasyn/bactrim.
# Necrotic right lung abscess: CT torso showed a large necrotic mass with extravasation of oral contrast, suggestive of esophageal perforation.
He was transferred across campus for rigid bronch where the abscess was sampled and grew thin branching GPR's, suspicious for nocardia.
Culture from abscess revealing thin branching G+ rods and G+ cocci in pairs and chains, no nocardia.
After ERCP, patient was still intubated so prior to extubation, patient underwent repeat bronch with mucous pluggings removed.
On day 10 of unasyn, patient developed diffuse morbilliform rash on torso and back, c/w with drug reaction.
# Acute renal failure: Cr up to 1.4 on admission.
# Anemia: Normocytic, likely secondary to chronic disease/malignancy.
He had an initial Hct drop, though thought in part to be dilutional given volume rescuscitation.
He had no s/s bleeding.
# Esophageal cancer: Squamous cell carcinoma on pathology from [**2168-12-31**] EGD by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is likely cause of patient's low grade fevers, dysphagea and possibly his current nausea/vomiting.
He underwent CT neck/chest that showed esophageal-pulmonary fistula (see above), which has been stented.
Patient then underwent a PET CT for staging which did not show any diffuse metastatic disease.
# L Knee Pain: Patient complains of left knee pain for the past several months.
On exam patient has small effusion, no erythema.
Patient does have history of gout, but exam and history is inconsistent with this.
Unasysn can cause increased uric acid levels, but again, patient has had this problem for several months.
- XRAY [**1-16**] no acute fracture - defer on arthrocentesis given no obvious collection to tap, will clinically monitor - tylenol and oxycodone PRN for pain - uric acid wnl .
# L Calf Pain: Patient working with PT today had pain in the L calf and difficulty ambulating - LENI Negative, will continue to monitor .
- Monitor LFT's  To recap, The patient was transferred to the MICU for rigid bronch on [**1-8**] for evaluation of a lung abscess and was started on IV clindamycin, and back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for esophageal stent [**1-9**] for an esophageal fistula, and then transferred to the OMED service for further oncologic workup and therapy.
On [**2-1**], the patient noted moderate to severe R knee pain.
There was swelling superior and lateral to his R patella and he was very tender to palpation in this area.
Rheumatology was alright with stopping the vancomycin since no organisms grew from the joint fluid, and it was likely only a gout flare.
The patient had issues with hyponatremia during his stay.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 10. colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for gout flare: Please use only for gout flare, and continue only until pain resolves.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* -> this medication was not approved for coverage and the patient was unable to fill prescription 11. indomethacin 75 mg Capsule, Extended Release Sig: One (1) Capsule, Extended Release PO twice a day as needed for gout flare: Please use only for gout flare, and continue only until pain resolves.
You were admitted due to nausea/vomiting and problems eating and drinking.
You had a CT scan which showed a mass in your esophagus.
A biopsy was taken of the mass and consistent with a cancer.
You also had large lung infection in your right lung, and we started you on antibiotics for this.
In addition, we checked your blood for signs of tuburcolosis and this was positive for an inactive infection.
You also had a gout flare during your stay and received colchicine and indomethacin as treatment.
You also had low sodium levels during your stay.
MEDICATION CHANGES: START Guaifensein take 5-10ml by mouth every 6 hours as needed for cough START Isoniazid 300mg table take one by mouth daily START Pantoprazole 40mg take one tablet by mouth twice daily START Aceteminophen syrup take 20ml by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain START oxycodone 5mg as needed for pain START Clindamycin take 900mg PO every 8 hours - this is ongoing until told to stop by an Infectious Disease doctor (see appointment below) START Zofran 8mg tablet take one tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea Start Coumadin 2.5mg daily Start Endomethacin 75mg twice a day for gout flare Start Colchicine 0.6mg daily for gout flare  You have several followup appointments as shown below.
