He was tachycardic and hypotensive on admission, central venous access was maintained, and he was kept NPO and hydrated aggressively.
Review of imaging from the outside hospital disclosed thrombosis of the splenic and portal veins and he was started on a heparin drip with goal 40-60 (he had a significant percentage of non-enhancing pancreas on CT, presumed to be necrotic, and so heparin was not bolused and the rate was up titrated slowly to prevent hemorrhagic conversion).
On HD#5, despite never having a therapeutic PTT (it was 28 that morning), the patient became acutely hypotensive, diaphoretic, tachycardic, with a witnessed desaturation to 87% on room air.
EKG was sinus tachycardia without ST/T changes.
He was emergently transferred to the ICU, intubated, and repeat labs showed a significantly lower hematocrit.
Scan of the abdomen showed active extravasation from a splenic injury.
There was no history of trauma.
The following day (POD#1, HD#4) he spiked a fever and blood cultures grew coag neg staph.
His CVC was removed and replaced via fresh puncture and was started on vancomycin and meropenem empirically to cover staph as well as empiric coverage for necrotizing pancreatitis.
On [**2130-3-31**] (HD # 15), the patient back in OR, [**State 19827**] patch tightened as part of staged abdominal closure.
On the floor, the patient was continued on PCA for pain control, Heparin gtt and tube feed via Dobbhoff.
On [**2130-4-4**] (HD # 19), the patient underwent bedside [**State 19827**] patch tightened as part of staged abdominal closure, negative pressure dressing was continued as well.
On [**2130-4-10**] (HD # 25), the patient underwent Reopening of recent laparotomy via removal of [**State 19827**] patch and primary closure of abdomen, also repositioning of drain into pancreatic fistula collection, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Post operatively, all antibiotics were discontinued, Dobbhoff was removed, diet was advanced to clears, and patient had Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.

Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Signs of a life-threatening reaction.
These include wheezing; chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you hit your head.
Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically, severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black, tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds, coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding, severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.
Also call if you have stomach problems, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day.
However, recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your dietary vitamin K intake.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems.
If it is too low, you might be at risk for forming clots.
It is very important to talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics, vitamins, or herbal products.
