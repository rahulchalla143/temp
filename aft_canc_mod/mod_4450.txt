Admission Date:  [**2117-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-5-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / gemfibrozil / ibuprofen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, stable [**First Name3 (LF) 8813**] dissection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 64M with a history of active prostate cancer s/p completion of radiation tx yesterday,  who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with dyspnea on exertion.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] documentation, he was walking upstairs to do laundry, and when he came back down he had persistent shortness of breath.
According to his wife, he was told that his grandson (to whom he is very attached) was in a MVA, and after that he became very anxious and SOB.
He underwent chest x-ray that showed enlarged aorta, and subsequent CT (noncontrast given renal failure) that showed dissection extending from arch to beyond the level of the renal arteries.
He was started on BIPAP for his SOB and an esmolol gtt to control blood pressures.
He received levofloxacin for possible pneumonia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of the dissection.
While in the ED, he developed a temperature to 102.4 rectal.
He was sedated with propofol but BP dropped so changed to fentanyl/versed.
Has drool coming from mouth, so suctioned which causes patient to wince/appear uncomfortable.
Most recent assessment [**3-/2116**] in Atrius records: Type B [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection with proximal descending thoracic aorta measuring five centimeters and dimension.
The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery arise from the true lumen while the left renal artery arises from the false lumen.

Allowing for differences in technique, this has not significantly changed since the earlier study of [**2115-7-18**].
New since the prior study are small simple bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
Moderate centrilobular emphysema, apical predominant.
3.8 cm left renal cyst is not characterized in this study, a non-emergent renal ultrasound can be performed for further assessment if not already obtained.
Normal bilateral main renal artery waveforms and resistive indices.
Left main renal artery cannot followed back to the aorta due to technical reasons.
Redemonstration of type B [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection with slight interval increase in size of the aorta.
Moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis bilaterally.
IV) Studies: Renal Ultrasound: FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10.7, the left kidney measures 11.9 cm without evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
There is a 1 cm left upper pole kidney cyst and a 5-mm right lower pole hyperechoic lesion, likely representing AML (angiomyolipoma).
The left renal artery cannot be followed to the aorta due to technical reasons.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
No dissection flap is seen (best assessed by thoracic/chest MRI/CT or TEE).
The [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoraic aorta.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old man with a past medical history signficant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, prostate cancer s/p XRT, and type [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8813**] dissection (dxed [**2114**]) transferred from outside hospital for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Hospital course notable for finding of stable type B [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure due to malignant uncontrolled hypertension, and acute on chronic renal failure.
#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/Malignant Hypertension: Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with shortness of breath and hypoxia requiring high flow oxygen.
He had a chest CT which showed type B [**Hospital3 8813**] dissection (old, but not clear at OSH).
Upon transfer patient required escalating oxygen support and was intubated for both hypoxia and to facilitate workup of dissection.
Patient was euvolemic on discharge and it was felt that initial hypoxia was due to malignant hypertension.
A TTE prior to discharge showed a preserved EF with mild symmetric LVH.
Patient was euvolemic breathing on RA prior to discharge.
On follow up could consider uptitratring clonidine or hydral or starting diltiazem for better BP control if needed.
His elevated creatinine was felt to be related to malignant hypertension and improved with treatment of blood pressure and CHF.
Renal doppler ultrasound did not show renal artery stenosis, however, it is possible that his [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection partly into the renal artery may be creating RAS physiology.
#Presumed UTI/PNA: While on the floor the patient lacked any signs or symptoms of a UTI or pneumonia.
Medication Changes: -Increased labetalol to 800mg TID -Increased Amlodipine to 10mg QD -Started Lasix 20mg PO QD -Held allopurinol in the setting of his acute renal failure.
There has been no progression in his [**Hospital1 8813**] dissection when compared to films from the last year.
Since the patient was started on lasix during this hospitalization, we recommend drawing a chem 10 in one week to check for electrolyte abnormalities and renal function.
- Oxycodone 15 mg PO Q6H PRN pain - Clonidine 0.3 mg PO TID - Amlodipine 5 mg PO daily - Labetalol 300 mg PO TID - Zoladex administered monthly in urology - Fluoxetine 40 mg PO daily - Allopurinol 300 mg PO daily - Nifedepine ER 30 mg PO daily - Colchicine 0.3 mg PO daily for gout pain - Hydralazine 75 mg PO TID   Discharge Medications: 1. labetalol 200 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day).
Hypertension 3.
Compensated acute heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 55%.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**],  You were admitted to the hospital with acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.
We believe that this is due to something called congestive heart failure.
Your congestive heart failure which has now resolved was most likely caused by your high blood pressure and excess fluid and salt retention.
