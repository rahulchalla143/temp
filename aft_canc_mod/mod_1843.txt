Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP IR guided biliary drain  History of Present Illness: This is an 88 yo man transferred from OSH [**11-4**] for ERCP for biliary obstruction with obstructive hepatopathy.
presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**11-3**] with increasing shortness of breath, dizziness, and jaundice.
He underwent an abdomen CT which showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic obstruction likely secondary to metastatic cancer to the pancreatic head.
While being prepped for ERCP (while under MAC) and turned prone he regurgitated coffee-brown material so he was electively intubated due to concern for his risk of aspiration.
A dudodenal stent was placed due to external compression of the duodenum.
He was started on neo through a PIV for pressure support.
It was thought that his inability to extubate post-procedure and hypotension were due to sedation rather than aspiration given his rapid improvement.
Colon cancer with mets s/p colectomy complicated with small and large bowel obstruction with a colostomy.
Prostate enlargement s/p TURP, ?
Hypertension 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Urine Cx [**11-4**]: no growth.
A band of atelectasis is present at the base of the right lung which is otherwise clear.
Heart is mildly enlarged.
No pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are likely present.
An apparent bulge in the right mediastinal contour could be a skin fold instead.
ERCP [**11-4**]: A large amount of gastric fluid was found when the endoscope was passed into the stomach, suggestive of outflow tract obstruction.
Unable to pass the scope to the second part of the duodenum due to obstruction, most likely extrinsic compression from colon cancer metastases.
Fluoro [**11-6**]: IMPRESSION: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating moderate intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with obstruction of the common bile duct at the level of the ampulla.
Successful placement of a right transhepatic internal-external biliary draining catheter with the catheter connected to a bag for external drainage   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 88 yo male with pmh of metastatic colon cancer and hypertension who is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hypotension and need for continued intubation s/p ERCP attempt for biliary obstruction.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive after intubation on propofol.
Likely secondary to propofol, however also in the differential is hypotension from sepsis.
He has two potential sources for sepsis: biliary obstruction and recent apsiration.
Also could have volume depletion.
# Biliary obstruction/obstructive jaundice: The patient underwent a CT at the OSH which showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation likely due to a metastasis to the pancreatic head from his colon cancer.
He failed ERCP due to external compression of the duodenum limiting their ability to pass the scope.
A duodenal stent was placed by the ERCP team to help to decompress the gastric outlet obstruction.
# Anemia, chronic disease: The patient was noted to have coffe-ground regurgitation during the ERCP procdure.
Haptoglobin high makes hemolysis unlikely.
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possibly due to oncologic treatment.
Started an IV PPI due to concern for coffee ground regurgitant.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Patient has multiple mets seen on OSH imaging.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of Upper [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metatstatic colon cancer Gastric outlet obstruction s/p duodenal stent placement Biliary obstruction s/p IR placed drain Prostate enlargement s/p TURP Hypertension, benign Hypercholesterolemia gastroesophageal reflux   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital becuase you had an obstruction in the small bowel and also in your biliary tract.
Return to the hospital if you experience fevers/chills, abdominal pain, recurring jaundice, or any other concerning symptoms.
