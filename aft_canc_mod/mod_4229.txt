no hearing aides.
She does her own shopping with her dtr or she takes the ride.
Family History: Mother died of kidney failure at age 35.
Nourishment: At risk Grooming: good Mentation: alert, funny and witty Eyes:NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted Ears/Nose/Mouth/Throat: MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, murmur radiates to neck but no clear bruit Respiratory: Decreased BS at the bases Cardiovascular: tachy, irregularly irregular nl.
S1S2, holosystolic murmur with radation to the neck Gastrointestinal: soft, NT/ND, hyperactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Lymphatics/Heme/Immun: No cervical lymphadenopathy noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Severely depressed LVEF.
Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV pressure/volume overload.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Given severity of TR, PASP may be underestimated due to elevated RA pressure.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with severe LV systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior wall, septum and inferolateral wall suggesting either multi-vessel CAD or infiltrative process.
Calcified aortic valve with probable moderate to severe stenosis (low-output/low-gradient AS).
Mild aortic and at least mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Hypertrophied, dilated and depressed right ventricle with evidence of pressure-volume overload and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU summary: Pt is a 83 yo F w/ long h/o afib w/ rvr, large B cell lymphoma, raynaud's, CAD and AS p/w UTI, afib w/ RVR and C. difficile colitis.
Pt presented to ED w/ complaints of progressive abd pain accompanied by loose, non-bloody diarrhea though PCP noticed guaiac positive stools.
Pt was at the hospital about a month ago with similar symptoms (diarrhea, afib w/ RVR, and UTI), but C. difficile studies were negative at that time.
She c/o crampy abd pain that is temporarily relieved once she has a BM.
Patient was found to have a UTI and put on cipro IV.
Pt was also given flagyl and vanc for presumptive C. difficile colitis while studies were pending.
Studies came back positive for C. difficile upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Pt also with longstanding hx of afib and is supratherapeutic on coumadin with INR 6.7.
Currently in afib with RVR but is asymptomatic.
For her Afib with RVR, her home dose of digoxin was continued.
For her acute renal failure, the diagnosis was thought most likely due to low perfusion related to her Afib with RVR.
She had a renal ultrasound that showed no hydronephrosis.
For her C Diff infection, diagnosis was made by positive stool toxins.
Her diarrhea was resolving while in the ICU.
For her history of coronary artery disease, the patient remained asymptomatic and her home aspirin was continued.
Urine culture revealed no bacteria, so ciprofloxacin discontinued.
became asymptomatically bradycardic while sleeping (BP stable), so BB was down titrated to home dose.
Creatinine normalized with IV hydration until diarrhea was resolved, then gentle home dose diuresis was resumed for chronic heart failure and LE edema.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: C Difficile Colitis Volume depletion (intravascular) due to diarrhea from above Atrial Fibrillation with RVR controlled with digitalization and Beta Blockade Chronic, systolic, heart failure with LE edema Generalized deconditioning with difficulty in ambulation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
