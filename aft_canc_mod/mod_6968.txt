CXR [**2184-1-7**] Recently described bilateral perihilar opacities have rapidly resolved and were likely due to pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for portable technique.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53-year-old gentleman with recurrent mantle cell lymphoma on chemotherapy admitted with hypothermia after suicide attempt.
They saw no evidence of compartment syndrome or infection.
Hand surgery team recommended daily dressing changes and elevation whenever possible.
Patient's need for surgical debridement or amputation will be determined at a future date by the Hand surgery team.
Patient's pain was initially managed with low doses of IV dilaudid prn and standing acetaminophen.
Would recommend continuing acetaminophen scheduled and using oxycodone prn for pain control.
Then keep bilateral hands elevated on two pillows above the level of his heart.
If evidence of infection arises please contact [**Hospital1 18**] hand surgery [**Name (NI) 2678**].
# RECURRENT MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA:  Receiving chemotherapy as an outpatient prior to admission.
However, due to his psychiatric condition, the decision has been made to postpone his chemotherapy until his depression is being appropriately managed.
Because significant delays in his chemotherapy may effect his prognosis, we strongly recommend evaluation by an Oncology team to confirm patient's willingness to pursue chemotherapy once his depression is being managed, and to provide necessary chemotherapy in a timely manor.
# HYPOTHERMIA:  Resolved with rewarming in the ICU, now normothermic, with improvement in EKG and platelets.
Patient likely has significant cold induced diuresis given significant urine output.
He will likely require increased oral fluid intake while kidneys regain ability to concentrate urine.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  In setting of hypothermia and altered mental status.
# SUICIDE ATTEMPT:  Patient has a history of depression and bipolar disorder.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] admits that recent event was a suicide attempt.
# RHABDOMYOLYSIS:  Likely from hypothermia and immobility as he was "found down" on ground.
There was never any evidence of renal failure.
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Unclear etiology however, as per previous clinic notes, patient has been persistently tachycardic in the past.
His tachycardia persisted once out of the ICU and ECG showed sinus tachycardia.
He had no other concerning sypmtoms for PE, specifically persistent hypoxia or chest pain.
Heart rate ranged from 100 to 130 and responded minimally to pain medications.
Heart rate also responded to increased fluid intake.
# Anemia and thrombocytopenia:  Patient's initial lab abnormalities may be attributed to his lymphoma and recent chemotherapy as well as his response to hypothermia.
# Constipation: Patient's sedentary behavior and inability to help himself use the bathroom has likely contributed to his constipation.
Then keep bilateral hands elevated on two pillows above the level of his heart.
If evidence of infection arises please contact [**Hospital1 18**] hand surgery [**Name (NI) 2678**].
