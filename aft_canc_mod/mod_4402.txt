Admission Date:  [**2199-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-10-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-8-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: confusion per family  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**10-14**] Left craniotomy for tumor resection [**10-15**] Left stereotactic cyst aspiration [**10-15**] Left re-do craniotomy for resection of mass [**10-15**]: external ventricular drain placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 57 year old Cantonese speaking man.
Per his niece and sister, he had a behavior change starting [**10-12**].
By report, CT showed a large left temporal hemorrhagic mass with midline shift and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
Social History: 4 cig/day, no ETOH  Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: O: T98.5 P 60 BP 108/61 R 16 O2 on oxygen100 Gen: WD/WN, lethargic, difficult to exam due to cooperation and confusion, family assisting with language.
MAE symmetrical, difficult to assess due to apraxia.
Left frontal large heterogenous lesion with calcification and with hematocrit levels(suggesting subacute to chronic hemorrhage), consistent with left frontal mass with hemorrhage.
9mm rightward midline shift with subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
Compression of the left lateral ventricle and third ventricle with enlargement of the right lateral ventricle, consistent with obstructive hydrocephalus.
Mild prominence of the fourth ventricle  MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST [**2199-10-14**] Known Left large frontal lobe mass with internal hemorrhage as detailed on concurrent CT with patient status post resection at time of this review.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2199-10-15**] The patient is status post frontoparietal craniotomy with subtotal resection of a large hemorrhagic left frontal mass.
There is a large residual cystic component containing layering hemorrhage.
There is unchanged asymmetric enlargement of the right lateral ventricle and the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] compatible with obstructive hydrocephalus.
In addition, there is unchanged 10mm rightward subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
Inaddition there is a apparent remnant 2.9 x 3.9 x 5.4 (TRV x SI x AP) solid component in the anterolateral aspect of the cystic region, suspicious for residual tumor.
Surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality extending through the cortex of the inferior anterior aspect of the left frontal lobe is consistent with tumor infiltration.
The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with subtotal resection of large hemorrhagic left frontal lesion.
There is a large residual cystic component containing layering hemorrhage resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus that is intervally worsened and stable rightward subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
As previously noted, there is an apparent remnant solid component in the anterolateral component of the cystic lesion containing calcification.
CT HEAD POST ASPIRATION [**2199-10-15**] Status post frontal craniotomy with subtotal resection of hemorrhagic frontal mass and subsequent stereotactic-guided cyst aspiration.
There still remains a large residual hemorrhagic cystic component with associated obstructive hydrocephalus, enlargement of the right lateral ventricle occipital and temporal horns, rightward subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.
Status post left frontal craniotomy with subtotal resection, hemorrhagic frontal mass and subsequent aspiration of hemorrhage in situ, now with drain in place; interval improvement of hemorrhagic collection with increased left frontal region pneumocephalus.
Unchanged sulcal effacement, rightward subfalcine shift, and intraventricular hemorrhage.
However, hydrocephalus has improved since the previous head CT. Left uncal herniation persists.
Expected postoperative changes with resolving pneumocephalus and layering blood products over the left frontal lobe and within the resection cavity.
Area of focal hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe adjacent to the drain with no corresponding defect seen on the ADC map to suggest acute infarct.
Persistent post-surgical appearance of craniotomy, repeated mass resection and cyst aspiration with decreased pneumocephalus, but stable heterogeneous appearance of edema and blood product at the surgical site in the left frontal lobe with persistent 11 mm rightward shift of midline structures and uncal herniation.
There is a heterogeneous fluid surrounding the mid portion of the drainage catheter; however, distal tip does not seem to have significant fluid around it.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 y/o Male who was brought by his family to OSH for confusion and lethargy.
Head CT was done which showed a large L frontal hemorrhagic mass with midline shift.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], patient was very lethargic and declined very quickly, he was taken emergently to the OR for L craniotomy for mass resection.
Head CT showed residual hemorrhage and tumor with effacement of L ventricle.
MRI was ordered and showed residual tumor, midline shift, L uncal herniation, and entrapment of the R temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Post Op MRI showed improved hydrocephalus, resolving Pneumocephalus and question of left frontal hyperintensity.
He had a head CT which showed essentially no change from the previous day with the exception of a slight interval decrease in the size of the R lateral ventricle.
The post EVD pull CT demonstrated decrease in pneumocephalus with no new hemorrhage or midline.
Overnight patient had episodes of agitation and restlessness.
On [**10-22**], Seroquel was added to help decrease episodes of agitation and remove restraints.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
White Petrolatum-Mineral Oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] hospital - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: L frontal mass/hemorrhage Hydrocephalus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
