On [**2183-11-16**] she developed hemoptysis which prompted her to present to [**Hospital 76515**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**].
A mass was seen in her left upper lobe on chest x-ray.
She underwent bronchoscopy on [**2183-11-19**] with pathology consistent with nonsmall cell lung cancer, most likely adenocarcinoma.
A PET-CT on [**2183-11-29**], reportedly showed uptake in the left lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and left adrenal gland.

No ecchymoses.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Hyponehancement of left lingula and left lower lobe conistent with Pnuemonia is noted.
There is a large plueral effusion filling the whole of the left hemithorax with complete collapse of the left lung.
The large necrotic tumor in the left lower lung has increased in size since the last examination .
Multiple bilateral new axillary lymph nodes are seen with the biggest measuring 13 x 4 in the right axillary region (series 3, image 15).
A new prevascular lymph node is seen abutting between the left subclavian vein and left subclavian artery measuring 25 x 20 mm (series 3, image 14), which was not seen in the previous examinations.
The local tumor infiltration involving the mid portion of the left rib has increased in size with greater associated rib destruction (series 3, image 22).
In addition, the left plueral tumor deep in the posterior sulcus along the spine has also increased in size.
In the right lung, innumerable new pulmonary metastases along with interval increase in previous lesions, measuring up to 13 mm and are more extensive in the right middle lobe.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: New hypodense lesions are noted in the liver, most likely metastases.
The intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is unchanged.
Bilateral adrenal masses seen on the previous examination have increased in size.
Enhancing foci in the left psoas and right paraspinal seen on [**2176-6-15**] have also increased in size.
A new metastatic focus is seen in the posterior subcutaneous tissue at the level of L3.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Heterogeneously enhancing foci in the right iliacus, right gluteus, and the left quadriceps are persistent and have increased in size.
Increase in interval pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen with the biggest lymph node measuring 19 x 24 along the left pelvic wall, series 3, image 104. .
BONE WINDOWS: Interval increase in the destructive left fourth rib lesion is noted.In addition, new metastatic bony lesions are seen in vertebrae T4- T5.
Post-obstructive multilobar left lung pneumonia.
Marked progression of metastatic disease with increase in size of previous metastes, and development of innumerable multiple new metastases, more prominently in the right lung.
Increase in left pleural effusion filling the whole of left hemithorax causing collapse of the left lung.
Worsening confluent opacity in the right mid-lung zone is concerning for superimposed pneumonia.
Probable increasing left pleural effusion and unchanged collapse of the left lung.
Rapidly progressive airspace process in the right mid-lung and base, which, in clinical context, may represent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema related to the apparent clinical transfusion reaction.
Progressive pneumonic consolidation (including endobronchial spread of infection) and alveolar hemorrhage are additional concerns.
Progression of known pulmonary metastases is most unlikely given the rapidity of change.
TRANSFUSION REACTION WORKUP DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 76514**] experienced a 3 degree F temperature increase, chills, a significant drop in her O2 saturation from 90-94% to 81%, and wheezing following transfusion of 40 cc's of ABO/Rh compatible leukoreduced, irradiated RBC's.
Post-transfusion CXR showed possible non-cardiogenic edema in right lung (left lung collapse  unchanged).
There was no evidence of hemolysis in the post-transfusion sample (DAT negative, clear yellow serum).
Possible explanations for this constellation of symptoms include TRALI (Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury), fluid-overload (TACO), allergy, or symptoms due to her underlying medical condition (pneumonia, pleural effusion, metastasis).
The presence of fever, minimal response to diuresis, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema on CXR are suspicious for TRALI.
Blood samples will be sent to the Red Cross for work-up of this possible TRALI reaction and reported in an addendum.
TRALI reactions are thought to be related to the donor product and would require no change in transfusion practice for this patient.
Transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) is less likely given the small volume of RBCs transfused (40cc), and lack of significant response to Lasix per the clinical team.
An allergic transfusion reaction is also less likely in this patient given the absence of additional typical allergic  symptoms.
Ms. [**Known lastname 76520**] symptoms could also be due to her underlying pulmonary infections, lung collapse, and cancer.
No changes in transfusion practices are recommended at this time in this patient.
She had been treated for post obstructive pneumonia with 2 courses of antibiotics as an outpatient with no relief of her fevers.
She continued to have fever to 102.
After admission, a CT scan was preformed which showed worsening left sided pleural effusion.
She underwent thoracentesis, without positive cultures, and was cultured many times for recurrent/daily fevers.
It was thought that her fevers were likely related to her tumor/possible necrotic tissue in the lung.
On [**2184-8-5**], Ms. [**Known lastname 76514**] was receiving a blood transfusion for anemia, and had an acute hypoxic reaction with heart rates to the 150s.
She complained of chest pressure and an subsequent ECG was noted to show ST elevations in V1 and V2.
The patient's pain was controlled on oxycodone.
The did not have any more chest pain following this episode.
This was thought to be realted to her tumor or secondary to lung infection.
Given persistence of symptoms despite several courses of antibiotics, it was less likely that this represents an infectious source.
Glyburide 2.5mg daily   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Old [**Hospital **] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Fever Post-obstructive PNA Transfusion reaction NSCLC   Discharge Condition: Comfortable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fever which was atributed to a multifactorial process including a pneumonia and tumor related changes in your lungs.
Also, during your stay you were noted to have a worsening anemia which necessitated transfusion of blood cells.
During this process, you had a rare reaction that resulted in problems with your blood oxygenation.
