Admission Date:  [**2171-2-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-10-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**] Chief Complaint: mediastinal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 42 y.o male with no PMH who was originally transferred from [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital for eval and tx of a new mediastinal mass and PE.
Pt reports was in USOH until ~4wks ago when he developed a fever, non-productive cough, scratchy throat and severe SOB (+orthopnea and DOE), facial+neck swelling, cyanotic ears/lips, decreased appetite (wt loss 10-12lbs).
He also reports sharp R.sided lateral chest/rib pain, with occasional radiation down his R.arm and a dull discomfort in his RUQ.
He also reports a white spot in his R.eye vision, that has since resolved.
He then presented to [**Location (un) **] Urgent Care [**2171-2-14**] where a large lung mass was found on CXR.
There, CT chest showed a large [**Location (un) 21851**] invading the R.mediastinum causing severe compression, but no occlusion of the SVC.
CT guided bx showed malignant cells c/w poorly differentiated carcinoma (ddx carcinomatosis of immature teratoma within mixed cell germ tumor or poorly differentiated carcinoma with non-small cell morphology.
Onc felt comfortable starting chemo if no liver lesions.
Currently, pt reports SOB, facial swelling, and R.arm swelling, but pain is controlled.
He worked for [**Doctor Last Name 634**] Electronics at a desk job, with no particular toxic exposures.
97.6, BP 129/77, HR 107, RR 24 sat 96% on 2L, 1607I/ 1600 O GENERAL: well appearing, anxious, NAD, able to speak in full sentences HEENT: nc/at, PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, no OP lesions neck:+facial plethora, neck swelling, supple CARDIAC: s1s2 rrr no m/r/g LUNG: b/l ae, no w/c/, decreased BS r.base ABDOMEN:+bs, soft, +slight TTP Ruq, no guarding/rebound.
LE without edema, no c/c.
large [**Location (un) 21851**] of the RUL invading the right aspect of the mediastinum and causing severe compression but not occlusion of the superior vena cava.
Multiple nonspecific mediastinal lymph nodes are seen without change, the largest right peritracheal lymph node measuring 9x14, not enlarged by criteria .
Other CT-guided needle biopsy [**2171-2-13**] (by dictation, original report is not available): flow cytometry negative for lymphoma, POSITIVE markers: epithelial, pankeratin, BEREP4; NEGATIVE markers: CK-7, CK-20, TTF-1, b-HCG, yolk-sac cocktail;  impression - differential diagnosis includes carcinomatosis component of the immature teratoma within the mixed germ cell tumor and poorly differentiated carcinoma with a non-small cell morphology.
CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging.
Mediastinum is roughly midline despite a large right pleural effusion accompanied by a sufficient right lung atelectasis to suggest that this is a longstanding finding.
Smaller left pleural effusion has a very irregular contour along the mediastinum posteriorly, which may indicate adenopathy.
Trachea is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the extent of mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would require cross-sectional imaging for assessment.
No pneumothorax.
ECHO [**2171-2-12**] OSH -normal LV size, EF, RV normal, atrial normal, no valvular abn, trace MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], impaired LV relaxation.
No significant pericardial effusion.
pancreas, spleen, kidneys and adrenal glands are normal in appearance with incdiental not of 2.5cm cyst from the lower pole of the R.kidney, no calcified gallstones seen, no enlarged intra-abdominal nodes seen.
Moderately dilated loops of proximal small bowel are seen with an abrupt caliber change inteh LUQ beyond which the small bowel is decompressed.
CXR [**2171-2-16**]: AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging.
Mediastinum is roughly midline despite a large right pleural effusion accompanied by a sufficient right lung atelectasis to suggest that this is a longstanding finding.
Smaller left pleural effusion has a very irregular contour along the mediastinum posteriorly, which may indicate adenopathy.
Trachea is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the extent of mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would require cross-sectional imaging for assessment.
CXR [**2171-2-21**]: There is no significant interval change in the large right pleural effusion, although minimal decrease might be suspected most likely due to postural changes.
The left lung is well aerated except for minimal basilar opacities.
The left midline tip is at the level of the mid portion of left subclavian vein.
Scrotal U/S [**2171-2-18**]: FINDINGS: There are small bilateral hydroceles.
The echotexture of the bilateral testes is extremely heterogeneous with diffuse patchy areas of relative hypo- and hyperechogenicity; however, there is no discrete mass identified within either testicle.
There is a 2.5-mm left epididymal cyst.
Diffusely and markedly heterogeneous testicular echotexture bilaterally without discrete masses identified.
The findings are not suggestive of a germ cell tumor of the testicle.
The differential diagnosis for the findings is broad, however, including infectious or inflammatory process, possible drug effect, or sarcoidosis.
A diffuse infiltrative malignancy, such as lymphoma, cannot be excluded, but if the known mediastinal mass does not represent lymphoma, this seems unlikely.
Small bilateral hydroceles.
CT Head [**2171-2-20**]: FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or large territorial infarcts.
No enhancing intracranial lesions are seen.
The intracranial vessels enhance symmetrically, with no evidence of large vessel cutoff.
Mucosal retention cysts are seen in the right ethmoid, left maxillary, and left sphenoid sinuses.
There are no fractures or suspicious osseous lesions in the skull.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial metastases.
MRI Abdomen/Pelvis: FINDINGS: On localizer images and coronal imaging, the known large right mediastinal mass is partly visualized.
A large right pleural effusion is identified with areas of heterogeneous high signal on T1-weighted images, suggestive of proteinaceous or hemorrhagic components.
There is extensive atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
A subcapsular area of signal loss is identified on out-of-phase imaging in the anterior aspect of segment IVb of the liver compared to the in-phase images, appearing to corresponding to the focal area of low attenuation identified on CT performed at outside hospital [**2171-2-11**].
No other focal parenchymal lesions are seen in the liver.
No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is identified.
No gross abnormality is seen in the pancreas, spleen, kidneys or adrenal glands, but views are suboptimal due to motion artifact.
No free fluid is seen in the upper abdomen.
There is anasarca of the abdominal wall.
No abnormal signal is identified within the visualized bone marrow.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series with kinetic information.
Suboptimal visualization of the liver and other abdominal organs due to patient difficulty suspending respiration.
Area of abnormal hypoattenuation identified on CT likely corresponds to an area of focal fatty infiltration, but precise characterization cannot be made due to motion artifact.
Partial visualization of large right mediastinal mass and large right-sided pleural effusion with probable proteinaceous or hemorrhagic component.
See also corresponding core biopsy  	report S10-4792 for further characterization.
A metastatic lesion should be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 42 y.o male with no PMH who presented with SOB/fever/cough/weight loss/SOB and was found to have SVC syndrome and a mediastinal mass.
#SOB/mediastinal mass-As per oncology note, differential diagnosis includes carcinomatosis pattern of germ cell-teratoma vs. poorly differentiated non-small cell.
Pt tolerated chemotherapy very well without evidence of tumor lysis syndrome.
He had minimal side effects of nausea which was well controlled with Ativan, Zofran and standing Compazine.
Metastatic work-up did not reveal disease in the head or abdomen though there were abnormal CT abdomen findings as attached.
A testicular ultrasound found only heterogenous abnormalities, if anything, most consistent with lymphoma.
For final pathology and cytology, please see results section.
Pt noted to have compressed SVC on imaging, but without complete occlusion.
Neck and upper extremity edema improved over course of admission, as did headaches and vision changes.
Etiology could include malignancy vs. infection vs. medication effect.
Could also be due to R.sided heart failure vs. metastatic process.
CT abdomen revealed focal fatty infiltration near the falciform ligament.
