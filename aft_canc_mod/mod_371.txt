Admission Date:  [**2114-4-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-4-19**]   Service:  [**Company 191**] MEDICI  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 79 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate status post pharmacologic conversion and status post pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome with congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, and poorly controlled hypertension, who presented with shortness of breath.
The patient reports a three to four week history of "a cold" with cough productive of yellow thick sputum, occasionally blood.
No night sweats.
She does admit to shortness of breath, especially with some severe spells over the last week.
She says her diabetes mellitus is borderline diabetes mellitus but not on any medications nor does she check fingersticks at home.
She denied any chest pain but was with tachycardia on arrival at the Emergency Room.
Also, she received 20 of intravenous Lasix, Nitroglycerin, digoxin and then had a CT scan of her chest done to evaluate for shortness of breath.
She was noted to have some lymphadenopathy and diffuse nodules worse on the left than on the right.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post an myocardial infarction.
Hypertension with history of uncontrolled blood pressures in the 200s over 100s.
Atrial fibrillation status post tachy-brady syndrome status post pacemaker.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Recent echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] showed an ejection fraction of 60% with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, prolonged E wave deceleration, impaired relaxation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Includes mother who died of breast cancer and an uncle with cancer.
In general, she is an elderly woman sitting up, tripoding with moderate respiratory distress.
Pulmonary examination with bilateral coarse expiratory wheezes and diffuse crackles throughout, left greater than right.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
On admission EKG she had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diffuse ST depression, and then follow-up EKG had sinus tachycardia at a rate of 112, normal axis, normal intervals.
A CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, extensive hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple foci.
Areas of nodular density consistent with metastatic foci.
Positive post obstructive pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 78 year old woman with history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachy-brady syndrome, status post pacemaker, with congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, who presented with shortness of breath.
SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  The patient was stable oxygen wise and was treated for pneumonia empirically with initially Ceftazidine and then switched over to Levofloxacin to complete a two week course; currently being discharged on day seven of two weeks.
She had evidence of diffuse narrowing of her lower airways without occlusion.
No endobronchial lesions were noted.
No source of hemoptysis, but she had minimal non-purulent secretions.
She did have three sets of samples sent of for pathology and cytology which eventually, on the day prior to discharge, returned as highly suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma.
The patient was advised of these findings and referred to the Thoracic Multi-Disciplinary Oncology Center for further follow-up and further staging.
Otherwise, the patient's shortness of breath was likely exacerbated by a post obstructive pneumonia.
Her shortness of breath improved throughout her stay.
ESCHERICHIEAE COLI BACTEREMIA AND URINARY TRACT INFECTION: The patient had a few blood cultures positive for E. coli at time of admission as were her urine cultures.
It was likely that the patient had a urinary source of her urinary tract infection but her E. coli was pan sensitive and the patient was continued on Levofloxacin for her urinary tract infection and her E. coli bacteremia.
Eventually, her blood cultures remained negative and she will just complete her course for pneumonia on the Levofloxacin, also covering for her bacteremia and urinary tract infection.
She was not on Coumadin secondary to fall risk and a question of compliance, and otherwise remained stable and asymptomatic.
The patient's elevated troponins on admission were likely secondary to the demand ischemia secondary to her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was stable and continued on her metoprolol although her aspirin was held for procedures and can be restarted once her work-up for her lung cancer is completed.
She will continue at home off medications but advised to continue with diabetic diet.
She had fairly good control on this regimen, with occasional episodes of hypertension throughout the course of her stay which resolved quickly.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  Her creatinine was elevated on admission at 1.7 and back down to her baseline of 1.1 and 1.2 at time of discharge.
Likely this was slightly prerenal dehydration on admission.
The patient is ambulated with the assistance of walker without difficulty.
The patient aware of diagnosis although unsure if understands complete complications and associated issues associated with her diagnosis.
Non-small cell carcinoma.
Post obstructive pneumonia.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
Urinary tract infection.
