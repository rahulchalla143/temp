No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes; however, given this, no acute cardiopulmonary process is seen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral bibasal patchy opacification consistent with pneumonia.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Bilateral hypodensities within the kidneys bilaterally, which are too small to characterize.
Moderate prostatic enlargement.
Hypertrophied bladder wall with possible nodular filling defect superiorly.
VIDEO SWALLOW [**2130-5-2**] Aspiration or penetration of all barium consistencies, although less with nectar-thick liquids.
There is no pneumothorax.
Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.
QS complex in lead V2 consistent with an anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CXR [**2130-5-9**] FINDINGS: AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate persistent low lung volumes and opacification at the left lung base that may represent pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
There is no pneumothorax.

#Sepsis, Pneumonia: Met 3 sirs criteria with fever, tachycardia, and elevated WBC count at time of admission.
His fever, tachycardia and elevated WBC count resolved.
He did have a fever to 100.8 on the day following discontinuation of abx, but remained afebrile since.
He also developed a leukocytosis on the day prior to discharge, which was up to 11 and stayed stable on day of discharge.
The patient had repeat AP and Lat CXR to evaluate for pna, which showed LLL pna, but this is consistent with prior known pna and felt to likely represent no new process.
# Goals of Care: the patient developed hypernatremia to 148, which resolved with free water IVF.
The possibility of PEG was raised with the family, which would ensure adequate hydration and avoid hypernatremia and renal failure.
They choose to continue to administer free water by mouth despite risk of aspiration.
They understand that continued administration of water will likely lead to repeated pneumonias, and that he may not be able to meet his needs for free water, and hypernatremia or pneumonia could lead to death.
# Hypernatremia: up to 148, improved with free water by IVF.
Because of his frequent PNAs and risk for aspiration he was evaluated by speech and swallow.
This is likely secondary to pre-renal etiology.
