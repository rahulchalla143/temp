Admission Date:  [**2173-8-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-8-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-5-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 102099**] is a 66-year-old woman with past medical history significant for symptoms consistent with neuromuscular disorder.
Her symptoms began approximately six months prior to admission and were significant for lower extremity weakness which progressed to the point where she was unable to ambulate.
Three weeks prior to admission, she developed upper extremity weakness and dysphagia.
She is admitted to outside hospital where workup included equivocal EMG studies, positive P/Q voltage-gated calcium channel antibody, and negative acetylcholine receptor antibody.
Coronary artery disease status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2173-3-23**].
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25%.
History of atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion in [**2173-3-23**].
History of deep venous thrombosis.
History of osteomyelitis of the skull status post craniotomy which is complicated by a grand mal seizure.
Chronic low back pain.
History of compression fractures.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet controlled.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
There were several palpable nodules in the thyroid.
Lungs had bibasilar rales going 1.5 up the posterior lung field.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There are active bowel sounds and no abdominal bruits.
The extremities showed 2+ pitting edema at the knees.
Neurological examination was notable for a disoriented woman with slurred speech.
There was no clonus or vesiculations.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 102099**] was admitted to the hospital for further management of her neuromuscular disease.
Due to impending respiratory failure, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit soon after she arrived in the hospital.
Pulmonary:  Ms. [**Known lastname 102099**] was subsequently intubated secondary due to her respiratory muscle weakness.
At the time of intubation, she had a decreased vital capacity and decreased NIF.
Her pulmonary issues were complicated by progressive fluid overload leading to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
She did have a diagnostic therapeutic thoracentesis, which resulted with a removal of 1 liter of fluid, however, this did not improve her respiratory mechanics.
Cardiac:  She has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.
She was in atrial fibrillation while she was in the MICU.
This was complicated by worsening congestive heart failure and decreased urine output.
Renal:  She developed acute renal failure during her hospital stay.
It was thought that part of her acute renal failure were due to contrast induced ATN.
However, she did not develop any improvement in her renal function, perhaps due to inadequate tissue perfusion.
Neurology:  Her differential diagnosis of her neuromuscular disease included myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] myasthenic syndrome.
She underwent seven rounds of plasmapheresis with minimal improvement in her clinical status.
I&D:  She developed a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sacral decubitus ulcer.
Her sacral decubitus ulcer also grew Pseudomonas.
Her sacral decubitus ulcer was debrided by Surgery.
Due to her hematologic issues, however, she had problems clotting after the debridement, and she continued to ooze from her decubitus ulcer for the remainder of her hospital stay.
Hematology:  Her course is complicated by both anemia and thrombocytopenia.
[**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] myasthenic syndrome versus myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
Hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring mechanical intubation.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Atrial fibrillation status post DC cardioversion.
Congestive heart failure.
Acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.
Sacral decubitus ulcer complicated by infection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas.
