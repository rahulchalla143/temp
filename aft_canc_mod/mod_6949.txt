History of Present Illness: 69 y/o F with PMHX of COPD and Small Cell Lung Cancer (diagnosed [**2159**]) s/p XRT/chemo/tumor debridement/R mainstem bronchus stent placement ([**2164**]) and recent LUE DVT on Coumadin who initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on [**3-27**] with 3-4 episodes of hemoptysis, increased cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.
CTA was negative for PE and revealed right mainstem stent with distal intraluminal narrowing or tumor effusion, mediastinal and subcarinal confluent metastatic lymphadenopathy.
Decision was made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronch and IP evaluation.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and was continued on steroids, nebs and cough suppressants.
She went for flexible bronchoscopy on [**3-30**] which revealed normal trachea, extensive tumor at carina obstructing both mainstem bronchi, extrinsic mediastinal compression of L mainstem and unable to visualize stent in right mainstem due to intraluminal tumor.
During this procedure, pt became progressively hypoxic, bradycardic and loss of pulse at approx 3:38pm.
After approximately 2-3minutes of CPR, rhythm was checked and there was a palpable pulse with HR >100 and sbp >180.
TEE was performed and showed bubbles in the right atrium suggestive of APC related air embolism but no RV dilation suggestive of acute PE.
Small Cell lung cancer - diagnosed in [**2159**] and recurred in [**2161**].
Last bronchoscopy was in [**2165-12-23**] - small amounts of granulation tissue seen in stent.
Recent LUE DVT (mid-[**2166-2-20**]) - L arm port was changed, after which she developed dramatic swelling from shoulder to wrist; UENIs confirmed LUE DVT.
COPD - longstanding, unknown date of diagnosis 4.
Anxiety/Insomnia  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
She does not know of any asbestos exposure.
She drinks alcohol only on social occasions and uses no other drugs.
Family History: She reports no family history of lung cancer, SLE, or CAD.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.1 BP: 130/84 P: 117 R: 22 O2: 98% on 3 L General: Alert, oriented, not in acute respiratory distress, sitting upright in bed watching TV with audible upper airway inspiratory and expiratory stridor.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils equal round & reactive to light, mucous membranes moist, no jugular venous distention, mucous membranes moist, oropharynx clear without thrush, no oropharyngeal source of bleeding seen Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits, loud and harsh inspiratory upper airway stridor heard, trachea not deviated Lungs: Nasal cannula intact, patient sitting upright with audible upper airway inspiratory and expiratory stridor.
Respiratory rate is mildly elevated.
Scattered anterior inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.
Left-sided bronchial breath sounds bases>apices.
Right-sided bronchial breath sounds with fine crackles at bases.
CV: Tachycardic with regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: No skin rash or ecchymoses noted, dressing over left anterior pectoral region covering old PortaCath.
[**2166-4-9**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Known treated right upper lobe mass with expected post-treatment  change and soft tissue density seen in a right paramediastinal location is stable.
New mild bilateral pleural effusions.
Otherwise no significant interval change with no focal consolidation, and pulmonary vascularity within normal limits.
No new abnormality involving cardiomediastinal contours.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2166-4-7**] Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS There is a linear region of decreased diffusion within the right  frontal lobe, predominantly involving the cortex and subcortical white matter, as well as multiple additional punctate foci of decreased diffusion within the biparieto-occipital lobes, including extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum on the right.
There is an additional focus of abnormal slow diffusion within the inferior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, measuring 1.5 cm, with associated brisk enhancement.
There is [**Doctor Last Name **] enhancement over the right frontal lobe signal abnormalities described above.
All of the regions of decreased diffusion have associated T2 signal abnormality.
There are no regions of abnormal marrow replacement, despite limitations by motion artifact.
Focus of susceptibility artifact along the posterior focus likely represents a small calcified dural plaque.
There are multifocal regions of punctate post-embolic encephalomalacia within the left cerebellar hemisphere suggesting chronic embolic disease.
Multifocal regions of abnormally decreased diffusion, most prominent within the right frontal lobe, which has an appearance suggestive of watershed infarction.
The more punctate foci of decreased diffusion posteriorly suggest multiple small emboli.
Well-defined 15 mm focus of enhancement and decreased diffusion within the right cerebellar hemisphere may represent a subacute enhancing infarct, but is more concerning for a metastatic lesion in this patient with lung cancer.
Consideration could be given to neck MRA or CTA to evaluate the cervical circulation, though the pattern suggests a proximal source.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2166-4-1**] Cardiology ECHO No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No LV wall motion abnormalities.
Right PA appears compressed by large mass but still patent.
Arrest possibly secondary to left sided intracardiac air/coronary air embolism but unable to determine given time between event and images.
PE also on the differential but no signs of significant RV failure, however inotropes (epinephrine) were administered.
Small cell carcinoma  [**2166-3-31**] Radiology VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of the left subclavian IJ axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
There is normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all of the vessels.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o F with PMHx of large mediastinal SCC s/p right mainstem stenting who presented with recurrent compressive symptoms who underwent OR placement of left mainstem stent and right mainstem APC complicated by hypoxia and PEA arrest.
Pt thought to have had PEA arrest after rigid bronchoscopy was removed, subsequent to L main stent placement for SCLC and use of argon anticoagulation.
TEE was not done during procedure due to technical difficulties secondarely to the mediastinal mass.
Her ventilatory support was minimal, RISBI was <105 with air leak and she was extuabted 24 hours after procedure.
Due to long standing disease with e/o hyperinflation on CXR and report of bronchospasm on presentation, she was also treated for COPD exacerbation with standing and prn nebulizers.
800cc were removed and sent for culture.
LUE DVT: Per PSH report, pt had portacath associated upper extremity DVT and has been on Coumadin, p/w supratherapeutic INR.
Anticoagulation was held prior to procedure and re-started 24 hours afterwards (with lovenox) given her malignancy and higher bleeding risk.
During her hospitalization there was concern of a cerebellar metastasis of SCLC.
Due to h/o DVT and atrial fibrillation as well as evidence of embolic stroke, anticoagulation was continued upon discharge.
Tachycardia / SVT : Pt has remained tachycardic since admission, suspect some component of dehydration and underlying malignancy.
CTA neg for PE at OSH prior to transfer.
Then, she had episodes of atrial fibrillation up to 140-150 BPM with stable BP.
Metoprolol was not further uptitrated as sinus tachycardia was thought to be secondary to her illness.
She was diltiazem prior to this admission, but it did not control her heart rate adequately.
SCLC: Pt with SCLC s/p chemo/radiation and now with L and R main bronchus metal stents.
She will need follow up MRI in 6 weeks for further charactization of a potential brain metastasis.
Speciation showed ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE pan-sensitive.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium 3 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for sore throat.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check weekly CBC and chem 10 to ensure no major abnormalities   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: small cell lung cancer PEA arrest COPD exacerbation pulmonary effusion atrial fibrillation MSSA bacteremia Enterobacter UTI  secondary: hypertension h/o DVT anxiety   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
However, shortly after the procedure you developed very low blood pressure and required ICU hospitalization.
Upon extubation you had swelling in your neck impairing your breathing, as well as severe wheezing.
Your vocal cords show a candidal infection (thrush) so you should continue to gargle with nystatin swish and swallow.
Also during your hospitalization you were found to have Staph aureus infection of your blood stream and possibly a Staph aureus pneumonia.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection for which you are on a second antibiotic called Bactrim.
You were also treated for atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm) which requires medication to control the heart rate and continuation of blood thinners to prevent strokes.
Unfortunately, to complicate this matter, a small abnormality was found in your brain that may be a metastasis of the lung cancer.
If it is, you could potentially have a bleed in the brain.
On the other hand, if you do not continue with the lovenox treatment, you could have a stroke from a blood clot formed in the heart, which you may have already had in the past.
The present plan is to continue you on blood thinners until we can obtain a repeat MRI to confirm a metastatic brain tumor.
Regarding treatment - you should discuss further treatment of your lung cancer with your pulmonologists and your primary oncologist.
Many medications were changed during this hospitalization: - you will start prednisone taper, ipratropium and albuterol for treatment of COPD - guifenessin has been added to break up mucus - bactrim and vancomycin have been added for treatment of urinary tract infection and blood stream infection - nystatin swish and swallow for treatment of oral and vocal throat [**Female First Name (un) **] infection (yeast).
- aspirin has been discontinued due to increased risk of bleeding.
