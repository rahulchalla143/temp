Admission Date:  [**2156-3-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-2-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 47 year old female presents with 4 weeks of headaches, dizziness, concentration difficulty, word finding difficulty, and fatigue.
The patient cannot recall all the events of this morning but her co-worker reported that she had word finding difficulty today as well.
The patient has had no gait disturbances, visual changes, weight loss, numbness, or weakness.
She does not have any chest pain or SOB.
No dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.

Appearance is most consistent with metastasis, although at this time, there is no known underlying primary tumor.
[**3-30**] MR HEAD: There is a large, 5.8 x 5.0 x 4.4 cm mass arising from the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].
Central hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images is likely secondary to central necrosis.
There is extensive mass effect with rightward shift of 8 mm and associated subfalcine herniation.
There is also uncal herniation secondary to local mass effect.
Evaluation of post-contrast images demonstrate enhancement of the [**Doctor First Name 500**] adjacent to the mass suggesting that this mass is infiltrating the [**Doctor First Name 500**] locally.
Diffusion-weighted images reveal no associated infarct.
No definitive blood supply is identified based on these images.
IMPRESSION: Large, enhancing mass arising from the sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] on the left with MR characteristics of a meningioma.
Significant associated mass effect including subfalcine herniation, rightward shift and uncal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 47 year old woman with headache of 4 weeks duration associated with word finding difficulties and poor concentration found to have large left temporal mass consistent with meningioma arising from the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] on MRI.
There was significant mass effect and 8mm shift adjacent to the left temporal mass.
Symptoms and examination remained stable.
Embolization of the left temporal mass occurred on [**2156-4-6**].
She proceeded to resection of left craniotomy and excision of left temporal mass on [**2159-4-8**].
After the skull was removed, the brain was noted to be acutely swollen and a bleed was noted behind the meningioma.
Post operative CT scan showed there has been massive progression of intracranial mass effect with approximately 12 mm of subfalcine herniation with obliteration of most sulci bilaterally.
There is massive uncal transtentorial herniation with involvement of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
A large collection of air is noted along the frontal and temporal lobes with fluid and air within the resection bed as well as foci of hemorrhage within the left temporal lobe.
She was kept intubated for first 24 hours given high dose Mannitol and steroids.
A central line was placed for poor access and unfornatley she suffered a pneumothorax requiring a chest tube placement.
On post operative day 1 she was extubated and following commands, no motor deficits with short term memory deficits and expressive partial aphasia.
Post Operative MRI showed:  No evidence of residual neoplasm on post-gadolinium sequences, though evaluation in the immediate postoperative period is limited due to intrinsic T1 hyperintense blood product and a follow up MRI at a later date, as clinically indicated, would improve sensitivity.
On [**4-12**] she was transferred to the floor and the results of her biopsy showed ANAPLASTIC (MALIGNANT) MENINGIOMA.WHO ([**2148**]) grade 3.
She had a minute ptx after it was discontinued.
