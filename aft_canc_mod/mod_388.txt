Was feeling well prior to drinking, no symptoms or complaints.
Has a history of seizures and DTs per patient, last about a year ago.
FS 172, ETOH 456  Was relating right lower abdominal pain radiating to right hip as well as chest pain and SOB but no respiratory distress noted on assessment.
Had a shaky episode - unclear if was seizure - as well as episodes of unresponsiveness and 'foaming' at the mouth' and was treated with valium 5mg IM x 3, ativan 2mg IM x 1, valium 10mg IV x 1, ativan 2mg IV x 1.
Head CT showed small area of hemorrhage over [**1-12**] gyri on the right infereior frontal lobe which was read as either artifact or possible extra-axial hemorrhage and neurosurgery was consulted who recommended repeat head CT in 24 hrs or with any clinical decline.
States he had seizures yesterday, although he says he does not remember the episodes and only knows he had seizures because someone told him about them.
Per patient, fractured hip in the mid [**2142**] after being hit by a truck but was doing well until one month ago when he fell and hit right hip against the coffee table and the pain has now been increasing.
No fevers, chills, HA, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, or other symptoms.

This could represent a small amount of acute extra-axial hemorrhage.
The remainder of the study is unremarkable with no other areas of intracranial hemorrhage.
A mild periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent with small vessel angiopathy.
There is mild mucosal thickening of several ethmoid air cells.
No fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small linear area of high attenuation along the lateral right frontal lobe which could represent a small amount of acute extra-axial hemorrhage.
A followup CT would be helpful for clarification.
CXR: FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright" with excessive lordotic positioning dated [**2174-2-27**].
There is left more than right basilar discoid atelectasis, without other focal air space process.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged, with no pleural effusion or other evidence of CHF.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study with bibasilar atelectasis, but no other acute process.
There are extensive old, healed fracture deformities involving much of the right hemipelvis, including that iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], ischium, and superior and inferior pubic rami, with extensive heterotopic ossification and bony bridging.
Allowing for the extensive deformity and remodeling, no acute fracture is seen, and the right femoral head appears well directed in its acetabulum.
There is no discrete pelvic soft tissue abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Extensive, longstanding fracture deformities involving the right hemipelvis, likely related to severe trauma in the past, with no acute fracture or alignment abnormality.
Repeat CT Head: FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior study, the previously described small linear focus of high attenuation adjacent to the right inferior frontal gyri is no longer visualized.
There is no evidence of edema, mass, mass effect, or territorial infarction.
Unchanged lacunar infarction on the right thalamus as well as persistent periventricular white matter hypodensities, likely consistent with small vessel disease.
Unchanged mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal air cells, more evident on the left with a questionable medial wall defect of uncertain chronicity.
IMPRESSION: The previously described small linear area of high attenuation adjacent to the lateral right frontal lobe is no longer visualized.
There is no evidence of significant changes in the interim, unchanged lacunar ischemic event on the right thalamus and chronic microvascular ischemic changes as described above.
EKG: Ectopic atrial rhythm versus sinus rhythm with abnormal P wave axis.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Area of linear parenchymal scarring in periphery of right lower lobe with adjacent minimal pleural thickening also appears unchanged.
Ill-defined opacity in the periphery of the left lung base appears similar to recent chest radiographs but is new compared to the older study of [**2174-2-27**].
Additionally, on the lateral chest radiograph, a new nodular opacity is identified in the lower retrosternal region, difficult to localize on the PA projection.
IMPRESSION:  Poorly defined left basilar peripheral opacification, and a discrete nodular opacity in lower retrosternal region, possibly due to an acute infection but neoplasm is an important consideration for the discrete nodule.
If there are classic symptoms of infection, recommend followup chest x-ray in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy.
If such symptoms are absent, then immediate CT would be advised to evaluate for possible lung cancer.
Diffuse emphysematous changes.
Linear scarring in the right lower lobe.
Pleural scarring along the left lateral sulcus.
Hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration.
Collateral vessels along the anterior chest wall, incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast study, of unknown etiology.
Findings consistent with a right adrenal adenoma.
Colonic diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2180-5-14**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2180-5-14**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.

EtOH Abuse/Withdrawal On arrival to ICU had alcoholic hallucinosis but no current evidence of seizures.
AM of discharge from ICU patient transitioned to outpatient regimen of ativan 2mg [**Hospital1 **] with CIWA scale coverage with diazepam.
Diarrhea resolved.
On CT found to have scarring and emphysematous change.
No evidence of infection.
Fevers/Leukocytosis/Urinary Tract Infection WBC count rose after transfer to floor.
Also w/ fevers up to 101.
Patient received empiric C. Diff treatment as above given level of leukocytosis and recent diarrhea.
Given the coag negative staph in only one bottle this was felt to likely be a comtaminant.
He remained afebrile without leukocytosis for the last 4 days of hospitalization.
Cerebral hemorrage Initial imaging showed an area of attenuation concerning for extra-axial hemorrhage.
Patient was evaluated by neurosurgery who did not recommend any medical or surgical interventions.
Repeat imaging showed resolution of these findings.
Patient was without focal neurological deficits 7.
Hypertension Had previously been on Atenolol for hypertension, however patient reported intermittent compliance with this.
In checking pharmacy records had not filled prescription for this medication.
This was held given patient was initially in acute withdrawal and subsequently showed signs of infection.
Adrenal Adenoma Patient found to have adrenal adenoma on CT scan (as above).
Liver lesion Hypodense lesion seen on CT scan, however not well characterized.
This may require further f/u with RUQ U/S, particularly given drinking history and elevated transaminases.
Hip Pain The patient has chronic R hip pain.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for hip pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you should have a seizure, increased shortness of breath or chest pain, worsening headache or blurry vision, high fevers, or any other concerning symptom.
