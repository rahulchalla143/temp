HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including recurrent arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30% who was referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for APF/LV mapping/biventricular ICD.
He was scheduled for the pacemaker ICD placement in effort to enhance synchrony of his cardiac function and to capture an element of atrial kick, as well.
He had the procedure done on [**2123-3-23**] which was complicated by approximately 400 cc blood loss and hypotension which ultimately responded to fluid boluses and Dopamine drip.
He was noted to have a drop in hematocrit and, in light of hypotension, he was monitored in the CCU after his procedure.
In the holding area a quick TTE was done showing no effusion.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
Cardiotoxicity and cardiomyopathy status post Adriamycin.
Antithrombin 3 deficiency complicated by deep venous thrombosis.
Alternating right bundle branch block/left anterior fascicular block with left bundle branch block and long PR.
Clostridium difficile complicated by toxic megacolon status post hemicolectomy.
Status post transient ischemic attack.
Heart:  Regular rate, tachy, II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Extremities:  Trace bilateral pitting edema.
Cardiovascular rhythm:  Patient was ventricular paced with ICD which was interrogated the day after placement and working well.
Ischemia:  Patient had no signs or symptoms of active ischemia.
Blood pressure:  Patient had hypovolemia likely secondary to blood/volume loss and was transfused two units packed red cells initially.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix after his blood pressure normalized given his chest x-ray is concerning for congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray repeated after diuresis showed improvement with decrease in infiltrates bilaterally.
Left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis/hypercoagulability:  He will be started on Lovenox and Coumadin to be followed by primary care physician.
Rash/pruritus:  Patient complained of generalized pruritus.
Nurse noticed raised area of erythema diffusely across back which decreased with hydrocortisone cream.
Arrhythmias status post pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy with CHOP.
History of transient ischemic attack.
History of atrial flutter status post cardioversion [**2119**].
Left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
