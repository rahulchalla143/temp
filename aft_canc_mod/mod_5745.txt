MRI performed in [**Location (un) 6185**] reportedly showed) showed multiple small metastases and likely leptomeningeal spread.
After WBT, she started to have slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and hallucinations.
Then the patient was referred to the ED for spine scans, IV hydration and a swallowing study.
Exam was notable for L facial droop, inability to gaze upward on R side, bilateral weakness in lower extremities, good rectal tone.
Limited images through the cervical and most of the thoracic spine demonstrate no gross cord compression or canal stenosis.
Limited assessment of spinal cord itself, with no large area of signal abnormality.
Multiple vertebral body lesions are compatible with known metastatic disease, with mild anterior wedging of T7 but no large fracture identified."
CT head showed "No ICH or infarct (MRI more sensitive for acute infarct).
Fluid or mucosal thickening right sphenoid air cell, otherwise clear sinuses."
Upon arrival to the ICU, she denied pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or other symptoms.
In the ICU, her abx regimen was vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for aspiration pneumonia.
She has had mild hyponatremia, thought to be due to SIADH.
[**5-31**] developed bone pain in back and legs, no scans done.
Had back pain and bilat leg weakness.
Noted left sided facial droop, speech changes.
- Hypercholesteremia - HTN - "irreg heart rhythm" NOT atrial fibrillation   Social History: She is of [**Location 7972**] descent.

Limited images through the cervical and most of the thoracic spine demonstrate no gross cord compression or canal stenosis.
Limited assessment of spinal cord itself, with no large area of signal abnormality.
Multiple vertebral body lesions are compatible with known metastatic disease, with mild anterior wedging of T7 but no large fracture identified.
No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute infarct.
MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarct.
Multifocal hypodense region in the convexities may represent edema in the setting of occult metastasis.
Recommend correlation with outside hospital imaging if available, or further evaluation with MRI.
Fluid or mucosal thickening within the right sphenoid air cell, with a chronic appearance.
There is hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right, increased compared with comparison outside CT, with a point of relative decompression at the pelvic inlet.
Vessels are seen coursing through this, which is not a typical appearance for metastasis, and recommend correlation with prior imaging studies if available.
Air in bladder, recommend correlation with recent instrumentation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse osseous metastases.
No aspiration seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Aspiration PNA: Admitted for Altered Mental Status with possible aspiration pneumonia.
Dysphagia: Patient originally failed speech and swallow, but passed videography study of speech and swallow.
She started eating well, but kept NPO due to intractable nausea.
Hyponatremia: Thought to be SIADH and secondary to brain mets.
# Constipation: Patient is constipated upon admission, with exam tenderness to palpation, as well as by abdominal x-ray, which appears to show retained contrast from a prior study within the colon, as well as a dilated loop of bowel.
She had one episode of bilious emesis, and her NGT was placed on suction.
While on the floor NG tube was pulled for a trial because suregery did not feel that this was SBO, but etiology was not clear and could be secondary to diffuse metastatic disease.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Patient started to receive radiation therapy as an inpatient.
# Recent colitis: Had been on a 12 day course of cipro/flagyl, started on [**6-25**] and completed it prior to discharge.
