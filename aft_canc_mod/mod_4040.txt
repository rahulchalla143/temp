Admission Date:  [**2115-10-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-10-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-1-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old alcoholic man with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, who recently presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-29**] with abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth and jaundice.
The patient was found to have an obstructive mass in the duodenum, left inguinal lymphadenopathy, ascites, pancreatitis and a bilirubin of 14.4.
The patient underwent an endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography on [**10-7**] with failure to cannulate ampulla resulting in respiratory failure during procedure and intubation.
The patient was found to have bilateral infiltrates and pulmonary effusions, thought to have adult respiratory distress syndrome, required minimal ventilatory settings, though.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for percutaneous attempt at biliary drain.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Recently diagnosed with obstructive jaundice and duodenal mass.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In evaluation on arrival, he was found to have a temperature spike of 104.5 F.; temperature on the Medical Intensive Care Unit was 100.0 F.; 88 pulse; 111/65 blood pressure; MAP 82; respiratory rate 20; 97% on ventilation.
Lung sounds are coarse bilaterally, diffuse expiratory and inspiratory wheeze.
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft, mildly distended, positive biliary drain in right upper quadrant; no erythema.
Positive for ascites and shifting dullness, left inguinal mass with post surgical scar exudates.
Chronic venous stasis changes in lower legs bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for work-up of obstructive jaundice and history of alcoholic pancreatitis.
Sections of the duodenum were obtained that showed mucosal eroding ulcerations with active inflammation; biopsy was obtained later which showed chronic inflammatory change and fibrosis; no evidence of malignancy.
Common bile duct brushings negative for malignancy as well.
Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast was obtained showing bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, ascites with hepatobiliary dilatation, presumed pancreatitis, no pancreas masses seen although small probably cystic area in the head of the pancreas seen.
Interventional Radiology placed bilateral biliary drains, internal exiting with decompression of biliary ductal system.
Per IR, long area of stricture of the common bile duct, mild dilatation of the right and left intrahepatic ducts, and a biopsy was obtained of the lower common bile duct which again was negative for malignancy, positive for chronic inflammation changes.
Repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal flow, no evidence of complete obstruction, although presence of thrombus could not be eliminated via this modality.
Ascites were sent for analysis and cytology was pending at time of dictation.
ONCOLOGY:  Preliminary results from lymph node obtained from outside hospital was negative for malignancy.
Surgery was consulted and repeat biopsy was obtained; preliminary results show that it is positive for LCA, CD20 strong positive as well as 100% myotic index, is an indication of a high grade B cell lymphoma histologically, although clinically, the patient does not appear to be succumbing to a high grade lymphoma process.
The patient, at this time, declined further staging work-up and would recommend PET CT scan of the chest to delineate the presence or absence of mediastinal nodes.
CT scan of the abdomen done for obstructive jaundice was negative for intraperitoneal nodes.
Subsequently he was breathing 98% on room air without sequelae.
He has small bilateral effusions which were tapped.
Currently he is without evidence of pneumonia.
DERMATOLOGIC:   The patient was found to have likely Condyloma on penis with areas around genitalia consistent with herpes simplex one and two, DFA sent.
DISPOSITION:   The patient very uncooperative to nursing staff and recommendations of further work-up for positive lymph node biopsy.
Per request, would like to return to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for continuation of care and possible outpatient management of oncologic issues.
Summary: 1.ampullary mass- noted on ERCP as well as on abdominal CT. DDX includes adenocarcinoma and lymphoma (less likely).
ID- had been on Bactrim for xanthomonas maltophilia in his sputum though no overt evidence of pneumonia.
Presumably on Zosyn for biliary coverage.
Has been afebrile for several days.
DDX for source of fevers are SBP ( no evidence), ascending cholangitis, lung, decubitus, B symptoms from lymphoma.
5. hypercalcemia- presumed hyperparathyroidism with PTH level of 78 in setting of mild hypercalcemia 6. portal vein thrombosis- partial.
