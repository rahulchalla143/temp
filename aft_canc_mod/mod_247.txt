Admission Date:  [**2158-10-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-11-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3645**] Chief Complaint: lower back pain and hip pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Posterior surgical fusion T9-L1 with anterior column reconstruction at T11 level   History of Present Illness: A 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer, with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases presented with chronic and acute lower back pain and hip pain.
She has chronic lower pain and b/l hip pain for 2 years.
The pain has gotten worse over the past one month.
The pain was constant and [**10-23**] in intensity.
Any movement would aggravate the pain and only pain med would relieve the pain.
Because of the pain, she underwent a CT of abd and pelvis on [**2158-10-4**], which found that dramatic increase in overall tumor burden and  metastatic disease at T11/T12 results in focal spinal instability with a invasion of the spinal canal with nearly 50% canal narrowing and greater than 50% vertebral body involvement.
She denied focalized weakness, numbness, fecal or urine incontinence, buttock area numbness, or urine retention.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies  sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes.
Denies rashes or skin breakdown.
[**2156-7-14**]: CT torso (done because of elevated alk phos) showed 1.5 and 0.6 cm left upper lobe nodules.
[**2156-8-26**]: Left upper lobectomy showed two foci of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
CT-guided biopsy consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
Bone scan [**2157-4-18**] also showed involvement of several left ribs.
Sutent ended in [**2158-1-14**] because of disease progression.
[**2158-2-7**]: MRI L-spine with T11 disease with persistent mass effect on thecal sac but no significant cord compression, and T9 and T10 disease, all likely unchanged.
New T12 compression fracture.
Significant progression of L3 vertebral body lesion with pathologic fracture and retropulsion of posterior cortex.
[**2158-2-13**]: CT torso with interval marked progression of innumerable pulmonary mets since [**2157-8-2**].
Destructive lytic lesion within left femoral head.
CT torso showed osseous mets in spine and left ribs, with interva lincrease in size in soft tissue component at T11 encasing thecal sac, invading cord, and invading more than 50% of the spinal canal.
At L3, compression fracture with soft tissue component extending into spinal canal.
Destructive lytic lesion within left femoral head.
[**2158-4-19**]: C1D1 08-184 (avastin/temsirolimus) [**2158-6-7**]: CT torso with significant decrease in size of bilateral pulmonary lesions and stable osseous disease with decrease in soft tissue mass at T11 - [**Date range (3) 10263**]: admitted for PNA, mental status changes, found to have frontal CVA, taken off study - [**2158-8-9**] CT TORSO: stable disease  Other Past Med Hx: - Hypertension - Breast Cancer s/p resection - gout  Social History: She lives with her 3 sons who assist with her medical care.
She is a non-smoker, no alcohol or other drugs.
Family History: Father had esophageal cancer.
Her maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her 70s.

Metastatic disease at T11/T12 results in focal spinal instability with a invasion of the spinal canal with nearly 50% canal narrowing and greater than 50% vertebral body involvement, placing the patient at high neurological and pathologic fracture risk.
A large right femoral head mass is at increased risk for pathologic fracture as well.
[**2158-10-8**] skeletal survey:[**10-9**]: MRI shows cord compression.
pt states pain control improved but not optimal.
[**10-10**]: pall care came by again in AM and uptitrated pain meds.
Heterogenous expansile lesion invlolving T11 vertebral body and posterior elements.
There is posterior epidural soft tissue noted at this level which along with retropulsion of vertebral body causes compression of the spinal cord at this level.
There is increase in the amount of compression of the vertebra as compared to the prior study, with increased epidural soft tissue and increased spinal canal stenosis.
Hyperintense signal in the spinal cord extending from T3-T12, which likely represent syrinx and is unchanged since the prior study.
Heterogenous lesion in the posterior elements of T12 vertebra on the left side with associated periosseous soft tissue.
Decreased height of L3 vertebral body with biconcave shape.
There is retropulsion of the vertebral body causing moderate spinal canal stenosis and indentation of the ventral thecal sac.
Multiple nodules in bilateral lung fields suggestive of metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: A 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer, with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases presented with chronic and acute lower back pain and hip pain found to have metastatic bone disease.
# Bony Mets: pt was admitted for pain crisis and found to have extensive bony lesions in the spine and femur, likely secondary to known renal carcinoma.
No focal neurologic deficits.
MRI and skeletal survey were ordered and pt was found to have cord compression near T11-T12.
Skeletal survey also showed metastatic disease in T11, T12, L3 and lungs bilaterally.
Pt was started on dexamethasone for cord compression protocol.
Ortho Spine team wanted embolization of tumor prior to procedure so pt underwent Angio on [**2158-10-11**].....  # Pain Crisis: palliative care was consulted to assist in pain control after several days of difficulty controlling pain.
Pt was satisfied with regimen of neurontin and oxycontin standing, with oxycodone for breakthrough and dilaudid for refractory pain.
# HTN: continued home valsartan  # Anemia: likely secondary to underlying cancer.
