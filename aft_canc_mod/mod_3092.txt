HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old man with a somewhat complicated medical history.
He recently was worked up by his oncologist because of an elevated CEA.
A PET scan showed an abnormality in the right thyroid lobe as the only positive finding.
Subsequent ultrasound and ultrasound-guide fine-needle aspiration biopsy was positive for a papillary carcinoma.
The patient has elevated phosphate levels as expected.
His parathyroid hormone levels were moderately elevated at 120-150 and his calcium level was within normal.
Neck examination revealed an approximately 1 cm moderately firm nodule on the right thyroid lobe, middle to lower portion.
There were no nodules appreciated on the left side.
There was no lymphadenopathy along the neck or in the supraclavicular fossa.
Regarding the patient's other medical history, he has had renal insufficiency for approximately seven years and has been receiving hemodialysis twice per week since [**2143**].
He also has a medical history significant for peptic ulcer disease and pneumonia.
The patient underwent colon resection for a C2 colon cancer in [**2143**].
He received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy which was shortened because of side effects from the chemotherapy.
End-stage renal disease on dialysis twice a week.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2149-5-22**] following total thyroidectomy and removal of right upper and left lower parathyroid glands.
Surgical findings included a right thyroid nodule as well as possible partial injury to the branch of recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left.
The patient's voice was hoarse however there was no evidence of hematoma and his dressing was clean, dry and intact.
On postoperative day number one the patient had difficulty with coughing and change in his voice was noted by the patient's family.
There was no stridor or shortness of breath.
A laryngoscopy performed by ENT surgery revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis.
On postoperative day number three the issue of the patient's clotted arteriovenous fistula was raised.
On postoperative day four the patient was brought back to the operating room for thrombectomy of his arteriovenous fistula.
He tolerated the procedure well without complications.
The vocal cords did not adduct completely and there was a severe glottal gap.
There was no mucosal wave secondary to absent true vocal fold adduction.
There was edema and erythema in the posterior cricoid and interarytenoid region.
There was trace pooling of secretions in the piriform sinuses more so on the left side.
The results are as follows:  The patient aspirated during the swallow secondary to poor laryngeal vestibular and true vocal fold closure.
Although he did spontaneously cough, his cough was not strong enough to clear his airway of the aspirated material.
There continued to be apparent bilateral true vocal fold immobility with vocal cords in the paramedian position.
Dry swallow after initially swallowing a bolus with a chin tuck.
There were no signs or symptoms of aspiration.
The patient will go home with VNA services for wound checks and to monitor signs and symptoms of aspiration.
