BMT moonlighter was notified of status around 8pm, (VS p 90s SBP 90s O2 low 90s on [**5-10**] L o2) who felt she was wet on exam and she was given 40 IV lasix with some effect in terms of urine outpt, but her respiratory status continued to deteriorate and ABG was hypoxic 7/43/40s/60s, CXR w/ diffuse pulmonary infiltrate.
lasix 80 x 1 was given around 11pm for concern of pulmonary edema and ?frothy pink production.
Intubation was started and she became hypotensive to 60s/30s and acute became asystolic.
SHe was also given 1 amp Ca gluc for low ca from lab before.
Her EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia.
SHe received A-line, 1L fluid bolus, started on propofol for agitation and continued on levophed and her antibiotics was changed to linezolid/zosyn/foscarnet/caspofungin to optimize possible VRE infection.
Her CXR at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p intubation showed nl heart size and diffuse, somethwat improved opacitiy but no focal infiltrate.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large mass in the left upper quadrant with numerous enlarged celiac, porta hepatis, splenic and hilar lymph nodes.
A fine needle aspirate of the retroperitoneal lymph node unfortunately was nondiagnostic and she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy which did prove positive for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[**2196-3-4**] PET scan showed an interval increase in the size of the left upper quadrant mass measuring 2.3 x 5 cm when compared to 1.1 x 2.8 cm.
[**2196-5-9**] underwent a CT scan on a which showed no evidence for adenopathy, particularly in the retroperitoneum at sites of her prior disease.
A new right upper lobe opacity was noted.
Her chemotherapies have been fairly well tolerated -- she has not had febrile neutropenia, line infections or nausea/vomiting/ diarrhea.
was initially diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in [**2194-11-3**] and was treated with R-CHOP for a total of six cycles, which resulted in complete remission.
There was also an increase in the size of the left diaphragmatic lymph node which now measures nine millimeters.

Physical Exam: TGEN: acute respiratory distress HEENT: mmm, no lad, rosacea on cheeks CV: tachycardic, nl s1/s2, no m/r/g PULMO:  coarse BS bilaterally ABD:  bs+, nt, nd, no masses EXT:  warm, slight LE edema b/l, 2+ DP/PT NEURO:  moves all extremities and withdraw to pain  Pertinent Results: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX CT chest/abd/pelvis/bone.
The patient is status post splenectomy, with no evidence of recurrent, or residual disease within the abdomen or pelvis.
New 1.6 x 0.8 cm focal opacity within the right upper lobe.
Focal area of opacity within the left lobe anteriorly, is unchanged from prior exam, and most likely represents a parenchymal scar.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ECG:  Sinus tachycardia with ventricular pre-excitation/ [**Doctor Last Name 13534**]-Parkinson-White pattern Since previous tracing of [**2196-4-14**], ventricular pre-excitation/[**Doctor Last Name 13534**]-Parkinson-White pattern now present XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX MRI Head: FINDINGS: Comparison is made with prior study from [**2196-6-10**].
Overall, there has been no change.
There are small areas of increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, within the deep white matter of both frontal lobes.
These are most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
However, there is no evidence of acute infarct.
There is no mass effect.
There is no midline shift.
There is increased T2 hyperintensity within both mastoid sinuses.
These findings could be consistent with inflammatory/infectious etiologies, including opportunistic infection.
IMPRESSION: 1.Increased fluid within both mastoid sinuses, could secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes, including an opportunistic infection.
2.Chronic small vessel infarction.
No significant portal inflammation.
3.Occasional necrotic hepatocyte.
4.No evidence of lymphoma.
5.No evidence of graft vs host disease.
7.No fibrosis on trichrome stain.
10.Special stains for Fungi, AFB, and pneumonitis are negative with appropriate control.
11.Immunostain for adenovirus was sent to [**Hospital1 **] and will be reported in an addendum.

MUD NONMYELOABLATIVE ALLOGENIC SCT:  Pt was not given Bactrim PPX secondary to sulfa allergy.
She had no significant signs of hematuria or tamponade/pericarditis.
Her counts rose to a level of 22,000 due to ?GVHD vs. infection, but trended down to normal range.
Two weeks into her post-tx course, Cyclosporine was held due to possible toxicity and altered MS.
She spike a fever and flagyl was added for possible C.Dif, cultures were negative x2 for C.Dif.
DIARRHEA:  Pt had continual diarrhea from days -2 to +3.
Neurology was consulted, patient had a noncontrast head CT that was normal, MRI negative except for chronic microvascular ischemia, and an LP that was cx negative, and was cytology negative.
At the time, patient had an elevated white count, was in acute renal failure with elevated BUN, and with fevers, who was thought to be encephalopathic.
Pt had an acute change in MS on [**6-20**], with nonresponsiveness to sternal rub, touch or command, but had spontaneous eye opening and arm movements.
Repeat EEG [**6-23**] EEG concerning for post-ictal seizure activity, and a repeat EEG on [**6-28**] continued to show spikes possibly c/w seizures.
She was started on Foscarnet per ID recs for treatment of HHV-6, although it is unclear whether all of MS changes are due to HHV-6, or ?seizures d/t HHV-6 infection.
Her tachycardia (both regular WPW pattern and sinus tachycardia) was managed with metoprolol.
Per cardiology recommendations, she was monitored on tele for wide qrs patterns, but was recommended to load 100mg procainamide if she became tachycardic with afib, and a wide qrs pattern.
PT continued to have sinus tachycardia while occasionally switching into a ventricular pre-excitation rhythmn, but never developed a-fib.
+VRE BACTIURIA -Pt was found to have +VRE bactiuria on [**6-17**], her catheter was replaced, and pt was placed on Linezolid 600mg qD.
Pt never had positive blood cultures, and her vitals remained stable.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -Pt was placed on CSA post-tx and developed increasing Creatinine levels, decreased UOP, and worsening pleural effusions.
Hypoxia:  The patient developed new onset shortness of breath.
More recently on [**6-27**], pt began to have worsening tachypnia, although was still satting 94-95% on 2L.
MIGRAINE:  discontinued verapamil 120 mg QD, no symptoms throughout hospitalization.
Continued Hospital Course:  O/N on [**6-29**], pt was noted to have increased work of breathing with hypoxia up on bone marrow transplant floor.
During intubation, pt became asystolic and ACLS protocol was followed.
Initially pt was kept on caspofungin and foscarnet and other abx were changed to zosyn and linezolid to ensure broad coverage as etiology of her worsening medical condition was not known.
During this time, dilantin dose was adjusted and bedside EEG monitoring was performed which demonstrated decreased amplitude, decreased spike activity.
On her 3rd day in the ICU, pt became increasingly acidemic and hypotensive, requiring pt to be placed back on neosynephrine pressure support.
Throughout the day on pt's 3rd day in ICU, she became increasingly acidemic, with increasing Neosynephrine requirement until the maximum dose of the pressor was reached.
