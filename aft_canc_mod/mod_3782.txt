In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left hemidiaphragm is quite well seen with only minimal atelectatic changes at this and the other base.
Right chest tube remains in place, and there is no definite pneumothorax.
Mild atelectatic changes persist at the left base.
There is some vague haziness with preservation of markings at the right base.
This could possibly represent some pleural fluid, although the sharpness of the hemidiaphragm makes this less likely.
A lateral view would be most helpful for further evaluation.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main bronchus).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Postoperatively she had some borderline ABGs in the PACU, which improved with pulmonary toilet and decreased narcotics, and was transferred to the floor.
That evening she was found to be acutely hypoxic and short of breath, with a low pO2 by ABG, so was started on a nonrebreather mask and transferred to the ICU.
Her chest tube was pulled on POD 2 and there was no pneumothorax on a post-pull chest Xray.
On POD 4 she complained of some nausea associated with her narcotics so her Percocet was discontinued and she was started on standing Tylenol.
