Admission Date:  [**2120-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-4-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress, hemoptysis transferred from OSH   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: debridement of mass from tracheal lumen by interventional pulmonary  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo male with PMH large right thyroid cystic mass eroding into trachea, who presented to [**Hospital6 **] [**2120-3-24**] with hemoptysis and respiratory distress, now diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
Pt reports that he noticed a right neck mass last [**Month (only) 359**].
The mass appears to be cystic in nature and has been aspirated at least 3 times, which decrease in size each time.
Pt was o/w in his USOH until 2-3 weeks ago when he developed a URI with symptoms of dry cough; no fever, chills, sore throat, myalgias.
1 day PTA, pt developed stridorous breathing and respiratory distress.
CT neck showed tracheal mass per nursing s/o (pt brought CT).
He has not had fever and night sweats but reports weakness and weight loss for several months recently.
anemia Afib (19 episodes since [**2119-11-4**], as documented on pacer interogation [**2120-3-6**])   Social History: Was living alone in ALF.
Family History: No history of thyroid disease.
CVS: RRR, nl s1 s2, no m/g/r Lungs: transmitted upper airway stridor; otherwise clear Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS Ext: no edema Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, [**6-7**] bilateral upper and lower extremity strength.
7-cm diameter right neck mass, with direct invasion of the subglottic, cervical and proximal thoracic trachea.
Differential diagnosis includes primary head/neck cancer and lymphoma.
Left lobe thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous appearance.
Right upper paratracheal and prevascular lymphadenopathy as well as additional nodes in the right side of the neck.
Dedicated MR of the neck may be helpful for more complete assessment of the neck mass and lymphadenopathy if warranted clinically.
Pathology: The tumor is composed of a relatively monotonous proliferation of spindle cells which grow in sheets with a prominent vascular pattern.
These results exclude both melanoma and hematopoietic neoplasms.
The differential diagnosis includes, but is not limited to, sarcoma, spindle cell carcinomas (sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma), and malignant salivary gland neoplasms.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was transferred here for further mgmt of airway and large thyroid mass by our IP team.
IP found endotracheal obstructing tumor and extrinsic compression of the high trachea by thyroid mass.
After rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the intratracheal tumor component on [**2120-3-26**], stat pathology showed anaplastic tumor.
On the morning of possible radiation, patient and family met with interventional pulmonary team who explained that the most recent CT showed further invasion of the tumor into the trachea.
