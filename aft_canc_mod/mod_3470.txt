Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77yo M with T3N2 papillary RCC s/p L.nephrectomy who recently started on Pazopanib [**2117-8-16**], who was originally admitted for elevated LFTs thought to be [**1-5**] Pazopanib heptotoxicity, C diff colitis and acute on chronic renal failure.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt s/p nephrectomy with baseline Cr ~[**1-6**].
Developed acute on chronic RF in the setting of sepsis which did not improve.
Continues calcium carbonate 500mg TID for phos chelation, Nephrocaps 1 cap QD Low potasium diet.
# Infection: Initiatially treated for sepsis + c.dif with IV Vanc/flagyl + PO Cipro + Vanco from [**Date range (1) 73681**].
Was treated with total 10 days of PO vanco after disconinuing other systemic antibiotics.
# diarrhea: initially had c.dif for which recieved treatment now repeated c.dif assays negative yet diarrhea continues.
Colonoscopy showed diffuse erythema, friability, exudates and ulceration likely pseudomembranes in the rectum and sigmoid but biopsies were normal.
2. drug side effect [**1-5**] to Abx  3. infection: less likely now with neg cultures and repeated ng C.dif  4. inflammatory: unlikely in the setting of normal colonic biopsies.
[**Month (only) 116**] consult with GI in the out patient seetting of no resolution.
# A fib:   a number of Afib/flutter/RVR episodes during this admission.
Except for AF episodes remains non-thyrotoxic clinically.
# Cholestatic liver injury and Jaundice: secondary to Pazopanib heptotoxicity.
Imaging w/o structural abnormalities or ductal dilatation.
Pt mentating well, no asterixis.
Has possible malabsorption and a few guiac positive stools.
Thus anemia is likely multifactorial and secondary to chronic illness + CRF + possible malabsorption and occult GI bleeding.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma: per patient's oncologist no further treatment is considered at this point due to patient's various other complicating medical issues.
