CXR showed "peripheral RUL infiltrate/atelectasis and probable insult to peripheral LLL/pleura."
CT scan at the OSH revealed a small fat containing umbilical hernia with minimal fat stranding concerning for incarceration.
According to the patient's daughter and [**Name (NI) **] notes the patient was recently admitted for weakness and difficulty ambulating.
He was found to have SOB, dehydration and hypokalemia from increased diuretic use, and abdominal distension.
His KUB showed fecal loading in the rectum so he was given milk of magnesia and mg Citrate.
His abdomen then became distended (his belly 3 x as big as usual) and after that he developed worsening shortness of breath.
ROS: The daughter notes the pt has had + constipaiton, poor PO intake, and SOB.
His baseline lung exam is dry rhales worse on right and he has low BP in the low 90s.

Collapsed gallbladder, containing high-density contents, likely reflective of numerous stones.
Emphysema, with suggestion of mild fluid overload.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
His UA was positive for uti and so he was given aztreonam, as he has a history of pseudomonas uti's and has many antibiotic allergies.
# hypoxia/tachypnea: In the ED: the patient's vitals were 97.9 104/65 75 100% 2L.
His CXR showed no pleural effusion, but his CT showed emphysema with suggestion of mild fluid overload.
His JVP was elevated to his ear and lower extremities showed 2+ edema to knees bilat.
His creatinine was elevated above baseline at 1.4.
It was unclear if the patient was having an acute systolic CHF exacerbation or abdominal distention from constipation that was causing splinting and tachypnea.
On HD #2 he became tachypneic ____?
# Abdominal distention: The pt had been having constipation for the past two weeks prior to admission.
He had a distended abdomen on exam (stating his abdomen was three times his normal size), but denied pain.
However, KUB showed significant stool in the distal colon and rectal vault.
He was given lactulose and ___  # leukocytosis: On presentation the pt was afebrile but had an elevated WBC count.
He received aztreonam in the ED for UTI on UA (pt has many allergies to antibiotics).
The patient remained afebrile and his white count trended down.
Here at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient's UA showed few bacteria, WBCs and RBCs.
He had an elevated white count with 86% neutrophils so he was started on aztreonam for UTI.
This antibiotic was selected given his multiple antibiotic allergies and the fact that he had pseudomonas in his urine in [**9-24**].
# CHF: as above, it was unclear if the patient was volume overloaded from acute CHF exacerbation.
# hypothyroid:  The patient was continued on levothyroxine 200 mg daily with 300 mg on Sunday  # CAD:  The patient's statin and ACE inhibitor were continued.
expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Cardiac Arrest actue systolic CHF exacerbation Constipation  Secondary diagnosis: Antithrombin III deficiency Hypothyroidism CAD   Discharge Condition: Pt.
