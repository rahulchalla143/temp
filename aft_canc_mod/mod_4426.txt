Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
The LMCA had an 80% stenosis in the distal portion of the vessel.
The LAD had a 80% proximal stenosis, a 70 mid vessel stenosis and a 80% distal vessel stenosis.
The Cx had a 70% stenosis in the proximal portion of the vessel.
The RCA had an 80% stenosis in the distal portion of the vessel and there was diffuse plaquing all throughout the RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics reveal elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 20 mmHg.
There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback from the LV to the aorta.
[**2108-8-2**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild diastolic LV dysfunction.
No significant valvular disease seen [**2108-8-2**] Chest CT Scan: In the left lobe of the thyroid, a 2.5 cm nodule is seen.
Otherwise, there are no abnormalities in the upper mediastinum.
Generally, in the mediastinum, no enlarged lymph nodes are seen.
There is no evidence of pleural effusions or other pleural pathology.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of nodular lung lesions, notably no evidence of lesions suspicious for metastasis.
No evidence for airway lesions.
Small gallbladder stone (2, 62).
2-mm right renal calculus (2, 68).
The bone windows show moderate degenerative vertebraldisease, but no evidence of bone destruction.
[**2108-8-3**] Carotid Ultrasound: There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery including left main lesion - see result section for further details.
The echocardiogram showed only mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function, mild diastolic LV dysfunction, and no significant valvular disease.
Carotid ultrasound showed minimal disease of both internal carotid arteries.
Chest CT scan revealed a thyroid nodule and right upper lobe nodule, but there was no evidence of lesions suspicious for metastasis.
He remained pain free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from pressor support without difficulty.
He was started on Kefzol for serosanguinous sternal drainage without erythema or a sternal click.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has recommended to Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his urologist that he not undergo his renal mass surgery for six weeks after his bypass surgery.
