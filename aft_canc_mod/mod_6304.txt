Admission Date:  [**2130-4-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-2-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Low back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ex-laparoscopy, retroperitoneal mass biopsy   History of Present Illness: The Pt is a 75y/o F who transferred from OSH with worsening renal failure, elevated uric acid and a newly diagnosed abdominal mass.
The pt was in USOH until 1 month ago when she developed increasing low back pain.
Three days prior to transfer the pt developed abd pain intially located in the RLQ and later radiating to LLQ as well as increased urinary frequency and dysuria.
She then presented to her PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT abdomen was obtained demonstrating a large retroperitoneal mass, multiple lymphadenopathies.
There she had a CXR which was WNL, renal ultrasound with no hydronephrosis and a percutaneous biopsy of the retroperitoneum was performed.
Given her elevated LDH, uric acid and worsening renal failure she was given IV hydration with bicarb, allopurinol and Rasburicase.
Her retroperitoneal mass was felt concerning for lymphoma and she underwent a CT guided biopsy.
Per report the CT guided biopsy yielded only necrotic tissue.
Urology was consulted for question of bladder wall thickening.
OR cystoscopy demonstrated that the left lateral wall has a smooth 1.5-2cm area of invagination into the lumen of the bladder.
This may be a primary bladder mass or more likely, extrinsic compression of the bladder by an external mass.
Post-op the pt had low BP and neo was started.
This may be a primary bladder mass or more likely, extrinsic compression of the bladder by an external mass."

No intravenous contrast material was given due to renal insufficiency.
ABDOMINAL CT: The liver and spleen are normal in size without focal defects.
Pancreas is normal in size but there is peripancreatic adenopathy and inflammation.
There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes adjacent to the aorta in the upper retroperitoneum.
More distally a dense conglomerate mass surrounds the aorta and IVC.
Enlarged mesenteric nodes are present.
There is no free air in the peritoneal cavity.
There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric collection.
PELVIC CT: There is bilateral pelvic adenopathy.
There are a few enlarged inguinal nodes bilaterally.
Review at bone window settings shows degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Large retroperitoneal mass with mesenteric and pelvic adenopathy, accompanied by inflammatory changes.
Wall of the urinary bladder is thickened possibly infiltrated by tumor.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Moderate estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
ADDITIONAL LEFT RETROPERITONEAL TISSUE "5" (F): DIAGNOSIS: INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH GRADE B CELL LYMPHOMA   Brief Hospital Course: 75 y/o F with no significant past medical history who presented with new of abdominal/pelvic retroperitoneal mass and tumor lysis syndrome, s/p intraop biopsies, with results consistent with aggressive B cell lymphoma.
# B cell lymphoblastic follicular lymphoma:  She initially presented from an OSH with a new abdominal and pelvic retroperitoneal mass and with tumor lysis syndrome, with a uric acid of 22 and in acute renal failure.
She was started on rasburicase and allopurinol with improvement of her tumor lysis labs.
On [**4-21**],  she underwent CT guided biopsy which yielded necrotic samples.
For definitive diagnosis, on that same date, [**4-21**], she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with biopsy.
She also had a cystoscopy in the operating room by the urology service for further characterization of the bladder thickening seen on CT.
Immediately following her post-operative course, she spiked a temperature in the ICU and was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia (see below for further details).
Pathology revealed an aggressive B cell lymphoma and on [**4-22**] she was started on [**Hospital1 **] at 80% dose given recent surgery.
Of note, on her first day of rituxan, she developed acute abdominal pain.
STAT CT of the abdomen revealed no acute pathology.
Her abdominal pain soon resolved and she tolerated the remainder of rituxan without event.
# Tumor lysis syndrome: She was admitted with tumor lysis syndrome, with uric acid 22 and in ARF with SCr at 2.2.
Her tumor lysis labs began to trend down and her acute renal failure resolved on hospital day 3.
# Pneumonia: Given prolonged anesthesia on [**4-21**] during open biopsy as noted above, she was remained intubated on POD 1.
She remained afebrile throughout the remainder of her hospital course.
Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Retroperitoneal mass B cell lymphoma Pneumonia, ventilator associated Back pain Tumor lysis syndrome Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: stable, O2 sat 98% RA, tolerating PO   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a mass in your abdomen and tumor lysis syndrome (electrolyte and metabolic disturbances secondary to malignancy).
You had this mass biopsied by the surgical team.
The biopsy revealed that you had B-cell lymphoma.
In addition, you were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a pneumonia.
