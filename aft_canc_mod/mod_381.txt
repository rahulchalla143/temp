No formal mental status exam can be performed in light of pt's severe aphasia.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
There appears to be slight overinflation of the endotracheal cuff.
Severe bibasilar atelectasis is present, and an underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small left pleural effusion is present.
Severe bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is a 2.2 x 1.7 cm left parietal hematoma, previously 2.0 x 1.6 cm, which has a hematocrit level on the current and prior studies.
There is a left temporal hematoma, 3.7 x 5.2 cm, previously 3.5 x 3.5 cm, with a new hematocrit level superiorly.
There is a left occipital 2.1 x 1.9 cm hematoma, previously 1.5 x 1.9 cm, with a new hematocrit level.
There is complete compression of the temporal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle, and partial effacement of its atrium and body.
There is mild effacement of the ambient cistern adjacent to the mid brain (2a:12).
There is no shift of midline structure, and no compression of the third ventricle.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
A right anterior ethmoid air cell is opacified.
IMPRESSION:  Significant interval enlargement of the left temporal hematoma.
Mild interval enlargement of the smaller left parietal and occipital hematomas.
COMMENT ON ATTENDING REVIEW: Given the lobar nature of the hematoma, diagnostic considerations include amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformation(s), and underlying masses.
MRI/MRA brain & neck [**9-10**]: FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:  There are areas of acute hemorrhage seen in the left temporal and occipital region.
There is mild surrounding edema identified.
On post-gadolinium images, several linear areas of enhancement seen in the area of hemorrhage as well as subtle peripheral enhancement seen and subtle enhancement in the inferior portion of the hematoma.
Post-gadolinium images also demonstrate increased vascular structures in the suboccipital region on the left, best visualized on series 25, image 40.
Subtle fleeting filling defects in the left transverse sinus could be secondary to arachnoid granulations and are not likely due to thrombosis and as visualized on the MP-RAGE post-gadolinium images.
There is no other abnormal area of enhancement seen.
No acute infarct identified.
The MRA of the head is limited but demonstrate no vascular occlusion.
Although some flow is visualized in the carotid arteries, the evaluation for stenosis is limited.
Left temporo-occipital hemorrhages with several linear vascular structures in the area as well as in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
The combination of findings described above is suspicious for an arteriovenous fistula unless proven otherwise by cerebral angiography.
Alternatively, an underlying mass can also be suspected if the angiography proves to be negative.
No other areas of enhancement or acute infarct seen.
The MRA of the head and neck demonstrate no vascular occlusion, but are limited for evaluation for stenosis or aneurysms.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
There is complete compression of the temporo-occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle, and partial effacement of its body, unchanged.
There is mild effacement of the left ambient cistern, unchanged.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their major branches, are grossly unremarkable.
The abnormal blood vessels in the left cerebral hemisphere and left cerebellum, seen on the preceding MRI and suspicious for dural AVF, are poorly seen on this exam.
However, a conventional angiogram would be the study of choice to evaluate for an arteriovenous fistula.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Left vertebral arteriogram, left common carotid arteriogram, left external carotid arteriogram,left middle meningeal artery arteriogram, left occipital artery arteriogram.
Onyx embolization of right occipital artery branches 3.
Coil embolization of  left transverse and sigmoid sinuses with Cashmere and Axium coils.
Through this, using a combination of multiple catheters and multiple wires, the left external carotid artery was accessed using a 5 French Cobra 1 catheter and over a Glidewire.
Super-selective access was then obtained of distal middle meningeal branches with a Synchro-2 wire and SL-10 microcatheter which were passed across the point of fistula into a venous pouch adjacent to the left transverse sinus.
Control angiogram through the DAC demonstrated multiple other feeders to the AV fistula, and thus the catheter was exchanged for a rapid transit and further embolization was undertaken within two distal middle meningeal branches with Onyx 18 with good penetration into the nidus.
Attention was then turned to the left occipital arterial supply, and a rapid transit catheter and gold-tip Glidewire advanced into a dominant supplying artery, and embolization was undertaken with Onyx.
Central angiogram at this point demonstrated further occipital arterial supply from very small feeders which we were not able to embolize, and thus at this point we decided to perform embolization from the venous side.
An Echelon catheter and X-Pedion wire were then used to cross a stenotic portion of the transverse sigmoid sinus junction and into the left transverse sinus.
Followup angiography was performed which demonstrated near-complete occlusion of the complex fistula.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications and was sent to the ICU in stable condition.
There is early filling of the left transverse sinus.
The posterior meningeal branch of the left vertebral artery supplies a dural AV fistula which is better delineated on subsequent angiograms, with note made of early retrograde cortical venous drainage which is seen to fill the superior sagittal sinus.
There is no aneurysm or venous pouch identified on this study.
LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERIOGRAM:  There is normal filling of the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid portions of the left internal carotid artery, with normal filling of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries.
The external carotid arterial system is hypertrophied, with especially prominent middle meningeal and occipital branches feeding a large dural AV fistula in the region of the left transverse sinus, with early anterograde drainage seen into the left transverse sinus and jugular vein, as well as retrograde drainage into two large cortical veins which eventually empty into the mid superior sagittal sinus.
LEFT MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY ARTERIOGRAM: Shows hypertrophied branches supplying the dural fistula primarily ending in the transverse sinus.
LEFT OCCIPITAL ARTERY ARTERIOGRAM: Shows numerous small branches supplying the dural AV fistula through transosseus branches.
There is no evidence of dural AV fistula.
There is no early venous drainage as was noted previously.
Venous drainage  of the left cortex is seen seen through multiple cortical veins entering the superior sagittal sinus.
IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname 12584**] [**Known lastname **] underwent cerebral angiography and embolization of a complex ([**Doctor Last Name 12585**] III) dural AV fistula with embolization of arterial supply from left middle meningeal, left occipital, and left vertebral arteries, as well as venous embolization of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses.
