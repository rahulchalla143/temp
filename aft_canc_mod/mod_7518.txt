Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Double-cord stem cell transplant Hickman line placement Colonscopy EGD Enteroscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of recurrent myeloma w/ hx of autologous stem cell rescue in [**Month (only) **], [**2166**], who now presents for a matched unrelated cord blood allogeneic transplant.
The patient was originally diagnosed with multiple myeloma in [**2164-1-4**] when he presented for evaluation of bilateral pleuritic rib pain.
Work up demonstrated a pathologic rib fracture, HCT of 29, and IgA level of 5540 with positive monoclonal spike.
The patient has had multiple relapses as discussed above but stable disease since [**Month (only) 216**].
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made to go forward with a cord blood allogenic transplant as he does not have an HLA suitable donor from the unrelated donor pool.
On review of system the patient denies any changes in vision, headache, URI symptoms, cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation, peripheral numbness or tingling, hematochezia, melena, hematuria, or dysuria.
The patient also describes some xerosis but denies any other complaints.
2) DM- insulin requiring, diagnosed in [**2159**]; no end organ involvement 3) HTN- diagnosed in [**2159**] 4) OSA -diagnosed in [**2162**] and prescribed a CPAP device but does not use this routinely 5) history of hydrocoele ([**2161**]) 6) history of Zoster (distant) without PHN.

STUDIES: ======== CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-4-23**] 10:06 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please evaluate for interval change in size of bleeding with Field of view: 42  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with multiple myeloma day + 98 from cord blood transplant now with evidence of intraperitoneal hemorrhage s/p hepatic biopsy.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for interval change in size of bleeding with CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Acute Renal Failure  CLINICAL INDICATION: Intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
TECHNIQUE: 0.625 mm helically-acquired images are obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: Direct comparison is made to prior examination dated [**2167-4-23**] at 3:25 a.m. Areas of interstitial septal thickening are identified at the lung bases.
Differential considerations do include a component of congestive failure.
A mild-to-moderate-sized pericardial effusion is again seen.
Again there is evidence of hemoperitoneum.
The sentinel clot noted about the inferomedial aspect of the liver has increased in size, measuring 7.9 x 3.7 cm on the current examination.
Diverticulosis noted throughout the descending and sigmoid colon.
Again multiple compression fractures seen within the lumbar spine as well as permeative lytic areas within the bone, consistent with the patient's known multiple myeloma.
Possible mild congestive failure noted at the lung bases.
Findings consistent with the patient's known multiple myeloma.
Findings consistent with the patient's known hemosiderosis.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ON [**2167-4-23**]  CLINICAL HISTORY: Multiple myeloma and prior stem cell transplantation, recently performed transjugular liver biopsy, now with acute onset of abdominal pain and question of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
There are scattered areas of ground glass opacity, with more focal area seen in the right middle lobe, as well as the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
These are compatible with atelectasis or possibly pneumonitis.
Emphysematous changes are seen near the apices.
The heart is centrally located within the thorax, partially due to elevated left hemidiaphragm.
No pleural effusion.
There is a tiny pericardial effusion.
Ventricular septum is hyperdense indicating underlying anemia.
Mild atherosclerotic calcifications.
ABDOMEN: Non-contrast evaluation of the abdomen reveals a slightly hyperdense liver and spleen compatible with hemosiderosis.
There has been interval development of a moderate amount of hyperdense fluid, most notably in the region of the gallbladder fossa, with density measurements approximately 55 Hounsfield units.
Small amount of fluid which tracks into the lower pelvis, all slightly hyperdense and compatible with blood, resulting from hemorrhage due to recent transjugular biopsy.
There is a small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
There are vascular calcifications seen throughout a nondilated aortoiliac system.
No abnormal mass or lymphadenopathy.
Nondistended bladder.
There is extensive bony mineralization, with ill-defined permeative pattern seen throughout the osseous spine, unchanged from prior study.
There are multiple compression fractures including superior endplate of all lumbar vertebral bodies and inferior endplate of L3.
Evaluation for myelomatous involvement would be more thorough by MRI if there is clinical concern for progression.
Moderate amount of intraperitoneal fluid, particularly in a perisplenic location with slightly increased density, not seen on prior study and is suggestive of intraperitoneal hemorrhage from recent transjugular liver biopsy.
Scattered atelectasis within the lungs, particularly right middle and right upper lung as described, question developing pneumonia.
[**Numeric Identifier 93055**]  DUODENUM AND RANDOM COLON BIOPSIES (2 JARS).
Mild portal, predominantly mononuclear inflammation with lymphocytic bile duct infiltration, associated bile duct damage and focal endothelialitis, see note.
Marked iron deposition in Kupffer cells and mild to moderate iron within hepatocytes on special stain; focal associated hepatocyte necrosis seen.
Scattered apoptotic hepatocytes with minimal lobular inflammation; no significant steatosis present.
CMV immunostain is negative for viral inclusions, with a satisfactory control.
Trichrome stain demonstrates minimal portal fibrosis.
Note:  The biliary features are consistent with acute graft vs. host disease.
A component of injury related to hemachromatosis is also identified.
Clinical: "55 year old male, day 97 status post cord transplant for multiple myeloma with recurrent diarrhea and now rapidly rising LFTs.
Concern for graft versus host disease versus fungal/viral infection.
Patient has history of CMV viremia in [**2167-2-3**]".
[**2167-4-21**] MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: Please evaluate for evidence of infection vs GVHD Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with MM day +96 s/p cord transplant now with rising LFTs, bilirubin 3.7.
Has hx of CMV viremia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for evidence of infection vs GVHD CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Multiple myeloma, status post transplant with rising LFTs and bilirubin.
Evaluate for graft versus host disease or infection.
The liver otherwise demonstrates no focal lesions or evidence of abscess formation.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is seen.
No periportal edema is identified.
The gallbladder is non-distended but does demonstrate gallbladder wall edema; the gallbladder wall measures up to 4 mm thick.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is seen.
Spleen demonstrates no focal lesions and is normal in size.
Stomach and visualized bowel loops appear decompressed, without evidence of surrounding inflammatory fat stranding or mural hyperenhancement.
No free fluid is demonstrated.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present.
Multiple compression fractures are again demonstrated within the lumbar spine, unchanged from the prior CT from [**2167-2-3**].
No definite evidence for intra-abdominal abscess or graft versus host disease.
[**Numeric Identifier 93055**]  DUODENUM AND RANDOM COLON BIOPSIES (2 JARS).
DIAGNOSIS:  Markedly hypocellular bone marrow (~10% cellular, however, see core limited, see description) with marked megakaryocytic hypoplasia.
Erythrocytes show anisopoikilocytosis with occasional burr cells, dacrocytes, microcytes, rare target cells, and scattered schistocytes (2/HPF).
notably, the distribution of erythroid and myeloid precursors is variable with focal areas with myeloid predominance noted) and show occasional megaloblastoid forms as well as occasional forms with asymmetric nuclear budding.
Myeloid precursors appear relatively decreased in number; maturation appears left-shifted and occasional giant myelocytes and metamyelocytes are noted.
Plasma cells include rare large atypical nucleolated forms.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is suboptimal for evaluation and consists of a fragmented core measuring up to 0.7 cm in length and is comprised of periosteum, hypocellular subcortical bone, and a small amount of detached marrow.
Storage iron is markedly increased.
ADDENDUM  CD138 staining, as well as Kappa and Lambda, show no evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia.
CD42 stain for megakaryocytes shows no staining.
Date: [**2167-4-15**]  [**2167-4-10**] CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY: Clinical: 55 year old male with relapsed multiple myeloma, D+ 75, status post cord blood transplant.
Reason for referral: This patient was referred by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1790**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1789**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation of GI bleeding.

There are no well visualized bleeding lesions.
DDx includes erosions, ulcers, or angioectasias.
Small erosions in the duodenum 3.
Mild erosions in the proximal small bowel 4.

Repeat EGD or enteroscopy   Brief Hospital Course: HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Pt was transferred to the ICU in the setting of hypoxia s/p cord blood transplant.
This was considered multifactorial, with likely contributions from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, VAP, GVHD with obliterative bronchiolitis.
Cyclosporine was discontinued and plasmapheresis was held given ineffectiveness in setting of cyclosporine-related TTP.
DIC labs presented a possible mixed picture, with decreasing fibrinogen but negative FDP negative and normal INR.
He tolerated these well other than the development of mucositis and fatigue.
Delays possibly caused by acute illness post transplant given his multifocal pneumonia and his renal failure requiring hemodialysis for a period of time as well as his CMV viremia up to 1100 copies which became undetectable after initiation of treatment with ganciclovir.
His counts began to increase slowly but peaked at an ANC of 210 after ganciclovir initiation and the thought was to switch to foscarnet (cr stable for days at 1.2-1.3) in order to avoid the marrow suppression of ganciclovir.
ID was consulted, and he was switched to acyclovir for CMV ppx, and his counts continued to slowly decline.
The patient underwent BM biospy on [**3-/2088**] with results demonstrating a markedly hypocellular bone marrow (~10% cellular) with marked megakaryocytic hypoplasia.
The patient was immunosuppressed with tacrolimus; he developed tacrolimus toxicity with a level up to 24 and likely the cause of renal failure in [**2167-1-3**].
Given concern for its contribution to diarrhea and possible microangiopathic angiopathy his tacrolimus was changed to cyclosporin and his dose adjusted for a goal trough of 200.
His steroid dose was then uptitrated due to his persistent diarrhea and elevated LFTs related to GVHD.
GVHD: Throughout his hospitalization the patient had recurrent episodes of diarrhea and intermittednt BRBPR.
GI was consulted, and he had an EGD/colonoscopy twice while hospitalized that showed gastritis and duodenitis.
Small bowel enteroscopy demonstrated segmental continuous erythema, friability and congestion of the mucosa with contact bleeding in the second part of the duodenum.
No evidence of amyloidosis.
He was started on rifaximin per GI for possible bacterial overgrowth however this was discontinued out of concern for its contribution to marrow suppression.
The patient underwent capsule endoscopy which demonstrated several sites of ctive bleeding in the stomach, duodenum, and proximal small bowel.
There are no well visualized bleeding lesions.
As the patient was being transitioned from tacrolimus to cyclosporin and his steroids were tapered to prednisone from solu-medrol, he developed a bump in his LFTs and recurrent diarrhea with approx.
1L daily production.
His cellcept and cyclosporin were increased and he was started on Entocort with subsequent improvement in diarrhea and liver function.
The patient was made NPO except medications and had improvement of his diarrhea with bowel rest and was continued on TPN.
Unfortunately, the patient the developed a rapid elevation in his liver function tests from his baseline of 0.8 to 5.0.
Given his progressive worsening of liver function and elevation of transaminases despite increase in immunosuppression, he underwent liver biopsy on [**4-22**].
Pathology was consistent with GVHD.
Following the procedure the patient dropped his HCT and was found to have a intraperitoneal hemorrhage related to his liver biopsy site.
Cyclosporine as well as ganciclovir was later discontinued given the development of significant persistent thrombocytopenia.
(Of note, he is H. pylori positive and should pursue treatment as an outpatient.)
CMV VIREMIA: As stated above, the patient was found to have CMV viremia without evidence of CMV colitis.
Ganciclovir was later discontinued given concern for toxicity to platelets.
MULTIFOCAL PNEUMONIA/FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA: In the beginning of his hospital course, he developed a multifocal pneumonia and respiratory distress and was intubated in the ICU.
He spiked low grade temps to 99 and repeat CT chest on [**4-13**] demonstrated ronchovascular thickening of LLL.
He was started on empiric levaquin after CXR on [**4-23**] demonstrated question of RLL infiltrate.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had acute renal failure with creatinine elevation from 1.0 to 2.6 on day 0.
This renal failure was thought to be secondary to elevated tacrolimus levels which had reached 24.
The patient was evaluated by renal and found to have acute tubular necrosis.
He was initially started on CVVH for volume overload, pulmonary edema and deterioration of respiratory status.
Renal was consulted again, who felt that etiology of the ARF was due to medications, including tacrolimus and foscarnet.
During pt's ICU admission for hypoxia, pt became uremic and anuric, and was started on HD.
HEMOLYSIS: The patient was found to have [**2-4**]+ schistocytes on peripheral smear with [**Doctor Last Name 17012**] prep positive.
His medications were reviewed for possible oxidative stressors.
No evidence of angiopathy on review of path from GI biopsies.
Chimerism study demonstrated no evidence of persistent chimerism as cause for hemolysis.
The patient expired on [**2167-5-15**] of respiratory failure.
He had a trial of CRRT which he was unable to tolerate secondary to hypotension.
