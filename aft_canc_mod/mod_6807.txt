The patient confirms this on questioning and has noted increasing SOB over the past few days.
There was no report of fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other symptoms.
His SBP dropped to 79/46 and he was immediately infused with IVFs through his port with an immediate bump in his BP to 103/56.
On a follow-up CT scan he was found to have partial lung collapse.
Past Medical History: 1)Metastatic colon ca: s/p resection in [**2164**] complicated by leak; underwent ileostomy but hospital course complicated by septic shock.

Imaging: [**2167-3-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Extensive patchy opacities without comparison study available.
There is likely baseline pulmonary metastatic disease with possible superimposed infectious infiltrates.
Atypical edema cannot be excluded as well.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 77287**] is an 88 year old male with metastatic colon cancer who presents with increasing respiratory distress, confusion, and hypotension.
He responded immediately to nebulizer treatements, which made the most likely diagnosis of his respiratory distress bronchospasm.
He was however, also covered with levofloxacin and flagyl for possible pneumonia given his CXR appearance that showed metastatic disease with inability to rule out underlying pneumonia.
2) Hypotension: Patient was transiently hypotensive in ED with BP improvement quickly with IVFs.
[**Name (NI) **] has had poor PO intake over the past week.
No evidence of an infection.
Mental status returned to baseline upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] after treatment of hypoxia with nebulizer treatments.
4) Metastatic colon cancer: Patient has metastases to liver and lung.
No complaint of chest pain on this admission.
Troponin mildly elevated.
Patient was ruled out for acute MI.
Coumadin was continued with goal INR 2 (lower end given history of lung metastases and hemoptysis).
8) Anxiety: Per family, pt is extremely anxious at baseline likely related to underlying cancer and prognosis.
