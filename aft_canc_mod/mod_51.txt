Additionally, due to the intense fibrotic scarring secondary to her endometriosis, consultation was requested from Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2920**] [**Doctor Last Name 1022**] who graciously assisted in completing dissection of the uterus and adnexa, ultimately resulting in a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy which confirmed endometriotic changes.

She was afebrile with a hematocrit of 27.9.
