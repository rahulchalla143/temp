Admission Date:  [**2189-8-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-5-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Mucositis, rash  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 61 yo male with h/o HCC in the setting of HCV cirrhosis progressed on sorafinib, started cabcitabine on [**7-24**], which was stopped on [**7-31**] due to mucositis pain and severe scrotal pain.
He is found to be neutropenic on admission.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3321**] started the Xeloda on [**7-24**] and, shortly thereafter, he developed severe mucositis primarily of oral cavity along with severe dysphagia.
His oral intake has been very minimal but has tried to maintain good fluid intake.
He also complains of sore erythematous area in the right underarm and severe burning scrotal pain.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3321**] has tried the magic mouth wash swish and gargle (lidocaine, mag hydroxide and benadryl) with minimal relief.
He had multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting over the past few days with nonbloody emesis on occasions and dry heaves on others.
ROS is negative for jaundice, pruritis, scleral icterus, abdominal pain, constitutional symptoms, fatigue, nausea or vomiting.
Past Medical History: Asbestosis Pulmonary nodules and calcified pleural plaques Alcoholic Cirrhosis, dx [**2163**] HCV Hepatocellular carcinoma  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3321**] is a 61-year-old male with history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was noted to have elevated AFP in [**3-/2188**] (560) which rose to 944 in [**9-12**].
However, serial MRIs failed to detect a focal lesion until [**8-/2188**] when a 3-cm mass at the interface of segments IV and II was seen.
However, the tumor did not display classic features of HCC and was in close proximity to a dilated intrahepatic bile duct.
This raised the possibility of a mixed histology tumor or possibly cholangiocarcinoma.
Triple phase CT of the liver on [**2188-9-8**] identified a 3.2-cm focal hypodense lesion in segment II with no enhancement in the arterial phase or attenuation in the delayed imaging.
The findings were nonspecific for HCC or cholangiocarcinoma.
The high AFP was most consistent with HCC.
Repeat TACE for residual disease occured [**2188-11-11**].
While surveillance MRI in [**12-14**] revealed no clear evidence of residual or new disease, the one from [**3-14**] detected an enhancing mass in segment II/[**Doctor First Name 690**], which had  increased in size and represented further growth of residual HCC.
The mass appeared to be obstructing the left hepatic duct.
Subsequent ERCP revealed an irregular filling defect in the left main hepatic duct with peripheral dilation.
Cytology revealed "atypical" cells and a pigtail biliary stent was successfully placed over the stricture.
Morphologically, the tumor was most consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
The AFP rose dramatically over [**Month (only) 547**] and [**2189-4-4**], which was highly concerning for rapid disease progression.
Because the patient was uninterested in repeat TACE, systemic therapy was initiated using Nexavar on [**2189-5-5**] in the setting of protocol 09-326 but was taken off of it on [**2189-7-22**] due to disease progression.
Worked in construction for many years.
GEN: Alert and oriented x 3, obviously difficult to speak [**1-6**] pain and dry mouth, somewhat sleepy.
HEENT: Visible multifocal areas of stomatitis and glossitis.
LYMPHATICS: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
CARDIAC:  RRR, normal S1/S2, no rubs or murmurs.
Bilateral gynecomastia.
BACK: no spinal or CVA tenderness ABD: +BS, soft, nontender, no palpable HSM or masses.
?shingles type rash left abdomen/flank, ringworm like lesion right axilla EXTREMITIES: 2+ Pitting edema of right leg without cyanosis or clubbing.
Groin: Severely excoriated scrotum and serous drainage on the patient's underwear.
[**8-9**] Abd U/S: Nondiagnostic ultrasound examination secondary to body habitus and overlying bowel gas.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3321**] is a 61-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma status post transarterial chemoembolization [**2188-9-12**] and repeat on [**2188-11-11**] for residual disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 13300**] disease progressed after a short course of sorafenib.
He has developed severe dermatitis and mucositis related to Xeloda started 1.5 weeks before admission.
Axillary rash - the patient presented with an axillary rash on admission that had been evolving over the previous week and was described as painful and pruritic.
Dermatology was consulted and biopsied for pathology, with bacterial and fungal cultures.
Acyclovir as well as IV antifungal treatment were instituted empirically out of concern for viral and fungal etiologies.
The axillary culture grew out sparse MSSA, most likely a skin colonizer, but given the patient's neutropenic status, and the plan to continue neutropenic antibiotic coverage, this was of little clinical significance.
Severe scrotal pain - the patient presented with severe scrotal ulcerations that had evolved over the last week.
It started as what looked like white papules according to the patient's family, and subsequently became erythematous and very painful, making it difficult to urinate.
Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash looked as if it was viral, and took a biopsy from the axillary area that looked quite similar.
He was put on neutropenic precautions and started on on vancomycin, ceftazidime, fluconazole and acyclovir for infection prevention on [**8-5**].
ID was consulted on [**8-7**], and recommended discontinuing micafungin for fluconazole.
Altered mental status: on the day after admission, patient was found to have altered mental status via increased lethargy and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] levels of consciousness.
Based on exam findings, etiology was likely due to encephalopathy from hepatic, infectious, or metabolic causes.
Another possibility that was entertained was encephalitis secondary to toxic levels of the patient's xeloda.
#Sepsis and Hepatic Failure: Several days following his transfer to the floors, the patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in the setting of hypotension to 79/45 (from baseline of SBP in the 90s), and several episodes of desaturation to the mid-80s while on the oncology floor.
His cxray showed increased bibasilar atelectasis, and his WBC had begun to increased to 3.8 (with 17 bands) from 1.9 the day prior.
Given these findings, along with his large amount of oral secretions, he was believed have an aspiration PNA.
He had worsening infiltrates on CXR and his mental status continued to deteriorate.
Discussions were held with family regarding the patient's failure to respond to aggressive therapy, along with the poor prognosis of his underlying condition.
