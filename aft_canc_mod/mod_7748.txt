Admission Date:  [**2187-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Newly diagnosed biliary ductal mass - noted to be consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, initially here for PTC placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2187-9-24**]:  Internal-external drain placement in the right anterior and left intrahepatic biliary system and external drain placement in the right posterior biliary system.
[**2187-9-25**]: Successful uncomplicated coiling of a small bleeding branch of the a left hepatic artery.
[**2187-10-5**]: Cholangiogram with internalization of R. posterior PTC   History of Present Illness: Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4727**] note, this is a 52 y/o woman who presented with painless jaundice and pruritus.
She was noted to have elevated liver function tests including alkaline phosphatase of 325 and a bilirubin of 19.5.
CT scan of the abdomen on [**9-7**], demonstrated intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of the left lobe with abrupt cutoff at the porta hepatis suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma.
A followup triphasic CT scan of the abdomen on [**9-17**], demonstrated invasive tumor in the hilum of the liver suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma.
She had a replaced right hepatic artery.
She had intrahepatic biliary dilatation that was more severe on the left compared to the right.
There was an infiltrating mass measuring 2 cm in extent of the hilum, suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma.
There was early branching off the right posterior portal vein which was mildly narrowed by the tumor.
More distally, however, the proximal right anterior and left main portal veins were thought to be occluded with more distal reconstitution beyond the hilum.
The tumor also involves the origin of the left main hepatic duct and all segmental biliary ducts in the right lobe appear separately occluded by the mass near the hilum.
The anterior right segment of the liver, especially segment VIII, are mildly atrophic with prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and attenuated in segment portal branches and associated increased compensatory arterial enhancement.
There was no definite tumor involvementin left lobe parenchyma.
She did not have adenopathy that was suspicious for metastatic disease.
An ERCP demonstrated a malignant- appearing stricture at the bifurcation extending to the left and right main hepatic ducts with upstream dilatation.
She had placement of transhepatic catheters in the right anterior, right posterior and left hepatic ducts.
The involvement of the left hepatic duct was approximately 2-3 mm above the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts.
She had bleeding from a branch of the left hepatic artery after the PTC requiring embolization of a small branch of the left hepatic artery supplying the left lateral segment (segments II and III).
She did have a large intra-abdominal hematoma demonstrated on CT scan.
She did develop some ischemia of the left lateral segment with a rise in transaminases and also a small infarct demonstrated on CT scan post embolization.
At the same time, her transhepatic catheters were drained of bilious fluid well.
The rising bilirubin was thought to either be representative of absorption of the hematoma or compromised liver function post embolization or a combination.
Past Medical History: Asthma, chronic, stable Hypothyroidism Elevated fasting glucose EKG abnormalities - unspecified Colonic polyp Migraine headache Tobacco Dependence  Social History: 40 pack year tobacco use history, stopped 1 month ago.
Family History: Negative for biliary or bowel disease and negative for cancer.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Alert and oriented; no acute distress; obviously jaundiced HEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; scleral icterus present; no occular or nasal discharge; thyroid without enlargemement or masses CV: Regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, PTC catheters in R. abdomen capped and without leakage; incision along R. costal border clean and with steri strips in place - small amount of serous drainage from pin-point are [**2-12**] of the way along the incision from the R. with no fluid collection palpated and no fluctuance noted; no surrounding erythema; R. flank ecchymoses extendes to midline of back and resolving EXTREMITIES: No swelling or edema bilaterally   Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2187-9-23**] WBC-9.0 RBC-3.98* Hgb-12.3 Hct-36.8 MCV-93 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.4 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-199 PT-15.7* PTT-25.6 INR(PT)-1.4* Glucose-350* UreaN-7 Creat-0.4 Na-135 K-4.2 Cl-96 HCO3-27 AnGap-16 ALT-39 AST-44* AlkPhos-235* Amylase-520* TotBili-18.8* Lipase-905* Albumin-3.1* Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.1 Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old female admitted with jaundice, and status post ERCP demonstrating an intra-hepatic biliary mass concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
On [**2187-9-24**] she went for placement of the drains and she underwent successful placement of internal-external biliary drainage catheters in the right anterior and left hepatic ducts, and external drainage catheter in the right posterior intrahepatic biliary ducts.
The patient's post-procedure course was complicated by blood noted in her drains and transfer to the ICU for hemodynamic instability (Hct of 23.7) secondary to bleeding from a small branch of the L. hepatic artery (likely trangressed along the course of the L. PTBD catheter).
The bleeding vessel was localized on angiogram and successfully coil embolized by IR on [**2187-9-25**].
The patient continued to do well post-procedure with no further evidence of bleed although she remained visibly jaundiced.
She was noted to develop some ischemia of the left lateral segment of her liver with a rise in transaminases, and a small infarct was demonstrated on CT scan ([**2187-9-28**]) post-embolization.
Her bilirubin has also increased from a nadir of 10.1 to 22.8 although her transhepatic catheters were draining bilious fluid well.
The rising bilirubin was thought to either be representative of absorption of the intra-abdominal hematoma caused by her L. hepatic artery bleed, possibly secondary to compromised liver function post-embolization or a combination of both.
On [**2187-10-1**] (hospital day #7) the patient was taken to the OR for for exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal hematoma, cholecystectomy, and possible common bile duct excision, possible right hepatic lobectomy, possible Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and possible lymph node dissection.
Intra-operatively ultrasound demonstrated the mass at the hilum with involvement of the right anterior and right posterior portal veins and with significant involvement of the left portal vein up to the bifurcation into the left lateral and left medial segment veins in the umbilical fissure.
On post-op day #2 the patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for a Hct of 24 without evidence of active bleed.
20mg IV Lasix twice daily was begun to address her continued lower extremity edema.
The following day the patient continued to do well, was started on a regular diet, and began Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily prophylactically as her R. posterior PTC and L. hepatic PTC were noted to have decreased output (output from the R. anterior drain remained high)in addition to upward trending serum bilirubin levels (elevated to 20.3).
Ursodiol 300mg PO TID was begun on post-op day 7 for her elevated bilirubin levels although through-out her hospital course the patient denied itching or other symptoms of hyperbilirubinemia.
By post-op day #8 the patient's pain was under good control, she was taking good PO, ambulating, her serum bilirubin was down-trending, other laboratory values were stable, and her incision was noted to be healing well with a minimal amount of serous drainage from a pin-point spot approx [**2-12**] of the way along the incision from the right.
No fluid collection palpated along the incision.
The serous drainage is small in amount with no odor or evidence of purulence.
