ERCP [**12-6**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of stricture or obstruction .
pCXR [**12-11**] Tip of the left internal jugular introducer projects over the left margin of the mediastinum a cm above the apex of the aortic arch.
Slight widening of the superior mediastinum indenting the trachea to the right at the thoracic inlet is longstanding likely due to enlarged thyroid gland, not an indication of hematoma.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly persists, and there is mild vascular engorgement in the mediastinum consistent with volume overload explaining increased perfusion to the lungs.
New irregular largely linear opacification in the right lower lung zone is probably atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is severe thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2110-1-28**], there has been no significant change.
The patient was kept in the left decubitus position and then was transported to the floor in stable condition.

# GI bleed admitted for ERCP Post-sphincerotomy, patient had bleeding from the sphincterotomy site.
A second IR angio showed a gastric bleed which was considered secondary to EGD induced trauma and the gastric bleeding vessel was embolized.
The next day, the left femoral arterial sheath was pulled which caused a massive bleed into the thigh.
She was extubated after which she developed some stridor which was most likekly from edema [**2-28**] volume overload and intubation.
She also developed mild chest pain after angio which resolved with NTG, IV Metoprolol.
She developed sepsis with a temperature spike, and was placed on empiric Abx coverage.
Groin bleed: Patient developed a L groin hematoma/bleed after pulling the angio sheath s/p angiography/embolization.
ESRD: Pt with ESRD who received HD through an AV graft in her R arm.
At time of discharge, there was no palpable thrill or bruit throught the graft, and no dopplerable flow could be appreciated.
