Admission Date:  [**2122-12-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-12-31**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Lasix / Triazolam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Subdural Hematoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Craniectomy and evacuation of left sided subdural hematoma   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o female transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with left SDH on MRI and 1 week history of unsteadiness.
The patient had  an MRI scan today and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
Functional baseline activity.
+3 systolic murmor.
Large abdominal mass.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Difficult to assess pronator drift due to sore shoulder.
Subfalcine herniation with 7 mm of rightward midline shift.
Significant mass effect on subjacent gyri, with effacement of the frontal and temporal horns of the left but no definite trapping of the right lateral ventricle.
CT [**2122-12-24**] - Postoperative changes, with a moderate size residual left subdural hematoma containing some acute blood.
Left-to-right subfalcine herniation is slightly decreased in the interim.
CT [**2122-12-27**] - Stable appearance of left-sided subdural collection with interval decrease in component of pneumocephalus.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
EEG - This is an abnormal EEG due to the right temporal more then left frontocentral slowing, slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
The right temporal and left frontocentral slowing suggests subcortical dysfunction in these regions.
The slow background and bursts of generalized delta slowing suggest an encephalopathy.
There is persistent asymmetric airspace opacity in the right lung, not significantly changed.
There is no pneumothorax or definite effusion.
IMPRESSION: Slight malpositioning of new feeding tube.
Brief Hospital Course:    Ms. [**Known lastname 15513**] was taken immediately to the OR where she underwent a craniectomy for evacuation of a left sided chronic with acute component.
She appeared to have a mental status change on [**12-24**] and a repeat CT showed no change but a Dilantin level was 35.
Her renal function remained at baseline 4.4, ruled out for an MI and TSH was 2.9.
A CXR showed a right lower lobe pneumonia, she was started on Levaquin.
Patient was transferred to Medicine service 3 days prior to her passing for management of her hypertension, renal failure, and moderate tachypnea.
Patient continued to decompensate clinically with mutli-system organ failure, namely her neurological system was severely compromised, her cardiovascular system became more unstable as she required large quantities of diuretics and aggressive hypertensive medical management, and her renal failure progressively worsened.
Pain and palliative care contributed to end-of-life care.
Patient in the AM hours on [**2122-12-31**], hopefully with minimal pain and discomfort.
