A staging chest computed tomography scan, head computed tomography scan, and bone computed tomography scan were negative for metastatic disease.
He has done well from this, having complained therapy and now presents for his esophagectomy.
A repeat chest computed tomography scan demonstrated no progression of the disease.
He is doing well status post therapy, having lost a significant amount of weight from therapy.

The patient had a good amount of gastric losses from the nasogastric tube and was started on tube feeds on postoperative day two.
Subsequent chest x-rays each day throughout the patient's early postoperative course were consistent with normal postoperative changes without dilatation of the gastric component of the esophageal reconstruction.
On postoperative day eight, secondary to complaints of the patient's shortness of breath as well as the resurgence of the tachycardia, a V/Q scan was performed in order to rule out pulmonary embolism.
The results of the test were low probability for pulmonary embolism.
At that time, the patient's theophylline was restarted; it had been held previously secondary to his tachycardia to prevent ectopy.
In addition, the chest x-ray that was done at the time of the complaints of shortness of breath were consistent with a significant left pleural effusion.
