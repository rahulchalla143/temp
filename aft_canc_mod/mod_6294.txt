BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS)  [**2177-6-26**] 6:32 PM  BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS  Reason: Please eval fracture  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with rectal cancer, s/p R hip fracture in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2177**] REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval fracture BILATERAL HIPS [**2177-6-26**]:  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Rectal cancer status post right hip fracture marginally.
Comparison is made with the CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2177-3-30**] which demonstrates a lytic destructive lesion of the right acetabulum.
Since the prior study, there has been interval progression of the destructive lesion within the right acetabulum and iliac bone.
There is medial displacement of the acetabular wall into the pelvis.
There is a lucency at the femoral head-neck junction which may represent a non-displaced fracture.
There are multiple lytic lesions throughout the osseous pelvis and the left femur as well.
There is old osseous deformity of the left proximal femur.
There is severe degenerative change in the lower lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:  1) Progression of large lytic destructive lesion in the right acetabulum and iliac bone with fracture of the medial acetabular wall with displacement of fracture medially into the pelvis.
2) Question non-displaced fracture of the femoral neck at the subcapital region.
3) Old fracture deformity of the left proximal femur.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2177-6-27**] 10:32 AM  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  Reason: BILATERAL LEG EDEMA, ?DVT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with colon Cancer, pathalogic fracture of hip, bilateral lower extremity swelling, R>L.
INDICATION: Bilateral lower extremity swelling, right greater than left.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: The right and left common femoral, greater saphenous, superficial femoral, popliteal demonstrate wall- to-wall flow and normal compressibility and response to Valsalva and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for DVT; edema.
Images show focal abnormal uptake of tracer in the right acetabulum and right inferior pubic ramus.
Increased uptake is seen within the left proximal femur diaphysis associated with bony deformity.
Additionally there is focal uptake in the bilateral shoulders, right greater than left, as well as the bilateral knees, right greater than left consistent with degenerative changes.
Focal uptake within the distal ends of the 11th and 7th left ribs is likely secondary to prior trauma.
The above described findings are consistent with focal tracer uptake within the known lytic lesion in the right acetabulum as well as within the right inferior pubic ramus, concerning for metastatic disease.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
Focal tracer uptake within the known lytic lesion of the right acetabulum and pubic symphysis, concerning for metastatic disease.
Likely degenerative changes of the bilateral shoulders and knees.
Using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under direct CT fluoroscopic guidance, a 14-gauge coaxial needle was inserted into the destructive lytic lesion within the right ilium.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedural complications.
Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of Versed and fentanyl throughout the total intraservice time of 10 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
IMPRESSION: Technically successful CT-guided core biopsy of right iliac bone lesion  Biospy: DIAGNOSIS:  Right iliac lytic lesion, biopsy (A):  Connective tissue, scant fragments of bone and fibrin.
No malignancy identified in this specimen  CT Torso: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis are greater on the right than the left.
There is associated volume loss on the right, with segmental collapse.
There is mild thyroid enlargement without a discrete thyroid nodule identified.
There is no supraclavicular, axillary, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is a soft tissue mass involving the right rotator cuff muscles and causing erosion into the right humeral head, which demonstrates pathologic fracture.
There is no apparent involvement of the glenoid fossa.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A 2.2 x 1.9 cm adrenal nodule (3:57) is low in attenuation and unchanged since prior studies, likely representing an adrenal adenoma.
A 3.9 x 2.2 cm exophytic cyst is identified arising from the interpolar region of the left kidney (3:60A), and a simple renal cyst is identified arising from the inferior pole of the right kidney (3:60A).
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and no intra-abdominal free air or fluid is identified.
A rectosigmoid anastomosis site is identified.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is a 4.4 x 2.1 cm fluid collection anterior to the inferior sacrum and posterior to the rectum (axial 3:107; coronal 7:47).
There is diffuse edema and soft tissue enlargement involving the right flank, right psoas muscle, and iliopsoas, with erosion of a soft tissue mass into the right acetabulum and femoral head.
Although previously involving the right acetabulum, there has been progression of pathologic fracture of the acetabulum as well as femoral head.
The left iliopsoas muscle is also enlarged, indicative of a soft tissue mass with pathologic fracture of the left acetabulum and extensive lytic lesions of the left femoral head without definite cortical breakthrough.
Soft tissue metastases with bony erosion and pathologic fracture involving the right humeral head, right femoral head and acetabulum, and left acetabulum.
Lytic lesions without definite cortical breakthrough involving left femoral head.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis and volume loss.
No lymphadenopathy in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Significant atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and its branches.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 M w/ pmhx of rectal cancer presented for evaluation of likely pathologic right hip fracture.
The initial examination hsowed predominantly fibrosis with spindle cells, raising the possibiltity that the pathalogic fracture may be from a new primary sarcoma, as opposed to metastatic rectal cancer.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Pelvis X-Ray showed widespread metastatic involvement of the bony pelvis.
They recommended the patient be seen by radiation oncology for treatment of his metastatic disease.
Furthermore, he had previously received radiation therapy at an outside provider and they recommended that if radiation was needed, he should return there as they have his previous mapping.
They also recommended the patient get a bone scan in order to find other metastatic sites which may be easily accesible for further biopsy and identification.
The bone identified the lesions in the right hip that were suspicious and he underwent a CT guided biopsy of the right ilium by orthopedic oncology on [**7-4**].
However, this biopsy show no malignancy.
His right hip lesion may be severe bony disease in a patient in a patient on hemodialysis.
If his disease has progressed at that time, the orthopedic oncologist will pursue an open biopsy.
His pain was controlled with Oxycontin .
On [**7-1**], after receiving more extensive IV fluids prior to his bonescan, the patient developed respiratory distress and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He presented with a chronic oxygen requirement of approximately 2.5L.
He was using 3L NC at the time of discharge and this may continue to be weened as more fluid is removed at hemodialysis at it is felt that the cause of his oxygen requirement is continued volume overload.
# ESRD- on HD MWF- Continued on nephrocaps and calcium acetate.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Continued on ASA, metoprolol, and statin with fluid removal at hemodialysis .
# DM- continued humalog ISS .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] Health Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Rectal carcinoma Pathologic hip fracture End Stage Renal Disease on hemodialysis Diabetes Type 2  Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Gout Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: All vital signs stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of your hip fracture.
You had a biopsy done which showed no cancer.
You will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further observation.
Your hip problem may be from severe osteooporosis caused by your dialysis.
You also have accumulated more fluid which will continue to be taken off at dialysis.
