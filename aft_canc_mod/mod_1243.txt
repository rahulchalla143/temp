The biopsy on the left was reported at the time of admission to be positive for DCIS with the possibility of microinvasion.
The surgery was complicated by a probable postoperative abscess which required a second surgery and drainage a short time after the 1st one.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] pelvic mass was found on the left.
An ultrasound examination that [**Month (only) **] demonstrated a cyst with multiple septa.
It proved to be a serous cystadenoma.
She had extensive abdominal and pelvic adhesions at that time and had an intraoperative enterotomy which was repaired.
Her gynecologic history was further complicated by the fact that in [**2185**], while she was being followed during the years after her left salpingo-oophorectomy, a pelvic ultrasound exam and then an MRI had suggested that she had a complex mass involving the right adnexa consistent with an ovarian carcinoma.
Meanwhile, follow-up ultrasound and MRI exams suggested that the earlier exams had been over-read and that what she had was an ovary with a dilated right tube surrounding it, creating the impression of a mass with multiple septa and a solid component to it.
On physical examination, she was a well developed, well nourished Oriental female in her late 40s, in no acute distress.
There was an ample hypogastric midline surgical incision scar on her abdomen and 2 recent incisional scars in her breasts.
The right adnexa contained a 4-5 cm soft cystic mass contiguous with the uterus.
On opening the abdomen, she was found to have extensive anterior wall abdominal adhesions.
Continued dissection of the sigmoid, however, led to the conclusion that there were no dissectible planes between the adhesions and the left aspect of the uterus.
In view of the fact that she would have to be on large doses of anticoagulants and the severity of the adhesions involving the left adnexa, it was decided to leave the uterus in place.
It appeared as if a single diverticulum involving the bowel had been transected during the dissection of the sigmoid colon off the posterior aspect of the fundus, leaving a small neat defect in the sigmoid colon.
The patient developed hematuria after the retroperitoneal dissection had begun.
An injury to the bladder muscularis, but not the mucosa, was discovered.
A subsequent follow-up with cardiac enzymes indicated that she had not sustained any kind of myocardial infarction.
Her left leg became markedly edematous.
A follow-up Doppler study the next day confirmed that she did have a deep vein thrombosis involving the damaged common femoral vein.
Over the course of the ensuing week, the edema involving the lower extremity resolved substantially.
At the time of discharge, she had a good femoral pulse and minimal edema involving her left thigh.
Additional postoperative complications included a transient ileus involving a portion of the small bowel and the development of a subcutaneous hematoma which was drained approximately a week postoperatively.
