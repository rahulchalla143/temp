Patient did not notice any neurologic changes.
Upon wakening, her husband noted she had a R sided facial droop and was having difficulty word finding.
Patient had noticed that since beginning her new job, over the past month, she had intermittent episodes of strong odors followed by word finding difficulties that lasted about 15 minutes.

difficulty with low frequency objects.
VII: has decreased facial movements and droop on R side.
Unchanged appearance of the large left temporal hematoma with  intraventricular extention and associated mass effect, as described above.
The left middle cerebral artery is displaced superiorly due to the mass effect from the left temporal hematoma.
There is no evidence of intracranial arterial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
Since a small vascular malformation could be compressed by the hematoma, follow-up MRA should be considered when blood products resolved, if no other source of hemorrhage is identified.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2170-8-26**] Expected appearance of the large acute hematoma centered in the  inferomedial aspect of the left temporal lobe with intraventricular extension, mass effect and slight uncal herniation, stable.
However, the pattern of enhancement, which is relatively thick and eccentric to the locus of hemorrhage, is atypical; while this may reflect neovascularity related to the organizing hematoma, it raises concern regarding an underlying hemorrhagic mass lesion (is there history or other evidence of primary neoplasm?).
There is no pathologic focus of enhancement elsewhere  [**8-29**] MRI Head: IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the irregular rim-enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe most likely consistent with a primary brain tumor such as glioblastoma.
The examination performed for pre-operative planning.
[**8-30**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical appearance after left frontotemporal craniotomy and temporal lobe resection, without change in the previously-seen 3-4 mm shift of midline structures and minimal left uncal herniation.
Recent resection of left temporal lobe tumor.
Residual nodular enhancement along the lateral operative bed is suspicious for residual tumor.
Small acute infarct of the lateral thalamus, hippocampus and adjacent posterior limb of internal capsule.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 y/o F presented with headache to OSH.
Head CT showed L parietal IPH.
MRI showed underlying mass.
Patient presented with expressive aphasia, slight R facial droop and L ptosis with full strength.
Pt underwent left sided craniotomy on [**8-29**] without complication.
Frozen section sent from the OR was consistent with high grade glioma.
She was continued on decadron 4mg q6 and keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
She was noted to have dense R hemiplegia on exam and complete expressive aphasia, her R facial droop remained.
She remained with her R hemiplegia and expressive aphasia.
24 hour EEG monitoring was obtained to evaluate for seizure activity.
Occupational therapy was consulted for her aphasia as was the speech therapist.
Routine post op MRI was performed revealing small left infarct and residual tumor.
She continued on decadron 4mg q6hrs secondary to persistant aphasia.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
