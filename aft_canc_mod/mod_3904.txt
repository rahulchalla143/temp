TRANSFER PHYSICAL EXAM TO SICU: 97.0, 100/70S, 80-100, 18, 96% ra Abd: much more distended than admission with very rigid to touch although dull to percussion.
Ext:  his buttocks are intensely painful [**10-11**] and tender to the touch bilaterally with radiation to the left thigh as well.
There is no rash or visible lesion, exacerbated by movement .
The thyroid is normal, and there is no supraclavicular lymph node enlargement.
The lungs are hypoinflated owing to a poor ventilatory effort which hinders assessment of lung consolidations due to vascular crowdings and difficults comparison with previous study.
Allowing for these limitations, there is diffuse ground-glass opacities which are present in all the lobes of both the right and left lung which seem significantly worsened with respect to [**2156-9-14**].
There are no hilar, mediastinal, or axillary lymphadenopathies.
The patient has moderate but stable cardiomegaly, and the pulmonary trunk has a diameter of 3.8 cm (2:21), which is mildly increased in size since [**2156-9-14**].
The portal vein is patent without evidence of thrombosis.
The pancreas shows no focal lesions or peripancreatic stranding or fluid collection.
The right kidney shows no focal lesions while the left kidney shows two tiny hypoenhancing lesions (2:63) that are unchanged with respect to [**2156-9-14**].
The kidneys present a symmetric nephrogram and excretion of contrast, and there is no evidence of hydroureter or hydronephrosis.
No perinephric stranding is noted.
The abdominal vessels are unremarkable without evidence of thrombosis.
Some prominent paraaortic lymph nodes are noted; however, these nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
There is no mesenteric lymph node enlargement.
No evidence of abdominal hernia, ascites, or free air.
The stomach, duodenum, and small bowel are unremarkable without evidence of wall thickness.
the ascending colon shows peripheral fat stranding, which is new compared to prior study.
No evidence of colonic obstruction.
There is no pelvic wall or inguinal lymph node enlargement.
On these predominantly expiratory studies, there is a mosaic appearance at bilateral lung bases, which becomes somewhat more prominent on the full expiratory study, suggestive of a mild degree of airtrapping.
No definite ground-glass opacities, however, are present.
Bibasilar atelectasis and atelectasis adjacent to bilateral heart borders is present.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.
The heart is mildly enlarged with a pacer wire in the right ventricle.
No significant coronary artery calcifications are present.
The patient is mildly anemic.
In this young patient, there remains residual thymic tissue (5:17) measuring 4.6 x 2.7 cm, decreased compared to a study from [**2156-7-9**].
No significant axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The lobes of the thyroid appear normal.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bone lesions are present.
No ground-glass opacities present to suggest the presence of a PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**].
The degree of heterogeneity in the lung parenchyma could be due to the presence of pulmonary hypertension or air trapping.
Enlarged large main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Residual thymic tissue, which has decreased in size since [**2156-7-9**].
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for malignancy are noted.
A sclerotic lesion in T10 is unchanged since at least [**2156-5-2**].
Diffuse ground-glass opacities in all lobes are significantly worsened with respect to prior CT, although severely hypoinflated lungs limits assessment and may be the explanation for this appearance.
Given this patient's clinical features however, an HRCT of the lungs is recommended to exclude Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
Mild interval increase in pulmonary trunk dilatation.
This is consistent with worsening pulmonary hypertension.
No nodal masses in the thorax or abdomen concerning for lymphoma.
FINDINGS: LUNG BASES: The lung bases are clear, with minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder is normal in appearance without wall thickening or radiopaque stones.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no intraperitoneal free air.
PELVIS: The colon is opacified by positive contrast, and is again noted to demonstrate pan-colonic wall thickening and pericolonic inflammatory change compatible with diagnosis of colitis.
There is a mild-to-moderate amount of abdominal ascites which is increased compared with prior.
No extraluminal contrast is seen.
There is no pelvic side wall lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION: Pancolitis, which appears to have progressed compared with prior and is now associated with a moderate amount of abdominal ascites.
There is no evidence of perforation.
Hypointense marrow is noted on T1 weighted images in the right parietal bone, which has increased as compared to the prior study.
Hypointense marrow is also noted in the clivus and the visualized cervical vertebrae suggestive of lymphomatous involvement.
Enhancement is noted along 7-8th nerves in bilateral internal auditory canals which may represent early leptomeningeal enhancement.
There is no evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.
Brainstem and cerebellum appear normal.
T2 hyperintensity is noted in the right mastoid air cells suggestive of fluid/mucosal thickening.
Lymphomatous involvement of the right parietal bone, clivus and visualized cervical vertebrae.
Enhancement is noted along 7-8th nerves in bilateral internal auditory canals which may represent leptomeningeal enhancement.
No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.
Heterogeneous marrow signal is noted in S1 vertebra and subarticular region of left iliac bone posteriorly showing mixed intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images.
These show mild heterogenous enhancement on post contrast images and there is associated mild soft tissue along the left iliac bone.
The intervertebral discs are normal in height and signal intensity.
At L3 and L4-L5 levels, there are diffuse posterior disc bulges without significant spinal canal stenosis.
At L5-S1 level, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge without significant spinal canal stenosis.
The disc with facet and endplate osteophytes causes mild left foraminal stenosis.
Lumbar vertebral bodies appear diffusely hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted images.
This may represent marrow reconversion or diffuse marrow infiltration by lymphoma.
Heterogeneous marrow signal and enhancement in S1 vertebra and subarticular region of left iliac bone posteriorly with associated mild soft tissue along the left iliac bone.
These may represent focal areas of lymphomatous involvement.
Hyperintense signal in posterior paraspinal muscles and soft tissues in the lumbar region.

Unfortunately, he had an uncontrolled infectious colitis which was not completely identified and did not respond to treatment with antibiotics.
His intense left hip pain continued and he had an MRI which showed that he had diffuse marrow involvement by lymphoma.
# CNS lymphoma:  He presented with elevated LDH.
He also had very severe buttock pain which did not improve with antibiotics.
There was no cause identiied by the CT abdomen and pelvis, he received an MRI lumbar/sacral spine which showed diffuse marrow involvement by lymphoma.
After a discussion with his family indicating that he had very advanced lymphoma after he had already undergone a complete course of chemotherapy and that there were not more options we could give him for treatment, he was transitioned to comfort measures and passed away.
During admission, he began to have increasing abdominal pain and swelling with WBC rising, up to 43K.
Acute abdominal series did not show megacolon or free air but repeat CT abdomen [**10-12**] did show worsening pancolitis compared to [**10-8**] despite treatment with po vancomycin, IV metronidazole, and tigecycline.
The infectious disease team was consulted to assist with possible other causes of leukocytosis and pancolitis since his C. diff toxin and PCR was negative.
His stool cultures were negative for all pathogens.
He underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed nodules which may have been consistent with pseudomembranous colitis, however, the biopsies are still pending.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # HIV: Last CD4 count 60 on [**9-19**] due to poor compliance with his medications.
# Adrenal insufficiency:  Patient had a history of primary adrenal insufficiency and he was on chronic replacement at home with hydrocortisone.
Although this can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea if he were in an adrenal crisis, he also had signs of acute infectious colitis on the CT scan and leukocytosis.
