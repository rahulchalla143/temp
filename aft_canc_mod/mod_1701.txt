During his admission, an aortic mass was identified on CT scan and echo.

Nonocclusive thrombus within the aortic arch.
Nonocclusive thrombus near the origin of the left internal mammary artery and thyrocervical trunk although these vessels opacify well.
Fluid-filled loops of mildly dilated small bowel in a postoperative patient could represent ileus but are incompletely evaluated on this chest CT. Abdominal radiographs may be helpful if clinically indicated.
Mucous plugging of the right lower lobe bronchus and right lower lobe segmental bronchi.
Aortic thrombus and occlusive thromboembolism of the left axillary artery discussed immediately after completion of the scan at 2:40 a.m. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of surgery.
[**2166-3-8**] ECHO Pt is intra-op for embolectomy of left arm  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the anterior and anteroseptal walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
There is a large (2-3cm) mobile mass in the aortic arch.
It is stalked with multiple fronds and is located just proximal to the left subclavian artery.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mass consistent with thrombus or tumor with mobile atheroma being less likely.
[**2166-3-11**] Chest/Coronary CTA A cardiac CTA was performed on this 63-year-old gentleman to evaluate the coronary arteries prior to aortic surgery for an intraluminal mass in the aortic arch.
There is a small amount of calcification in the left anterior descending coronary artery with the calcium score in the 35th percentile for stated age and gender.
One would not expect significant coronary artery disease with this calcium score.
The cardiac output, however, did appear to be satisfactory and there was no abnormal wall motion.
Although the study is less than ideal there would not appear to be significant disease throughout the arterial tree.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Epiaortic scanning performed with the surfqace probe for exact localization of the tumor.
No change in valve structure and function The echo density could not be visualized in the distal aortic arch..  [**2166-3-13**] LE Ultrasound No deep venous thrombosis in right or left common femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal veins.
RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2166-3-16**] 10:48 AM CHEST (PA & LAT) Reason: r/o inf, eff [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o inf, eff HISTORY: Rule out effusion, infiltrate.
There is a small left effusion versus pleural thickening and minimal blunting in the right costophrenic angle posteriorly as well.
No definite pneumothorax.
No acute CHF or infiltrate.
Bilateral upper lobe scarring and subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, better assessed on the [**2166-1-4**] torso CT at which time findings were felt to be unchanged since [**2158-1-3**].
He acutely developed a cold left upper extremity and the vascular surgery service was consulted.
IV Heparin was started and CTA revealed a left axillary thrombus which was occlusive and an aortic arch thrombus.
Over the next several days the patient had an uneventful post-operative course and on POD5 it was decided he was stable and ready for discharge home.
