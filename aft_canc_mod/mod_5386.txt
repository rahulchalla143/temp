hemoptysis, wt loss and found on CXR at OSH revealed RML and RLL opacification and R tracheal deviation.
CT chest reportedly revealed large mass in right chest encasing RMSB and causing collapse of the RML and RLL, abutting R PA and descending PA and posterolateral aspect of IVC.
It also reportedly showed possible left adrenal gland involvement.
At OSH, Pt had MRI of brain reportedly showing possible limbic encephalitis with abnormal signals in b/l temporal lobes.
Underwent flex bronch which showed L vocal cord edema, extrinsic RMS bronchus obstuction occluding 100% of lumen on [**8-21**].
On [**8-22**], underwent rigid bronch w/ TBNA, balloon dilatation, 2 stents placed in RMSB c/b ptx which has persisted despite multiple chest tubes placed.
Currently, pt denies sob at rest but reports DOE w/ [**1-2**] flight of stairs.
Also c/o dry cough and reports several episodes of small amounts of hemoptysis, but some occured in setting of epistaxis.
She denies f/c/s, n/v/d/c, rash, HA, diplopia, focal neurologic deficits.
no m/g/r Lungs: decreased bs over right lung fields.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2136-8-22**] 5:31 PM Small right pneumothorax following stent placement in right main bronchus.
Right upper lobe mass with partial collapse right upper lobe and separate nodular density in right midzone.
PATHOLOGY [**8-23**] path: Positive for malignant cells consistent with poorly-differentiated carcinoma with features of a small cell carcinoma.
The findings are compatible with a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
Bone scan [**8-27**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of bony metastatic disease.
Post pneumonectomy changes with associated right hydropneumothorax and left to right mediastinal shift.
Large abdominal nodal masses concerning for metastatic disease.
Small left adrenal lesion does not meet CT criteria for benign lesion.
Increased T2 and FLAIR signal within the left medial temporal lobe in the region of the hippocampus, and possibly within the right uncus.
Alternatively, herpes encephalitis is also a consideration and a neurology consult is recommended.
Four-mm enhancing lesion in the periphery of the left cerebellar hemisphere without associated edema, possibly representing a metastasis.
Admitted to oncology for chemotherapy.
Metastatic SCLC - Large R sided lung mass encassing RMSB.
Percocet prn and Dilaudid prn for pain control of intermittent epigastric pain.
Dolasetron was given for nausea as needed.
Patient was pain free and in good condition upon discharge.
Confusion: On admission, patient was mildly confused, but alert and fully oriented upon admission to oncology.
Patient was suspected to have paraneoplastic encephalitis vs HSV encephalitis according to an MRI of the brain that also showed brain lesions likely to be [**First Name3 (LF) 1364**].
Pt has a baseline short-term memory loss since [**1-2**] yr according to daughter (pt occasionally forgets events after 1/2h).
Pt was started on ACV b/o possible HSV encephalitis according to neurology consult, but D/C'ed again since LP from [**8-29**] contained only 1 RBC and CSF HSV PCR result was negative.
Metastatic lung cancer 2.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, bloody sputum, belly pain or any other concerning symptoms.
