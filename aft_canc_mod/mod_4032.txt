Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 61077**] is a 65-year-old female with left renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy ([**2117**]), who was found to have a pericardial effusion.
A CT scan last wednesday ([**6-11**]) revealed volume overload with increased pleural and pericardial effusions, pulmonary and periportal edema and ascites.
She also felt unwell and developed a cough with purulent sputum.
She was started on Levaquin as an outpatient, but continued to have shortness of breath.
This shortness of breath lasted for the last 2 weeks but became worse in the past 24 hours.
On review of systems, she reports some occasional rib pain on her posterior back.
She also had a lot of nausea and vomiting last week but that has resolved.
She did not have any TB exposure or recent travel.
Otherwise, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dizziness, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Left renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy ([**2117**]) - Motor vehicle accident - complicated by pneumothorax, rib fractures and incidental findings of pulmonary nodules ([**2119**]) - Right mid, left lower lobectomy for spread of renal cancer ([**2121**]) - nodules in lobes were found to be malignant with histology compatible to those from a primary renal cell carcinoma source - Hypothyroidism - C-section x2 - Appendectomy - Hemochromatosis gene carrier (reported by patient)  Social History: - Family: Married.
- Occupation: Works as a nurse ~3 days/week at acute rehab facility, but reports it has been increasingly difficult to go to work due to shortness of breath.
- ETOH: Occasionally.
Family History: - Grandfather had possible throat cancer - 3 children have hemochromatosis - Sister has systemic lupus erythematosus - Father has Alzheimer's Disease - No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds on right below nipple line and posterior below inferior angle of scapula.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis or peripheral edema.
LUNGS: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi, reduced air entry lower right chest ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended, + bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES: no cyanosis or peripheral edema.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): .
Fluid Culture in Bottles (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH .
Pericardial Fluid Cytology: Pending On Discharge .
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
IMPRESSION: large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of early cardiac tamponade  [**6-18**] EKG: Sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate.
Low voltage T wave abnormalities.
T wave abnormalities are new.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
Saline contrast injected via a pericardial drain is seen within the pericardium prior to removal of pericardial fluid.
500 ml of pericardial fluid was removed with resolution of the pericardial effusion visualized by echocardiography.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-6-18**], post tap resolution of the pericardial effusion is seen.
[**6-20**] CXR: Bibasilar opacities likely due to association of atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is noted.
[**6-21**] TTE: There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The epicardial surface of the right ventricular free wall (particularly toward the apex) appears somewhat thickened, suggestive of residual organized effusive material, thrombus, neoplastic tissue, or possibly even fat pad.
[**6-23**] TTE: There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 65-year-old female with history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented to the outpatient clinic with worsening shortness of breath secondary to a large pericardial effusion with right atrial tamponade.
# Large Pericardial Effusion with Right Atrial Tamponade: Effusion had likely gone on for weeks and was likely a malignant effusion.
Patient was HD stable but found to have tamponade physiology as shown by echocardiography.
She underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 500cc ([**2127-6-19**]) with serosanguinous exudative fluid.
Repeat TTE on [**6-23**] showed a very small pericardial effusion, but no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
# Renal Cell Cancer: History of RCC s/p left nephrectomy ([**2117**]) + right lung lower & middle lobectomy ([**2121**]).
She has since progressed on several treatment regimens including interleukin-2, Avastin, pazopanib, Everolimus and as shown on radiology has involvment of lungs, bones and thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes.
Plan is to f/u with her oncologist in the outpatient setting and resume Avastin.
# Hypothyroidism - TSH = 12, FT4 = 1.3 Continued levothyroxine 125mcg daily .
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - f/u Thyroid function .
# Hyponatremia: Had mild euvolemic hyponatremia with Na stable at 131.
Her serum and urine indices were consistent with SIADH which is likely [**3-5**] to her malignant pulmonary involvment.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - f/u Na .
# DVT prophylaxis: The patient was treated with subcutaneous heparin during this admission.
# CODE Status: Was full during this admission # COMM: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 61078**], Daughter ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 61079**])  Medications on Admission: - Levothyroxine 125mcg qd - Lorazepam 5mg q6-8h prn anxiety - Omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] - Zofran 8mg [**Hospital1 **] - Acetaminophen 1000mg qd - Melatonin 3mg qHS - Ipratropium 42mcg [**Hospital1 **] - Multivitamin  Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
3. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**7-9**] hours as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pericardial Effusion Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management of your shortness of breath.
Work-up of your symptoms revealed a collection of fluid in the lining surrounding your heart.
With drainage, your symptoms improved.
