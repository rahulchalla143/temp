Admission Date:  [**2114-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-9-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 75 y/o M w/ atrial fibrillation, HTN, dyslipidemia, and DVT (while on coumadin so now on lovenox) who persented with a 1 day history of worsening SOB and cough productive of clear sputum.
He has recently been admitted twice within the last 2 months for complaints of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation and SOB thought to be secondary to a CHF flare with his most recent dicharge ~ 6 weeks ago.
He walked around and noticed increased dyspnea with exertion.
He has had no orthopnea or PND and denies any recent CP, palpatations, fevers, HA, visual changes, diarrhea or chills.
His chronic LE edema is stable per the patient since his last admission.
He denies any sick contacts or recent travel.
Cardiology was consulted and felt this episode did not represent an acute STEMI but suggested admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].
Atrial fibrillation 3.
Dyslipidemia 4. h/o L popliteal vein DVT (while on coumadin) 5.
Peptic ulcer disease 7.
Diaphragmatic hernia 8.
Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy  Social History: Patient is married and lives with wife.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

[**11-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**11-19**] Head CT: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation or cerebral edema.
There are bilateral small vessel ischemic changes.
No gross acute territorial infarct is identified on this CT scan.
There is opacification of ethmoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Chronic small vessel ischemia.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Sinus disease.
No orogastric or nasogastric tube is seen; it is presumably out of the field of view, i.e., in the patient's pharynx.
There is probable left-sided retrocardiac atelectasis and/or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No orogastric tube seen, likely representing coiling in pharynx.
[**11-19**] ECHO: EF > 60% The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate globa free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

He then received 3 more rounds of epinephrine, as well as 2 rounds of calcium and bicarbonate, and a liter of bolus IV NS.
Review of telemetry revealed atrial fibrillation with progressive bradycardia and eventual asystole.
ECHO w/o new WMA and CE without significant elevation which does not support cardiogenic cause.
Likely a respiratory arrest, ?
from massive PE given h/o DVT and chronic PE seen on CTA on admission.
He continued to requre maximum dose of dopamine, vasopressin and levophed with persistent hypotension.
Also w/ shock liver and anuric renal failure and likely significant brain damage was not awakening after sedation turned off.
Because of his poor prognosis, and with the knowledge that he never wanted to be institutionalized and enjoyed being very independent, they made the decision to make him DNR.
