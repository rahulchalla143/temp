Admission Date:  [**2114-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-10-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-11-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Percodan / Percocet / Cerebyx / Phenytoin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Right facial droop, left face and arm numbness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Status post tracheostomy -Status post PEG -Status post dental extraction of 3 teeth  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 56 year old right handed female with pastmedical history of breast cancer 10-15 years ago, pleural effusion, DVT and PE who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-9-17**] for evaluation of left face and arm numbness and right facial droop.
She then had several days of nausea and vomiting and malaise.
Then, on morning of admission, she awoke at 6am with left arm and face numbness.
This was associated with a vertiginous sensation as well.
No nausea or vomiting, headaches, blurry vision, double vision, lightheadedness, paresthesias, weakness or incoordination.
She went to [**Hospital1 56809**] for evaluation.
Head CT there with pontine hemorrhage.
However, she reported that her symptoms worsened.
She felt that her speech was more slurred, she was having difficulty managing her saliva and secretions, and had vertical diplopia.
While in ED, she went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response; Diltiazem 20mg IV resulted in rate control.
Breast cancer status post right mastectomy and chemotherapy 15 years ago 2.
Pleural effusion 3.
DVT and PE 7 years ago   Social History: Married, with 3 children.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds over right hemithorax.
Coarse breath sounds on left.
No rebound or guarding.
V, VII: Unable to fully assess with ETT but appears to have right UMN palsy.
No abnormal movements or tremors.
In addition, this extends slightly more superiorly into the pons and slightly more inferiorly into the medulla.
No new areas of hemorrhage are identified.
There is no mass effect or hydrocephalus.
As seen on the CT examination, there is a small 1 cm lesion of increased T2 signal along the right pontomedullary junction which demonstrates magnetic susceptibility on gradient echo images suggestive of a small cavernoma or a calcified lesion due to the increased density seen on the CT exam and magnetic susceptibility.
FLAIR images demonstrate a similar but smaller lesion near the left middle cerebellar peduncle.
MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patent distal vertebrobasilar circulation.
----- CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis [**2114-9-20**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular and prevascular regions, the largest is in the left supravicular region measuring approximately 12 x 19 mm.
There is obstruction within the central right airways with complete opacification of the more distal airways and the entire right lung.
There is a mixed low and high attenuation density of the collapsed right lung.
There is a small loculated effusion at the posterior inferior right thoracic cavity with a thickened wall.
Posterior atelectatic changes are noted within the left lung.
At the superior aspect of the superior segment of the left lower lobe there is a pleural based nodular density measuring approximately 6 x 10 mm.
The patient is status post right mastectomy and surgical clips are noted in the right axilla consistent with lymph node dissection.
A porta cath is noted in the superior left chest wall.
There is layering high attenuation material within the gallbladder suggestive of layering sludge.
There is gallbladder wall thickening or gallstones.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus, adnexa, sigmoid colon, rectum, distal ureters, and urinary bladder are unremarkable.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
----- MRI head with and without contrast [**2114-9-22**]: Since the previous MRI study there is now evidence of subacute hemorrhage with increased T1 and decreased T2 signal identified in the right side of the pontomedullary junction.
The previously seen surrounding edema has also increased which involves now the medulla and the posterior portion of the pons.
No distinct enhancement is seen in this region.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus is seen.
There are no other distinct areas of abnormal enhancement noted.
IMPRESSION: Interval new hemorrhage with subacute characteristics in the right pontomedullary junction with increased edema.
No distinct enhancement is seen in this region given the presence of blood products.
However in the presence of a second small enhancing lesion in the left middle cerebral peduncle, and given the patient's clinical history, these findings are suggestive of metastatic lesions.
No hydrocephalus is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 56 year old female with past medical history of breast cancer 15 years ago, DVT/PE admitted on [**2114-9-17**] after 2 day history of right facial droop, left hemibody numbness.
In terms of localization, her findings point to lesion in right lower pons/upper medulla.
In light of location and history of breast ca, hemorrhagic transformation of underlying mass was a concern.
Repeat MRI with gadolinium to assess for underlying mass demonstrated enhancement of hemorrhagic mass and second enhancing lesion in cerebellum.
On hospital day #1, she was intubated for inability to protect airway and difficulty handling secretions.
Chest XRay showed opacification of right hemithorax and mediastinal shift.
She underwent flexible and rigid bronch with tissue biopsies samples taken.
Chest CT demonstrated multiple enlarged lymph nodes, collapsed right lung and left sided pleural based density concerning for malignancy.
Pathology from her right mainstem tumor mass was  consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast origin.
We were unable to wean patient from ventilator, likely related to collapsed right lung and poor lung volumes.
While on telemetry monitoring, patient was noted to have intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation alternating with sinus bradycardia.
Esmolol or diltiazem was recommended as needed for rate control.
Due to location of her hemorrhagic tumor, patient is likely to have difficulties with swallowing and speech function as she has decreased palatal, tongue, and gag functions.
In terms of infectitious disease issues, patient spiked a temperature on [**2114-9-26**].
Urine culture had gram positive bacteria.
She also has a right conjunctivitis that is being treated with drops.

Insulin sliding scale  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic breast cancer, with hemorrhage in right pontomedullary junction, likely secondary to metastasis.
Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Neuro: Neuro checks, supportive care Onc: Pt should follow up with oncology (Dr.[**Name (NI) 8949**] office) as an outpatient if she wishes to pursue therapy Optho: Pt needs eye patch on R eye intermittently to alleviate diplopia, also eye drops for conjunctivitis CV: Continue esmolol for rate control.
Pt has hx of intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation, but has been stable from that perspective for many days Resp: Follow O2 sats, continue ventilation through trach ID: Continue vancomycin x14 day course (last day will be [**10-10**]), recommend reculturing if she spikes HEME: follow hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit <30, last transfusion was [**9-28**] GI: continue PEG tube feeds, follow electrolytes Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, insulin sliding scale, proton pump inhibitor   Followup Instructions: Follow up with oncology: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 8949**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6568**] to schedule appointment                               [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD, [**MD Number(3) 632**]
