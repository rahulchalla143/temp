Admission Date:  [**2174-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-7-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: T4 squamous carcinoma of the left lower lobe.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) s/p sternotomy, exploration, biopsy, 2) s/p drainage of L pleural/pericardial effusion, 3) s/p bx mediastinal nodes, 4) s/p partial pericardectomy 5) s/p tube thoracostomy (removed [**6-3**])   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an unfortunate 56-year-old woman with a prior 40 pack-year smoking history who quit several years ago and earlier this year was found to have a squamous carcinoma arising from the left lower lobe of the lung invading the left main bronchus and resulting in left main bronchial occlusion.
There was no evidence for remote metastatic disease and she underwent mediastinoscopy at an outside institution that showed no metastatic mediastinal nodes.
We reevaluated her with cardiac MR imaging and felt that if the tumor was confined to the atrium and did not involve the ventricle or the mitral annulus that we could consider a high- risk resection with left atrial reconstruction.
Past Medical History: HTN, ^chol, SCC lung carcinoma, s/p mediastinoscopy ([**Hospital1 112**])  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2174-6-3**] IMPRESSION: Large extracardiac mass invading through the left atrial wall with possible involvement of the basal inferolateral left ventricle.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
There is a similar abrupt cut-off of the left main stem bronchus with near complete opacification of the left hemithorax including mild volume loss.
There are small areas of residual partial aeration at the left apex, as before.
IMPRESSION: Similar opacification of the left hemithorax with mild volume loss.
Brief Hospital Course: pt was admitted one day proir to surgey for nausea and diarrhea.
The planned tumor resection was aborted as the tumor was seen to be invading the AV groove - see operative note for details.
The following surgical procedure was performed: Bronchoscopy, Exploratory sternotomy with biopsy of anterior  mediastinal lymph node, drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions and subtotal pericardiectomy.
Post operatively pt was extubated and transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU for monitoring.
She was tacycardiac and remained hemodynamically stable-betablockers were initiated and was transffered from the ICU.
Her pain was controlled intially on PCA which was weaned to po pain med w/ good effect.
She did rec IV lasix for generalized lower extremity edema with good effect and miantained a stable BUN/Creat.

pat your chest incision dry after showering.
The VNA will change your chest dressing daily- call if the drainage increases, becomes yellow/green or smells foul.
take a mild laxative and stool softner while you are taking pain medication to avois constipation.
