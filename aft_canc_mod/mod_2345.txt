Imaging/Studies:  EKG ([**2108-8-12**]): Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Modest non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Echo ([**2108-8-13**]): There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic stenosis and symmetric LVH.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myelomonocytic antigens CD33, CD15, CD11c, CD64, CD56, and CD4.
T cells comprise 77% of lymphoid gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 2.
INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: Acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy ([**2108-8-12**]): DIAGNOSIS:  Markedly hypercellular bone marrow with involvement by acute monoblastic leukemia (FAB, M5a).
Note: Please correlate with cytogenetic findings.
Erythrocytes are normochromic and show very mild anisopoikilocytosis with scattered burr cells.
Myeloid precursors appear increased and consist primarily of blasts.
Megakaryocytes are present in increased numbers; abnormal forms are not seen, but focal clusters are seen.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature cells consistent with blasts occurring in sheets occupying 90% of marrow cellularity.
There is scant remaining hematopoiesis.
Scattered erythroid precursors are noted including forms with dyspoietic maturation with irregular nuclear contours and asymmetric nuclear budding.
Location: INPATIENT    Cell culture was established to provide metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
**FINAL REPORT [**2108-8-30**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2108-8-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77M with 2-3 weeks of fatigue, found to have elevated white count, diagnosed with AML s/p decitabine ([**8-18**]).
# AML - The patient presented with a leukocytosis of 160k on [**8-12**] with 74% blasts.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed and he was found to have AML, moncytic subtype.
The patient was having symptoms concerning for leukostasis such as cardiac demand ischemia with troponin leaks.
The patient had symptoms concerning for DIC.
The patient also had some symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome.
He received 5 days of Decitabine with a resultant drop in all of his cell lines.
# Renal insufficiency - The patient had a history of renal insufficiency.
The likely etiology was pre-renal due to decreased fluid intake versus tumor lysis syndrome.
# Infectious disease - The patient spiked fevers when he was undergoing pheresis in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# Superficial venous thrombosis - On [**8-20**] the patient noted a tender nodule on his right leg.
The patient underwent ultrasound of his lower extremities and was found to have a superficial thrombus with no deep vein thrombosis.
The patient was treated with warm compresses and the pain resolved.
Pathology report of the lesion showed no evidence of leukemia cutis or sweet's syndrome.
# CV disease - Per past medical records the patient has extensive coronary artery disease.
The patient underwent an TTE which showed an EF of 55 percent with moderate aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation with concentric LVH.
# Hypertension - The patient was continued on his home blood pressure medications with good control.
# Petechial rash - the patient had a petechial rash which was noticed on the day of his discharge.
This rash was thought to be due to his low platelet count.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute myelogenous leukemia.
You received leucopheresis, which is where you have your blood filtered to take out some of the white blood cells from your blood.
Some medication changes have been made: - Your Procardia has been stopped.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Your lisinopril has been stopped as well.
If you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, bleeding from your nose or mouth or rectum, or bleeding that does not stop after 15 minutes, please call your primary care provider or go to your nearest emergency room.
