He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5858**] in [**Month (only) 958**] and had an echo which showed an EF of 40-45% and diffuse wall motion abnormalities.
A P-MIBI was also done, which demonstrated a predominantly large fixed defect in the anterior wall, apex and septum with some evidence of improvement at rest in the septal region.
He was treated conservatively due to the absence of symptoms, however on [**2125-4-25**] developed SSCP and presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**].
He was found to have three vessel disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a long segment of disease in the proximal vessel up to 90% stenosis.
There was a large OM1 with sequential proximal and mid vessel lesions of 80%.
The RCA had an 80% stenosis in the mid-vessel.
Limited resting hemondynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressure with LVEDP 21 mmHg.
There was moderate systolic arterial hypertension 160/87 mmHg.
There was no evidence of a true gradient across the aortic valve on careful pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Left ventriculography revealed distal apical hypokinesis, LVEF approximately 60%.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
[**2125-4-30**] Echo: PREBYPASS: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed although unable to quantify EF.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
POSTBYPASS: Limited acoustic windows.
Left ICA no stenosis  [**2125-5-4**] 04:30AM BLOOD WBC-7.1 RBC-4.17* Hgb-12.9* Hct-36.6* MCV-88 MCH-30.9 MCHC-35.2* RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-178 [**2125-5-3**] 03:34AM BLOOD WBC-7.7 RBC-3.90* Hgb-12.0* Hct-34.6* MCV-89 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.7 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-123* [**2125-5-4**] 04:30AM BLOOD Glucose-127* UreaN-20 Creat-1.1 Na-135 K-3.9 Cl-100 HCO3-26 AnGap-13 [**2125-5-3**] 03:34AM BLOOD Glucose-135* UreaN-17 Creat-1.2 Na-136 K-4.3 Cl-102 HCO3-27 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 90070**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac cath on [**4-27**] which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
