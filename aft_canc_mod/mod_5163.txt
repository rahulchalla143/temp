He appeared to be in no apparent distress.
The patient's stool was positive for C. difficile toxin, and he was started on PO vanco and flagyl.
On the morning of [**3-21**] the patient developed some "burning" sensations at his epigastric region which were initially thought to be heartburn.
Upright and supine plain abdominal films were ordered STAT and revealed evidence of free air.
Physical exam worsened and he had diffuse lower abdominal tenderness, decreased bowel sounds, and some rebound tenderness as well.
CT showed new free intra-abdominal air and fluid surrounding the ascending colon concerning for perforation.
In the OR where he was noted to have a dusky bowel, but no obvious leak from the colon.
In the OR, the patient was hypotensive requiring 7 liters of IVFs, 2 units of platelets, and 2 units of pRBCs.
Of note, post operatively, radiology called regarding the scan with a concern for apparent extravasation of oral contrast at the junction of the 2nd and 3rd portions of the duodenum, suspicious for focal perforation.
Repeat CT with oral contrast ([**2157-3-22**]) showed increased extraluminal contrast, and the patient returned to the OR for suspected duodenal perforation.
Unfortunately, the HemeOnc service believed that his leukemia was so severe that his life expectancy at best was on the order of weeks.
Given his longstanding fatigue complaints his presentation may be that of MDS with transformation to AML.
Patient had received XRT and alkylating chemotherapy in [**2151**] for his squamous cell cancer of anus which places him at increased risk as well.
Subsequent skin biopsy of his left thigh lesion showed evidence of leukemia cutis in conjunction with a MRSA cellulitis.
He required several platelet transfusions for his persistent thrombocytopenia.
Lysis labs and DIC labs were predominantly unremarkable with occasional elevations in XXX XXXX.
#Left thigh cellulitis: Left thigh erythema, tenderness and large carbuncles.
Blood cultures were negative at time of transfer and he had been afebrile during his hospital course.
IV Cefipime was discontinued once he had a swab that confirmed MRSA in his wound and he was placed on MRSA precautions.
Ultrasound of left thigh was neggative for any abscesses.
A dermatology consult was called due to question of leukemia cutis as there were multiple edematous and hardened inflammed areas adjacent to the MRSA lesions.
Hydrea therapy was therefore extended after completion of his Dacogen chemotherapy.
#Diarrhea: This was felt to be secondary to his recent antibiotics.
He had a positive C.difficile stool study after admission and he was placed on Flagyl and PO Vancomycin was added.
Frequency of diarrhea improved throughout his hospital course.
#Abdominal Pain: On the morning of [**3-21**] the patient developed some "burning" sensations at his epigastric region which were initially thought to be heartburn.
Upright and supine plain abdominal films were ordered STAT and revealed evidence of free air.
Physical exam worsened and he had diffuse lower abdominal tenderness, decreased bowel sounds, and some rebound tenderness as well.
CT of his abdomen showed air and fluid around area of the ascending colon indicating perforation.
#Atrial Fibrillation : Known history of atrial fibrillation.
Patient no longer on anticoagulation due to concerns over falls and bloody stools/GI bleed history when on Vioxx.
However, after decision was made to start him on chemotherapy and AML confirmed a cardiology consult was called to review best approach to medical management of his atrial fibrillation with minimal drug interactions.
Flecainide was discontinued and he was maintained solely on Toprol and Verapamil which proved to be good rate control up until [**2157-3-21**] when he was experiencing abdominal pains.
At that time he went into rapid atrial fibrillation with rates in the 130s.
Due to the urgency of his acute abdomen he was taken to the O.R.
He had been taken off of his Coumadin about a month prior to his admission due to GI bleed history and possible fall risks.
Patient has no stents, no ACS history, no prior interventions.
--holding statin for chemotherapy --holding all aspirin/anticaogulation  given his thrombocytopenia --cardiac healthy diet .
#CHF : Patient limited historian but OSH notes indicate prior LVEF 60% in [**2154**], he may have some diastolic dysfunction given his history of hypertension.
Repeat TTE showed preserved LVEF >55% and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
