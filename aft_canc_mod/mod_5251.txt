Admission Date:  [**2142-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-11-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, anemia.
History of Present Illness: 58 year old man with widely metastic prostate cancer (calverium, spine, ribs, pelvis, and proximal humeri and femurs) presented with profound weakness, n/v/d after initiating chemotherapy for prostate cancer one week ago.
Additionally in that week he had difficulty with ambulation and a fall and difficulty getting up.
He notes urinary incontinence that he says is due to inability to get to the bathroom but also diarrhea with incontinence.
This appears relatively new for him but he notes he is able to control his sphincter function and incontinence is in the setting of decreased ability to ambulate.
He notes increased productive cough (yellow sputum) for 3+ days PTA which is not normal per him, but denies episodes of coughing or choking on foods.
He was tranferred to the ICU where he received 2 uPRBC's and was continued on vanco/zosyn for pneumonia (by CT scan).
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: -presented [**12-19**] with diffuse bony pain (cervical, lumbar, lower exremity) and weight loss (25-30 lbs).
-Prostate biopsy=[**Doctor Last Name **] 5+4 prostatic adenocarcinoma -Bone marrow biopsy=metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma associated with extensive fibrosis.
-[**2142-5-10**]: Symptoms from disease progression: worsening bilateral pelvic bone pain and left shoulder pain.
Chronic pancreatitis.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.6, P 101, BP 93/58, RR 16, O2 sat 100% on 2L Gen: Cachectic, comfortable, speaking slowly in full sentences LN: HEENT: MMM, PERRL, EOMI CV: RRR, no m/r/g Chest: coarse crackles on right posteriorly Abd: soft, nt, +bs Ext: no c/c/e Neuro: grossly intact, AAOx3 Guiac +   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: 139  109  25 ------------<100 4.5  20  1.0 estGFR: >75 (click for details) Ca: 7.4 Mg: 1.4 P: 2.5 .
Imaging: Imaging: CXR [**6-5**]: 1) Increased opacity in the right lower lobe is consistent with a pneumonic consolidation.
2) Diffuse sclerotic osseous metastasis.
Abd Film [**6-5**]: 1) Nonspecific prominent loop of small bowel is noted, which is likely unchanged in configuration in comparison to the prior study.
No other dilated loops of bowel.
2) Diffuse osseous sclerotic metastases.
3) Coarse calcification in the epigastric region from chronic pancreatitis .
Bone scan: Widespread metastatic bony disease.
Scattered small diffuse retroperitoneal adenopathy and right iliac adenopathy.
No regions meet criteria to be considered target lesions.
Diffuse bony metastatic disease primarily sclerotic in origin.
Findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis and a probable simple pancreatic pseudocyst involving the pancreatic head.
CXR [**2142-6-6**]: Multilobar pneumonia in the right lower lung has improved since [**6-5**].
Extensive blastic metastatic prostate carcinoma is seen in the chest cage.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 58 yo man with diffusely metastatic prostate cancer presenting with anemia, hypotension, and pneumonia.
Likely secondary to hypovolemia with acute anemia, improved with IVF/transfussion, though in clinic notes documented baseline 83-116 SBP.
Not likely to be adrenal insufficiency given response to treatment.
Retic inappropriately low, not surprising given his known fibrosis of bone marrow with metastatic prostate CA.
Coags mildly elevated PT/INR.
H/O melena and guaiac positive in the icu (despite being negative in ED) suggests GIB contributing to acute change.
3 Pneumonia: CXR consistent with pneumonia, likely aspiration given distribution but as living in long-term care facility warrants treatment as HAP.
4 Metastatic Prostate cancer: s/p taxotere recently, held prednisone given potential GIB but restarted [**6-8**] since hct stable, continue morphine sulfate slow release and vicodin prn for pain as outpatient pain regimen.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic prostate cancer, anemia, pneumonia.
Chronic pancreatitis.
Please notify your primary care doctor or Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] if you experience fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, worsening cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, black or tarry stools, dizziness, lightheadedness or any symptoms that concern you.
