Pt found to be guiaic positive and underwent colonoscopy which showed diverticulosis, and EGD which showed stomach erythema.
During her hospitalization she had a small CVA, right frontal-parietal region, and was also shown to have previous cerebellar stroke by MR.
This was thought to be due to Atrial fibrillation, although the patient was thrombocytotic secondary to her CML.
She was initially treated with a heparin gtt, with plans to restart coumadin; however, she became coagulopathic and developed mucosal bleeding.
Heparin was discontinued and coumadin never started due to continued epistaxis.
The patient became acutely hypotensive and hypoxic and was transferred to the ICU for further care.
CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of heart failure with EF 70%.
She was also treated with 8 days Vancomycin/Zosyn for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
