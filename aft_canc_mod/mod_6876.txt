History of Present Illness: 74 year old female with known aortic valve stenosis whoe developed chest pain recently with exertion.
Follow-up echocardiogram revealed progression of her aortic stenosis with now higher gradients and a smaller aortic valve area.
Given the progression of her aortic stenosis and new finding of coronary artery disease, she is being admitted today for pretesting/heparin with plans for AVR/CABG in AM.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate hypokinesis of the distal anterior, anterolateral, anteroseptal, apical and mid septal walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 0.5 cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The left ventricle displays a septal "bounce" consistent with ventricular pacing.
There is some distal anteroseptal dyskinesis they may also be due to ventricular pacing.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position.
No aortic regurgiation is seen.
