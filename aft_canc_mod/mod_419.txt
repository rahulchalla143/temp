TRACING #1  Brief Hospital Course: 83-year-old female with a history of high grade urothelial bladder cancer with invasion s/p resection [**2190-8-3**], hypertension, GERD, anxiety, and depression referred in from oncology clinic due to elevated WBC, admitted for gram-negative rod bacteremia transferred to the ICU after a PMVT arrest.
#VT ARREST: The patient developed polymorphic VT associated with prolonged QT interval with arrest on the floor on [**2190-8-28**].
She had another episode of polymorphic VT in the ICU with loss of pulse that returned after brief administration of chest compressions.
The patient appeared to have a boarder line prolonged QTc on admission suggesting a possible channelopathy, her decline into VT arrest was likely to multiple hits to her QTc from medications, poor nutrition and urosepsis.
Patient was discharged with a small hematoma at the surgical site which did not show signs of acute bleeding and to follow up in device clinic in one week's time.
#UROSEPSIS / GNR BACTEREMIA: Patient presented to the ED with fever, leukocytosis and tachypnea with urine culture growing >100,000 E.Coli.
Patient was adequately fluid resuscitated and initially treated with cefepime as no history of ESBL cultures per OMR.
Sequent culture data grew a pan sensitive e coli and patient was switched to amoxicillin.
As patient had a foreign body pace maker installed while having SIRS physiology patient was discharged on a 2 week course of ampicillin to prevent colonization.
#  Acute Renal Failure:  Patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine on admission to 1.9 this was felt to be of pre-renal etiology given urine electrolytes in the setting of her VT arrest and hypotension.
#BLADDER CA: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] (urology) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (onc) and has been told that the tumor is invading the muscle and at her last visit they discussed two options one being total radical cystectomy with creation of anileal conduit versus chemo and radiation therapy.
#ANEMIA: Patient was noted to have a diminished hematocrit on admission and no evidence of GI bleed on history or exam.
Patient was noted to have substantial hematuria felt secondary to her invasive bladder cancer which likely accounted for her low crit.
This was monitored and was stable while an inpatient requiring no transfusions or iron supplementation.
Once extubated patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow with no evidence of aspiration and the patient was encouraged to eat and drink to her comfort.
#HTN: As patient was hypotensive on admission her antihypertensives were initially held, but restarted, save lisinopril, prior to discharge.
-held the patient's lisinopril on discharge given acute renal failure -patient discharged on a 14 day course of amoxicillin   Medications on Admission: patient reports having stopped all meds because of dysphagia since her surgery   Discharge Medications: 1.
Disp:*28 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis Ventricular tachycaridia s/p internal cardiac defibrillator implantation Hypertension Urethral bladder cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had an infection in your blood and in your urine and needed intravenous antibiotics to treat this.
An internal defibrillator was placed that will be able to shock you internally if you have the ventricular tachycardia again.
If your ICD fires, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 2227**].
You did not have a heart attack during this episode.
The infection in your blood and urine will be treated with an antibiotic for two weeks.
