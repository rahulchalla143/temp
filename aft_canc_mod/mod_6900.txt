RLL pneumonia and UTI.
[**12-12**]) the patient was very lethargic and slept most of the day.
She could sit at the edge of the bed but her "legs were like a rag doll's," and she was unable to stand.
The patient and her husband had a negative experience with a neurologist at [**Hospital1 **], and they love their GI surgeon here at [**Hospital1 18**] and requested transfer for further evaluation.
The patient underwent MRI of her T and L spine without note of cord compression at the OSH prior to transfer.
She was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycine for RLL pneumonia and also treated for E. Coli UTI.
She denies any pain or discomfort at present.

She rapidly worsened with total body weakness prompting hospitalization at [**Hospital **] Hospital where she was plasmapheresed x 5 days.
Residual pins and needles sensation in the hands and feet and residual BLE weakness.
She thought she might have had a recurrence a few years ago (felt weak for 2 days), but these symptoms resolved on their own."

She follows simple commands, but is perseverative "open your eyes" but difficulty with "show me two fingers on your left hand"  CN- smell not tested, pupils 4mm-->3mm and sluggish to light bilaterally, EOM's are full, no nystagmus.
Funduscopic exam could not be performed due pt uncooperativeness with exam (pulled eyes shut forcibly).
unable to perform detailed sensory testing due to mental status.
Pertinent Results: CHEST RADIOGRAPH AP ([**2116-12-13**]): Mild cardiomegaly.
No vascular engorgement.
No lung consolidation or mass.
No pleural effusion.
No evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, of mass effect.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is most sensitive for evaluation of intracranial metastatic disease.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS ([**2116-12-15**]): No DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Some costophrenic angle filling posteriorly suggests small pleural effusions.
Specifically, no evidence of acute pneumonia.

NeuroICU course: Her neurologic examination on admission was notable for marked inattention, which further limited detailed motor and sensory testing; however, she was able to hold her legs antigravity.
Her inattention was thought to be due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy, likely due to her underlying pneumonia and UTI.
It was determined that GBS was not the cause of her symptoms, and her encephalopathy improved by the second day (oriented to person, place, and date).
Head CT showed no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, of mass effect.
Her PNA and UTI were treated with CTX and azithromycin.
The medicine team was consulted for her PNA and UTI, and the patient was called out to the medicine floor with neurology following.
As above, the patient's weakness was thought to be secondary toxic metabolic encephalopathy; she continued to improve on antibiotics for treatment of UTI and community acquired pneumonia.
Leukcytosis resolved.
Of note, patient has history of COPD with baseline sats in the low 90's.
On day of discharge, patient was satting at baseline at rest but requiring oxygen (1 to 2 liters) with ambulation.
Labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
- Hyperglycemia:  Patient was started on metformin for persistently elevated blood glucose.
- Nutrition:  Patient required Dobhoff for short duration in neuroICU.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Medical Center - [**Hospital1 3597**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Toxic metabolic encephalopathy secondary to urinary tract infection, community acquired pneumonia] - Hyperglycemia  Secondary: - History of [**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] - Pancreatic cancer - Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
You were initially admitted by the neurology team, who felt that your weakness was due to an infection in your bladder or lungs.
You were treated with antibiotics for both of these infections and your weakness improved.
We added a new medication, Metformin, for better control of your blood glucose.
Please call your physician or return to the emergency department for any worsening weakness, shortness of breath, fevers, or for any other concerns.
