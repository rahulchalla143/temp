<b>Radiologic Data: CXR [**10-3**]:  Mild cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, but no evidence for pneumonia.
PFTs [**4-/2112**]: Reduced FVC (72%) and Dsb (63%) with low-normal TLC suggests a restrictive process.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated because of the lack of a tricusped regurgitation jet.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo F with multiple myeloma on Thalidomide and Decadron who presents with progressive DOE x 6 weeks, hypoxia, hypotension, and ARF.
Her physical exam was unremarkable for CHF - she had no peripheral edema, no JVD and her lungs were clear bilaterally.
Given her hypoxia, elevated A-a gradient (297), history of multiple myeloma and her treatment with Thalidomide and Decadron (known to be thrombogenic and pt.
Her elevated creatinine did not allow for a CTA so a VQ scan was performed and was highly suspcious for a PE with multiple perfusion deficits.
Additionally, an echo showed depressed RV function and evidence of RV hypertrophy and LE dopplers showed a DVT in her right popliteal artery.
The evidence of RV hypertrophy and multiple VQ mismatches suggested an acute and chronic thromboembolic disease.
As the patient had transient risk factors for DVT/PE (i.e.
recent long car ride and thalidomide), will anticipate ~6 months of anticoagulation with INR [**3-4**].
There is no reported history of CAD and no EKG changes, but the patient has hyperlipidemia, HTN, and hyperglycemia.
She also has a history of chronic LE edema for which she takes Lasix and Triamterine as an outpatient.
However, on exam her lung exam was unremarkable and she had no peripheral edema.
On transfer to BMT, she was restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix since she had some trace LE edema and b/l pulmonary crackles.
She was initially treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of sepsis given the high lactate.
Blood and urine cultures are still pending, but show no growth.
Her BP meds (Diltiazem and Lisinopril) were held, but a Metoprolol 12.5 was started on [**10-5**] because her blood pressure had improved and because of her cardiac risk factors.
There was no bandemia and no signs of infection.
4 Acute Renal Failure: Admission Cr was 3.4 and her baseline Cr is 1.1.
All diuretics were held as was Metformin for concern of lactic acidosis in the setting of ARF.
9 FEN: low Na diabetic renal diet.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pulmonary Embolism Deep Venous Thrombosis Acute Renal Failure .
Discharge Instructions: If you develop any concerning symptoms particularly shortness of breath, chest pain, worsening leg swelling, or signs of severe bleeding, seek medical care.
