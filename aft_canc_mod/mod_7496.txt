Despite multiple attempts to have patient stay for close monitoring and paracentesis after EGD, the patient decided to leave AMA.
EGD performed in the MICU and patient did not have any active bleeding.
She continued to have varices, portal gastropathy, and a known gastric ulcer.
It was felt her bleeding was likely from the portal gastropathy in setting of recent ETOH use.
The patient continued to have melana and was strongly encouraged to stay for close monitoring, but the patient left AMA from the MICU despite knowing the risk of re-bleeding and death.
# ETOH Abuse: No signs of withdrawal.
You were given two units of blood and the gastroenterologists performed and endoscopy and this showed an ulcer in the stomach, enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus called varices, and changes in the stomach secondary to elevated blood pressures in your gut.
These findings are all secondary to your cirrhosis.
