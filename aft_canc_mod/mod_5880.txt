Patient's carcinoid tumor was first diagnosed seven years ago during a small bowel resection for a small bowel obstruction.
She has had persisting diarrhea, which is being treated with Sandostatin and cutaneous flushing.
Approximately 3-5 weeks prior to admission, patient started developing a productive cough, and initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
Bronchoscopy demonstrated no tracheal lesions.
The CT scan at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital showed an area of necrosis in the right lower lobe of the lung and HIDA scan was performed to assess for a possible biliary bronchial fistula.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2191-2-25**], for further treatment.
ALLERGIES:  Patient reports no known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon her transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], the report on the HIDA scan appeared to suggest biliary bronchial fistula.
There was no visualized bronchial fistula seen on the exam.
However, patient was having bilious sputum during the procedure.
Patient developed respiratory difficulty and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on [**2191-3-2**], where she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Patient underwent a CT-guided drainage of the right pleural effusion on [**2191-3-3**], with return of approximately 200 cc of bilious fluid in chest tube one and 100 cc in chest tube two.
Patient also developed a urinary tract infection with Enterococcus and was being treated appropriately.
Patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy on [**2191-3-15**], which showed a persistent small fistula in the right lower lobe bronchus with bile spilling into the airway.
Postoperatively, patient received an epidural for pain control and was started on Vancomycin in addition to meropenem for broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage until the operative cultures came back.
The intraoperative culture came back with C. albicans and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and patient was started on linezolid.
She had persistent leak in her chest tube, which required a prolonged treatment, and on discharge patient has one chest tube which is connected to a Heimlich valve.
Metastatic carcinoid disease status post radiofrequency    ablation with right lower lobe methicillin-resistant    Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia complicated by biliary    bronchial fistula.
Right lower lobe pneumonia/necrosis with persisting air    leak.
