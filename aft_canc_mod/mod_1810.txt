On POD #2 he transferred to the floor and overnight had an episode of atrial fibrillation and responded to IV beta-blockers.
On POD #4 on chest x-ray a right lower lobe effusion was noted and underwent Ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic right-sided thoracentesis for removal of 600 mL of serosanguineous.
On POD #6 he continued to have episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibulation and was V-paced.
Since he had multiple episodes of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation they recommended anticoagulation which Coumadin was started.
His Foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.
