Admission Date:  [**2113-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, intraperitoneal bleed from ruptured hepatoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and celiac arteriogram, supra selective left hepatic artery catheterization with microsphere embolization of bleeding arterial branch.
Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation large amount of intra-abdominal blood and hematoma, cautery of right hepatic lobe ruptured hepatoma  3.
Tracheostomy  History of Present Illness: 78 F with history of hepatic cirrhosis of unclear etiology with history of shunt, TIAs, HTN, presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with abdominal pain and hypotension and tachycardia.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 3x3 cm right lobe hepatic mass with 1.4 cm vascular aneurysm and active extravasation of blood into peritoneum and a large amount of blood in peritoneum.
Patient subsequently decompensated and became progressively more tachycardic and hypotensive.
Past Medical History: Hepatic cirrhosis s/p operative shuntting at [**Hospital1 2025**] approximately 12 years ago (per husband), HTN, TIAs/stroke with residual left sided paralysis, C.diff colitis, GERD, hearing loss, macular degeneration.
Physical Exam: The patient has passed away  Pertinent Results: EEG  FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Several bursts of mixed theta and delta frequency slowing were noted in a generalized distribution.
A superimposed faster beta rhythm was also noted in a generalized distribution.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to frequent bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing in the setting of a slow and  disorganized backgroung suggestive of a widespread encephalopathy consistent with bilateral subcortical or deeper midline dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy.
No electrographic seizures were noted.
The degree and evolution of the encephalopathy is uncertain and should be correlated with clinical exam or if follow up EEG if necessary.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-11-22**] 4:49 PM  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old woman with abnormal EEG, altered mental status, vent dependent REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for structural cause of altered mental status CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 79-year-old woman with abnormal EEG, altered mental status, please evaluate for obstructive causes of altered mental status.
FINDINGS: There is evidence of low signal with susceptibility artificat from chronic blood products at the right basal ganglia extending into the temporal lobes along the sulci.
There is also associated dilation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ventricle.
This could be from chronic hemorrhage in that area with associated volume loss of the temporal lobe.
There are bilateral hyperintensities noted in the region of basal ganglia in the pre-gadolinium T1-weighted images, features, usually associated with hepatic insufficiency.
Periventricular white matter hyperintensity suggestive of chronic microangiopathic ischemic disease is noted.
There is mild prominence of the ventricles and the sulci suggestive of age related atrophic changes.
There are no areas of abnormal enhancement or acute hemorrhage, masses, mass effect or midline shift.
No diffusion abnormalities are noted.
No osseous or soft tissue abnormalities are noted.
IMPRESSION: Areas of susceptibility artifact in the right basal ganglia suggestive of chronic right basal ganglia hemorrhage.
No acute intracranial process or hemorrhage or mass effect.
Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and celiac arteriogram, supra selective left hepatic artery catheterization with microsphere embolization of bleeding arterial branch.
She continued to require resuscitation and had rising intraabdominal pressures.
She was taken emergently for exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of large amount of intra-abdominal blood/hematoma, cautery of right hepatic lobe ruptured hepatoma.
Over the next several days her hematocrit stabilized and acidemia improved.
Because of concern for aspiration a Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained on [**11-6**] and showed "silent" aspiration with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia.
ENT service was consulted and their exam showed senechii and dried blood with some areas of erosion overlying the mucosa.
She had no further bleeding from her nasopharynx.
On POD 4 a bedside swallowing consult was obtained and patient was found to be "silently aspirating" and had severe dysphagia.
On POD 7 patient became more confused and less responsive.
A CT scan of her head was obtained ( [**2113-11-9**]) and showed no acute pathology.
Lactulose was started for an elevated ammonia level.
On [**11-11**] patient became progressively hypoxic with increased work of breathing and was re-intubated.
Over the following several days she developed a leukocytosis and fevers.
Blood, sputum, urine and line cultures were sent and eventually returned with MRSA from her sputum as well as blood.
Given her failure to wean off of ventilatory support, a tracheostomy was placed on [**11-17**].
The patient remained intermittently agitated without significant change in neurological status and unable to be weaned off of the vent.
