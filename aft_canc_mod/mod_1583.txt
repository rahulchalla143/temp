[**2120-1-18**] Chest Xray: Bibasilar pneumonia.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 year old female with history of chronic hepatitis c, seizure disorder, brain hemangiomas admitted for hypotension, acute hepatitis, and acute renal failure.
Hypotension/Shock:  She initially presented to the ED with hypotension that was responsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation.
It was felt that she had hypovolemic shock.
The etiology of the hypovolemia was not entirely clear, but possibilities include toxic ingestion, infectious process, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency.
Pneumonia: She presented with history of cough and fatigue, and her initial chest xray on admission showed no acute process.
A chest xray the day after admission showed bibasilar pneumonia.
She was started on levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia.
She was seen by the endocrinology team who did not feel that her presentation was related to her hypothyroidism, despite an elevated TSH to 7.5.
Transaminitis:  She had transaminitis on admission that was felt to be related to hypotension.
She was negative for acute EBV and other viral studies were pending (HIV, CMV, or Hep A, B, D, or E).
Acute renal failure:  Given her BUN to Crt ratio, granular and hyaline casts on sediment and picture of hypovolemia on presentation, her acute renal failure was most likely prerenal.
Unlikely UTI/Pyelonephritis:  She had a urinalysis consistent with a UTI on admission and was treated with levofloxacin as above.
No urinary symptoms and this seemed unlikely  #.
She denied any toxic ingestion or overdose.
