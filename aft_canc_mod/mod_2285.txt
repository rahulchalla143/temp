Admission Date:  [**2160-10-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-11-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-2-20**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 44935**] is a 68-year-old primarily Russian-speaking female who has been diagnosed with myeloproliferative disorder several years ago.
The patient's comorbidities included coronary artery disease (with a myocardial infarction in [**2153**]) as well as a history of hypertension.
In addition, she had a left-sided nephrectomy and breast carcinoma with a left-sided mastectomy in [**2148**].
The patient presented to General Surgery for a possible surgical solution of her splenomegaly due to her myeloproliferative disorder.
The estimated blood loss was approximately 600 cc, and the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells.
Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2153**].
Left-sided mastectomy for breast carcinoma in [**2148**].
Status post left-sided nephrectomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
No signs of lymphadenopathy.
No carotid bruits were detected.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
An enlarged spleen extending below the umbilicus was palpable in the left upper quadrant.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the history of myeloproliferative disorder and significant splenomegaly, a surgical intervention was undertaken.
The procedure was without any complications with an estimated blood loss of approximately 600 cc.
Her pain was adequately controlled.
The patient maintained a low-grade fever and remained somewhat tachycardic.
She was further resuscitated with fluids given her low urine output.
Given the symptoms of nausea, a KUB of the abdomen was obtained which showed diffuse dilatation of the small bowel and colon; consistent with postoperative ileus.
Intraoperatively, the patient was found to be coagulopathic, but no discrete source of the bleed was found.
Several blood cultures were taken which showed no growth.
An electrocardiogram performed at the time showed a sinus rhythm, and no change compared to the baseline tracing available.
Her wound remained clean, dry, and intact.
There was some abdominal distention noted.
Given the persistent elevated temperatures and distended abdomen, a computed tomography of the abdomen was performed on [**2160-10-25**].
There was no evidence of abscess.
However, diffuse ascites were noted.
In addition, bilateral pleural effusions were noted; which were associated with atelectasis at both lung bases.
Cultures were obtained from the fluid which showed no microorganisms; only polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
The patient was consequently placed on Unasyn for empiric coverage.
The patient also had several urine cultures obtained which grew Escherichia coli as well as Corynebacterium species.
In addition, the Renal Service was consulted given the ascites; with the specific question of whether ascites were from a renal etiology and also the significance of proteinuria which was noted on routine urinalysis.
In addition, the CAT scan that was obtained on [**2160-10-25**] showed evidence of portal vein thrombosis which was confirmed by the ultrasound.
It was thought that the significant ascites that seemed to reaccumulate after therapeutic paracenteses were due to the portal vein thrombosis and not renal failure.
On [**2160-10-27**], the patient appeared to have a relatively sudden onset of chest discomfort as well as tachypnea.
There was no nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes, and her lung scan was low probability of any pulmonary embolism.
A venous ultrasound of the lower extremities was also negative for any clots.
Her electrocardiogram showed no changes.
However, the chest x-ray did show left lower lobe consolidation.
Her liver function tests were elevated; consistent with portal vein thrombosis seen on the CAT scan and ultrasound.
The Hematology/Oncology Service was consulted given the elevated white blood cell count and platelets.
In addition, the patient underwent one round of plasmapheresis which she tolerated well.
The Renal Service continued to follow the patient, and they thought that her proteinuria was secondary to a nephrotic syndrome.
The patient continued to improve, and her ascites decreased significantly toward the end of her hospitalization.
While the patient was on neutropenic precautions; secondary to a low white blood cell count, she was maintained on cefepime intravenously which was discontinued when the neutropenic precautions were removed.
Her lower extremity edema decreased significantly as well.
Status post open splenectomy; complicated by intra-abdominal bleed, status post re-exploration and aspiration of intra-abdominal bleed.
Coronary artery disease.
The INR goal is approximately 2.5; but one needs to be careful given the history of coagulopathy with this patient.
