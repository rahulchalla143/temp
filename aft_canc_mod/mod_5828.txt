HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old male, who was in his usual state of health until [**2149-1-7**], when he developed dysarthria and right arm sensory loss, at which time he was admitted [**Hospital6 1129**] and found to have multiple embolic frontal lobe strokes.
Two weeks after discharge from [**Hospital6 1129**], he was admitted to an outside hospital in early [**2149-2-7**] with severe anemia with the hematocrit of 23.
On endoscopy, he was found to have a gastric ulcer.
The patient had inferior myocardial infarction with peak CK of 1000 in the setting of this GI bleed and anemia.
On [**2149-3-4**], the patient was re-admitted to [**Hospital6 1129**] with chest pain radiating to his left arm with diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and edema.
The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
Catheterization at that time showed 100% chronic occlusion of his left circumflex with collaterals and 80% nondominant PDA lesion.
On echocardiogram, the patient was noted to have an EF of 45% to 55%, moderate MR, mild AR and inferior akinesis.
The patient also experience an eight-beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Colonoscopy at that time revealed polyps with tubular adenoma, which was excised.
The patient was also treated with antibiotics for H. pylori.
Today, on the day of admission, the patient was receiving a blood transfusion for a hematocrit of 25 down from 30, when he developed chest pain and shortness of breath at approximately 3:30 p.m.
The EKG reportedly had EKG changes.
EKG in the ER showed some ST changes inferiorly.
Blood pressure subsequently increased to a systolic in the 120s and the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for possible MI/GI bleed.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied cough, nausea, vomiting, diuresis, bright red blood per rectum or melena.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times two with known 100% left circumflex lesion with collaterals and 80% PDA lesion, which had been medically managed.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% to 50%.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
History of severe GI bleed with peptic ulcer disease status post H. pylori treatment and colonic polyps, status post removal.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
CHEST:  Bilateral rales at the bases, no wheezing.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm S1 and S2 normal, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
ABDOMEN:  Normoactive bowel sounds, mild epigastric tenderness, no guarding, no rebound, guaiac positive as per the emergency room with brown stool.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 1+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Q-waves in 2, 3, AVF; .5-mm to 1-mm ST elevations in 2, 3, and AVF; 1-mm ST elevations in V1 through V3; biphasic Ts in 2, 3, and AVF; LVH by voltage criteria, and good R-wave progression.
Chest x-ray:  PA and lateral showed good inspiration, questionable mild congestive heart failure versus retrocardiac opacity.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 69-year-old male with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an EF of 45%, history of GI bleed, history of cerebrovascular accidents, who presents to [**Hospital1 69**] as a transfer from [**Hospital3 4419**] with chest pain in the setting of a dropping hematocrit.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes negative times three.
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of chest pain, which were relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin and not noted to have any EKG changes associated with these episodes of chest pain.
The patient underwent stress test on [**2149-3-25**], which showed findings consistent with a likely fixed perfusion defect in the inferior wall, ejection fraction of 39%, global hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall.
PUMP:  The patient was noted to be mild congestive heart failure and was diuresed gently initially on admission to the Coronary Care Unit.
For the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the patient was not noted to be in congestive heart failure and only given Lasix at the time of transfusion.
RHYTHM:  The patient was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay at [**Hospital1 188**] and there were no active issues.
The findings from the endoscopy included moderate-to-severe distal esophagitis, erosions at the GE junction and erosions in the fundus of the stomach.
HEMATOLOGY:  As above, the patient, at [**Hospital3 7558**], was noted to have a decreasing hematocrit from a value of 30 down to a low of 22 at the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient received one unit of packed cells at an outside hospital at the time he began to experience chest pain.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, the patient was noted to have a persistently decreasing hematocrit requiring periodic transfusions.
Based on the thrombocytopenia and slightly elevation coagulation laboratory work, it was the recommendations of the hematology team to send off a DSE panel, the findings of which were that the patient had an elevated D-dimer and fibrin-split products in the setting of thrombocytopenia and elevated coagulation laboratory work.
It was thought that the patient was in mild DIC possibly secondary to infection versus malignancy.
At this time, the patient was noted to have an elevated WBC of 24.3, and had spiked a temperature to 101.5.
However, no clear etiology of infection was present at that time.
Based on concern for a possible occult malignancy, CT of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with the following findings: Bilateral adrenal masses, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy; complex lesion of the left kidney, which is likely infarction; multiple lesions within the liver, which are likely cystic; small lobulated left pleural effusion; and bilateral DVTs.
In addition, further recommendations of the oncology and radiology team that a CT of the chest be performed to also rule out a lung cancer primary with metastatic disease to the adrenals.
VASCULAR:  As from the CT showing bilateral DVTs, lower extremity Dopplers were obtained, the finding of which included a DVT of the left popliteal vein extending into the mid calf, but no evidence of a DVT in the common or the superficial femoral veins.
Based on this finding and the inability to anticoagulate in light of a GI bleed and decreasing hematocrit, it was decided that the patient should receive an IVC filter.
The patient received [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter placed by interventional radiology on [**2149-3-31**], without complication.
No clear source of infection was identified and antibiotics were deferred.
The patient remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospital course and leukocytosis improved to a value of 12 at the time of discharge.
PULMONARY:  The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
From the records from the outside hospital the patient had recently been on a steroid taper for a recent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, however, the patient did not manifest any such symptoms and thus there was no requirement of systemic steroids.
Coronary artery disease status post MI times two.
History of severe GI bleed with peptic ulcer disease and colonic polyps.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Left popliteal deep venous thrombosis.
