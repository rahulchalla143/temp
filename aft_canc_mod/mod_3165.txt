Admission Date:  [**2138-12-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-12-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-8-9**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old woman who was transferred from the MICU after a rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement in her left main stem bronchus on [**2138-12-16**] for a near total occlusion due to adenocarcinoma.
The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2136-11-30**].
Over the past several weeks, she has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response; she was started on digoxin, Diltiazem, and flecainide.
During her latest admission at [**Last Name (LF) 1562**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abnormal V/Q scan prompted a CT scan, which revealed a soft tissue mass compressing the left main stem bronchus.
She received bronchoscopy on [**2138-12-13**] which revealed the mass occluding 90% of the bronchus.
Cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
On the night of admission, the patient had an increased oxygen requirement, requiring a nonrebreather.
Chest x-ray and CT were concerning for postobstructive pneumonia, right upper lobe bronchus occlusion, lymphangitic spread of the cancer.
A Cardiology consult recommended Amiodarone and long-term warfarin for the atrial fibrillation with discontinuation of the flecainide.
The patient was started on clindamycin and levofloxacin for possible postobstructive pneumonia.
A bronchoscopy with stent placement was performed on [**2138-12-16**] without complications.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of positive PPD with negative AFB on bronchoscopy.
History of thyroid surgery.
Brimonidine ophthalmic solution.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to shrimp.
Neck:  Without cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Neurologic:  Alert, mentating well, no gross focal deficits.
X-ray post stent revealed significant re-expansion of the left lung, resolution of consolidation and infiltrates in the left lower lobe, lingula with patchy infiltrates in the right lung.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the MICU and continued on her medications for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation.
Telemetry monitoring after this procedure revealed intermittent periods of sinus rhythm with atrial fibrillation.
The patient and her husband expressed a desire to be transferred back to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment for her lung cancer.
However, the patient was not felt to be a good candidate for transfer due to her persistent hypoxemia.
She underwent debulking of the tumor and replacement of the stent in a prolonged and difficult procedure.
On the morning of [**2138-12-24**], the patient developed acute respiratory decompensation with a PA02 of 43 on a face mask.
She reverted to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Throughout this time, the patient was conscious and mentating well and she reiterated her desire not to be intubated or to receive positive pressure ventilation.
She understood that she would most likely go into respiratory fatigue and failure in her current status without these interventions.
