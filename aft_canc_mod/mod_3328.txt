Admission Date:  [**2197-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-8-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress, hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nasogastric Tube Left elbow joint aspiration  History of Present Illness: Pt.
is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from NH with hypoxia of 84% RA --> 97% 15L after being noted by nursing staff to be gurgling as well as nasal congestion and drainage early in the morning.
Pt was given combivent nebs at the NH and at the time was noted to be afebrile with temp of 98F, P 100, RR 20, BP 136/68.
Later in the afternoon, the patient was noted to have some difficulty breathing, and at that time was found to be 84% on RA.
CXR: showed a possible LLL pna, and a chest CTA was negative for PE, but did show a L sided consolidation.
Of note, the patient had been recieving Penicillin VK 250mg po QID since [**7-6**] following a recent dental procedure.

?F) HR: 111 (111 - 116) bpm BP: 156/85(104) {149/58(81) - 156/85(104)} mmHg RR: 21 (16 - 21) insp/min SpO2: 97% Heart rhythm: ST (Sinus Tachycardia) Height: 51 Inch  General Appearance: No acute distress, Thin Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, Poor dentition Lymphatic: Cervical WNL Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), No murmurs, gallops, or rubs Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Not assessed), (Left DP pulse: Not assessed) Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Percussion: No(t) Resonant : ), (Breath Sounds: No(t) Clear : , Rhonchorous: bilateral rhonchi throughout all lung fields with no wheezing), Significant upper airway secretions and gurgling Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, reducible ventral hernia Extremities: Right: 1+, Left: 1+ Musculoskeletal: Muscle wasting, Thin lower extremeties with decreased bulk Skin:  Warm Neurologic: Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Oriented (to): self, Movement: Purposeful, Tone: Not assessed, Somnolent but easily arousable, able to follow simple commands and answer questions   Pertinent Results: [**2197-7-16**] [**Year (4 digits) 5283**] Ultrasound <br> IMPRESSION: Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound.
No intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
4 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.
Age-related diffuse cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement, stable since [**2196-7-6**].
Bilateral lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia and small vessel ischemic disease.
Periodontoid pannus in keeping with possible rheumatoid arthritis or pseudogout.
<br> [**2197-7-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac alveolar opacity associated with left small pleural effusion is new, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Less marked right basal alveolar opacity increased, could be due to atelectasis, multifocal aspiration or pneumonia.
There is no right pleural effusion.
There is no vascular congestion.
There is no evidence of central lymphadenopathy.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
No radiographic findings to suggest interval aspiration.
Persistent consolidation and atelectasis involving the majority of the left lower lobe.
The patency of the left lower lobe bronchus is in question, and a small obstructing mass cannot be excluded.
New small region of consolidation in the right lower lobe.
This may be due to aspiration or atelectasis.
Mild right lower lobe bronchiectasis.
Stable small right upper lobe nodule.
A few borderline mediastinal lymph nodes.
Small calcified granuloma in the spleen.
Bilateral non-obstructing nephrolithiasis.
Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative changes.
<br> [**2197-7-29**] BILAT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND IMPRESSION: Thrombosis involving the left cephalic and basilic veins.
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left upper extremity.
There is no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities, and no evidence of pleural effusion.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal, there is no evidence of overhydration.
<br> PNEUMONIA: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.
CTA with L lower lobe consolidation correlates with CXR at presentation.
Patient never experienced hypotension related to pneumonia.
Initial sputum gram staining showed two morphologies of gram negative rods; however, there were never postive sputum cultures or blood cultures.
There was bilateral swelling, warmth, and erythema of the elbow joints noted on exam.
The joint aspirate had ~[**Numeric Identifier 7206**] WBCs and many positively birefringent rhomboid crytals.
This was thought to be consistent with a CPPD pseudogout inflammatory arthritis.
On exam, mucous membranes dry and clinical patient appears somewhat volume down.
CTA negative for PE, and tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying infection.
EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia in the MICU.
The patient's tachycardia eventually improved as his overall presentation improved with decreasing WBC count, treatment of pneumonia, treatment of pseudogout, and treatment of fungal UTI.
<br> DEMENTIA / ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Pt with known dementia; however, his sister reported that at baseline he was quite conversant and would frequently read medical journals and the [**Location (un) 86**] Globe.
A head CT on [**2197-7-17**] showed multiple lacunar infarcts and diffuse cerebral atrophy.
The patient became agitated and confused while in the MICU and this was controlled with Zyprexa initially.
<br> DIARRHEA / C DIFF TESTING: Patient developed soft liquid stools shortly after the initiation of colchicine and continued to have soft stools up to the day of discharge.
He also struggled with fecal incontinence and although this was most likely a function of the patient being unable to use the bathroom without help.
A rectal exam was performed on [**7-28**] to check for evidence of fecal impaction and the exam bore out that the patient had adequate rectal tone and there was only liquid stool in the rectal vault.
He was on oral vancomycin for 4 days for empiric treatment of c. diff in setting of persistent leukocytosis; however, this medication was discontinued on day of discharge.
<br> URINARY INCONTINENCE / UTI: Patient was incontinent of urine during the hospitalization and has an unknown baseline of urinary continence.
He did have a urine dipstick positive for WBCs as well as a urine culture positive for greater than 10^5 colonies of [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was treated with a three-day course of fluconazole prior to discharge.
<br> ELEVATED LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 5283**] u/s with no evidence of cholecystitis.
<br> THROMBOCYTOSIS: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with previous platelet counts.
Known history essential thrombocytosis; however, platelets were as high as 962 on [**2197-7-29**] presumably due to systemic inflammatory status in setting of ongoing CPPD psuedogout flare.
<br> NUTRITION: In the MICU, the patient initially failed two speech and swallow evaluations in the setting of altered mental status and poor respiratory function.
As his mental status improved, he was initiated on a liquid diet and tolerated that and was quickly advanced to a regular diet which he handled with ease aside from needing assistance to feed himself due to decreased arm strength from muscular deconditioning.

You were tested for C. diff and it was negative.
Please discuss with your PCP regarding starting Colchicine 0.6mg PO BID for maintenance of CPPD remission.
Please come back to the Emergency Room if you have fever, chills, joint pain, shortness of breath, markedly altered mental status, or chest pain.
