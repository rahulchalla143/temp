Transduodenal resection of a carcinoid tumor 2.
Retroperitoneal exploration.
He has recently been worked up for elevated liver function tests and there was a concern that he might have PFC.
An ERCP was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] recently and this revealed a normal biliary duct without obstruction.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] has been working up his liver function which showed mild fibrosis on a percutaneous biopsy.
On Dr.[**Name (NI) 62661**] ERCP, a 1 cm peri-ampullary duodenal lesion was identified and biopsied and this came back as a carcinoid tumor.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] met with them all in the office to discuss these findings and indicated to them that he had a malignant tumor that appeared to be confined at this point in time and amenable to local resection.
Among the risks included poor wound healing, bleeding and infection as well as the chance of leaks from any enteric openings as well as liver failure, postoperative hemorrhage or any other intra-abdominal infections.
They understood entirely that he had early Trials-8 cirrhosis and that he was at heightened risk for any operative intervention given this.
In addition to the preop workup, a CAT scan showed extensive lymphadenopathy throughout the upper abdomen.
An endoscopic ultrasound was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1 week prior to this operation and did not reveal any diagnostic information.
On [**2194-5-1**] he elective presented for a transduodenal resection of a carcinoid tumor, an open cholecystectomy, a liver biopsy as well as a lymph node biopsy.
Past Medical History: 1. renal failure and has been on dialysis three times a week.
2. cerebral palsy 3. liver fibrosis 4. retinitis pigmentosa with limited vision.
5. s/p back fixation 6. s/p left forearm AV graft for dialysis 7. s/p ERCP [**2194-3-13**]   Social History: Social history shows that he does not smoke tobacco nor does he imbibe alcohol, and he has had no known major environmental exposures.
Family History: He has a family history of pancreatic cancer with an aunt who suffered from this.
He has no family history of colorectal or melanoma cancers; however, he had a grandmother with breast cancer.
There is no history of pancreatitis in the family although his mother has had gallstones in the past.
His HEENT exam shows him to have no scleral icterus, no lymphadenopathy and moist membranes.
His cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
He has a dialysis shunt, which is functional with a palpable thrill in the left arm.
His skin exam is normal, and there is no evidence of any gross lymphadenopathy.

A minimal amount of atelectasis is seen at the right lung base.
Study is somewhat limited due to respiratory motion artifact.
No nodules or areas of septal thickening are identified.
Several small pretracheal and precarinal lymph nodes are seen.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, specifically no hilar lymphadenopathy is identified.
A small amount of layering soft tissue attenuation material consistent with mucus is seen in the upper trachea.
There are no pleural effusions.
The heart is slightly enlarged.
Dense coronary calcifications are identified within the left anterior descending coronary artery.
The kidneys are atrophic and contain numerous cysts consistent with polycystic disease, also stable in appearance.
Osseous structures demonstrate severe scoliosis.
There is a fixation rod seen within the left paraspinal musculature.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the spine.
[**2194-5-20**] Parathyroid U/S: The right thyroid lobe measures 2.1 x 1.8 x 3.0 cm.
Posterior to the mid portion of the right lobe, there is a 1.7 x 1.7 x 2.2 cm homogeneously hypoechoic structure with mass effect on the thyroid gland.
The structure has increased peripheral vascularity.
This most likely represents a parathyroid nodule and correlation with a sestamibi scan is recommended.
There is an additional 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 homogeneously hypoechoic nodule within the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
IMPRESSION: Hypoechoic nodule with peripheral increased vascularity posterior to the right thyroid lobe, most likely representing a parathyroid adenoma.
There were no complications, and he tolerated the procedure well.
He was monitored in the PACU overnight for pain control and observation of his blood pressure.
Over the next several days he had intermittent episode of desaturation to the 80's.
On POD 4, [**2194-5-5**] the patient returned from dialysis and was found to have peripheral cyanosis.
An O2 sat could not be obtained using a finger, toe, or forehead probe.
With anesthesia at the bedside, the decision was made to transfer the patient to the SICU.
A CXR showed question of a LLL infiltrate.
That evening he became febrile, pan cultures were sent, and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for presumptive pneumonia.
Sputum culture eventually grew Moraxella Catarrhalis and Haemophilus Influenzae.
His respiratory status remained tenuous with easy plugging.
He received PRBC transfusion on [**2194-5-7**] to help with a low blood pressure.
On [**2194-5-11**] he passed a spontaneous breathing trial and was extubated.
He also had an ultrasound of his RUE to rule out a DVT.
A swallow evaluation on [**2194-5-14**] showed the patient is positive for signs and symptoms of aspiration.
He underwent an ultrasound of his parathyroid gland to evaluate for potential nodules in light of his persistent hypercalcemia.
He was found to have a small nodule on his thyroid.
At the time of discharge, the patient needs to have outpatient follow up in order to evaluate this potential parathyroid nodule further.
He should have an outpatient nuclear medicine sestimibe scan of his parathyroid gland and follow up with his renal dialysis doctors.

Please notify them that you need to have an outpatient nuclear medicine sestimibi scan of your parathyroid gland for evaluation of hypercalcemia.
