She was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab the day prior to presenation after an 11 day hospitalization stay after she presented with urosepsis which was thought to be secondary to hydronephrosis from obstruction secondary to her tumor.
Her urine and blood cultures grew pan-sensitive E. Coli which was treated with ceftriaxone.
She received cytoxan, prednisone, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate.
She developed tumor lysis syndrome which was treated with high rates of IVF and diuresis to keep her urine output up.
She did not develop complications, and tumor lysis resolved.
The patient had a witnessed grand mal seizure at her nursing home.
Out of concern for altered mental status and inability to protect airway, the patient was intubated.
After sedating and paralyzing medications, the patient developed hypotension to 88/54 (and sbp to ?60's) and was started on a levophed drip for hypotension.
CT scan performed on [**2146-5-6**] revealed extensive ascites and peritoneal masses concerning for ovarian cancer.
Also, noted were bilateral ureteral irregularities close to obstruction, both on the left and the right.
CVA- no residual deficit R carotid artery occlusion Melanoma- (~[**2140**]) Left eye localized involvement, s/p proton beam tx without evidence of recurrence hypertension hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism gout .
No current tobacco, or illicits.
Family History: She has one cousin with history of breast cancer and daughter had renal cell cancer.
Appropriate placement of a new right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis (left greater than right) along with a persistent mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.
CT head No evidence of acute intracranial process.
New moderate bilateral pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
Small fluid accumulation around the liver and in the pelvis suggesting the presence of ascites.
There has been interval dcrease in the size of soft tissue infiltrate surrounding the course of both ureters into the pelvis.
No retroperitoneal or pelvic hematoma is seen.
Unchanged appearance of calcified splenic artery aneurysm measuring 16 mm.
The previously described soft tissue mass within the upper pelvis is less prominent and can not be well characterized since no oral or IV contrast has been used.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Seizure: Etiology of seizure remains unclear, most likely in setting of IT MTX.
No further workup at this point.
Was probably secondary to depressed CNS drive in the setting of seizure.
