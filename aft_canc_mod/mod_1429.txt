Admission Date:  [**2105-12-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-1-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-8-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  OMED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 34355**] is a 64 year old female with a history of adenocarcinoma with unknown primary with bone marrow involvement and metastases to spine, ribs and hips as well as a history of thrombocytopenia likely immune mediated, who presented to [**Hospital1 190**] in [**2105-8-29**], with headache, lethargy, ataxia and blurry vision in the setting of platelet counts of 23,000.
An MRI at that time revealed a subdural hematoma on the left side with mass affect and midline shift.
She was seen by Neurosurgery at that time and treated with platelet transfusions and high-dose steroids.
The hematoma was stable in follow-up imaging and the patient was discharged home with close monitoring.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**12-17**] until [**2105-12-19**], for increasing left lower extremity pain and weakness.
The plan was to treat this pain with outpatient XRT to the SI joint.
During this admission, the patient received multiple platelet transfusions and was given intravenous IG for two days.
At that time she was complaining of headache and she was noted to be increasingly somnolent and have some gait instability.
Her platelet count was found to be 16,000, therefore, she was admitted and a STAT head CT scan was done due the suspicion of worsening subdural bleed.
The head CT scan showed an increase in the left subdural hematoma with sub-falcine herniation.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, thought to     be breast cancer versus gastric cancer.
Peptic ulcer disease.
History of positive PPD as a child.
Thrombocytopenia and anemia thought to be immune     mediated.
Subdural hematoma first noted in [**2105-8-29**].
In general, she was somnolent but arousable to voice and in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
No facial droop.
There was left conjunctival ecchymosis.
Cardiovascular examination:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
No carotid bruits.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
It was felt that no immediate neurosurgical intervention was indicated and that the patient should be closely monitored.
The patient had multiple head CT scans monitoring the subdural hematoma during this time.
On [**2105-12-27**], due to the head CT scan findings and the patient's decreasing mental status, it was determined to place a subdural drain.
In the following day, there was minimal change in mental status and a repeat head CT scan showed no change in the subdural hematoma, the midline shift or herniation.
On [**12-29**], the patient was noted to have worsened mental status and also abnormal respirations and periods of apnea.
A repeat head CT scan after this procedure showed a decrease in the subdural hematoma.
It also noted a new posterior limb of the internal capsule infarction.
On the following day, the patient had a mild improvement in her mental status.
However, at this time, it was noted that there was increasing difficulty in controlling this patient's hypertension.
The patient's subdural drain had minimal output and was discontinued.
On [**1-1**], the patient was noted to have worsening mental status.
A family meeting was held at this time and it was determined not to pursue any further surgical interventions and therefore to not have any further head imaging as well.
The patient was completely unresponsive during the day of [**1-2**].
She continued to have low platelet counts and labile blood pressures.
