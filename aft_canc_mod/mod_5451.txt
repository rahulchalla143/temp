On arrival to the ED, he triggered for hypoxia to 88% which improved with supplemental oxygen.
A head CT was negative, CXR showed PNA in RLL and CT torso showed a loculated effusion and compression fractures.
Spine was consulted for the compression fractures and recommended a TLSO brace and an MRI on a non-urgent basis.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):   Images: -CXR [**2189-10-18**]: Small residual of right pleural effusion has remained stable since insertion of the pigtail pleural drain at the base of the lung.
Consolidation primarily in the right lower lobe, to a lesser degree anterior segment of the right upper and middle lobes is improving.
Infrahilar atelectasis in the left lower lobe, however, is worsening.
No pneumothorax.
-CT head [**2189-10-15**]: no acute intracranial process  -CXR ([**2189-10-23**]): 1.
No evidence of pneumothorax following right pigtail pleural catheter removal.
Improving mass-like consolidation in right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.
Small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
-Abd US ([**2189-10-23**]): No evidence of gallstones or biliary dilatation.

#) Pneumonia with complicated parapneumonic effusion/loculation: On admission to the MICU he had a thoracentesis and 1L of cloudy non-purulent fluid was drained.
There was concern for aspiration versus community acquired PNA.
Clinically, his breathing was improved at discharge, he was maintaining good oxygen saturation on room air and there was no reaccumulation of the pleural effuion on repeat CXR.
Increased WBC likely secondary to his pneumonia.
#) Hypercalcemia: Given unintentional weight loss of 70-80 lbs and smoking history, there is concern for malignancy.
Skeletal survey did not show evidence of lytic lesions, only suggestive of osteoporotic changes.
A urine N-telopeptide was sent and was elevated, suggesting some process leading to increased bone turnover.
Paget's is another possible explaiantion given elevated alk phos and calcium, no evidence of Paget's on skeletal survery per radiology.
Had a bone scan in [**2-/2188**] which also did not show evidence of Paget's.
MRI showed compression fracture in L1 and L2, recommended follow-up in 4 weeks.
At discharge, pain well controlled only on PRN tylenol and lidocaine patch, not requiring narcotics.
#) Diarrhea: Had diarrhea during this admission with 4-5 BMs per day.
It is thought that he had antibiotic-associated diarrhea which should improve at discharge now that he is off antibiotics.
#) Code status during this admission: FULL CODE  Trnasitional Issues: -Follow-up MRI in 4 weeks from [**2189-10-18**] to follow-up on lumbar compression fractures  -Ongoing work-up for weight loss and hypercalcemia, as described above  -Emailed pt's Hemotologist who is aware of weight loss and has talked with PCP regarding concern for malignancy  -Received Pamidronate 60mg IV on [**2189-10-20**], would be due for this every month if ongoing therapy with bisphosphonates is desired  Medications on Admission: LISINOPRIL - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 5 mg Tablet - one  Tablet(s) by mouth daily METFORMIN - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 500 mg Tablet - one  Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day PRAVASTATIN - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth daily  Medications - OTC ASPIRIN - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 81 mg Tablet, Delayed  Release (E.C.)
