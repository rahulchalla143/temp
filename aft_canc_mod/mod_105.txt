Pt also had one episode of emesis (no blood) yesterday.
He is still on his course of flagyl from recent admission, but has missed the last few doses due to outpt pharmacy issues.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have an elevated lipase and amylase of 557 and 900, respectively.
He was also noted to have an elevated lactate of 3.2 and a positive u/a with 6-10 wbc's, trace leuks, neg nitrates.
He was given Vanc/CTX/flagyl in the ED for h/o MRSA, positive u/a, and recent h/o c diff enterocolitis ([**4-10**]).
His diarrhea was improving and he had no complaints at that time.
Past Medical History: - HTN - CAD, 3VD s/p stents in [**11-8**] and [**7-10**] to LAD and OM1 - Ischemic Cardiomyopathy with EF 40% in [**7-10**] - C. difficile enterocolitis - CVA's with multiple infarcts of varying ages on MRI (bilateral  frontal, L temporal, R cerebellar) baseline gait apraxia and frontal lobe affect.
- Peripheral vascular disease - Myelodysplastic Syndrome vs. refractory anemia/thrombocytopenia, bone marrow [**2102**] - History of recurrent URI's   Social History: Born in [**Country 3587**], retired x 20 yrs, lives at home with his wife who recently had a stroke.
Neck: Supple, flat JVP, no nuchal rigidity Chest: CTA anteriorly; pt with trouble cooperating fully CV: RRR, s1 s2 normal, no m/g/r Abd: Soft, voluntary guarding, NABS, no HSM; no rebound.
Diffusely swollen pancreas consistent with mild pancreatitis without peripancreatic fluid collections noted.
Mildly atrophic kidneys with diffuse calcification of the renal artery ostia are noted.
Diffuse rectal, sigmoid, and descending colon wall thickening suggestive of colitis.
Enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes noted on previous exam, unchanged and of unknown significance.
No pleural abnormality or evidence of central adenopathy.
There appears to be some interval increase in the degree of stranding within the small bowel mesentery, and along the pericolic gutters.
There is a small amount of fluid along the pericolic gutters and within the pelvis, which is slightly increased from the prior study.
No focal abscesses are identified.
There are bilateral pleural effusions which also have increased slightly in comparison to the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 86 yoM with PMH CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, MDS, recent admission for presumed C. difficile colitis, admitted to the MICU with diarrhea and hypotension admitted to floor [**7-6**].
After family meetings to address goals of care in this patient with chronic pain and MDS most likely with leukemic transformation, not likely a candidate for therapy per hematology, the patient was made DNR/DNI/CMO.
CT abdomen [**7-3**] showed diffuse rectal, sigmoid, and descending colon wall thickening suggestive of colitis.
His stool cultures were negative x2 and C. difficile toxin was negative x3, however, the patient had a history of recent antibiotic use.
The patient continued to spike fevers despite antibiotic treatment.
The patient was kept hydrated intravenously and with free water boluses through his feeding tube to replace his GI losses.
The patient was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for presumptive infectious colitis, with antibiotic changes as above per ID recommendations.
An echocardiogram did not show evidence of endocarditis.
Hematology felt that the patient's blood smears were concerning for leukemic transformation of the MDS.
Cytology was sent prior to the decision for CMO and was pending at the time of discharge.
This was an atypical presentation as the patient was diagnosed in [**2103**] and an extended lifespan is inconsistent with the diagnosis of MDS.
As above, the team felt that the patient's blood smears during the end of his hospitalization were concerning for leukemic transformation.
Cytology was sent prior to the decision for CMO and was pending at the time of discharge.
The thrombocytopenia was likely secondary to acute illness and the patient's underlying bone marrow disorder.
The anemia was macrocytic with recent normal B12, folate [**6-11**].
His low reticulocyte count was indicative of a hypoproliferative disorder, most likely secondary to MDS with likely leukemic transformation.
#) Shortness of breath.
The shortness of breath was most likely secondary to pulmonary edema from the patient's congestive heart failure and bronchoconstriction.
His mental status was most likely secondary to underlying dementia with superimposed infection/hospitalization.
The patient was found to have a chemical pancreatitis; he remained asymptomatic without complaints of epigastric pain.
A RUQ ultrasound was negative for gallstones.
The patient had an increased INR to 1.8 in the MICU, likely in setting of nutritional deficiency from diarrhea.
The patient had no active symptoms and remained stable.
Aspirin and plavix were discontinued when the patient was thrombocytopenic and in anticipation of possible colonoscopy with biopsies.
#) Congestive heart failure.
The patienet was initially hypovolemic secondary to diarrhea.
The patient became transiently fluid overloaded and given lasix 10 mg x2 with effective diuresis.
The patient at baseline had pain with movement of his extremities.
There was increased pain with movement of the right upper extremity, films were taken of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder without evidence of destructive disease or any acute issues.
The patient at times complained of intractable hiccups.
Lipitor 40 mg qhs  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Colitis Myelodysplastic syndrome with likely leukemic transformation Thrombocytopenia Anemia .
Secondary: History of cerebrovascular infarct   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
