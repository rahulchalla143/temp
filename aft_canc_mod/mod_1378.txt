Ischemia of the terminal ileum with perforation status post resection of the terminal ileum and ileostomy.
Bradycardia of unknown etiology.
Mesenteric ischemia status post superior mesenteric artery stent on [**12-19**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 83-year-old female with past medical history significant for glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, ventral hernia, renal cyst, and right hip replacement, and bowel obstruction with multiple lysis of adhesions, who presented to the Emergency Room on [**2162-12-7**] complaining of left sided abdominal pain with loose bowel movements and vomiting.
The patient reported this low grade abdominal pain over the past few weeks, but had worsening pain over the past 1-2 days prior to admission.
Patient also noted decreased appetite prior to her admission.
She denied fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain, or sick contacts.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Renal cyst.
Bilateral hip replacements.
Bowel obstruction status post multiple lysis of adhesions.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her abdomen is soft with some hyperacute bowel sounds and tenderness mostly in the right lower quadrant with no rebound or guarding or calf tenderness.
A CT scan was obtained, which does not reveal any significant explanation for her abdominal pain.
On hospital day #1, the patient was seen to have an acute abdomen.
Her elevated lactate decreased.
Vascular Surgery consult was obtained given the concern for ischemic bowel, which is seen in the operating room.
They were not concerned about any risk for ischemia and they recommended continuing antibiotics with fluid resuscitation.
The patient's postoperative course was notable for thrombocytopenia.
She was ruled out for HIT antibody.
Patient had progressively rising white blood cell count on the floor as well as diarrhea.
She was continued on antibiotics and ruled out for Clostridium difficile.
On the evening of [**2162-12-18**], the patient was noted to have increasing abdominal pain and a base deficit on her blood gas.
On the morning of [**2162-12-19**], her abdominal examination was significant for rebound and guarding.
She was taken for an emergent CT scan, which showed free air.
Given her elevated white count, free air, distention and tenderness, she was taken to the operating room.
Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have several small perforations of the small bowel.
Infectious Disease as well as Vascular and Cardiology continued to follow the patient.
Her postoperative course was remarkable for difficulty to wean from the vent with large amount of secretions, but over  her ICU stable able to diurese the patient and wean her from the ventilator.
She also had increased ostomy output, but with tincture of opium and Imodium, and her tube feeds, were able to decrease her output.
She did fail a swallow evaluation, and therefore was on tube feeds and was NPO.
Otherwise, the patient had no major postoperative complications or events.
She received aggressive pulmonary toilet and dressing changes to her abdominal wound as well as Physical Therapy.
On [**2163-1-11**], given the fact that the patient was doing well, tolerating her tube feeds with decreased ileostomy output, it was decided that she was stable for discharge.
