History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59-year-old G2, P2 who presented with a several-week history of diarrhea, tenesmus, and abdominal bloating.
She had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2141-7-4**] at [**Hospital1 18**], which revealed a small amount of ascites.
There was an additional 9-mm enhancing peritoneal implant in left pericolic gutter.
A CA-125 was noted to be elevated at 1587.
She denied any urinary complaints.
She has had no vaginal bleeding.
Past Medical History: Significant for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right jaw, status post maxillectomy and radiation therapy in [**2137**].
She reports that she had a chest CT several months ago which revealed a question of an enlarged lymph nodes and was to have followup for this.
Also, history of NSAID nephropathy, postoperative atrial fibrillation following maxillectomy, squamous cell carcinoma of the face status nose surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a maternal aunt who had breast cancer in her 70s, another maternal aunt with esophageal cancer, and paternal relatives with lung cancer.
There were postoperative and post-radiation changes on the right side of the face.
HEART:  Regular without murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and moderately distended and without palpable masses.
Bimanual and rectovaginal examination revealed a large firm mass in the cul-de-sac which was somewhat immobile.
There was a question of cul-de-sac nodularity.
Cul de sac tumor, biopsy (O):      Carcinoma in fibrous tissue.
Lymph nodes, peri-aortic, biopsy (P-S):      Metastatic carcinoma in three lymph nodes ([**2-18**]).
Cecum, tumor, biopsy (U):      Carcinoma in fibrous tissue.
Rectosigmoid colon, resection (V-AA):      A.  Carcinoma in bowel mesentery.
Blood vessels with lymphoplasmacytic and granulomatous "vasculitis".
Lymph node, peri-aortic, biopsy (AB-AG):      Metastatic carcinoma in seven lymph nodes ([**6-24**]).
Blood vessels with lymphoplasmacytic and granulomatous "vasculitis".
No malignancy identified.
Blood vessels with lymphoplasmacytic and granulomatous "vasculitis" and vascular thrombus.
No malignancy identified.
Lymph node, left gutter, biopsy(AJ):      Metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node ([**12-19**]).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is severe focal hypokinesis/dyskinesis of the apical half free wall of the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
trivial mitral regurgitation.
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7611**] was admitted after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid resection with rectal anastomosis, repair of cystotomy and tumor debulking for a pelvic mass previously visualized on CT.
Prior to her surgery, an epidural was placed by anesthesia for post-operative pain management.
Her post-operative course was complicated by hypotension, right ventricular hypokinesis, NSTEMI, a-fib, anemia and oxygen desaturation.
# Hypotension: On post op day one and two, the patient was hypotensive to the 80s/40s.
There was no evidence of acute blood loss as her HCT remained stable post-operatively.
An epidural was in place for pain control.
The ddx for her hypotension included epidural induced sympathectomy versus myocardial ischemia.
When the hypotension did not resolve after capping the epidural an Echocardiogram performed which showed focal right ventricular hypokinesis.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes:  No known h/o CAD prior to this hospitalization.
CEs sent initially in the setting of hypotension and finding on TTE of RV free wall hypokinesis.
Reportedly this was prior to a. fib w/ RVR so troponin leak appears to predate the rapid a. fib.
Differential, however, includes ischemia vs. less likely myocarditis as cause of elevated troponin.
EKG when in NSR in the setting of hypotension did not reveal evidence of ischemia, but w/ atrial fibrillation now has new TWI in I, aVL which may represent demand ischemia in LCx distribution.
# Right ventricular hypokinesis:  Severe free wall motion hypokinesis on echocardiogram likely represents small RV NSTEMI.
The patient was initially hypotensive requiring IVF boluses and 2u RBC, but remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her ICU course.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Pt.
reportedly has h/o post op a. fib after her surgery in [**2137**] which responded well to Lopressor and was self limited.
She was given vitamin K, her HCT was monitored serially, and there was no evidence of acute bleeding as her INR returned to baseline.
CXR does show evidence of b/l pleural effusions and possible LLL opacity vs. atelectasis, o/w without significant pulmonary edema.
No evidence of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities nor depressed EF to suggest significant risk for pulmonary edema, but has been receiving fluids for BP maintenance given RV wall motion abnormalities and mild bibasilar crackles were heard on exam .
Likely hypoxia is secondary to fluid overload and dependent atelectasis.
Pt ruled out for PE on CTA.
# Leukocytosis:  WBC was max 17.0 without left shift with pt afebrile.
Treated with 3 days of Cipro for presumed UTI, however urine cx showed no growth.
At the time of discharge she was afebrile and her WBC had trended downward to 10.7.
Postoperatively hct has been 24-27, without evidence of bleeding.
