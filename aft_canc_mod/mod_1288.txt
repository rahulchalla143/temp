Admission Date:  [**2200-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-9-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2200-6-5**] - Cardiac Catheterization [**2200-6-10**] - CABGx5 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->Diag, SVG->Ramus, SVG->OM, SVG->PLV); Closure of Aorto-Pulmonary artery fistula.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78 yo man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and exercise echo [**1-21**] showing inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis, who presents with a 1 day history of chest pressure at rest.
Because of these symptoms, he had an Exercise Echo in [**1-21**] which showed in the presence of baseline 0.5 mm of inferolateral ST segment depression, there was an additional 2.0 mm of horizontal ST segment depression at peak exercise, these changes became downsloping in morphology during recovery.
The TTE showed new regional dysfunction with more extensive infero-lateral hypokinesis and distal inferior hypokinesis.
He reports that over the past month, he has had approximately 4 episodes of chest pressure at rest.
Two of the episodes have been associated with eating sticky rice, and the episodes ressolve with taking NTG SL.
This was not associated with SOB, diaphoresis, n/v, or radiation.
He was seen by his cardiologist on [**2200-5-29**] for his angina pectoris.
He had been having 3-4 episodes of angina/anginal equivalent (which is dyspnea on exertion) over the past few months occasionally at rest.
In the ambulance, he received 4 SL NTG and ASA 325 mg, and was then chest pain free.
EKG showed ST depressions in V2-V6.
CXR showed increased opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for possible infection/pneumonia.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: -CAD, no interventions, but Exercise Echo [**1-21**] showed regional dysfunction with more extensive infero-lateral hypokinesis and distal inferior hypokinesis -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, diagnosed in [**8-19**] when routine lab work showed WBC of 19,000 with 76% lymphocytes, CLL on immunophenotyping -Seborrheic keratoses -Right sided hearing loss  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
His father had diabetes and died at the age of 60 because of diabetes complication.
He has 4 sisters and 1 brother who are all healthy.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with no JVD CV: RR, normal S1, S2.
No carotid bruits bilaterally.
Lungs with right>left basilar crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: No lower extremity edema bilaterally, extremities warm and well perfused.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Diffuse ST segment depression which is downsloping, particularly in leads V2-V6.
These findings are consistent with an acute anterolateral ischemic process.
No definite pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Increased opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for possible infection/pneumonia.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
The LAD had a diffuse mid-vessel stenosis to 80% involving a large septal that provided collaterals to the RCA.
The LCx had diffuse proximal disease to 90% stenosis.
The RCA had a total occlusion in the mid-vessel.
There was a moderately-sized fistula off the LMCA to the pulmonary artery.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressure with a LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
There was moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with a central pressure of 170/77 mmHg.
There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback of the catheter from the LV to the aorta.
Left ventriculography demonstrated no mitral regurgitation.
Anomolous fistula from the LMCA to the pulmonary artery.
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal basal inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, with prominent calcification of the noncoronary leaflet, but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
The slight prominence of markings at the right base is again seen, though on the lateral view, there is no definite consolidation.
Normal coronary artery origins with severe stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery and of the trifurcation of the left main to LAD and LCx arteries.
There appeared to be a tortuous fistula arising form the left main coronary artery and coursing to the left lateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery.
There was no significant intracardiac shunt.
Mild aortic stenosis with calcification of the non-coronary cusp.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were mildly increased.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The non-coronary cusp is extremely calcified and immobile.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
2D and CFD signs of a fistula draining into the Main PA are seen.
Fistula could not be visualized consistent with surgical ligation, however imaging views are not optimal   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-6-5**] for further management of his ischemic chest pain.
This revealed severe three vessel disease and a normal ejection fraction.
Of note, an anomalous fistula was noted between the left main and pulmonary artery.
A cardiac MRI was obtained which demonstrated a tortuous fistula arising form the left main coronary artery and coursing to the left lateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery.
Integrilin and Plavix were discontinued in anticipation of surgery and for mild hematuria.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical PRN (as needed) as needed for itching.
