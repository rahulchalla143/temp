Pt admitted w/ hypoglycemia from sulfonylurea toxicity [**2-17**] [**Doctor First Name 48**], SBO (resolved), HCC (on chemo), and OLT (on immune suppression).
1) Hypoglycemia ??????
Best theory is that w/decreased PO, N/V patient became pre-renal and had increased increased serum sulfonylurea [**2-17**] decreased renal clearance.
Pt was DCed from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to OMED normo- to hyper-glycemic, and covered on SSI to which he again became hypogylcemic to 26 on the day of admission.
We suggested instead DCing all anti-hyperglycemics until his appointment on Fri; he was not open to this as he feels that other providers will use his ensuing hyperlycemia as justification for parenteral insulin.
He complained that he sometimes cannot reach a doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] clinic; his PCP will serve as a backup-call for hypoglycemia and I have given him my phone number as another backup.
2) Anemia ??????
[**Month (only) 116**] also have component of anemia [**2-17**] past chemo.
3) HCC ??????
S/P liver transplant, s/p chemo for HCC, now with recurring ascites.
Diagnostic / therapeutic paracentesis on [**8-1**] no SBP by cell counts & chemistries, cultures ngtd on DC.
5) Asthma - Managed inpatient on nebs of atrovent standing and PRN albuterol.
likely [**2-17**] past chemo, though did have dilated loops of bowel by abd film.
Pt and family verbalized understanding of the risks of DC at this time given hypoglycemia and renal failure.
