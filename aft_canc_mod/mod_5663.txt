He does not complain of respiratory symptoms (cough, SOB).
CT head negative for acute process.
CTA chest pursued given his h/o PE (although INR 6.0), and revealed RUL consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
In addition his serum calcium was 12.2 (has h/o hypercalcemia of malignancy) and he was given 500cc bolus of normal saline only given his h/o [**Name (NI) **] failure on HD.
Does admit to "total body pain" which on further characterization seems to be muscle pain, predominately in the legs and head.
He admits to chronic leg pain at baseline.

Portable Chest x-ray: no acute process .
Right upper lobe consolidation, likely infectious.
No PE or acute aortic process.
Interval resolution of bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe pneumonia.
CT head (non-contrast) [**2130-7-15**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
ECG: Sinus tachycardia @ 104.
man with multiple myeloma and ESRD on [**Known lastname 2286**] who presented with altered mental status and was found to have a right upper lobe pneumonia and hypercalcemia.
# RUL pneumonia.
The patient was found to have a right upper lobe pneumonia on CT scan.
His O2 requirement worsened in the setting of volume overload.
Pt had rigors and low grade temps on HD2.
# hypercalcemia/ altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status likely due to a combination of his infection (pneumonia) and metabolic derangements (hypercalcemia).
The patient's hypercalcemia was thought to be secondary to his multiple myeloma.
He was treated with pamidronate, calcitionin, decadron, and [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] to decrease his calcium level.
# right back pain: The patient developed excruciating right back pain during this admission.
Multiple imaging modalities were negative for any pathological fractures, but there was a question of left sided ilio-psoas bursitis which did not correlate with his clinical presentation.
His pain was managed with Dilaudid throughout his admission.
# End-stage [**Month/Year (2) 2793**] Disease: The patient is on HD with ESRD secondary to his multiple myeloma.
The patient is basically anuric so his hypercalcemia and volume status was dependent on HD.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been anticoagulated for paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
He was reversed with Vitamin K and anticoagulation was held as patient was thought to be at high risk of bleeding given his likely uremic platelets.
Of note, the patient had a history of PE in [**9-2**], but completed a 6 month treatment course with warfarin and repeat CTA was negative for residual clot.
# Hypertension:  The patient's antihypertensive medications were initially held due concern that he might be developing sepsis physiology; however, he developed HTN with SBP 200.
# ST depressions:  The patient was noted to have ST depressions on EKG most likely secondary to demand ischemia.
He did not have any symptoms of chest pain or pressure.
# Multiple myeloma:  The patient has end stage multiple myeloma.
His was treated with Cytoxan on [**2130-7-3**] in an effort to help control his disease and hypercalcemia.
Orthopedic oncology was consulted and it was determined that no intervention for his back pain would be indicated at this time.
