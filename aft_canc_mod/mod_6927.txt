Coronary artery disease 2.
Mitral regurgitation 3.
Episodic atrial fibrillation 7.
Left ventricular outflow obstruction  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old woman who was admitted to the [**Hospital3 3834**] on [**2144-12-26**] with complaints of shortness of breath.
She denied chest pains or palpitations at that time.
She was hypotensive and a chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Computerized tomography scan was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism given the history of breast cancer.
The patient had a history of allergy to Shellfish and computerized tomography scan was ultimately negative for pulmonary thrombosis, but the patient became acutely more short of breath and bronchospastic.
She was presumed to have an allergic reaction to the intravenous contrast dye and was treated with epinephrine, Solu-Medrol as well as Benadryl.
Despite this the patient became hypoxic and was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Dobutamine was started for presumed cardiogenic shock although there was no specific etiology.
The patient subsequently developed a 300 cc bloody emesis via nasogastric tube.
Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
Chest is significant for rales in the right mid lung field.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended and obese.
The patient has a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, left radial arterial line, intubated with nasogastric tube, Foley catheter and two peripheral intravenous lines.
Chest x-ray reveals mild congestive heart failure with question of a right middle lobe infiltrate.
There was some small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram is sinus rhythm, ST depression in V3 and 4 with T wave flattening in the lateral leads.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the presumptive diagnosis of cardiogenic shock, possibly from transient ischemia.
Leukocytosis with lowgrade temperatures, also indicated the possibility of a lung infection.
From a gastrointestinal standpoint, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**2144-12-28**] which revealed blood in the fundus and multiple small lesions are actively bleeding.
It was felt that those lesions probably represented arteriovenous malformations.
The patient was extubated on hospital day #2 without difficulty.
The patient was premedicated for cardiac catheterization given her possible allergic reaction to intravenous dye.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 65%.
There was some anterior hypokinesis.
The patient also had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia with a rate of 200 and then converted back to sinus rhythm with a total of 10 mg of intravenous Lopressor.
On the evening of postoperative day #3, the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation and was given 20 mg of intravenous Lopressor as well as 150 mg of Amiodarone.
On postoperative day #6, the patient went into a second episode of rapid atrial fibrillation at approximately 1:30 AM.
The patient remained asymptomatic throughout without chest pain or shortness of breath.
She did complain of subjective palpitations.
They recommended outpatient [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitoring as well as Amiodarone taper regimen.
Echocardiogram was obtained on [**2145-1-6**] which revealed still some mild to moderate mitral regurgitation as well as significant left ventricular outflow obstruction due to the mitral leaflets.
The patient tolerated this and had no further disease.
pain medications.
Anticoagulation was not begun due to her history of gastrointestinal bleeds and probable arteriovenous malformations.
