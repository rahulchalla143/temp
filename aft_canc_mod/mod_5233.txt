Past Medical History: Neurofibromatosis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, h/o Spontaneous pneumothorax, s/p appendectomy  Social History: Lives with his wife.
No history of thyroid or parathyroid disease.
No history of MI or heart disease.
missing teeth, MMM, EOMI, PERRL, op without lesions, anicteric Neck: Thin, no LAD, no carotid bruits appreciated CV: RRR, normal S1, S2, no m/r/g Lungs: CTA anteriorly Abdomen: Thin, normoactive BS, soft, NT/ND Ext: warm, no edema, 2+ pedal pulses b/l, 2+ femoral pulses b/l  R groin: small amt of blood on dressing, no hematoma or femoral bruit Neuro: AAO x3, CNII-XII intact, moving all 4 extremities, unable to fully assess as patient on bedrest.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated a three vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCA was a small caliber vessel with a 90% bifurcation lesion at the PDA and the PLB.
Severe emphysematous changes in the upper lobes bilaterally with asymmetric apical scarring, left greater than right, both changing calcification which are presumably chronic changes.
No adenopathy.
If there are any prior older radiographic studies available elsewhere, it would be helpful to compare these to assure no suspicious interval change has occurred.
Otherwise, PET CT may help confirm no underlying malignancy.
Atherosclerosis and calcified coronary artery plaque.
Truncal cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas.
Mild prostatic enlargement.
No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of intracranial mass or hemorrhage.
No intracranial "stigmata" of neurofibromatosis; scalp subcutaneous nodules could represent neurofibromas or other associated dermal lesions, and clinical correlation is recommended.
[**2119-2-13**] Head MRI/MRA: There is a small lacune within the right side of the pons.
There are minimal periventricular white matter hyper-densities most consistent with minimal chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
There are no enhancing lesions.
And there are no areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
The 3D time-of-flight MRA is normal with no evidence of aneurysms or stenoses.
[**2119-2-15**] Echo: Pre Bypass: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild basilar inferior hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and borderline complex atheroma (.36-.39 cm) in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve appears normal with no tricuspid regurgitation.
[**Month/Day/Year 72424**] >55% with no change in wall motion.
There is stable bullous change within the lung apices, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No pneumothorax is seen in the background of bullous disease.
There is no new consolidation or pulmonary edema, or cardiomegaly.
Cath revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and he was referred for surgical intervention.
Prior to surgery he required extensive work-up which included multiple radiologic studies and consultations.
On post-op day two he had an episode of atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone and beta blockers.
