Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from 5/55/12-6/1/12 for ascending cholangitis and UTI after presenting with AMS, fevers with abdominal US demonstrating obstruction.
As above the patient has a previous history of obstruction with placement of 2 stents.
The day of presentation patient was noted to have shaking chills at rehab, labs were done and demonstrated a white count of 26.
He presented [**Hospital1 **] Needeham from rehab where labs were notable for elevated WBC,lipase of 42 and bili of 9.
CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema but no PNA.
Head CT was negative for an acute process.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were afebrile 89 141/74 99% 2L NC.He denies any complaint including chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, vomiting.

Intrahepatic biliary dilatation and pneumobilia.
Stent in common bile duct with stable dilatation of pancreatic duct.
Distended gallbladder with sludge and thickened wall, most likely due to third spacing.
Right pleural effusion and ascites.
There is a small mobile mass which may represents a small vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
Decreased biventricular systolic function with abnormal septal wall motion.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Large left pleural effusion.
No DVT in the right upper extremity.
BIOPSY ([**2128-4-28**]): Periampullary mass, mucosal biopsies: Adenomatous mucosal fragments, predominantly with low grade dysplasia; see note.
Note: Occasional areas demonstrate nuclei with disordered polarity and cytologic features worrisome for high grade dysplasia.
No definite carcinoma in these biopsy samples.
BRUSHINGS ([**2128-4-28**]): POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
CXR [**2128-5-4**]: Moderately-severe pulmonary edema is unchanged, but moderate right and small left pleural effusion have both increased substantially since [**4-28**].
Heavy calcification of the cardiac silhouette along the diaphragmatic surface is probably left ventricular aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo male with recent cholangitis s/p ERCP with stent placement who presents from rehab with chills, AMS, elevated WBC, elevated bilirubin, LFTs and concern for recurrent cholangitis.
Severe sepsis with septic shock; secondary to: 2.
Possible endocarditis  Presented with fever, leukocytosis, confusion, and acute renal failure.
Initial treatment for enterococcus was vancomycin, then switched to daptomycin when noted to be VRE.
Regarding possible bacterial endocarditis, an echo showed a small mobile mass which may represents a small vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
Adenocarcinoma: CT abdomen showed enhancing lesion around pacreatic head.
ERCP showed a 4mm fungating mass at the major papilla.
Brushings were positive for adenocarcinoma.
After discussion with the family, oncology consultation was pursued but pt's poor performance status as well as significant comorbidities precludes surgery or aggressive therapy.
Acute renal failure: Initially elevated with improvement after IVF then another increase later in course.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Noted to have pulmonary edema on CXR in the setting of IVF for hypotension.
Lisinorpil was held due to hypotension and ARF.
He had persistent HTN so this was titrated up with response.
day prior to discharge he was noted to require oxygen and repeat CXR showed increased bilateral pleural effusions.
Atrial fibrillation: On admission he was supratherapeutic and was given vitamin K for ERCP.
Given a CHADS2 score of 5 with prior TIA bridging anticoagulation was used (initially with IV heparin, then enoxaparin given difficulty obtaining PTT levels routinely).
Peripheral vascular disease: Has difficult to palpate/doppler DP pulse on the left.
Based on poor overall prognosis with new diagnosis of pancreatic or biliary adenocarcinoma, family wanted to avoid further invasive measures or aggressive treatment as it had been the pt's wish to spend his time at home.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Severe sepsis and setic shock due to:    * Cholangitis with biliary obstruction, likely secondary to adenocarcinoma    * Septicemia (VRE; pseudomonas; enterobacter)    * Possible endocarditis 2.
Acute renal failure 4.
Hypernatremia 5.
Atrial fibrillaton with history of TIA 6.
Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure 7.
Coronary artery disease 8.
Peripheral vascular disease 9.
Prostate cancer 10.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe infection (cholangitis) and well as bacteria in the bloodstream.
These were treated with ERPC with new stent placement and antibiotics.
Unfortunately, a biopsy performed during ERCP showed evidence of adenocarcinoma.
Due to multiple comorbidities and your overall status at this time you are not a candidate for surgery or aggressive treatment.
