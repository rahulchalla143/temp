Admission Date:  [**2148-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-9-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: s/p VT arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization s/p MiniVision LAD stent Intubation R arterial line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 29887**] is a 52 yo male with significant PMH significant for HTN, smoking, who collapsed and hit his head at work this afternoon.
There is no report of chest pain, SOB, or any other symptoms prior to his fall.
He was given 5 minutes of CPR with no respirations.
Patient had agonal respirations at the time of the arrest.
The patient was given Ativan, Versed, and Nitro and a CT of the head was done which suggested subdural hematoma vs. meningioma.
EKG showed ST elevations in 1, aVL, V2-V6.
The patient did not receive ASA, heparin, or integrilin for concern for a possible intracranial bleed.
In the cath lab he was found to have occluded LAD after D1 & S1 and 1 subbranch with long subtotal occlusion with collateral filling of distal vessel.
He is an 80 pack year smoker, no alcohol.

EKG: nl sinus rhythm, ST elevations in 1, aVL, V2-V6, reciprocal ST depressions in III, aVF, t wave inversions laterally, LAFB .
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had diffuse mild disease.
The distal LAD was a small diffusely disease vessel that filled via right to left collaterals.
Hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided filling presures.
There was pulmonary artery hypertension.
2)C,T,L-spine CT ([**2148-12-14**]): no evidence of fracture or malalignment.
3)CT head ([**2148-12-15**]): There is a 5-mm hyperdensity along the right frontal falx of uncertain etiology.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or infarction.
There do not appear to be any large areas of intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
There appears to be a fetal origin to the right posterior cerebral artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 29887**] is a 52 yo male with HTN who is now s/p anterolateral STEMI and VF arrest s/p LAD stent, and s/p intubation.
He remained stable thereafter, but did have some residual short term memory deficits.
1)STEMI: The patient had evidence of an anterolateral STEMI and subsequent Vfib arrest.
He was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have occluded LAD after D1 & S1 and 1 subbranch with long subtotal occlusion with collateral filling of distal vessel.
2)Pump: The patient had an ECHO 2 days after PCI and VF arrest which showed an EF~ 30% with an akinetic apex.
Given the akinetic apex found on echo and increased risk of clot formation, the patient was started on a heparin drip as a bridge to coumadin.
3)Rhythm: The patient is s/p vfib arrest secondary to an anterolateral STEMI.
4)Fall: The patient is s/p posterior head trauma prior to the VF arrest.
Head CT head showed a 5-mm hyperdense focus along anterior falx.
Differential included meningioma vs. bleed.
5)Short term memory: The patient's STM deficit was thought to be secondary to anoxic brain injury from poor perfusion during the Vfib arrest.
A follow up appointment was made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this purpose.
The patient was clinically asymptomatic and over the course of the hospitalization.
UA and CXR were negative for UTI and PNA respectively.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Visiting Nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 269**] [**Location (un) 270**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: ST elevation MI with stent placement V-fib arrest New systolic dysfunction (EF 30%) with apical akinesis Meningioma .
Secondary diagnosis: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Safe for discharge home.
If you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact your doctor or report to the nearest ER.
