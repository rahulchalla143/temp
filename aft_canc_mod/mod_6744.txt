Patient had noticed a lump and nipple retraction in her left breast two years before presenting to [**Hospital1 2025**] at the urging of her husband for evaluation.
According to [**Hospital1 2025**] records patient had a core biopsy of a 8 X 9 cm firm mass occupying the entire L breast.
The core biopsy showed an invasive mammary carcinoma (lobular, E-Cadherin negative) that was ER +, PR+ and Her2neu-.
Patient had felt well until 9 months ago when she started becoming increasingly fatigued and limited in function, first unable to leave home and since [**Month (only) 404**] only able to ambulate from bed to comode.
Husband noticed patient's abdominal girth increasing over last year with an acceleration over the last couple of weeks.
Over the last few days Mrs. [**Known lastname 81308**] has had worsening abdominal distension and shortness of breath and has noted that her abdomen has increased in size markedly over that time.
She has been laying only on one side, and has had increasing difficulty transfering from the bed to her commode.
Her PO intake has been poor with significant wasting of her extremities and decreased appetite since [**Month (only) 404**].
On [**3-18**] when her respiratory status became labored and he could no longer transfer her to the commode, she agreed to go to the hospital.
According to a palliative care note, Mrs. [**Known lastname 81308**] did not elaborate on her thoughts reagrding her illness or disease progression which her sister explained as part of CS belief system that thinking of any negative outcomes as that impacts the healing process.
Note, according to family it is a contradiction to her religious practice to note the earthly changes in her body and seek medical help therefore she is uncomfortable answering questions regarding the history of her symptoms.
Nodal status at time unknown (pt never had any imaging or further surgical interventions, treatments, or biopsies s/p core biopsy).

Shortness of breath: Patient's chief complaint on arrival was her shortness of breath and she agreed to therapeutic paracentesis on several occasions to relieve her dyspnea and improve her mobility.
We attributed her dyspnea to the  elevation of her diaphragm and splinting in the context of massive ascites and this was supported by improvement in her dyspnea with each tap.
She tolerated taps well without electolyte shifts and by the end of her hospitalization patient was able to lie on her back without dyspnea.
A pulmonary embolism was initally also part of the differential for her dyspnea given her concurrent diagnosis of cancer but it was felt that a CTA was not possible given pt's inability to lie flat during most of her stay.
We also didn't know whether or not she has metastatic lesions to her brain for which anticoagulation might be contraindicated.
Patient was afebrile throughout her hospitalization without cough or leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Breast cancer: Patient's diagnosis of lobular breast cancer was obtained at [**Hospital1 2025**] over two years ago.
These alterations were explained as hypothalamic supression in the setting of illness and cachexia and patient was presumed to be post-menopausal by age and history of several years of amenorhea.
Pt had a transudative ascites by initial SAAG calculation.
Cytology showed "rare, atypical cells" and a subsequent tap showed no malignant cells.
Letrozole 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO daily () as needed for metastatic breast cancer.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Breast Cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having shortness of breath.
We drained over 40 liters of fluid out of your abdomen on several occasions in order for you to feel less short of breath and have better mobility.
You also decided that you would like treatment for your breast cancer so we started you on a medication called Letrozole 2.5 mg daily.
It works by blocking estrogen production, the hormone that your tumor needs to grow.
While you were here you also were noted to have a urinary tract infection which we treated with antibiotics.
