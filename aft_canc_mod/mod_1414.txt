HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old female with a history of papillary serous ovarian carcinoma diagnosed in [**2105-11-30**], status post exploratory laparotomy and drainage of ascites on [**2105-12-11**], who presented to an outside hospital with small bowel obstruction.
On initial surgery, unable to debulk secondary to extensive carcinomatosis.
She was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with a three day history of nausea and vomiting, and inability to tolerate any p.o.
Nasogastric tube was placed and since then the patient denies any nausea and vomiting.
No chest pain or shortness of breath.
No dysuria or hematuria or hematochezia.
Gastrogram enema revealed two obstructing lesions in the sigmoid.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Peptic ulcer disease/gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Hypothyroidism, status post partial thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter.
Ovarian carcinoma as per history of present illness.
History of small bowel obstruction in [**2097**].
Bilateral hip replacement.
Partial thyroidectomy.
4   Exploratory laparotomy for small bowel obstruction in [**2097**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Chest is with decreased breath sounds and occasional expiratory wheezes.
Cardiovascular - tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen is soft, markedly distended, minimal diffuse tenderness to palpation, tympanitic areas, high pitched bowel sounds.
Extremities are without edema, notable for ecchymosis in the upper arm and right hip and right knee.
A colonoscopy revealed a tight 3.5 centimeter stricture in the midsigmoid colon.
The sharp and abrupt angulation of the stricture prevented the deployment of a metal stent.
On [**2106-2-10**], the patient complained of difficulty breathing and was evaluated for a pulmonary embolus with a CT angiogram which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
The patient also had an episode of mild chest pain with tachypnea on [**2106-2-14**], and she ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time.
Given her persistent recurrent episodes of tachypnea and tachycardia, the patient was started on Advair, for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare worsened by gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Following another episode of shortness of breath with tachypnea to the mid 30s, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and started on intravenous Solu-Medrol.
She should have her TSH rechecked in three weeks, to readjust her Synthroid dose (TSH found to be elevated during this hospitalization).
