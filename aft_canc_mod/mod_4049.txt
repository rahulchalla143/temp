She dnies any dysuria, hematuria, frequency or urgency.
In the ED she was febrile and hypotensive and was given 4L NS with improved hypotension but developed respiratory distress.
CXR was c/w PNA with superimposed CHF so she was given 20mg IV lasix X 2 with good effect.
No documented fevers.
Past Medical History: Onc hx: Initially presented with mole at her left flank which grew and turned black.
She underwent a resection of a 12.5-mm thick ulcerated melanoma from her left abdominal wall in [**Month (only) 958**] of [**2145**].
On [**2146-5-11**], she underwent complete left inguinal node dissection, with no melanoma in three remaining lymph nodes.
Following that therapy, she developed a psychotic depression, which fully resolved on antidepressant therapy.
CT scans in [**Month (only) 116**] showed possible bilateral pulmonary nodules.
PET scans in [**Month (only) **] confirmed metastatic disease in the lungs, liver, and bone and a head MRI showed multiple small CNS metastases.
Upon documentation of this CNS metastases, she was referred to Neuro-Oncology for evaluation.
She underwent an LP, which disclosed no evidence of leptomeningeal disease.
Because of multiple CNS lesions and skull metastasis, she was started on whole brain radiation in early [**Month (only) 205**].

Brief Hospital Course: Hypotension - resolved following initial hydration with 4L IVF in ED.
No further episodes of hypotension.

CXR consistent with pneumonia given hx of fevers and cough, but metastatic spread also possible.
