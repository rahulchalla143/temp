Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**4-24**] to [**4-27**] with hemoptysis at which time she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with argon photocoagulation therapy on [**4-26**].
Following this, the pt had no further hemoptysis.
Pt was only home for a few [**Known lastname **] when she had three episodes of hemoptysis and returned to [**Hospital1 18**].
Per notes, pt had no SOB on admission.
She was admitted and on the morning of [**5-1**] went to the OR for rigid bronchoscopy.
This showed heavy bleeding from the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Later that morning, Pt extubated without complication and transferred to medical service.
ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY(per OMR): Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old female with metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs and lymph nodes noted on work-up for shortness of breath ([**1-3**]) associated with a hgb=17: CT [**5-1**] demonstrated bilateral cystic kidneys and confirmed pulmonary nodules as well as prevascular, supracarinal and infracarinal, mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes.
CT-guided biopsy of the right lung nodule at [**State 48444**] Center [**5-1**] was suspicious for, but not diagnostic of malignancy.
She was diangosed with metastatic renal carcinoma based on the large left kidney necrotic hypernephroma and polycystic kidney disease.
After one cycle of IL-2 [**8-1**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] was followed with stable CT scans every three months until [**3-2**] when extensive periaortic adenopathy, pulmonary nodules and an 8.8 cm left renal mass were noted.
At this time she had episodes of shortness of breath and hemoptysis, including an episode during bronchoscopy that required emergent intubation [**4-2**].
She has done well on [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] with resolution of hemoptysis, shortness of breath and a decrease in target lesions initially and stable since then.
Her diarrhea has stabilized on immodium.
In [**1-4**] she developed new onset asymptomatic Grade II a-fib requiring cardioversion s/p TEE (?

There is bulky bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The mediastinal nodes are most prominent in the right paratracheal, aorticopulmonary window and subcarinal regions.
Numerous pulmonary nodules are seen in both lungs, ranging in size from less than a cm in diameter to several cm in diameter.
The nodules appear more conspicuous than on the prior study were likely more difficult to visualize previously due to portable technique.
The lungs reveal no focal areas of consolidation or areas of significant atelectasis.
There are trace pleural effusions which have improved compared to [**2164-4-24**] chest radiograph.
Skeletal structures reveal diffuse demineralization and degenerative changes.
Extensive metastatic disease involving the thoracic lymph nodes and pulmonary parenchyma.
Improved pleural effusions with small residual effusions remaining.
IR Embolization: 1) Thoracic aortogram revealed a single, hypertrophied right bronchial artery supplying the right lung field.
No active extravasation was identified.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 56 y/o female with PMH significant for metastatic renal cell CA with mets to the lung and multiple lymph node chains admitted with hemoptysis after bleeding from right upper lobe during bronchoscopy.
[**Name (NI) 48445**] Pt with episodes of hemoptysis in the past and now returns with similar complaints.
Underwent rigid bronchoscopy on admission where bleeding was seen from the right upper lobe.
While on the floor Pt stable without evidence of respiratory distress.
Morning after embolization/bronch, Pt c/o some residual hemoptysis that resolved.
Pt without evidence of further bleeding.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma- Pt is currently on the experimental [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
