Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
The distribution and appearance of the findings are consistent with pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, moderate.
Brief Hospital Course: In short, Mr [**Known lastname 40722**] is an 88M with acute onset of respiratory distress and septic shock shortly after receiving BCG treatment for bladder CA, prolonged hospitalization c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure, coag-negative Staphylococcal line infection.
# Respiratory Failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 40722**] had ARDS secondary to a systemic inflammatory response from either sepsis or a systemic rxn to BCG as below.
?s hx of repeat septic physiology after BCG treatment two times in a row is suggestive of either repeat seeding from a urinary source or repeat BCG reaction.
?s presentation: increased severity of second episode would be c/w sensitization during first dose.
[Acute respiratory failure and septic shock induced by Mycobacterium bovis.
A rare side effect of intravesical BCG therapy] Presse Med.
Given the possible component of enterococcal urosepsis, he was initially covered with Unasyn and levofloxacin for double gram negative coverage and for some anti-mycobacterial activity.
He underwent scrotal ultrasound to evaluate for epididymitis or prostatitis, showing no evidence of such.
ID saw him and recommended starting treatment of mycobacteria with isoniazid and rifampin, with discontinuation of levofloxacin and changing Unasyn to Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage, which was also done.
# Renal Failure: Secondary to sepsis.
Fluid removal was limited by hypotension initially.
# Atrial fibrillation:  On [**6-8**] patient developed atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Transaminitis, elevated Bili: Seen by ERCP b/c initial concern at OSH over LFTs.
Dbili>Indirect suggestive of cholestasis, but margianlly elevated AlkP and lack of stones or biliary dilation on US, argue strongly that source if not biliary.
RUQ US did not show ductal dilatation.
Likewise, Hct=40 likely indicates further extravasation of intravascular volume into interstitium [**2-22**] sepsis.
Hypertension:  After being hypotensive initially, he developed hypertension.
