Pt has known history of lung parenchymal disease from her ovarian cancer as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
Has developed progressive SOB, [**Month/Year (2) **], hypoxia with low grade fever (in the ED) over this time.
Wears oxygen at baseline and has been having increasing requirement from 2L up to 5L oxygen.
At baseline, patient is able to walk around her house, but unable to walk short distances without becoming SOB.
She denies fevers at home, sick contacts, productive [**Name2 (NI) **], hemoptysis, chest pressure, pleuritic chest pain, or lightheadedness on standing.
Patient was found to have increased bilateral pleural effusions from prior.
Also mild constipation.
Also complaining of significant fatigue.
Patient denies significant abdominal pain, headache, chills, weight loss, bruising or bleeding.
Onc History: Dx'd [**8-/2140**] with Stage IIC ovarian cancer.
Pathology showed serous papillary adenocarcinoma.
She relapsed in [**2146-1-9**] in the form of a mass in the left hemipelvis.
She underwent a second cytoreductive surgery on [**2146-1-18**] followed by four cycles of carboplatin and Taxol until [**2146-4-9**], which was discontinued because of disease progression.
She was then treated with topotecan 1.25 mg/m2 x5 days IV every three weeks for four cycles from [**Month (only) 547**] [**2146**] until [**2146-7-10**] that was discontinued because of a rise in her CA-125.
She was treated with Doxil 40 mg per meter squared for two cycles on [**2146-8-30**] and [**2146-9-30**], which was discontinued because of disease progression based on a CA-125 that was rising.
She has been on weekly Taxol and Arimidex from [**2146-11-9**] to [**2148-12-10**] and this was discontinued because of disease progression.
She received three cycles of gemcitabine but had significant disease progression.
She was then on Navelbine in [**Month (only) 958**] but discontinued this in [**2149-7-10**] due to disease progression.
She was started on oral etoposide in [**2149-11-9**] but discontinued it in [**12-15**] [**3-13**] GI side effects and fatigue.
Past Medical History: - IBS - Anxiety - metastatic ovarian ca as above.
No cervical or inguinal LAD.
Dullness to percussion over left lung, and base of right lung.
No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi.
Purplish subcutaneous 3 cm nodule to left of umbilicus, representing metastatic disease.
CXR- As best can be compared across modalities, there is a markedly stable radiograph with bilateral pleural effusions, left much greater than right.
No pulmonary embolism.
No aortic dissection.
Interval worsening of large left loculated pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.
Similar appearance of right lower lobe total consolidation due to aspiration.
Interval slight worsening of thoracic metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 yo female with relapsing ovarian cancer with metastatic disease to the lymph nodes, lungs, pleural effusions presents with worsening dyspnea.
with known bilateral pleural effusions secondary to malignant effusions from ovarian cancer.
There was no evidence of PE on CTA but the CT did show worsening of the loculated bilateral pleural effusions, which was the most likely etiology of her dyspnea.
She also had low grade fevers and was immunosupressed from chemotherapy.
Therefore, she was started on levofloxacin for possible underlying pneumonia.
The patient was oxygen dependent was being treated with standing nebulizer treatments.
After extensive conversation with the attending and the family and patient, the following was decided upon: no further chemotherapy, no further interventions.
Ovarian Cancer- Unfortunately the patient had relapsed disease and failed multiple chemo regimens.
