The precipitating episode was a CT-guided biopsy of a mediastinal mass was being done at the outside hospital.
Apparently, the aorta was entered during this biopsy and there was bleeding into the pericardium.
The patient tamponaded and was taken emergently to the operating room for pericardial window.
After this was done, she was transferred here to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for further management and biopsy of the anterior lung mass.
She had a number of chest x-rays, which were stable and showed a collection in the medial aspect of the right chest.
She was weaned off propofol and extubated without complications.
After stabilizing, she was taken to the operating room on [**1-17**] for a mediastinoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] for diagnosis of the mediastinal mass.
