CT CHEST [**5-13**]: Limited evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma due to image acquisition during the expiratory phase of respiration.
However, no intra-thoracic malignancy is identified  MRI Brain [**5-14**]: Large extra-axial mass lesion identified at the right occipital region, causing mass effect, associated with vasogenic edema and adjacent and contacting the right transverse sinus as described above, more likely consistent with a meningioma.
Residual edema in the right temporo-occipital region causing mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and approximately 6 mm of right-to-left midline shift.
MRI Brain [**5-16**]: There is increased DWI signal surrounding the resection cavity.
Infarct cannot be ruled out at this time but this is likely due to retraction during the surgery though infarct cannot be excluded.
There is gross total resection.
A chest CT was obtained, which revealed no pulmonary lesions or other areas of tumor.
MR head showed large extra-axial mass lesion at the right occipital region, causing mass effect, more likely consistent with a meningioma.
Frozen section was consistent with a meningioma with no atypical features.
The procedure went well without complications.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain .
