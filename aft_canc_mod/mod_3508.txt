TRACING #1  	Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 63	0	162	454/459	0	-58	-66  PATHOLOGY:  IMAGING: [**2134-6-24**] - Portable CXR: A pacemaker/ICD device has two ventricular leads and a single right atrial lead.
The lungs are difficult to assess in this area and it is also difficult to exclude a small left-sided pleural effusion.
However, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
Mild rightward convex is curvature centered along the mid thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited examination, but substantial cardiomegaly without definite evidence for acute disease.
[**2134-6-25**] - Transthoracic Echo: Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Dilated coronary sinus (diameter >15mm).
Severe global LV hypokinesis.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Focal basal hypokinesis of RV free wall.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe global hyopokinesis suggestive of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Depressed cardiac output/index.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Dilated coronary sinus (is there evidence for persistance of left SVC?).
Normal flow, compression and augmentation is seen in all of the visualized veins.
Superficial edema within the soft tissues is seen in the right calf.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis from the right common femoral through the right popliteal veins.
There is no evidence of fracture, lytic or sclerotic lesions demonstrated.
There is lumbar dextroscoliosis.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging dedicated to the area of pain demonstrated.
[**2134-6-28**] - Thyroid U/S: There has been prior left thyroidectomy.
Remaining thyroid parenchyma shows a homogeneous echotexture without evidence of focal nodules.
In the anterior midline, extending slightly to the left of midline, adjacent to but appearing separate from the thyroid isthmus, is a lobulated, heterogeneously, predominantly hypoechoic mass which measures 3.3 x 1.2 x 2.4 cm.
The appearance is suggestive of either an abnormal lymph node or other heterogeneous solitary mass.
Survey views throughout the remainder of the neck show no evidence of additional lymphadenopathy.
This may represent an abnormal lymph node or other solitary mass.
CT images of the lungs show bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral patchy areas of atelectasis of the right lower lobe as well as of the left upper and lower lobes.
IMPRESSION: 1- Intense focal tracer uptake overlying the left thyroid bed consistent with a large left parathyroid adenoma, increased in size and intensity when compared to the prior study.
2- Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis of the right lower lobe and the left upper and lower lobes  [**2134-6-29**] - CT neck with contrast: The patient is status post left hemithyroidectomy.
There is a high-attenuation mass in the strap muscles to the left of midline, separate from the right-sided isthmus remnant, which corresponds to the mass seen on the prior ultrasound.
Of note, this was thought to be consistent with a parathyroid tumor on the nuclear medicine parathyroid scan.
There is a 1-cm lymph node between levels III and IV on the left (image 2:56), at the upper limit of normal size.
No other enlarged cervical lymph nodes are seen.
There is no evidence of an exophytic mucosal mass.
There is calcified plaque in the aortic arch.
There is calcified and noncalcified plaque at the origins of the internal carotid arteries, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.
The distal cervical right internal carotid artery is medialized, indenting the posterior pharyngeal wall.
There are ground-glass opacities at the imaged lung apices, better assessed on the concurrent torso CT.
There are no lytic or sclerotic bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
There are degenerative changes in the cervical spine.
Mass in the strap muscles to the left of midline, corresponding to the lesion seen on the preceding ultrasound, separate from the residual thyroid isthmus.
This was thought to represent a parathyroid tumor on the preceding nuclear medicine study.
Ground glass opacities at the imaged lung apices, better assessed on the concurrent torso CT. - CT Torso with and without contrast: CT CHEST: There is a 1.5 x 2.5 cm enhancing mass superior and anterior to the residual right lobe of the thyroid gland compatible with known parathyroid adenoma.
There is no supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
The heart is markedly enlarged with predominantly right-sided involvement.
There is a moderate pericardial effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
Ground-glass opacity at the bases most likely represent atelectasis.
There is no large central pulmonary embolus.
CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is heterogeneous appearance to the liver with prominent hepatic veins, most consistent with hepatic congestion from fluid overload.
There are no focal liver lesions and the portal vein is patent.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is thickening of the anteromedial limb of the left adrenal gland, which may represent hyperplasia or adenoma and less likely malignant involvement.
There is bilateral scarring.
The stomach, small and intra-abdominal large bowel are unremarkable.
A small amount of perihepatic ascites is present.
CT PELVIS: There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
The bladder is collapsed and there is a Foley catheter.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free air within the abdomen or pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
There is diffuse anasarca.
2.8 cm enhancing mass anterior to the residual thyroid consistent with known parathyroid adenoma.
Findings consistent with fluid overload including cardiomegaly, moderate pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural effusions, hepatic congestion, small amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis as well as anasarca.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery which is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
Thickened appearance to the medial and anterior limb of the left adrenal which may represent hyperplasia, or an adenoma and less likely malignant involvement.
Increased bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis and/or consolidation.
No foci of uptake consistent with parathyroid tissue are seen on either image.
Again, no foci of uptake consistent with parathyroid tissue are seen on either image.
There are post-operative changes including small gas collections.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
The intensely avid midline mass is surgically absent.
There is no evidence of residual tissue related to that mass, and there is no other mass identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old woman with past medical history of etoh abuse, primary hyperparathyroidism s/p left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection in [**2127**], AF and sCHF p/w hypercalcemia, [**Last Name (un) **], elevated troponin, ruled out for ACS with hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
She presented with significantly high Ca and elevated PTH > 1300.
She subsequently underwent further imaging with thyroid ultrasound and parathyroid scan which showed a large left parathyroid adenoma.
T spine and L spine did not show any fractures, lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Her previous left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection operative reports and surgical pathology from [**Hospital3 **] were reviewed among her inpatient and outpatient endocrinologists, surgery, and radiology.
The decision was made to pursue  an exploratory surgery for resection of the neck tumor on [**2134-6-30**] rather than FNA alone, for concern of possible seeding if it were to be a malignant tumor and the ultimate goal of treatment.
Pt was maintained on IVF and intermittent lasix dosing, to gently diurese and allow for slow calcium excretion.
Her normocalcemia was most likely secondary to surgery but could be also due to the cinacalcet.
#Respiratory failure: After extubation from surgery, patient developed respiratory distress with O2 sat approaching 60% and hypotension with BP 80s/50s.
The etiology of hypoxemia was unclear.
Most likely diagnosis was post-op apnea from anesthesia.
Hypotension was unlikely acute coronary syndrome with troponin downtrending since admission.
Felt most likely related with hypoxia vascular constriction causing right heart strain, in the setting of severely impaired LVEF.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF.
Patient has history of cardiomyopathy with EF=30% in [**2130**].
Exam consistent with right-sided failure at admission (JVD, LE edema) and repeat echocardiogram showed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and EF = 25%.
She received large volume IVF for treatment of hypercalcemia with frequent dosing of Lasix.
Her CT neck/torso revealed pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and anasarca.
She was restarted on 40 mg PO Lasix and 6.25 mg PO carvedilol, but her blood pressure dropped to the 80's, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
# Elevated troponin: Patient had TropT = 0.13 at arrival.
She did not have cardiac complaints.
It is thought that elevated troponin was likely due to decreased clearance in setting of heart failure.
# Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease.
# Altered mental status/Delirium.
She presented with lethargy and some confusion.
However, she remained somewhat lethargic with decreased motivation while on the medicine floor.
# Macrocytic anemia.
She was noted to have increased reticulocyte counts.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Atrial fibrillation on warfarin.
# Seizures.
Patient reports history of seizures when she was drinking EtOH.
# Type 2 Diabetes.
She is discharged on her home anti-diabetic agents except for metformin given her kidney disease and Cr 1.5 on discharge.
# History of Breast Cancer, s/p left mastectomy.
# GERD: Stable.
Warfarin 2 mg PO DAILY16   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Primary Hyperparathyroidism R-sided heart failure  Secondary Diabetes Atrial fibrillation Breast cancer Seizure disorder NOS   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted because of concern for your heart and for high calcium levels in your blood.
Tests determined that you have a condition called primary hyperparathyroidism.
The endocrine experts evaluated you and suggested further imaging which found a parathyroid adenoma.
You had a surgery to remove the adenoma and your blood levels were checked daily.
