Admission Date:  [**2142-3-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-3-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-3-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea and fatigue.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma that was diagnosed at the age of 17 and was treated with MOPP and radiation therapy to the left lung which resulted in progressive fibrosis.
She had been doing well and was in her usual state of health until she began to note fatigue and eventually more difficulty breathing over the course of two months prior to this admission.
She also noticed bilateral lower extremity edema which she had never experienced before.
She presented to the Emergency Department where a chest computed tomography showed a large right-sided pleural effusion with mediastinal shift to the left.
She was admitted to [**Hospital6 733**] Medicine for diuresis on [**2142-3-3**] and became increasingly dyspneic and disoriented that night with an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.27, PCO2 of 86, and a PO2 of 81 requiring transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, she was a thin ill-appearing female but pleasant, and in no apparent distress.
Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Her lungs revealed decreased breath sounds in the entire left lung field when compared to the right.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.
Extremity examination at this time revealed no pedal edema.
There, she received a Cardiology consultation for her dyspnea and found new heart failure.
She had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed tricuspid regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
She did briefly transfer out to the floor but then went back to the Intensive Care Unit for hypercarbia to 120 on arterial blood gas as well as mental status changes.
She also had a bronchoscopy on [**3-9**] which showed no significant airway narrowing.
She was continued on diuresis at this point but was switched to furosemide for a rash that seemed to be due to the spironolactone.
and remained even with her intake and output.
RASH ISSUES:  The patient did develop a maculopapular rash on her abdomen and chest.
New diagnosis of right heart failure secondary to high pulmonary artery pressures to the lungs bilaterally.
Right-sided pleural effusion; improved with diuresis.
She did exhibit some desaturations with ambulation, and this will be worked on with greater conditioning at rehabilitation.
