CT head [**2114-10-14**] IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic microvascular ischemic change and several remote lacunar infarcts in the right basal ganglia.
CXR 's [**10-14**]: The marked interval changes are predominantly focused within the left lower lung with patchy opacity and air bronchograms and associated pleural effusion.
Given history of altered mental status, an infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
There is known underlying emphysema, and as such, pulmonary edema may have unusual distributions.
If not present, this may be an atypical manifestation of edema and repeat radiography following diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
[**10-15**]:Bilateral increasing pleural effusions, left worse than right.Bibasilar atelectasis.
Underlying pneumonia in left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
Tortuous right chest tube.
[**10-17**]: Grossly unchanged appearance of the chest with left lower lobe consolidation which might be a combination of atelectasis and infection.
[**10-21**]:Accounting for technical and positional differences, there is no significant interval change.
Persistent bilateral effusions and retrocardiac density again noted.
EKG's [**10-14**]: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Probable prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to prior tracing of [**2114-10-5**] no diagnostic interim change.
Slow R wave progression.
Cannot exclude underlying anterior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
[**10-19**]: Atrial fibrillation with a relatively rapid ventricular response of about 105 beats per minute.
Echocardiography [**10-19**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Inferior hypokinesis is suggested, but due to varying R-R interval and resting tachycardia, this is not confirmed.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-8-3**] the degree of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension detected have increased.
Inferior hypokinesis is suggested but not confirmed.
Cultures: Blood Cultures: negative UCx: >100,000 enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin Legionella Urinary Antigen: negative UA: no WBC, no nitrites, no RBC's   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30984**] is an 84 year-old with atrial fibrillation, COPD, metastatic colon cancer to liver and recurrent right pleural effusions who initially presented on [**10-14**] with altered mental status and was admitted to the hospital wards.
He was first transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with respiratory distress on the day of admission.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient developed GI bleeding.
After discussion with the family, it was decided not to escalate care (no pressors, FFP, IVF or transusions) and the patient died on [**2114-10-21**].
# Mental status change: Initially admitted on [**10-14**] with concerns of changing mental status, difficulty ambulating and increasing shortness of breath.
He was noted to have mycoclonus on exam consistent with hypercarbia and elevated bicarbonate.
He was also found to have a pneumonia and UTI which along with hypercarbia likely contributed to his altered mental status.
His pneumonia and UTI were treated with antibiotics - Zosyn and Vancomycin.
However, he then developed atrial fibrillation w/RVR, and theophylline was discontinued.
His mental status waxed and waned during his hospital stay with occaisonal agitation treated with Haldol and then Zydis.
# Respiratory Distress: The patient was admitted to the hospital wards but developed respiratory distress with tachypnea and SaO2 72%.
His respiratory distress was thought to be multifactorial with end-stage COPD, peumonia, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
ABG's showed chronic respiratory acidosis with significant hypercarbia compensated by high bicarbonate levels.
He received IV lasix dialy and PRN with some improvement of pulmonary edema.
An echo was obtained to evaluate heart function and found an EF >55% but severe MR which may have contributed to pulmonary edema.
His pneumonia was treated with Zosyn and Vancomycin.
An attempt was made to drain his pleural effusions via his right pleurex catheter but no fluid was obtained; per family, his VNA had also been unable to obtain fluid on the last visit prior to hospitalization.
They also felt that his desaturations were not secondary to pleural effusions but rather from pulmonary edema and lymphangitic spread and pneumonia.
In addition, it was noted that his CXR showed relatively little pleural effusion on the right side of his chest and a significant amount of pleural effusion on his left side.
Due to an elevated INR, thoracentesis was not immediately performed.
And, on further disccusion with the family, it was decided not to perform left chest thoracentisis because of bleeding risk, limited benefit and likely rapid reaccumulation.
Given his respiratory distress and severe hypercarbia, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was offered although the patient's underlying lung disease or respiratory distress were unlikely to resolve.
His respiratory distress stabilized enough at the end of his first [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for him to be briefly transfered to the floor on NC 4L.
#Anemia: The patient was admitted with chronic iron deficiency anemia secondary to colon cancer.
On [**10-20**], he was noted to have a decreased HCT 21->17.
He was found to be guiac positive with dark stool suggestive of a GI bleed given the setting of a high INR and colon CA.
He was initially typed and screened for transfusion, given vitamin K and given IVF as his blood pressure began decreasing and his mental status worsened.
His respiratory status did not permit EGD or colonoscopy without intubation.
All anti-hypertensives and atrial fibrillation rate controlling medications were held due to low blood pressures.
An EKG showed afib with depressions in V4-V6 as complared to old.
At the time, the patient also complained of chest pain.
# Leukocytosis: On admission, his WBC was found to be great than 30 but then trended down to 18.5 today with treatment of PNA and UTI.
# Enterococcal UTI: UA was bland but Urine Culture grew enteroccocus.
Given the patient's change in mental status, he was placed on Vancomycin .
A speech/swallow evaluation showed no "overt" aspiration but could not rule out silent aspiration.
Based on clinical exam while drinking, he most likely had silent aspiration and was at risk for aspiration pneumonitis/ PNA.
# Colon CA: No treatment was given for his metastatic colon CA but morphine PRN was administerd for abdominal pain.
