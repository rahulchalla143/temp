Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 62558**] was a 46 year-old male with a history of HIV who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2178-1-13**] with SOB and nonbloody diarrhea and a CD4 count of 19 (pt off HAART for 1.5 year).
He [**Month/Day/Year **] underwent BAL with diagnosis of PJP and CMV pneumonitis which were treated with bactrim and steroid taper and Gancyclovir.
In addition he recieved treatment for Giardia, thrush, HSV type II skin lesion and hospital aquired pneumonia.
He also developed recurrent Hep B infection and was therefore started on HAART therapy.
His hospital course was complicated by bilateral apical pneumothoraxes and pneumomediastinum.
Unfortunately Mr. [**Known lastname 62558**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] developed increasing oxygen requirement and mental status change which required his transfer to the ICU.
In the ICU he was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, mechanically ventilated and a right chest tube was placed to prevent tension pneumothorax in the setting of known pneumothorax and positive pressure ventilation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 90417**] ICU course was complicated by septic shock, renal failure, non resolving right bronchopleural fistula, pancytopenia and ARDS.
Our attempts to wean off oxygen and pressors were to no avail.
Given his multi-organ failure, his profound immune supression and his poor underlying nutritional status it was felt that he no longer had realistic chance of recovery.
The cheif cause of death was Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, the immediate cause of death was Respiratory Failure.
