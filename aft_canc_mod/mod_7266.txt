She subsequently went into respiratory distress and lost her pulse.
She was given IV vancomycin in the ED with plan to give cefepime and flagyl to empirically cover for infection with CXR showing bilateral intersitial and alveolar process on my read.
Past Medical History: Cerebrovascular accident history chronic hepatitis B and alcoholic cirrhosis and possible HCC by US in [**2192**] and varices by CT in [**2195**] Type 2 diabetes mellitus Hypertension Sclerosed papilloma in right breast   Social History: Not obtained, patient intubated on arrival  Family History: Not obtained, patient intubated on arrival  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: cooling protocol, BP 88/67, HR 61, RR 20, SpO2 95% Patient intubated and sedated RRR, no m/r/g clear lungs b/l chronic contractures right upper and lower extremities .
There is no evidence of displaced rib fracture or pneumothorax.
There is diffuse asymmetrically distributed central opacification, left greater than right.
There are no large pleural effusions.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours demonstrate tortuosity of thoracic aorta and enlargement of the main pulmonary artery.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Diffuse asymmetrically distributed left greater than right central opacification, for which differential includes an acute pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, aspiration or infection.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4300**] is an 83 year old female with past medical history significant for stroke, chronic hepatitis B and alcohol abuse complicated by cirrhosis, varices and hepatoma who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after having aspiration event leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with successful return of spontaneous circulation after CPR and epinephrine x 4. .
# PEA arrest status post cooling protocol: The cause of her PEA arrest was likely due to witnessed aspiration event.
However, over the next 72 hours of the cooling protocol her neurologic function declined and she did not have brainstem reflexes on exam.
Once re-warming was initiated, she experienced another episode of near cardiac arrest and underwent defibrillation in the ICU.
As per rewarming protocol, an EEG was also placed, demonstrating severe anoxic encephalopathy.
The patient remained pressor dependent after being rewarmed, and remained intubated.
# Shock liver: The patient had a transaminitis in the 1000s, consistent with shock liver, with an INR that peaked at 6.2. .
# Acute renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely related to her episodes of hypotension, with a creatinine that peaked at 2.1. .
# Hep B/Alcoholic cirrhosis: For her Hep B and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by varices/hepatoma, her nadolol and lamivudine were not continued in the hospital.
# Aspiration pneumonia:  Because the patient's cardiac arrest was likely related to her aspiration event, upon arrival to the hospital, she was treated with vanc/zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.
Medications on Admission: Not obtained on admission because she was intubated and sedated  Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Expired secondary to neurologic failure from prolonged hypoxia in the setting of out of hospital cardiac arrest  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: Expired
