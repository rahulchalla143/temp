Admission Date:  [**2151-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-2-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-4-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Aztreonam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation [**2151-2-15**] Bronchoscopy Extubation on [**2151-2-17**]   History of Present Illness: 65M h/o multiple myeloma, amyloid, s/p autologous stem cell transplant [**2149**], on HD for renal failure with hemoptysis x 1 day x 3 episodes.
Patient came into [**Location (un) 86**] from [**State 108**] for an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and was found to be coughing blood, with hypoxia, and chest pain.
He had also had a cough back in [**Month (only) 1096**], whcih was trated wtih antibiotics.
He has never been SOB int he past, and does not have any heart problems, or any obvious problems with bleeding.
He had a colonscopy recently which showed some polyps, but no obvious source of bleeding.
Patient was started on a heparin gtt, and intubated due to hypoxia and to get a CTA.
EKG with rate 130 with new LBBB, new ST elevation in V2-V3.
CTA showed pulm hemorrhage and no PE and ?
On the floor, the patient is intubated, but does not appear in any acute distress.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain secondary to intubation   Past Medical History: Oncology History: - Multiple Myeloma, s/p autologous stem cell transplant in [**2149**] - Amyloidosis  Other Medical History: - ESRD [**2-10**] amyloidosis - Hyperlipidemia - Restless leg syndrome - H/o genital herpes - Depression - Anxiety - s/p lens implantation (left) for cataracts - s/p discectomy - history of shoulder injury  Social History: - He works as a sales executive for luggage store, has been married for about 40 years.
- Drinks occasionally.
Family History: He has a significant family history notable for one brother with CLL and two first cousins with AML.
Father died at age 89 of prostate cancer and mother of PE and an MI.
HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, EOMI, OP clear Neck: no LAD, supple, JVP of Heart: RRR, 4/6 systolic murmur heard best at the LUSB Lungs: Patient is breathing comfortably.
HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, EOMI, OP clear, bilateral ear canals with evidence of cerum, right TM with good light reflection, but left TM not visible as it is impacted with cerum Neck: no LAD, supple Heart: RRR, [**4-14**] holosystolic and diastolic murmur Lungs: Patient is breathing comfortably.
Abd: +BS, soft NTND Ext: no edema, LUE fistula present with presence of strong thrill, left superior knee with presence of mild effusion, left knee not warmer or red, but has point tenderess, ROM intact but limited by pain Neuro: alert and appropriate.
Sinus rhythm.
Q waves in leads V1-V2 with small R waves in lead V3.
ST segment elevation in leads V1-V3.
Low limb lead voltage.
The early precordial Q waves with ST segment elevation are new.
[**2151-2-15**] CXR: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
There is perihilar ground-glass opacity which is concerning for central pulmonary vascular congestion though given history of hemoptysis, could reflect alveolar hemorrhage.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is present.
Diffuse pulmonary alveolar ground-glass opacities with minimal septal thickening at the apices and peripheral sparing is most consistent with diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage.
Dense posterior consolidations in the lower lungs are most compatible with aspirated blood.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Poor enhancement of the kidneys is consistent with patient's known chronic renal disease.
[**2151-2-16**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M h/o multiple myeloma, amyloid, s/p autologous stem cell transplant [**2149**], on HD for renal failure with hemoptysis admitted on [**2151-2-15**] and discharged on [**2151-2-20**].
# Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage: Patient has DAH as seen on both CT as well as on bronchoscopy with non-clearing vials even after wash.
Differential included cytotoxic and non cytotoxic drugs, infection, or connective tissue disorder.
Echocardiogram was performed which showed only a mild pericardial effusion, not likely asssociated with connective tissue etiologies.
BAL was not impressive for infection and patient w/o history or clinical signs of infection.
Ultimately etiology of DAH was unclear but was attributed to receiving heparin in the setting of strain.
# ESRD: Patient has known ESRD secondary to myeloma requiring dialysis.
He was started on metoprolol for control of this rhythm, but this was ultimately d/c-ed when he returned to sinus rhythm after completion of his dialysis session.
He had no further issue with his dialysis.
# HLD/?CAD: Patient has somewhat elevated tropinins (0.04-0.08), and per ED report was noted to have some chest pain.
EKG has showed variable changes in the precordial leads.
Patient is not a good candidate for heparin gtt secondary to known DAH.
Enzyme leak was attributed to renal insufficiency and enzymes were trended and remained flat.
# Myeloma: SPEP and UPEP as well as kappa and lambda light chains were sent which showed increased activity of his myeloma.
# Restless Leg Syndrome: Patient was recently started on a pramipexole.
# Depression: Continued citalopram and home temazepam as needed for insomnia.
# HTN: Initially held antihypertensives given DAH, but as patient stabilized, restarted home valsartan 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], nifedepine XL 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], Doxazosin 2 mg.  His nifedepine was uptitrated to 90 mg [**Hospital1 **], and he was informed of the change and advised to have his blood pressure monitored closely on this new dose.
Patient was advised to follow up with his physician should the pain not improve with conservative management.
9. temazepam 15 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Hg-Iron 8.8 mg as needed per your kidney doctor   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage  Secondary diagnoses: - End stage renal disease - Hypertension - History of Multiple Myeloma - Restless leg syndrome - Left ear cerum impaction - Left knee prepatellar bursitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
It was thought that the bleeding in your lung was due to a lung infection.
You have a left knee pain which is thought to be from bursitis.
However, you should let your doctor know at follow-up appointment if you continue to have pain in the area.
