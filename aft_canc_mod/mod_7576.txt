The patient initially presented with RUQ pain and had subsequent imaging noting pancreatic and biliary duct dilatation with a peri-ampullary pancreatic mass.
Endoscopic U/S was performed in [**1-/2111**] and noted a 4.0 x 4.2-cm ill-defined mass in the peri-ampullary region which was heterogeneous and hypoechoic.
Final pathology noted T2 N1 stage IIB adenocarcinoma of the ampulla.
[**6-28**] positive LNs were noted without perineural invasion.
In his third week of cycle 1 he developed some neutropenia and his cycle was interrupted - but he ended up completing 4 cycles (day 15 was [**2111-7-3**]).
Throughout his course, he had some issues with fatigue and nausea and the ocassional fever.
Around the end of cycle 4 he began experiencing episodes of fevers to 101-102F with rare and non-restricting epigastric abdominal complaints and worsening fatigue.
He also had ocassional nausea and emesis.
These periodic episodes of fever to 102F, fatigue and vague epigastric abdominal discomfort continued and he had some non-bloody particulate emesis with nausea.
His abdominal pain is a [**8-18**] at its climax and occurs in the evenings; distributed in a band-like pattern with minimal radiation and is sharp and sometimes dull in character.
Over the last several days, he notes persistent nausea, particulate and non-bloody emesis with some bilious output and lighter colored stools with darker urine.

He has had 15-20 lbs of unintentional weight loss over several months.
His son recently had URI symptoms, but he denies headaches or vision changes.
He has no nasal congestion, rhinorrhea or sore throat.
He has no dysuria or hematuria.
Exam notable for marked scleral icterus and jaundice.
A CT scan of the abdomen showed no intra- or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation and no abscess, but no PO contrast was given.
Following Zosyn infusion, he developed periorbital swelling and lip swelling and this was discontinued with the administration of IV benadryl and IV methylprednisolone 125 mg x 1 with resolution of symptoms.
Past Medical History: # Stage IIB periampullary adenocarcinoma s/p diagnostic laparoscopy and elective pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) with pylorus preservation ([**2111-2-11**]) # Migratory arthritis # Left orbital exoneration with prosthetic placement in childhood (traumatic injury)   Social History: He is married and lives with his wife and son and daughter.
Family History: no strong family history of malignancy or cardiovascular disease.
Physical Exam: On admission VITALS: 97.9   76-78  110/68   18  98% RA GENERAL: Appears in no acute distress.

No wheezing, rhonchi or crackles.
ABD: soft, mildly tender to palpation in epigastrum and RUQ, non-distended, with normoactive bowel sounds.
No palpable masses or peritoneal signs.
There was a tight angulation which the duodenoscope could not initially cross.
The scope was then switched out for a colonoscope and the biliary limb was again entered.
It was widely patent, draining clear bile, and there was no evidence of a a mass noted.
A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree on occlusion cholangiogram.
No filling defects or strictures were noted in the visualized biliary tree.
No stent was placed because of free flow of bile and contrast, with no visible stricture or filling defect.
Otherwise normal ERCP   Brief Hospital Course: 57M with a PMH significant for migratory athralgias with a diagnosis of stage IIB periampullary adenocarcinoma status-post pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure ([**2111-2-11**]) and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of gemcitabine who presents with fevers, RUQ abdominal pain and jaundice with evidence of direct bilirubinemia.
#Presumed Cholangitis - Patient presents with known periampullary carcinoma history and has undergone pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure.
Blood cultures grew gram positive cocci, he was started on vancomycin.
Speciation of the blood cultures revealed enterococci sensitive to Linezolid.
# CHRONIC NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA - Chronic normocytic anemia with hematocrit in the 36-37% range at baseline without prior iron studies.
Given malignancy diagnosis, normocytic anemia of chronic disease seems most likely.
No suggestion of hemolysis.
# PERIAMPULLARY ADENOCARCINOMA - Patient presents with known history of periampullary adenocarcinoma that was stage IIB with pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure performed in [**2-/2111**] followed by four cycles of gemcitabine therapy complicated by only episodic neutropenia.
