She has undergone bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer and is currently undergoing adjuvant therapy by you.
A recent bone scan showed an abnormality in the sternum.
On CT scan, she was noted to have a pathologic fracture involving the superior portion of her sternum.
During admission for sternal biopsy, patient developed suicidal ideation and has been evaluated by psychiatry.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old woman with breast CA, abdominal pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: obstruction, free air.
HISTORY: 59-year-old female with breast cancer, abdominal pain, evaluate for obstruction or free air.
SUPINE AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS ABDOMEN: Gaseous distended colon measures up to approximately 9 cm.
There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Osseous structures reveal degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Fecal impaction within the sigmoid colon, with a gaseous distended colon.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-5-5**] 2:36 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: assess for toxic megacolon and free air Field of view: 38  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old woman with abdominal distension & pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for toxic megacolon and free air CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 59-year-old female with abdominal distention and pain.
Please evaluate for toxic megacolon or free air.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after administration of oral contrast only.
IV contrast was not administered due to elevated creatinine.
CT ABDOMEN: There is dependent opacity at the lung bases bilaterally, right greater than left.
This appears more than would be expected for simple atelectasis, and there is likely a component of pneumonic consolidation or aspiration as well.
Absence of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the abdominal parenchymal organs and vasculature.
Diffuse anasarca has worsened, and there is a moderate amount of ascites now seen throughout the abdomen.
There is evidence of portal venous gas within the liver, and there is markedly abnormal appearance to the entire colon.
There is moderate wall thickening in the cecum and ascending colon, and there is pneumatosis intestinalis extending from the transverse colon just distal to the hepatic flexure to the uppermost portion of the descending colon in a segmental distribution.
Pneumatosis in the mid transverse colon is most severe, without evidence of mucosal sloughing.
A few borderline distended loops of contrast opacified small bowel, with small air-fluid levels are seen in the mid abdomen, but small bowel loops are otherwise unremarkable.
The gallbladder is mildly distended, but there is no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
There is no free intraperitoneal air, or abnormal intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS: There is a moderate amount of ascites within the pelvis.
Note is made of spinal stimulator device in the right abdominal wall.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild multilevel degenerative changes, including T12 compression deformity, and multiple old rib fractures are unchanged.
Pneumatosis intestinalis in a territorial distribution involving mainly the transverse colon from the hepatic flexure to the descending colon.
Moderate amount of free fluid, and mesenteric and portal venous gas.
Watershed ischemia is also a consideration, given the patient's reported recent history of hypotension.
Moderate wall thickening and pericolonic inflammatory change in the cecum and ascending colon may also represent early ischemic change, with probable lesser amounts of pneumatosis around small amounts of stool.
Bibasilar atelectasis, with increased right basilar consolidation, concerning for superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.
#)Breast Cancer: patient had recent bone scan with new lesion identified on sternum.
The day of the sternal biopsy, the patient developed suicidal ideation and was therefore admitted to the hospital with a 1:1 sitter for closer monitoring.
#)Abdominal Pain: The patient reported new onset of abdominal pain the morning of [**5-4**].
The patient had diffuse abdominal tenderness, along with rebound tenderness.
KUB was performed which showed  stool filled and distended colon.
Her distension was thought secondary to fecal impaction, and she was given two soap suds enemas followed by a small bowel movement.
The patient reported mild relief with the bowel movement.
Abdominal CT was postponed because the patient had a history of acute renal failure with IV contrast, and nausea was preventing her from taking oral contrast.
Given her increased fluid requirements to maintan blood pressure, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She had a CT scan which revealed severe colitis, so was taken to the emergency room emergently for ex lap and subtotal colectomy with mucus fistula.
