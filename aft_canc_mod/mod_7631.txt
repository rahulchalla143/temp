History of Present Illness: 57F with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma with pulmonary involvement, systolic CHF, aortic stenosis who presents with one day of frank hemoptysis.
She reports that starting today she had three episodes of frank liquid hemoptysis at home, each approximately one tablespoon.
She had two additional episodes of hemoptysis in the ED, the larger volume estimated to be two tablespoons.
She denies purulent sputum production, fever, chills.
She has no known sick contacts but says she is at the hospital constantly for appointments.
She has chronic back pain which has not been worse recently.
The patient has a longstanding history (years) of nonproductive coughing spells which lead to wheezing and dyspnea.
This has not been worse recently and she denies increased SOB or CP.
She denies orthopnea or PND.
She has never been incarcerated, lived in a homeless shelter, or travelled outside the country.
Labs were notable for INR elevated at 3.9, Hct 39.7.
CXR showed increased nodularities consistent with increasing metastases, RLL ill-defined opacity and increased R pleural effusion.
Intubation was discussed in setting of two additional episodes of hemoptysis but declined by patient.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient feels well and denies hemoptysis since arriving from the ED or SOB.

Surrounding centrilobular nodules with a few tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.
Findings may reflect superimposed infection or inflammation on diffuse metastatic disease.
Areas of ground glass are non-specific and could be infectious or possibly related to hemorrhage - correlate clinically with the degree of hemoptysis.
-New small right pleural effusion -Slight increase in the size of known mediastinal lymphadenopathy -Mild increase in size of multiple known pulmonary masses.
[**2133-10-17**] CXR: Interval increase in size of ill-defined nodular opacities in both lungs compatible with pulmonary metastases.
Small right pleural effusion has increased when compared to the prior chest radiograph, with patchy ill-defined opacity in the right lung base which may reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded.
EKG: AF 76, LVH, ST changes c/w LVH, no change from prior  Brief Hospital Course: 57F with metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma with pulmonary involvement, AF on warfarin, symptomatic aortic stenosis who presents with one day of frank hemoptysis.
Initially IP tried an intervention, but due to excessive bleeding had to stop.
Patient then went to IR to have the area of the posterior Right upper Lobe embolized.
The next day she had a repeat bronchoscopy with successful removal of the clot without incidental bleeding.
She had no further episodes of hemoptysis.
# Atrial fibrillation: now rate controlled, INR supratherapeutic on presentation.
# Aortic stenosis: unknown valve area now, last TTE in 2/[**2132**].
# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: on experimental chemotherapy regimen.
She will likely need an evaluation by radiation oncology to prevent hemoptysis in the future.
# Hypothyroidism: stable.
