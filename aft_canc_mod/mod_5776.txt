Per family, patient began vomiting 1 day PTA and sustained a fall at home due to dizziness, hitting her head.
She had no other symptoms at the time, including fevers/chills, chest pain, SOB, diarrhea or dysuria.
+abdominal pain that also began 1 day PTA, diffuse in nature and consistent with her prior presentations of SBOs.
She was tachypneic and became increasingly acidemic throughout her ED course: 7.44->7.34->7.29.
She also received Cefepime, flagyl, and repletion of her low K and low Mg. Cardiology performed a bedside TTE to rule out pericardial effusion/tamponade as an etiology of her hypotension.
Past Medical History: Stage I breast cancer (right), s/p mastectomy Ovarian cancer, stage IIIb-IV with peritoneal carcinamatosis atrial fibrillation h/o atrial septal defect s/p CABG and repair HTN h/o bradycardia s/p pacemaker  Social History: Lives at home with her husband, no tobacco/EtOH/illicits.

Hyperdense subcapsular metastasis has increased in size.
The heart size is unchanged, with no specific evidence of CHF.
No focal consolidation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 y/o female with advanced ovarian CA with peritoneal carcinomatosis, recurrent SBO, who presented with abdominal pain and refractory hypotension, hypothermia, leukopenia with bandemia, and tachypnea.
She fit criteria for septic shock and was admitted to the MICU for further management.
Presumed source was her abdomen (likely ischemic bowel with superinfection) and surgery was consulted while she was in the ED for her SBO.
She was deemed not to be an operative candidate given her extensive abdominal involvement from the ovarian cancer.
She was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all potential sources and was also started on IV steroids due to profound refractory hypotension on 4 pressors.
She had a severe metabolic acidosis on admission due to lactic acidosis and respiratory support measures (i.e.
Given her profund septic shock, we explained to the family and the patient that once she were intubated, the chance of being extubated was low.
She was kept comfortable with morphine IV prn and fentanyl IV prn for her abdominal pain and respiratory status.
