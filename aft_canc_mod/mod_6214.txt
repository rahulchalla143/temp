Soft tissue attenuation noted within the soft tissues of the right neck extending from the level of the hyoid bone inferiorly to the superior mediastinum as described above.
Nonvisualization of the inferior right internal jugular vein, which reconstitutes at the level just superior to the hyoid bone.
Adjacent focal area of hypoattenuation may represent thrombosed jugular vein vs cystic lymph nodes.
Right vocal cord paralysis, with or without tumor involvement.
Linear air-filled structure extending to the right of midline, originating from the esophagus, possibly representing an esophageal diverticulum.
Lytic lesions in vertebral bodies C2 and C3, present on prior PET without abnormal FDG uptake.
Large mass in the right neck consistent with tumor spread.
Occlusion of the right internal jugular vein but apparently related to mass effect or invasion rather than thrombosis.
