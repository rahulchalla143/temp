Admission Date:  [**2115-7-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-9-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: RUL and LLL masses, respiratory failure, VAP / post-obstructive pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotrachial intubation, bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 69-yo woman smoker with hypertension, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and a recently diagnosed RUL lung mass, who was admitted to OSH after PEA in Radiology.
The pt was undergoing an elective outpatient lung biopsy (TTNBx) of her newly-diagnosed large RUL mass on [**2115-7-4**], and during the procedure she became cyanotic, unresponsive, and pulseless.
Per the anesthesia report, there was significant blood within the mouth prior to intubation and in the airways thereafter.
She underwent bronchoscopy and was then found to have near-occlusion of the LLL bronchus with an endobronchial tumor that extends into the left main stem bronchus, with evidence of endobronchial bleeding from the right side, and also evidence of an endobronchial lesion distant into the RUL apical segments.
The decision was made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation for possible endobronchial stenting.
During the hospitalization, the pt spiked a fever to 101.4F yesterday with leukocytosis to 28.7, and was started on Vancomycin, Imipenem, and Ciprofloxacin to cover for possible post-obstructive pneumonia and VAP.
BAL culture returned with Staph aureus sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, with other culture data negative to date.
She continues to have respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, on AC 500x12/40%/5.
She also underwent flexible bronchoscopy on Friday [**2115-7-5**] that showed minimal residual bleeding, clots, and LLL obstruction.
Preliminary biopsy results from the RUL Bx are c/w small cell carcinoma.
With regards to her recent diagnosis, she reportedly had weight loss of 25 pounds over the preceding 3-6 months, and SOB.

Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T: 98.0F, BP: 182/64, P: 80, R: 35, O2:  96% General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: On admisssion: .
CXR [**7-8**]: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: .
A relatively homogeneous 8-cm wide right upper lobe lung lesion is most likely a mass.
More heterogeneous opacification in the right lung looks right middle and lower lobe pneumonia, but would obscure other smaller lung nodules.
Less distinct left perihilar and infrahilar opacification could also be pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
Poor definition of the left bronchial tree suggests retained secretions.
No pneumothorax.
Prior imaging should be obtained in order to assess the chronicity and likely explanation for widespread pulmonary abnormalities.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a possible vegetation on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
An eccentric, posterior directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic regurgitation with possible aortic valve endocarditis.
Mildly to moderately reduced LVEF.
Right upper lobe lung mass with bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy.
Contralateral left hilar adeonpathy causes obliteration of the left lower lobe artery and moderate narrowing of the left lower segment airways.
This is concerning for metastatic lung cancer.
Ill defined ground glass lung opacities likely represent infection or edema, although underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse anasarca.
No evidence of aortic dissection.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with a focal 4mm nodule, but no vegetations or abscess.
Moderate to severe (3+) centrally directed aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse aortic leaflet thickening with focal nodule atypical for a vegetation.
No abscess seen.
Moderate to severe centrally directed aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Unchanged large right apical tumor, unchanged extensive bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities with complete consolidation of the retrocardiac lung areas.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities, no pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Decreased mild pulmonary edema with unchanged small left pleural effusion.
CXR [**7-24**] :Collapse of the left lung is new, and is probably due to retained secretions because the left bronchial airway is opacified before the takeoff of the upper lobe bronchus.
Right lung shows improvement in basal consolidation and the right upper lobe mass is slightly smaller suggesting interval treatment, either radiation or chemotherapy.
Pathology [**7-17**]: Right upper lobe, CT-guided core biopsies (S10-2992, [**2115-7-4**]; [**Hospital3 85667**], [**Location (un) 2498**], MA):      Small cell lung carcinoma.
The histomorphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with small cell lung carcinoma.
Right upper lobe, touch preparations of biopsy cores (NG10-549, [**2115-7-4**]):      Positive for malignant cells, consistent with small cell lung carcinoma  Note: See core biopsy result (S10-2992) for definitive diagnosis.
Left lower lobe, bronchial brushings (NG10-550, [**2115-7-5**]):      Positive for malignant cells, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
Left lower lobe, bronchial washings (NG10-552, [**2115-7-5**]) Suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
Bone Scan [**2115-7-22**]:  No evidence of interosseous metastases .
CT Head W/ and W/out contrast [**2115-7-18**]:  No evidence of metastatic disease.
Bone Scan [**7-24**]: no evidence of interosseous metastases  Brief Hospital Course: 69-yo woman smoker with newly-diagnosed RUL and LLL masses, who suffered hemoptysis and PEA arrest while undergoing outpatient RUL Bx, transferred intubated to [**Hospital1 18**] with respiratory failure, VAP / post-obstructive pneumonia, treated for newly dx'd small cell lung cancer.
She had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR, respiratory distress secondary to COPD, heart failure causing pulmonary edema, and anxiety.
RUL and LLL masses - Newly-diagnosed, underwent RUL Bx at OSH on [**2115-7-4**] with prelim Bx report c/w small cell lung carcinoma.
Also noted to have LLL endobronchial lesion with obstruction on bronchoscopy, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for possible endobronchial stenting.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed a bedside bronchoscopy that showed collapse of the left lower lobe airways.
Stent placement was held given risk of worsening VQ mismatch and pt was treated symptomatically and for PNA as below.
The final pathology showed two primary cancers, both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.
A bone scan showed no evidence of interosseous metastases.
A CT of the head was also without evidence of metastases.
# Acute aortic insufficiency - A cardiac echo performed here showed that the patient had 4+ aortic insufficiency, which was new when compared to the report of an echo performed at [**Hospital1 9191**] on [**2115-7-4**].
Urgent CTA was performed, which showed no evidence of dissection.
TEE was performed which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
Pneumonia - Pt with fever and elevated WBC at OSH, started on vancomycin, imipenem and cipro to cover for VAP and/or post-obstructive pneumonia.
The patient was continued on steroids to treat her obstructive lung disease, also tx'd with abx and nebx.
PEA arrest - Occurred at OSH on [**2115-7-4**] during RUL Bx, as pt became cyanotic, unresponsive, and pulseless.
Likely hypoxic PEA arrest.
#  Atrial fibrillation - The patient was intermittently in atrial fibrillation.
On occasion the patient had a rapid ventricular response.
#  Aspiration - The patient had an aspiration events and was made NPO after a video swallow demonstrated that she was not safe to eat or swallow pills.
# Hypokalemia - The patient's potassium was chronically low and difficult to replete due to her malignancy, likely ACTH production, and diuretics required for her volume overload.
Hypertension - continued on home diltiazem.
Metoprolol, lisinopril, and hydralazine  were added and uptitrated for BP control.
