REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: angio w/embolization for bifrontal planum sphenoidale meningioma.
CLINICAL HISTORY: A 77-year-old female with bifrontal planum sphenoidale meningioma presents for evaluation with angiogram with possible embolization.
Risks explained included bleeding, hemorrhage, stroke, loss of vision and/or speech, injury to blood vessels and/or nerves, allergic reaction to contrast material, renal failure, and death.
General anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiology service.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single-wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate with aseptic precautions.
Right external carotid artery.
Right internal carotid artery.
Right common carotid artery.
Left external carotid artery.
Left internal carotid artery.
Left common carotid artery.
FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above blood vessels demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm or vascular malformation.
Upon injection of the right internal carotid artery there is a large hypervascular mass with a large tumoral blush identified in the bifrontal region which is largely supplied by the right anterior ethmoidal and right ophthalmic arteries.
Additionally, upon injection of the left internal carotid artery, there is identification of this large hypervascular mass to be supplied by a branch arising from the left paricallosal branch on the anterior cerebral artery.
Additionally, upon injection of the bilateral external carotid arteries there is minimal tumor-related blush seen to supply from branches of the bilateral middle meningeal arteries.
Also, additionally upon injection of the left external carotid artery there is a hypervascular mass with a prominent tumor-related blush seen overlying the left frontal lobe.
This hypervascular mass appears to be largely supplied by branches from the left middle meningeal artery.
Large bifrontal hypervascular mass is consistent with meningioma as reported on prior cross-sectional images which is larger beings supplied by the right anterior ethmoidal and ophthalmic arteries and a left branch arising from the left callosal artery.
Large hypervascular mass overlying the left frontal lobe consistent with a meningioma as correlated with prior cross-sectional images largely being supplied by branches from the left middle meningeal artery.

Again seen is a large extra-axial enhancing mass consistent with a planum sphenoidale meningioma which is compressing and distorting the frontal lobes bilaterally.
There is surrounding vasogenic edema of the frontal lobes extending into the right side of the corpus callosum with marked compression of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.
There is also a approximately 3.4 x 2.8 cm extra-axial mass with underlying hyperostosis overlying the left frontal parietal lobe consistent with a second meningioma.
This meningioma shows new internal necrosis which is new compared to the prior study.
No new lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Two large meningiomas as described above with a smaller meningioma over the left frontoparietal lobe showing some internal necrosis which is new.
INDICATION: Status post meningioma resection.
Heterogeneous appearance in the resection bed is seen, with high-density material consistent with acute blood in the resection bed.
Hypodensity again seen in this region consistent with edema.
No new hydrocephalus.
Second calcified extra-axial mass along the lateral aspect of the left frontal lobe appears unchanged from prior.
High-density material now also seen within the nasopharynx.
Bone windows demonstrate frontal craniotomy defects and post-surgical hardware.
Subcutaneous emphysema noted with multiple staples in the frontal scalp.
Minimal mucosal thickening seen within the ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
Heterogeneous appearance of the resection bed, with multiple pockets of gas and high density material consistent with blood in the resection bed.
High-density material is seen within the nasopharynx consistent with blood.

Single supine radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates air and stool projecting over a normal caliber rectum.
Small amount of air and stool are seen along the descending colon as well.
There is a featureless collection of air within a viscus projecting over the epigastrium.
A single collection of air within a viscus projecting over the upper mid abdomen is unlikely to represent the stomach.

INDICATION: 77-year-old female with large meningioma with dilated left pupil, assess for herniation.
FINDINGS: Again seen is a large calcified left frontal parietal mass previously described as a meningioma.
Hyperdensity at the anterior medial aspects is consistent with hemorrhage and is unchanged.
Vasogenic edema has increased resulting in increased rightward subfalcine herniation, now 6 mm and compression of the left lateral ventricle.
Suprasellar cistern is effaced and there is mild compression on the brainstem indicating transtentorial herniation.
Patient is status post bifrontal craniotomy with small amount of expected pneumocephalus and extraaxial fluid, which represents hemorrhage.
Evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated edema and local sulcal effacement is seen in the bifrontal lobes anteriorly.
Increased mass effect from vasogenic edema and hemorrhage surrounding calcified left frontal parietal meningioma has resulted in an increased rightward subfalcine herniation and compression on the left lateral ventricle and near complete effacement of the suprasellar cistern resulting in new transtentorial herniation.
There may be mild compression of the brainstem.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there is persistent mixed frequency theta and delta frequency slowing seen over the right frontal and central regions.
ABNORMALITY #2: There is some voltage asymmetry between the two hemispheres with decreased voltage noted over the left anterior quadrant.
ABNORMALITY #4: Intermixed with the already slow and disorganized background are brief intermittent bursts of moderate amplitude mixed frequency slowing.
SLEEP: There were no clear transitions or change in state noted.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to persistent focal slowing in the right fronto-central region suggestive of an area of underlying subcortical dysfunction.
In addition, there was a voltage asymmetry of decreased amplitudes noted over the left anterior quadrant suggestive of a structural or destructive process in that region.
The background rhythm was also slow, disorganized, and poorly reactive with admixed bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing suggestive of a mild global diffuse encephalopathy.
This suggests ongoing bilateral subcortical or deeper midline dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the most common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no clearly epileptiform discharges and no electrographic seizures were seen.

Status post bifrontal craniotomy and partial resection of tumor, returned into the ICU for signs and symptoms herniation ameliorated with mannitol and Decadron.
Persistent hyponatremia, status post treatment with hypertonic saline.
The edema and midline shift associated with this lesion are unchanged."
FINDINGS: The large heavily calcified lesion within the left frontal region as well as the marked surrounding edema unaltered in extent.
There is little change in the mass effect exerted upon the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the left lateral ventricle.
There is approximately 5 mm rightward subfalcine herniation seen.
The subfrontal lesion, as before, is quite difficult to discern, but there does appear to be residual edema, which persists after the extensive resection.
A small bifrontal extraaxial fluid filled compartment, which appears contiguous to and subjacent to the large frontal craniotomy flap appears unaltered in size.
No other new extracranial abnormalities are discerned.
A left internal jugular catheter terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins, as before.
There is increased left basilar opacity, without pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion.
Increased left basilar opacity, compatible with a pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis or pneumonia.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific lateral repolarization changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy and/or ischemia.
Note:  The tumor lacks any atypical features including necrosis, sheeting and prominent nucleoli.
