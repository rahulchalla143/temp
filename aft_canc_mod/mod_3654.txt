Depressed left ventricular function.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Complex atheroma in the ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
1-cm angiomyolipoma in the left kidney.
Mildly elevated RIs bilaterally suggest of renal parenchymal disease.
Bilateral tardus parvus waveforms of the main renal arteries.
Ultrasound cannot exclude bilateral renal artery stenosis.
The previously demonstrated interstitial edema currently has been progressed involving both interstitium and alveolar space.
There is also increase in left retrocardiac atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old chinese speaking gentleman with CAD w/BMS and DES, AS, presenting as OSH transfer in diastolic CHF in context of severe AS.
Acute on Chronic diastolic heart failure:  Patient presented to OSH with SBPs > 230 and flash pulmonary edema and was intubated.
Coronary Artery Disease: Patient with 2v disease, s/p BMS in LCx and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 in LAD one week ago.
Patient with EKG changes (ST depressions in precordial lateral leads) suggestive of demand ischemia, with old RBBB.
This elevation in troponin is likely related to subendocardial ischemia in the setting of increased demand.
Pt had GI bleeding in setting of elevated PTT, and so heparin stopped and pt was transfused 1u pRBCs.
ACE inhibitor was held due to renal failure.
Hypertensive urgency in setting of Severe AS likely precipitated CHF, with dietary indescretions.
MSSA Bacteremia: Pt found to be febrile, pancultured and found to have MSSA bacteremia.
Pt had a TEE negative for vegetations and will thus require at 2-4 weeks of antibiotics course.
Pt was extensively counseled on need for low sodium diet.
Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia: The patient remained stable with a mild anemia and thrombocytosis.
