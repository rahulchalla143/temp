He was then re-admitted from [**2-18**] - [**2-22**] with bleeding from a midline site.
This admission was complicated by pancytopenia (PLT as low as 49; HCT as low as 24.6; WBC as low as 3.2), coagulopathy (INR 1.5) and an ESBL Klebsiella UTI - this was treated meropenum.

Non bleeding angioectasia in the mid small bowel.
Several non bleeding red spots in the mid and distal small bowel and terminal ileum of unclear clinical significance.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 man with a history of multiple myeloma who presents with anemia, thrombocytopenia and melena.
His GI bleeding was thought to be secondary to known small bowel AVM's (seen on capsule study on prior admission for GIB in [**2-7**]), in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia.
GI was consulted and were considering a repeat enteropscopy while in the ICU but the patient was in severe pain ([**2-1**] multiple myeloma) this was deferred.
After further discussion with the patient's oncologist at the [**Hospital3 328**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**], it was decided that further invasive studies to work up the GI bleeding would likely not yield any change in management since his bleeding is likey from AVMs which are difficult to control.
Multiple regimens were tried to treat his pain, with the final regimen being Fentanyl patch for long acting analgesic, with short acting dilaudid for breakthrough.
Early in the morning on [**2116-3-30**], the patient acute spiked a fever to 105, became tachycardic and hypotensive, along with further BRBPR.
When his family arrived the IVF boluses were stopped and IV morphine was given instead of the oral dilaudid for pain and discomfort.
