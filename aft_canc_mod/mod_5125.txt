The pt denied pain, dizzyness or lightheadedness at that time.
He also denied chest pain and shortness of breath.
The pt received 40 IV protonix, 2 PIVs and an NGT were placed and on gastric lavage by the GI service the pt was found to have coffee-ground material in lavage fluid.

# GI bleed/hematemesis: Patient had an initial upper endoscopy and was found to have actively bleeding at a GE (gastro-esophageal) junction ulcer with superimposed clot.
This was the same site as had previously bled, initiating concern for underlying metastatic or primary malignancy.
He was treated with [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole and sucralfate, and with these measures, his hematocrit initially dropped from baseline of low 30's to the mid 20's and stabilized there, without further evidence of bleeding.
A repeat endoscopy after 48hrs showed the known ulceration but no further active bleeding, as well as an esophageal nodule, again concerning for malignancy.
# Enterococcus urinary tract infection:  Patient was noted to have a low grade fever during his hospital course and work up yeilded a positive urine culture for enterococcus.
# Neck pain:  Patient was complaining of neck pain upon arrival to the floor.
Given his history of metastatic prostate cancer, an MRI C spine was obtained that demonstrated multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes with spinal canal narrowing.
There was much motion artifact given his parkinson's tremor, and because of this they could not rule out cord compression.
However, clinically the patient did not have cord compression as his strength and sensation remained intact.
The MRI also demonstrated non specific enhancement at C4-5 vertebrae, and in the dura by C2/3, likely consistent with degenerative changes.
His neurological exam should be monitered for any signs of weakness/numbness in which case further evaluation should be done.
# Parkinsons Disease: Given the patient's GI bleed, he was made NPO for several days, thus missing his antiparkinson's medications.
Prior to transfer out of ICU, he developed rigidity and worsening of his tremor, thought to be a flair of his parkisons.
# Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia: Likely myelosuppression secondary to metastatic prostate cancer versus Hepatitis C cirrhosis.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: This was not an active issue and is being managed as an outpatient.
# Hepatitis C: No active inpatient issues.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient remained in sinus rhythm, without anticoagulation in setting of GI bleed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -Upper GI bleed secondary to bleeding gastric ulcer, with acute blood loss anemia -Urinary tract infection -Parkinson's flare -Degenerative changes of cervical spine with spinal canal narrowing   Discharge Condition: Good.
Evaluation demonstrated a bleeding ulcer in the stomach which was injected with epinephrine to stop the bleeding.
