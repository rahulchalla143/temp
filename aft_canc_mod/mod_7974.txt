GI Bleed: Patient had a normal EGD in [**1-23**], history of GERD, GIB with NSAIDs, and diverticulosis but no documented colonoscopy in our system.
His Coumadin was held and he received a total of 8 units of pRBCS with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit and no further melena or any BRBPR.
EGD was negative and colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticula of the whole [**Hospital Unit Name 499**] and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids but otherwise normal colonoscopy that they do not feel explains weight loss or extensive anemia.
Patient had no further episodes of GI bleed and HCT remained stable.
A small bowel follow through was performed to rule out any masses in the small bowel which was also negative.
It was felt that he may have had a transient and minor bleed but that his MDS was a contributor to the extent of his anemia.
His profound anemia may be partially secondary of worsening MDS.
His oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she felt that he would not benefit from prednisone as this has not helped in the past, and that it was unlikely that accelerating MDS could cause such profound and sudden anemia but that this much have been in conjunction with GI bleed.
Weight loss: This seems to be due to poor appetite, chronic disease, and lack of preparation of meals.
The possibility of counseling was brought up to the patient but he refused as he says he has no "emotional issues."
I encouraged him to take supplements including boost, which he said he has been doing with some weight gain but says that he is not interested in meals-on-wheels.
In the setting of GI bleed, his Coumadin was held and he was given small doses of vitamin K. It was felt that although does have structural heart disease, is at relatively low risk for stroke in his acute setting.
Given his history of GI bleed he was continued on Coumadin but with a new goal INR of 1.5-2 and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] as an outpatient.
CAD: Patient has diffuse right and left circumflex disease.
His EKG in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] showed TWI c/w lateral ischemia which resolved by the next day and was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia.
He had no chest pain.
CHF: Patient has history of diastolic dysfunction w/ normal EF by echo in [**3-25**].
He was closely monitored given the numerous transfusions he was given, but he did not have any evidence of failure.
Given the pt's 3+ MR, he may benefit from afterload reducing medication, such as ACE-I, when acute issues resolved.
CRI: Slightly higher creatinine than baseline 1.5-1.7 on admission, but corrected with fluid resuscitation.
However, his daughter feels that he is depressed and tries to encourage to go to a therapist, but he resists.
He had no SI or HI.
Anemia 3.
MDS with hemolysis Secondary 1.
Atrial fibrillation 2.
Depression 3.
Congestive heart failure 4.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Hematocrit stable, hemodynamically stable, afebrile, no further evidence of GI bleed   Discharge Instructions: If you have any dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, bloody bowel movements or any other concerning symptoms, call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
Your coumadin dosing has now changed given your recent bleeding and your goal INR is now 1.5-2.0.
