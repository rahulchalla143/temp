Admission Date:  [**2107-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-2-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, DOE  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 99932**] is an 80 year old male with history of prostatic adenocarcinom s/p radiation in [**2097**], adrenal mass (presumed angiomyolipoma) recently increased in size, MGUS, gastric polyps, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation s/p CVA x 2 on coumadin, who presented to the ED on the day of admission with c/o fatigue and dyspnea on exertion x 1 week.
He denies any orthopnea or PND.
He has chronic LLE edema from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] cyst.
No melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis.
No lightheadedness, dizziness, or vision changes.
Of note, he has had about a 20 pound weight loss over the last few months.
His medical history is notable for prostatic adenocarcinoma treated with radiation in [**2097**].
Additionally, he has had a known L adrenal mass since as far back as [**2100**], with radiologic features c/w angiomyolipoma.
Also demonstrated on this CT were new scattered non-calcified b/l pulmonary nodules < 5 mm in diameter.
A repeat abdominal MRI done at the end of [**Month (only) 205**] confirmed the marked increase in size of the adrenal mass, additionally demonstrating at least 4 new focal liver lesions ranging in size from 6-8 mm.
His labs were notable for a hct of 26, down from 33 on [**8-17**], as well as a mild leukocytosis of 14.
An EKG showed AF, with mild T wave flattening and ?low voltage in limb leads.
He had a CT of the abdomen which revealed interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis, the overall appearance and bilateral nature of which was felt to be most c/w failure; interval development and increase in size of numerous pulmonary nodules, as well as a slight interval increase in the previously described large left adrenal mass.
3) Non-insulin dependent diabetes with peripheral neuropathy 4) Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 5) CVA x 2 6) Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance 7) Mitral regurgitation:  Last echo [**12-9**] showed EF 55%, moderately dilated RA and LA, 1+ MR, [**2-6**]+ TR, and moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Biopsy c/w hyperplastic polyps.
Family History: Mother died of breast ca at 80.
Otherwise no known cancer history.
Physical Exam: VS:  98.7, 66, 171/84, RR 24, 97% on 2L via NC Gen:  Cachectic caucasian male appearing slightly tachypneic with some accessory muscle use, but otherwise comfortable and conversant.
Neck:  JVP at approx 10 cm, no bruits.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at both bases, mild rales just above dullness b/l.
Large firm nodular mass palpated in LUQ extending to umbilicus.
Extr: Trace edema of LLE to knee.
Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
The overall appearance and bilateral effusions is most suggestive of failure.
Interval development and increase in size of numerous pulmonary nodules.
The differential includes metastatic disease, although the rapidity of the change compared to the prior study makes this unusual, and infectious etiologies, particularly given the surrounding ground glass.
The overall stability of the configuration and lack of a large change in mass makes this unlikely to account for a large hematocrit drop.
Increased opacity in the left lower lobe could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo M with history of prostatic adenocarcinoma s/p radiation in [**2097**], adrenal mass (presumed angiomyolipoma) recently demonstrating signs of malignant conversion, MGUS, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation s/p CVA x 2 on coumadin, who presented to the ED on the day of admission with fatigue and DOE, found to have new large pleural effusions, increased pulmonary nodules, mild leukocytosis, large hematocrit drop, and guaiac positive stools.
Lung/liver nodules: preliminary cytology from pleural fluid with some atypical cells.
Final report revealing mesothelial cells, blood and no evidence of malignant cells.
However, it is still possible that malignant cells were present considering that there was no other evidence of infection in tap.
However, did have elevated WBC but also had urosepsis.
Dyspnea: Dyspnea worsened with re accumulation of pleural effusions but also with increased size of nodules.
Preliminary cytology from thoracentesis results with atypical cells.
Bedside echo no tamponade.
Had worsening respiratory distress on [**2107-10-3**]/ Oxygen saturations began dropping on non-rebreather.
Patient was asked if he wished to be intubated and said that he did not want this or any other drastic measures taken.
Medications on Admission: Moexipril 50 mg qday Prilosex 20 mg PO BID Procardia XL 90 mg PO Qday Glucotrol XL 10 mg Qday Glucophage 100 mg PO TID Zocor 30 mg PO Qday Coumadin 3mg/2mg  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Expired secondary to respiratory failure  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: No autopsy done as refused by family.
