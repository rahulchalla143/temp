Admission Date:  [**2200-10-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-11-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-6-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: All allergies / adverse drug reactions previously recorded have been deleted  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**] Chief Complaint: esophageal cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: G-tube insertion Intubation for EGD showing malignant stricture Stenting of malignant esophageal stricture PICC Line placement   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 57M from [**Country 3396**] who moved to [**Location (un) 86**] [**8-/2200**], diagnosed [**9-/2200**] with stage III SCC of the esophagus admitted for PEG and concurrent chemoradiation since he has no insurance.
Pt initially diagnosed in [**Country 3396**] with throat mass and was treated with herbal remedy.
Then saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic early [**9-/2200**] and admitted for workup of progressive dysphagia and hyponatremia from [**Date range (1) 112390**]/12.
Pt found to have strep viridans bacteremia; pt unable to undergo TEE to r/o IE because of esophageal mass, so plan for 4wk course of IV ceftriaxone.
Has stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma and needs concurrent xrt and chemo for locally advanced cancer.
Pt without insurance, so plan is to be admitted for these interventions.
On arrival to the floor, pt without complaints.
Reports persistent dysphagia and odynophagia.
Pt has been tolerating PO liquid diet including puddings and ensure with occasional sensation that foods like jello or oatmeal get stuck in throat.
Pt reports 2kg wt loss over the past few weeks.
Pt also reports some feelings of anxiety after all of the news today.
Pt denies urinary symptoms, including urinary retention.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 112389**] initially presented to clinic on [**2200-9-10**], at which time he had five to seven months of pain in his throat and difficulty swallowing.
According to his report, he had an endoscopy there, but no biopsy.
Following my visit, he was hyponatremic and thus was admitted to the hospital for this and for workup of his new malignancy.
He underwent a CT neck on [**2200-9-10**], which showed some question of a mass-like lesion within the esophagus, but no neck abnormalities.
He underwent a CT torso on [**2200-9-11**], which showed proximal dilation of the esophagus with thickening of the esophagus distal to the level of the carina as well as some small pulmonary nodules.
He had a barium swallow on [**2200-9-12**], which showed a mid esophageal lesion concerning for esophageal carcinoma.
Biopsy of the esophageal mass revealed an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
He underwent a PET scan on [**2200-9-23**], which showed high-level FDG avidity at the site of the biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma as well as scattered subcentimeter mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes limited FDG avidity with an SUV mass of 3.7.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mitral regurgitation BPH Extensive alcohol/tobacco use H/o CAD  Social History: Lives with his sister and wife; Recently moved to the US from [**Country 3396**].
Family History: Father: Murdered Mother: Diabetes  Physical Exam: Admission PE: Vitals - T: 98.3 BP: 124/64 HR: 77 RR: 18 02 sat: 100% RA GENERAL: well appearing male, sitting up on edge of the bed, in NAD HEENT: PERRLA, anicteric sclera, MMM, oropharynx clear, no evidence of mucositis or thrush NECK: nontender supple neck, no cervical/supraclavicular LAD CARDIAC: RRR, [**4-15**] holosystolic murmur heard best at apex LUNG: CTAB, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi, breathing comfortably without use of accessory muscles ABDOMEN: soft, nondistended, +BS, nontender, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly EXTREMITIES: moving all extremities well, no LE edema or tenderness, no obvious deformities NEURO: 5/5 strength in UE and LE bilaterally SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes  Discharge PE: Vitals - 99.2 current and max.
Tenderness over dorsal right foot resolved.
PENIS: Retracting foreskin reveals no evidence of balanitis without candidal thrush.
No pubic discomfort to palpation or other lesions noted.
Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions with still present minimal bibasilar atelectasis and minimal amount of pleural fluid is noted.
There is no pneumothorax.
The patient has a new esophageal stent for mid-esophageal cancer.
There is no sign of perforation.
New wall thickening proximal to the stent could be due to radiation induced edema or esophagitis secondary to the new stent.
Bilateral new consolidation in right lower lobe, lingula and right middle lobe is compatible with large scale aspiration and/pneumonia.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Previously noted right middle lobe nodule is a calcified granuloma.
PET negative stellate left upper lobe lesion accompanied by calcification and bronchiectasis is likely scarring from the same etiology.
No evidence for osteomyelitis.
Tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus associated with a small right subtalar joint effusion.
Moderate degenerative joint disease of the right mid foot.
No evidence for focal abnormality subjacent to the fiducial marker on the anterior aspect of the patient's ankle.
Subcutaneous edema and small joint effusion.
No osteomyelitis.
Resolution of previous bilateral opacities.
No CT evidence of vertebral osteomyelitis, but MRI is more sensitive for early osteomyelitis.
Long esophageal stent has migrated slightly cephalad by 2 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 57M from [**Country 3396**] who moved to [**Location (un) 86**] [**8-/2200**], diagnosed [**9-/2200**] with stage III SCC of the esophagus.
Admitted for placement of feeding tube and initiation of concurrent chemoradiation in the setting of no insurance.
Previously had been admitted for strep viridans bacteremia, likely related to his MVP and treated with one month of ceftriaxone.
On [**10-11**], one day before finishing this course, he spiked a fever and BCx grew out Abiotrophia (a nutrient deficient enterococcus).
A surveillance culture subsequently grew out Capnocytophagia (GNR).
His sodium was noted to be trending downwards so urine lytes were obtained and found a picture consistent with SIADH--likely either cisplatin toxicity or from tumor effect.
He was then placed on fluid restriction, but became relatively [**Name2 (NI) 112391**] and hypotensive with SBPs 90-100s with transient runs of tachycardia.
On [**10-19**] and [**10-20**] patient had two episodes of bright red emesis with clot without airway compromise or shortness of breath.
Subsequently became febrile, tachycardic and desat'd to the 80s.
CT chest performed that noted bilateral new consolidation in right lower lobe, lingula and right middle lobe is compatible with large scale aspiration and/pneumonia.
No esophageal perforation was noted.
Patient developed RIGHT dorsal foot pain and in setting of recent bacteremia MRI was performed that did not show evidence of osteo.
On [**2200-11-1**], patient again developed tachycardia in the setting of fever and worsening leukocytosis, and there was concern for septic physiology.
Given his underlying hyponatremia presumed secondary to SIADH, and concern that fluid boluses for his tachycardia may result in worsening hyponatremia, he was transferred to ICU for close monitoring.
Renal was consulted for further management of his hyponatremia.
Patient did have LEFT ankle pain/edema at the lateral maleoulus, but no warmth, erythema, or significant pain on range of motion to suggest septic arthritis.
Patient already on Zosyn, and antibiotic coverage broaded to include vancomycin to provide empiric gram positive coverage.
Pt with persistent odynophagia and dysphagia had been limiting PO intake, resulting in weight loss.
Plan for feeding tube as esophageal tumor causing high grade obstruction of esophagus.
Pt started concurrent chemoradiation as an inpatient since he has no insurance.
Pt underwent EBUS [**10-6**] which showed no evidence of endobronchial lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: # SCC of the esophagus: In addition to the management outlined above, he remained in the hospital until [**11-15**] and completed another round of chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU without complications.
By the time of discharge, he has only 3 radiation sessions remaining.
# Urinary retention: By the time of discharge, he had successfully passed a voiding trial on tamsulosin and no longer required a foley catheter.
# G-tube site: On [**11-14**], minor white-yellow thin drainage was noted around the G-tube site associated with 2-3mm of erythema and induration.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  # G-tube site drainage: Stable.
# BACTEREMIA/ENDOCARDITIS: Found on bl cx during admission in early 8/[**2200**].
Plan for 4wk of ABX to stop [**2200-10-12**] because unable to get TEE to r/o IE because of esophageal mass.
On [**10-11**] pt grew out GPCs later speciated as Abiotrophia, a nutrient deficient Enterococcus.
Repeat TEE showed tricuspid leaflet thickening so this was switched to Amp/Gent.
Surveillance culture subsequently grew a GNR later speciated as Capnocytophagia and so antibiotics were broadened to Gentamycin/Zosyn.
Unclear source for these bacteria, but ID suspects it may have to do with translocation of oropharyngeal flora across esophageal tumor.
There was some concern for osteomyelitis as well given left and right ankle swelling and pain on separate occasions.
Additionally, while on vanco he had developed some additional renal insufficiency and worsening anterior chest rash - these improved after discontinuing the vanco and liberalizing his fluids.
# HEMATEMESIS: At baseline patient had normocytic anemia with iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
On [**10-20**] patient developed hematemesis of bright red blood and clots also with blood found on G-tube draws during residual checks.
The clot was removed and revealed a malignant stricture that could not be traversed along with what appeared to be a necrotic central lumen that had some associated red blood (likely source of bleeding).
This was not intervened upon because did not have significant active bleeding and any intervention would have likely been short lived with re-bleeding to follow.
He remained stable without any episodes of hematemesis for the 5-6 days prior to discharge.
# HYPOTENSION-->SEPSIS: Patient's baseline is SBP 140s but over course of admission ran mostly in 100-110s.
He had 3 trigger events for SBP to the 90s.
On [**10-23**] became tachycardic to the 140s with fever spiking to 102 and continuing relative hypotension with SBP in the 100s.
He remained borderline tachycardic in the high 90s and low 100s, though without any drop in his blood pressure.
# HYPONATREMIA: Patient developed hyponatremia that trended down to nadir of 128 a few days after cisplatin dosage on [**10-7**].
Urine lytes showed high osmolality and salt wasting and this was eventually attributed to SIADH from cisplatin effect.
Throughout this admission there was a balancing act between hydration to treat sepsis physiology and fluid restriction for SIADH.
# Urinary Retention: 2 days prior to discharge, he developed urinary retention > 900ccs in the setting of having discontinued his doxazosin for his blood pressure.
Urinary retention managed with Foley as above.
# H/o CAD: continued daily aspirin  Transitional Issues: # Radiation therapy: Will receive for the next 2 weeks.
Anticipate improvement in urinary retention now that he has started on tamsulosin.
Brief Hospital Course: # SCC of the esophagus: In addition to the management outlined above, he remained in the hospital until [**11-15**] and completed another round of chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU without complications.
By the time of discharge, he has only 3 radiation sessions remaining.
# Urinary retention: By the time of discharge, he had successfully passed a voiding trial on tamsulosin and no longer required a foley catheter.
# G-tube site: On [**11-14**], minor white-yellow thin drainage was noted around the G-tube site associated with 2-3mm of erythema and induration.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  # G-tube site drainage: Stable.

About one month before your admission, one of your blood cultures grew the bacteria Streptococcus viridans.
Towards the end of this treatment you developed a fever and a repeat blood culture showed two new bacteria in your blood stream.
Due to there being bacteria in your bloodstream, we kept a high suspicion for infections elsewhere in your body.
Due to pain in your feet, we did MRIs of to make sure there were no infections in the bone.
At the same time we found that you had been infected with the parasite Strongyloides and so we started treatment for this with the anti-parasite medication Ivermectin.
You were also found to be infected with bacteria in your bloodstream.
You went to the ICU several times due to fear of infection in conjunction with this low sodium.
About two weeks into your radiation treatments you started vomiting blood and blood clots.
We performed an endoscopy to look at the site of bleeding and found that it was associated with your tumor.
We also found that your esophagus was very narrow from compression by your tumor.
You also developed difficulty urinating since you are off of your prostate medication due to low blood pressure.
These are important to continue taking so that an infection does not develop or become serious.
Serious symptoms to return to call your doctor and/or go to the Emergency Department: Fever 100.4 or above Vomiting blood Severe throat or chest pain Fast heart rate See below for additional symptoms to look for.
