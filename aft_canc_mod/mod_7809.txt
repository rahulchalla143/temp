Admission Date:  [**2184-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-4-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-7-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info 92330**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: SUB OCCIPITAL CRANIOTOMY FOR TUMOR RESECTION   History of Present Illness: HPI: 45 year old HIV+ male presented to OSH after having cold symptoms for the past 3 weeks.
The patient has been having nausea and vomiting and has been unable to keep food down for at least 2 days.
He's lost 25 pounds since he starting having URI symptoms 3 weeks ago.
The patient is also having dizziness and visual changes which began as blurred vision and now he sometimes has double vision.
He does not have any numbness and does not report any falls recently.
The patient has no chest pain or SOB.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
No dysmetria noted.
This could represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or a hemorrhagic neoplasm.
Hemorrhage associated with infection should also be considered in this patient with HIV.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
The hemorrhagic lesion is not in the cerebellar vermis, but rather centered lower, in the left paramedian inferior cerebellum, at the level of the obex of the IVth ventricle.
There is mass effect upon the dorsal aspect of the medulla, but no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or transpendymal migration of CSF.
The differential diagnosis includes primary cerebellar hemorrhage, hemorrhagic neoplasm (such as ependymoma) or opportunistic infection, such as toxoplasmosis, in this immunocompromised host.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-22**] 1:27 AM IMPRESSION:  2.2 x 1.8 x 3.7 cm complex heterogeneous mass with hemorrhage and enhancing tissue in the fourth ventricle, with mild mass effect on the posterior aspect the medulla, which could represent an unusual ependymoma, lymphoma or a focus of toxoplasmosis with hemorrhage.
2) Correlation with CD4 count as accurate differentiation is difficult on the present study, specifically on the diffusion-weighted images, due to the presence of associated hemorrhage.
MONDELBLATT/mtd    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: 4TH VENTRICULAR LESION (3).
Specimen labeled "4th ventricular lesion #2":  Subependymoma with hemorrhagic infarction (WHO grade I).
There is no definite residual tumor, although continued close followup is recommended to follow the area of slightly thickened enhancement.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the ICU on [**4-22**] with c/o double vision, nausea w/o emesis, headache and gait disturbance.
An MRI on [**4-22**] revealed a complex heterogeneous mass in the region of hemorrhage, and he was pre-opped for the OR.
Pt was scheduled for a post-op MRI on [**4-24**], which was not done because of radiology concerns about the MRI safety of the EVD.
Pt was being considered for discharge on [**4-27**], but when he was working with PT he developed orthostatic hypotension, which occurred again on [**4-28**], for which he was given a 1L bolus of LR for suspected intravascualr volume depletion.
