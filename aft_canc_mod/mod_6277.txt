The patient was worked up at an outside facility and presented with films indicating an approximately 2 x 2.5 cm contrast enhancing lesion, most consistent with a tentorial notch meningioma.
No history of tobacco or illicit substances.
Mildly depressed affect, but pleasant.
No diplopia or nystagmus.
No pronator drift.
There is no edema, erythema or eccymosis.
There is no drainage present.
There are a few, approximately 4- mm sized punctate foci of T1- hyperintensity (4:12, 4:11, 4:10) in the surgical resection bed, which have corresponding susceptibility artifact on gradient- recalled echo sequence, and likely represent small residual foci of post- operative hemorrhage.
On T1W MP-RAGE and SE post- gadolinium sequences, there are several small enhancing vessels seen along the posterior aspect of the surgical resection bed, seen on the pre-operative study, which likely represent normal vessels at the margin of the surgical resection bed.
Allowing for the above, no definitive evidence for residual tumor is seen.
There is no shift of normally-midline structures.
No new enhancing mass is identified.
No foci concerning for infarction seen on diffusion- weighted imaging.

Due to the excessive urine output, and elecated lactate in this setting, she was kept intubated overnight in the ICU for concerns of potential airway compromise.
On POD#1, DVT prophylaxsis was started, and MRI of the head was performed to evaluate for residual tumor burden.
She has progressed as expected in the immediate post op course with no perioperative complications.
She will follow up as outlined in the Neurosurgery and Brain tumor clinics.
