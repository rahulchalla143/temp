His last dose was complicated by shock requiring dopamine and brief atrial fibrillation, spontaneously reverting back when dopamine was changed to neo.
His current course was given from [**2-29**] to [**3-4**] and has been complicated by nausea/vomiting, encephalopathy, diarrhea, rigors, and desquamation, but also by hypotension in the 70s systolic requiring neo for 90 min on [**3-2**] and restarted again on [**3-5**], ARF with decreasing UOP (355 total cc's on [**3-5**], none on [**3-4**], + ~ 14L LOC but without detailed recording of his UOP), and progressive metabolic acidosis despite bicarb infusion.
Vancomycin was started empirically in the setting of severe dermatitis, and he has been on prophylactic cipro throughout his stay.
Because of his progressive renal failure, dopamine was added to improve renal perfusion.
His Tmax during his stay has been 99.5 on [**3-1**] with no other elevated temps, though he has been intermittently around 95F.

No evidence of erosions or dystrophic calcification.
Small bowel dilation without a clear transition point to suggest mechanical obstruction.
A 7 cm segment of small bowel wall thickening may represent ischemia, infection, or inflammation.
Metastatic disease, incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast study.
Bibasilar consolidative opacity concerning for pneumonia 5.
Florid colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Decrease in size of right adrenal nodule suggestive of response to therapy.
Extensive therosclerotis including coronary artery, abdominal aorta and mesenteric vessels.
Near-complete interval resolution of the enhancing lesion within the left anterior temporal lobe.
Only minimal residual enhancement and FLAIR signal hyperintensity persist.
No new enhancing lesions are identified.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TTE [**2124-3-8**]:  IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the left ventricle.
There is minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, which can be consistent with impaired ventricular filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the heart rate.
There is no frank tamponade seen.
No evidence of endocarditis although the valves are not well seen.
The patient remains tachycardic but is now in atrial fibrillation.
The size of the pericardial effusion is similar  Renal Ultrasound [**2124-3-6**]: 1.
No hydronephrosis of the right kidney.
CXR [**2124-3-6**]: Lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature more engorged, and distended mediastinal veins, unchanged, pointing toward volume overload or cardiac decompensation.
A more focal opacity at the left lung base laterally would be better evaluated after hemodynamic status is optimized.
It could be a small region of infection or infarction, pleural effusion, or transient atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
CT head/chest non-con [**2124-3-7**]:  Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left temporal lobe metastasis.
Extensive new strikingly peripheral/subpleural ground-glass opacities with a slight upper lobe predominance is highly suggestive of drug-induced toxicity (likely IL-2 drug-induced eosinophilic lung disease).
Persistent findings suggestive of vascular engorgement with mild interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
No significant interval change to some of the previously noted metastatic lesions with many of the previously noted foci obscured by the new lung parenchymal opacities.
Slight enlargement of prevascular lymph nodes can be seen in the setting of underlying pulmonary edema/elevated CVP.
CXR [**2124-3-8**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, a new central venous access line has been inserted over the left anterior jugular vein.
There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
Also unchanged is the size of the cardiac silhouette and the bilateral multifocal parenchymal opacities.
The retrocardiac opacity could have minimally increased in the interval.
Lower Extremity U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
BAL:  Bronchial lavage, right mid lobe:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, and   neutrophils; no viral inclusions noted.
CXR [**2124-3-11**]: Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 48 mm from the carina, standard placement for patient of this size.
Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, more pronounced in the perihilar right lung has progressed could by virtue of asymmetry be pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema, although pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
Moderate right pleural effusion is stable.
Right jugular line ends in the low SVC, left jugular line in the mid SVC, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Mediastinal widening in the right lower paratracheal station is due to a combination of adenopathy and venous engorgement.
There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.

Shock: Felt initially most likely due to sepsis and he was covered broadly with antibiotics.
Linezolid replaced vancomycin for VRE bacteremia.
He did not have further hypotension after transfer to the oncology floor.
# MRSA/VRE bacteremia: S/p line removals; Patient completed 15 day course of linezolid.
Antibiotics were d/c'd on [**3-25**] and patient has been stable, afebrile without leukocytosis since.
# partial/early SBO: On [**3-25**] patient developed worsening abdominal distention and confusion.
This early SBO was likely due to narcotics though concerning that is ongoing and limiting nutrition.
There was initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic positive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd findings, so GI and surgery were consulted.
# Anemia: likely multifactorial due to poor nutrition, acute nutrition, and marrow suppression.
Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] did have guiaic positive stools during admission which should be followed-up  by gastroenterology as an outpatient.
# thrombocytopenia: Resolved.
#  Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated electively in setting of persistent hypervolemia and renal failure.
Patient likely had IL-2 induced renal injury, with possible ischemic acute tubular necrosis.
Patient was showing signs of uremia and hypervolemia, and continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis was started following intubation and placement of HD line.
On the last days of admission he did not require diuresis and continued to auto-diurese with a creatinine of 1.1-1.3.
#  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response- Occurred on morning of [**2124-3-7**].
Cardiac enzymes were flat, lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
Repeat TTE showed no right heart strain.
HA/MS changes: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2 can cause swelling.
Clinical picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely toxic-metabolic.
CT head showed slight improvement in metastatic disease, less vasogenic edema.
# skin/eye/mucous membrane breakdown: Patient developed significant skin breakdown, particularly on his fingertips likely due to pressors and IL-2.
