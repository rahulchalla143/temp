A colonoscopy on [**4-3**] showed diverticulosis, resolution of bleeding, and small internal hemorrhoids.
He underwent colonoscopy [**4-8**] showing clots and evidence of recent bleeding (none active) in the sigmoid area.
The impression was a recent diverticular bleed.
At 5:40, he had an additional 300 cc of BRBPR, so plans were made for urgent transfer to [**Hospital1 **] for angiogram and embolization.
A red tag bleeding study showed a slow bleed in the sigmoid colon.

# GI bleed: Mr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] no bleeding on admssion and was hemodynamically stable.
His bleeding was likely secondary to diverticuli visualized on recent colonoscopy.
He then had several episodes of BRBPR and received 2 units of RBCs with essentially stable Hct 30-33.
PICC was placed for access given difficult phlebotomy and recurrent difficult IV placement.
On the medical floor, he had no further episodes of bleeding and remained hemodynamically stable.
# Atrial fibrillation: history of afib is uncertain.
Patient was placed on telemetry to monitor for atrial fibrillation.
Both rate control and anticoagulation were held given recent bleed and maintenance of sinus rhythm.
