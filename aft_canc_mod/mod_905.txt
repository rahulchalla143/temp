Admission Date:  [**2198-9-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-9-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-6-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Distress, Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: HPI - This is a 69 y/o Russian-speaking male with PMH significant for metastatic renal CA to brain and lungs, s/p LLL lobectomy, s/p TURP [**1-18**] prostate CA, colon CA s/p colectomy, who presents to the ED from NH with respiratory distress.
His mental status has been poor at baseline and has increasingly worsened to a non-verbal state approx one month ago.
Beginning two nights ago, the patient was noted to have some respiratory distress, requiring oxygen and was started on Augmentin for a presumed PNA.
Metastatic renal CA - s/p right nephrectomy 17 yrs ago; s/p immunotherapy in [**2193**], followed at [**Hospital1 336**].
[**1-18**] mets from renal CA 3. s/p prostate resection [**1-18**] prostate CA - [**2191**] 4. s/p CVA [**5-22**], affecting right side 5.
COPD 7.
Occasional EtOH, no illicits.
Unable to clear secretions and copious secretions [**1-18**] food noted.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck: supple, no JVD noted Chest: Diffuse rhonchi b/l, with rales in RLL.
Midline abdominal scar noted.
The calyces are mildly prominent throughout the left kidney, however, there is no frank evidence of hydronephrosis.
No stones or masses are identified.
When swallow was initiated, there was some adequate epiglottic deflection, and laryngeal valve closure.
However, there was silent aspiration to thin liquids.
The patient had difficulties following commands during the examination, and would not take cookie or straw.
IMPRESSION: Severe swallow initiation delay with aspiration to thins.
CT Head: CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with somnolence, assess for intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a large hyperdense lesion involving the left frontal lobe near the convexity measuring 4.2 x 4 cm and surrounded by vasogenic edema, with mass effect seen over the left lateral ventricle.
There is minimal midline shift to the right.
The edema extends inferiorly into the left frontoparietal white matter and the left temporal lobe.
There is no intraparenchymal or subdural hemorrhage.
There is heterogeneous hyperdense lesion abutting the right frontal aspect of the calvarium along the midline.
This could represent volume averaging.
No lytic lesions are identified.
Chronic mucosal thickening is seen within the paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION: 4-cm hyperdense necrotic mass lesion involving the left frontal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic edema and associated with sulcal effacement and surrounding mass effect as noted above.
This is most likely metastatic in nature given the history of renal cell cancer.
No intraparenchymal hemorrhage was seen.
CT Chest: Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast administration.
There is near complete opacification of the remaining portion of the left lung with only a small amount of residual aerated lung at the apical portion.
Assessment of the central airways demonstrates complete obstruction of the left main bronchus just beyond its origin.
Superiorly, there are some areas of consolidation and ground-glass superimposed upon underlying areas of emphysema, but beginning in the mid portion of the left lung, opacified lung is relatively homogeneous without air bronchograms.
An area of curvilinear calcification is present in the lower left hemithorax posteriorly and there are surgical clips present in the paraaortic and perihilar regions.
The left lobe of the thyroid gland is markedly enlarged and heterogeneous.
The superior portion of the enlarged lobe is not completely imaged on this scan, and it is difficult to exclude adjacent areas of lymphadenopathy in the left neck as well.
There is bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy on both sides of midline, with the right paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm and a left prevascular node measuring up to 2.5 x 3.0 cm.
A bulky left lower paratracheal lymph node measures 3.1 x 2.0 cm.
The left hilum is difficult to assess without intravenous contrast but there is probable left hilar lymphadenopathy as well.
There is left-sided pleural thickening contiguous with the area of homogeneous opacification in the left lower lung region.
This is contiguous with an area of chest wall destruction involving a lower left lateral rib which is partially destroyed by the mass.
Enlarged nodes are also present in the lower left paraaortic region and in the left extrapleural space.
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there are bulky lymph node masses which are incompletely imaged on this study.
A left anterior peridiaphragmatic enlarged node is present as well as left retroperitoneal node enlargement.
No definite lesions are seen within the liver but lack of intravenous contrast limits assessment.
Within the right lung, there are several small pulmonary nodules present, some of which are well circumscribed, and others of which are more poorly defined.
The largest individual nodule is a poorly defined lateral segment right middle lobe nodule measuring 10 mm on image 31 of series 3.
Respiratory motion limits assessment of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe.
Skeletal structures reveal partial destruction of the left seventh lateral rib as described above.
Healed lower right anterior rib fractures are noted without definite associated lytic lesions.
Finally, incidental note is made of a calcified granuloma in the periphery of the right middle lobe.
Complete obstruction left main bronchus.
Although possibly due to retained secretions, obstructing endobronchial lesion is likely in this patient with history of renal cell carcinoma.
Correlative bronchoscopy would be helpful.
Postobstructive collapse/consolidation in left upper lobe (status post left lower lobectomy).
Associated soft tissue mass with dystrophic calcifications, contiguous or adjacent to chest wall mass with destruction of the left lateral seventh rib.
Bulky mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy consistent with metastatic disease.
Dedicated contrast-enhanced CT torso could be considered to more completely characterize the extent of metastatic disease if warranted clinically.
Marked enlargement of left lobe of thyroid gland with displacement and compression of trachea.
Left-sided pleural thickening and small amount of pleural fluid.
Scattered nodules in the right lung, some of which are well defined and likely reflect metastatic foci and others of which are poorly defined and likely are related to the infection.
To sort out whether the patient simply had aspiration pnuemonitis vs PNA, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.
This showed almost complete collapse of the remaining portion of his left lung from a L mainstem bronchus lesion, concerning for metastatic disease.
It also showed narrowing of the trachea to approx 8 mm from an enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, which is stable in size according to his outside oncologists.
Because of renal failure (see below), the patient was switched to Linezolid to cover MRSA; CTX/Flagyl were continued to cover for ?
post-obstructive process.
Urine indicies not c/w pre-renal state, Urine Eos neagtive.
#ONC issues/goals of care:  after the Left mainstem lesion was discovered, both interventional pulmonary team and radiation team were consulted.
Both felt that bronchoscopy and radition therapy would add little to his quality/quantity of life, given his extremely poor performance status and prognosis.
#Anemia:  high ferrtin c/w Anemia of Chronic Disease.
#FEN:  the patient had speech/swallow evaluation which showed moderate-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus control and formation as well as a significant pharyngeal swallow initiation delay with mild silent aspiration of thin liquids.
