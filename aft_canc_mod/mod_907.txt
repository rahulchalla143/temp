She has had a resection of a left cerebellar hemangioblastoma on [**2144-5-12**] Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] because it was enlarging, s/p ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2147-12-5**], for impending obstructive hydrocephalus, s/p fractionated Cyberknife radiosurgery to a superior cerebellar and an inferior cerebellar hemangioblastomas, to a total dose of 6,000 cGy (600 cGy x 5 fractions) and 2,500 cGy (500 cGy x 5 fractions) respectively from [**2147-12-19**] to [**2147-12-28**],  and s/p resection of a metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the conus by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2148-2-21**].
A large left cerebellar hemangioblastoma was removed in [**State 4565**] in [**2130**]; During staging evaluations, renal tumors and liver cysts were found.
Her liver metastases went away.
She had a partial thyroidectomy.
Her systemic disease is stable.
She is not aware of any cystadenoma in her broad ligament or edolymphatic sac tumors.
Approximately 0100 the day of admission she noted nausea, ataxia and headache she arrived here after talking with Neuro oncology clinic.

10- Liver mets from renal cell carcinoma treated with IL-2 and alpha-interferon at [**Hospital6 1129**] for 9 months and tolerated it.
Her liver metastases went away.
Back well healing thoracic lumbar incision  Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch,  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: + bilateral dysmetria, difficulty with heal to shin   MRI: Large cystic lesion in cerebellum with surrounding edema ventricles unchanged since [**2-5**] MRI  Pertinent Results: [**2148-3-14**] 11:26PM   SODIUM-129* [**2148-3-14**] 11:26PM   OSMOLAL-292 [**2148-3-14**] 04:52PM   GLUCOSE-124* UREA N-22* CREAT-1.2* SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.5 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-17 [**2148-3-14**] 04:52PM   NEUTS-81.2* LYMPHS-15.7* MONOS-2.7 EOS-0.1 BASOS-0.3 [**2148-3-14**] 04:52PM   WBC-3.8* RBC-5.52* HGB-15.2 HCT-45.6 MCV-83 MCH-27.5 MCHC-33.3 RDW-17.4* [**2148-3-14**] 04:52PM   HYPOCHROM-1+ ANISOCYT-1+ MICROCYT-1+ [**2148-3-14**] 04:52PM   PLT COUNT-354  MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-3-14**] 6:26 PM MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: 1.
Interval increase in size of cystic lesion with mural nodule.
This is likely consistent with hemangioblastoma given the patient's history of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21344**]-Lindau syndrome.
The peripheral enhancement and rapid growth are worrisome, however, and metastasis cannot be excluded.
Multiple foci of abnormal enhancement primarily in both cerebellar hemispheres are stable compared to the prior examination.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-3-16**] 10:07 AM CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: Intracranial air has significantly improved with a small focus still present at the surgical site.
A very small postoperative 5-mm hemorrhage is present at the surgical site that is unchanged from [**2148-3-15**] at 10:40.
No extraaxial hemorrhage is identified.
A cystic heterogeneous structure appears unchanged from [**3-14**].
Surrounding hypodensity within the cerebellum secondary to edema or encephalomalacia is unchanged.
Small 5-mm hemorrhage at the surgical site that is unchanged from yesterday.
On [**3-15**] the patient was taken to the OR for a L para craniotomy and stereotactic drainage of hemangioblastoma cyst.
Her exam, speech, and nausea slowly improved.
On [**2148-3-20**] the patient was tolerating a regular diet without nausea, had good pain control with PO pain meds, and was neurologically stable.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: cerebellar hemangioblastoma, cystic lesion in the posterior fossa with incipient herniation.
