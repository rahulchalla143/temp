No pronator drift.
No CT evidence of a primary neoplasm within chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Small left pleural effusion with adjacent area of compressive atelectasis.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
Hepatic hypodensities are too small to characterize and most likely represent cysts or hamartomas.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
The right ventricle is not well seen but is probably normal in size with borderline systolic function.
No significant valvular abnormality.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2186-11-24**] Post-surgical changes related to large left temporal lobe mass biopsy, as detailed above, with small amount of pneumocephalus, which is likely post-surgical.
Social Work was consulted for coping and family support A wound consult was placed for the right lower extremity venous satsus.
Upon assessment at the bedside, the vascular team felt that the grafts were patent and there was no intervention warranted from their perspective.
[**11-21**] A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed which did not reveal any other cancerous lesions.
[**11-24**] patient was taken to the OR for a left frontal Craniotomy for tumor biopsy.
