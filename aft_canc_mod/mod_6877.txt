No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

The patient's creatinine initially bumped to 2.2, which was attributed to expected exacerbation of renal function s/p nephrectomy.

Recent ETT was not interpretable in the setting of LBBB and poor exercise tolerance.
However, there was a noted patially reversible moderate defect of the apical -inferior wall on MIBI.
The patient was closely monitored on Telemetry, which recorded no concenrning events.
EKGs showed no acute changes.
CHF: Dilated Cardiomyopathy with EF of 12% per recent perfusion scan.
The patient showed no signs of CHF exacerbation postoperatively.
