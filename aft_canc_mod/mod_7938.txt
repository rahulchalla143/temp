admission CXR: Cardiomegaly, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT head [**3-21**] No definite acute intracranial process.
Lytic lesions throughout  the skull compatible with multiple myeloma.
No lymphadenopathy evident.
Extensive rounded peripancreatic calcifications of unclear etiology may represent combination of calcified cysts, and adjacent diverticula or aneurysms.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Lytic lesions throughout the axial skeleton, as well as large femoral neck luceny, consistent with reported history of multiple myeloma.
Large femoral neck lytic lesion increases risk of pathologic fracture.
ECHO [**3-22**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Femur AP and lateral 1) High suspicion for a new femoral neck fracture, new since [**2117-3-21**] torso CT.
This is likely a pathologic fx through the lytic lesion in the proximal femoral neck seen on that torso CT.  2) Large lytic lesion in proximal femoral diaphysis, with endosteal scalloping, at increased risk for fx.
There is accentuated varus angulation of the intertrochanteric proximal left femur, consistent with a left basicervical fracture.
No definite acute infarct identified.
Brain atrophy and small vessel disease seen.
Chronic infarcts in the brainstem and right thalamus are identified.
routine EEG [**3-30**] This is an abnormal EEG because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and focal epileptiform discharges in the right temporal region.
These findings are indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy with focal area of epileptogenic potential in the right temporal region.
CT head without contrast [**4-6**] No CT evidence for acute intracranial process, though MR would be more sensitive for acute infact, particularly given the extensive background abnormality.
There is a minimal left pleural effusion.
Unchanged low lung volumes with persistent mild pulmonary edema.
The signs suggesting previous interstitial edema have improved.
There is no evidence of current pneumonia.
No atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO) is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.

His mental status gradually improved with treatment of hypercalcemia in the ICU and he was tranferred to the floor.
His course of the floor was complicated by an episode of acute altered mental status thought to be due to seizure and he was started on keppra.
He started treatment for his multiple myeloma with good response in his SPEP and IgG Kappa labs and ultimately decided to undergo surgery to stabilize his femur fracture on [**4-21**] which was complicated only by some mild post-operative anemia requiring 4 units of pRBCs over 3 days.
# HYPERCALCEMIA OF MALIGNANCY, [**2-25**] MULTIPLE MYELOMA ??????
Diagnosis most consistent with hypercalcemia in the setting of myeloma given lytic lesions, monoclonal Ig spike and renal insufficiency.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS ??????
Likely multifactorial toxic or metabolic encephalopathy based on exam and clinical appearance on admission.
Attempted IV naloxone infusion given opioid use and renal insufficiency which provided a quick response initially but did not clear the delirium.
CT head without acute intracranial process, only skull lytic lesions.
MRI also did not show acute process and LP did not show signs of infection.
On [**4-6**] patient had episode of acute altered mental status.
CT head without contrast did not show evidence of bleed.
24 hr EEG did not show any epileptiform featurs or electrographic seizures, however per neuro the decision was made to continue to treat with keppra 750 mg by mouth [**Hospital1 **].
# Multiple myeloma: Patient started treatment with velcaid on [**4-9**] and dexamethasone was added on [**4-13**].
Heme path reviewed CSF which had no evidence of plasma cells.
Tolerated cycle 1 well without complication.
# Left Femoral fracture:  Patient found to have pathologic left femur fracture.
Initially the decision was made to hold off on surgery given altered mental status.
He underwent palliative XRT of a lytic lesion in his femur.
He then underwent orthopedic surgery on [**4-21**] for repair and tolerated this well, only complicated by mild anemia post-operatively requiring 4 units pRBC over 3 days.
# ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ??????
# Fever - patient spiked fever to 101.7 on [**4-8**].
started vanc and zosyn for concern of possible aspiration pneumonia however CXR concerning for volume overload.
Stage 1 decub without evidence of infection.
Had RUE ultrasound which showed clot around the midline in left cephalic vein which may have caused fever.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, CHF HISTORY ??????
Presented with severe volume depletion, but no evidence of coronary ischemia.
Cardiac biomarkers elevated slightly in the setting of renal insufficiency with flat CK-MB.
No prior catheterization reports available.
2D-Echo this admission showing hyperynamic LVEF with only severe MV annular calcification and no significant valvular disease.
ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] held in the setting of initial renal insufficiency.
