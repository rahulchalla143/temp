On seizure detection files, there were between 30 and 40 electrographic seizures consisting of generalized theta frequency spike and slow wave discharges intermixed with periods of faster monomorphic sharp waves with a beta frequency.
EEG Study Date of [**2111-10-20**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It captures many prolonged episodes of ongoing seizure activity seen in a generalized distribution with predominance of the posterior quadrants more on the left than on the right.
The background activity was slow suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2111-10-19**] 2:36 PM FINDINGS: Prior sternotomy, joint chamber pacemaker, left pleural effusion and consolidation in the left lower lobe is again noted.
CONCLUSION: Left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation without change from [**2111-10-16**].
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2111-10-14**] 11:02 PM IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital craniotomy with persistent small hyperdense focus at the margin of the resection bed, which may represent residual tumor as suggested previously.
New oval area of hyperdensity adjacent to the parietooccipital craniotomy site, could be hemorrhage or residual tumor or post-surgical change.
OUTSIDE FILMS READ ONLY Study Date of [**2111-10-14**] 11:02 PM IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital craniotomy with persistent small hyperdense focus at the margin of the resection bed, which may represent residual tumor as suggested previously.
New oval area of hyperdensity adjacent to the parietooccipital craniotomy site, could be hemorrhage or residual tumor or post-surgical change.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 yom with PMHx of CAD, CHF, adenocarcinoma of the brain s/p resection in [**7-7**] and DVT/PE admitted to the MICU with new onset tonic clonic seizure and initial persistent unresponsiveness.
Per family, the patient is extremely sharp and functional at his baseline.
# Obtundation: at the time of initial presentation, the patient was non-verbal and unresponsive.
His physical exam was remarkable for clonus of his upper extremities and withdrawal of his bilateral lower extremities.
In the setting of new onset seizure, initial differential included post-ictal state, metabolic process, CVA and underlying infection.
Initial head CT showed post-operative changes, hyperdensity which possibly could represent residual tumor, edema and possible mild midline shift.
LP was therefore deferred for concern of increased ICP and empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and acyclovir) were started to cover for meningitis.
The patient continued to have improving mental status over the first several days of his admission.
Neurology was consulted and felt that post-ictal state and metabolic disturbance was most likely.
EEG was performed on [**10-16**] which was concerning for underlying seizure activity and Neurology recommended continuing Dilantin and adding Keppra for improved seizure control.
Subsequently, patient was transferred to the floor where continous EEG showed that there were seizure activities.
Patient also had numerous open skin sores and thus osteomyellitis and bactermia were also considered.
Given respirator status, congested lung sounds on physical exam and serial CXR's pneumonia was also strongly considered.
The patient remained afebrile over the first several days of admission and leukocytosis trended down.
On [**10-17**], antibiotics were tailored as suspicion for meningitis was very low considering his rapid clinical improvement and physical exam findings.
Patient was started on Unasyn for possible pneumonia / aspiration and vancomycin for possible MRSA.
He remained afebrile and was maintained on these medications until discharge.
#  Seizure: New onset sz for this patient.
Concerning that CT head shows new areas of hyperdensity as well as ?mild midline shift.
Possible mass effect and edema could contribute to sz.
After peeling back neuroleptics, he was no longer sedated and did better with her mentation.
# Respiratory Acidosis: patient initially presented with respiratory acidosis and reported desaturations on Bi-PAP.
# PAF: amiodarone was held as rate was AV paced without any signs of atrial fibrillation and initial hypotension.
# Cardiomyopathy: Carvedilol and furosemide was initially held for concern of sepsis.
On [**10-17**] Lasix was restarted given his CXR, congested lung sounds and fluid overload.
# CAD s/p CABG: patient initially presented with TN of 0.2 with normal CK's and ECG not concerning for ischemia.
This was attributed to sepsis / seizure activity.
# Prophylaxis: Lovenox .
# Access: peripherals .
