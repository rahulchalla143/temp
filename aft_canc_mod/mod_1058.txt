He reportedly refused antibiotics when awoken, then became agitated and combative at midnight last night, throwing objects around his room and screaming at his caretakers.
Exam notable for +2 symmetric pitting edema to the thighs.
Labs included normal WBC and stable Hgb/Hct, elevated creatinine to 1.9 (baseline ~1.1), normal LFTs other than alkaline phosphatase 131, INR 1.3, BNP >6700, troponin 0.04, and a urinalysis with moderate leukocytes, 6 WBC/hpf, but no bacteria.
Head CT was negative for acute process but +clivus bony lucency, as previously seen on MRI.
CXR showed new bilateral pleural effusions and worsening right sided opacities concerning for infection and/or progression of malignancy.
He had a 1:1 sitter for possible self-injurious gestures with oxygen tubing.
On the floor, he has no complaints other than ongoing chronic low back pain.
Denies chest pain, dyspnea, cough, palpitations, fevers, chills, leg pain, or constipation.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**4-/2189**]: presented to an outside hospital with severe back pain, with CXR showing right upper lobe lung mass.
PET scan revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node - [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for malignancy (report not available).
Pt declined RUL lobectomy - [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have broad contact with the chest wall - [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.
Surgery was scheduled but was canceled by the patient - [**2190-1-1**] chest CT revealed further increase in the known necrotic RUL lung mass, now measuring 8.1 x 7.5 cm.
It was in direct contact with the peripheral pleural surface, with loss of a normal intercostal fat plane between the adjacent ribs, suggesting possible chest wall invasion.
The epicenter of the mass was in the right upper lobe but crossed the fissure to extend into the adjacent right middle lobe.
Prevascular and right paratracheal and precarinal lymph nodes were again demonstrated, with a slight interval increase in the size of the enlarged precarinal node.
However, due to his poor pulmonary function, with a DLCO of 60%, it was felt that he would not tolerate a pneumonectomy.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7 (weak), negative for TTF-1.
Squamous cell carcinoma was favored.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of station 7, 4R, and R11 lymph nodes revealed no malignant cells.
Two sets of washings were negative, but brushings were positive for malignant cells.
- [**2190-2-18**]: A repeat PET scan demonstrated no evidence of bony metastatic disease.
Thus, the patient was felt to have likely Stage IIIA (T3N1M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
Required prednisone taper due to severe radiation pneumonitis.
[**2190-12-7**] CT torso showing a mildly enlarged cavitating lesion in the right upper lobe, which is now 6.5 x 4.4 cm, increased from 6.3 x 3.7 cm.
[**Month (only) **]-[**2191-1-25**]: Treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, with doses intermittently held for LFT abnormalities.
[**2191-2-25**]: CT chest without contrast showing slightly enlarged right upper lung mass, measuring 7.5 x 5.2 cm, with slightly enlarged soft tissue component at the right middle lobe bronchus, measuring 3 x 3 cm [**2191-2-22**]: Palliative chemo with taxotere, with doses held due to dehydration and cytopenias.
[**2191-4-3**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of uncontrolled nausea and emesis, dehydration, volume depletion.
Patient [**Hospital1 34676**] on [**2191-4-4**]  [**2191-4-12**]: discontinue taxotere due to intolerable nausea, emesis, decreased appetite .
[**2191-7-14**] CT chest: decreased size in primary mass, measuring 6.5 x 4.1 cm, as compared to 7.4 x 5.2 cm previously.
The previously noted thickening of the medial wall has also decreased, measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm compared to 2.9 x 1.6 cm previously.
No new nodules are present.
Severe traction bronchiectasis related to post-radiation therapy changes has mildly improved.
Severe paraseptal emphysema is unchanged.
Treated initially with ampicillin and gentamicin, with gentamicin discontinued due to impaired renal function.
He had a right internal jugular  and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for treatment.
[**2191-8-2**] CT angio of the chest showed a 4.5 cm x 3 cm thick-walled mixed solid and cystic structure in the right upper lobe corresponding to interval necrosis of treated tumor.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
Severe paraseptal emphysema was seen, along with post-radiation changes in the right lung.
There is an enlarged and irregular substernal thyroid goiter, with features concerning for malignancy.
[**2191-8-5**] MRI of the L-spine showed resolution of previously noted diskitis and osteomyelitis at T12 and L1.
There were multilevel degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine, stable, causing moderate-to-severe canal stenosis.
[**2191-8-15**] MRI of the brain showed no intraparenchymal findings, but there was a new clivus mass, most likely representing an osseous  metastasis.
-History of gunshot wound for which a large abdominal surgery was required -Hypertension, stable.
-Emphysema/COPD -right internal jugular and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath   Social History: [**12-27**] ppd x 30 years currently still smoking, social alcohol use, history IV heroin use and cocaine use.

-Symptomatic Bradycardia: There was a specific concern for conduction disease in the setting of recent endocarditis and current bloodstream infection.
Cardiology was consulted, and also commented that he may have exacerbation of the bradycardia specifically with increased vagal tone.
-Bloodstream infection: Needs 6 week treament course per ID for coag neg staph sensitive to vancomycin, which is current antibiotic choice.
Repeat TTE showed probably vegetation, though difficult to discern from previous echo findings for endocarditis.
His sister had been his healthcare proxy and had decided on [**Name (NI) 3225**] status given his endstage illness.
However, per report, patient found about about this and asked his reverend to take over position of HCP and code status was reverted to full code during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.
During this diuresis, he became tachycardic to the 140's with a 20 beat run of ventricular tachycardia.
Afterload reduction with imdur and hydralazine was continued.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr rose to 2.1 by discharge which is slightly elevated to that seen on admission.
No clear nephrotoxins at this time.
BUN:creatinine ratio was suggestive of intrinsic injury, and patient volume overloaded.
Throughout his 5 day stay on the floor (after being called out to the unit), Mr. [**Known lastname 34674**] did not require antipsychotics or restraints.
He is alert and oriented x 2, and does not express suicidal ideation or aggression.
It is likely that his earlier behavior was a component of delirium in the setting of endocarditis.
