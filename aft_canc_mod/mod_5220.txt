She was noted to have an increased resp distress and was started on home O2 Friday (3 days prior to presentation).
She had some cough productive of clear [**Last Name (un) 1993**] but no cough for the past few days.
She was lethargic and dyspnic in the car and the family was unable to get her out of the car upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], therefore she was taken to the ED.
She was given lasix 80 IV x 1; put on BIPAP, became hypotensive to the 80s systolic; taken off.
She subsequently got a CTA of her chest which showed dramatic progression of her metastases vs superimposed infection, B pleural effusions (R>L).
The CT revealed a R mainstem bronchus intubation and the ETT was readjusted.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was initially responsive to commands, but within 30 min became unresponsive, hypotensive to the mid70s to 80s.
Metastatic renal cell ca: DOE in [**Month (only) 1096**]--> local ER--> new R pleural effusion; CT with L renal mass (5 x 6 cm, enhancing left renal mass) and B pulm nodules.
Had recurrent R pleural effusions since then  She had a biopsy of her left kidney on [**2101-1-3**], which showed renal cell carcinoma vs transitional cell ca with some granular and some clear cells features and a bone scan showed some skull involvement.
This mass is somewhat centrally located; therefore, it is somewhat concerning for a transitional cell carcinoma.
multiple pulmonary nodules and also what appears to be a malignant right pleural effusion.
Bone scan was also done which had demonstrated increased uptake in the skull consistent with metastatic disease in the skull  2.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was initially responsive to commands, but within 30 min became unresponsive, hypotensive to the mid70s to 80s.
The next day, thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding drainage of R pleural effusion, and oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding her metastatic renal cancer.
It was concluded that there was a small amount of effusion in the lungs and the cause of the pts respiratory distress is due to the large tumor load in the lungs.
The pt was never stable enough to be a candidate for chemo treatment since the initial diagnosis of renal cancer in [**2100-12-16**].
Hypotension: The pt developed hypotension on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], felt possibly secondary to hypovolemia and sepsis, although afebrile on admission.
Pt was given steroid stress dose for 7 days b/c she failed the [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test.
Sputum culture showed gram postive cocci in pairs and oralpharyngeal flora.
Vanco was d/c'd after 3 days [**2-17**] no evidence of MRSA from screen test.
Resp failure was likely secondary to large tumor burden from malingancy and superimposed infection.
R pleural effusion: thoracic surgery was consulted.
It was determined that there was a small amount of pleural effusion and that removal of the effusion would do more harm than good to the patient.
The main cause of the patient's respiratory distress was the large tumor burden.
Metastatic renal cell ca was rapidly progressing.
Patient was never a candidate for chemo therapy because of her unstable condition.
Cardiac: patient did not have any evidence of ischemia.
H/o GIB: hct was stable for the most part at around 30 during the course of her stay.
