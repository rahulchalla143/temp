No definite abscess is seen, although the evaluation is more limited given the lack of IV contrast.
Left thyroid nodule.
Vascular calcifications at the carotid bifurcations.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Endocarditis also unlikely given ECHO report and negative follow up blood cultures though can't exclude with TTE.
CT of neck showed swelling of R submandibular gland w/o evidence of abscess, unlikely cause of sepsis.
We think the etiology of his MRSA sepsis is from skin infection; we obtained a skin swab of the lesion which grew staph aureus, coag +, senstivities pending.
Wound care for scalp lesion as directed.
