It is unclear to what extent interstitial opacities are acute versus chronic.
There is increased opacity at the retrocardiac left lower lobe, which may indicate a focal consolidation such as pneumonia if truly acute.
It is difficult to place these findings in context without pulmonary symptomology.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Note that MRI is more sensitive for ischemic process if clinical concern is high.
Non-contrast head CT is limited in evaluation of intracranial metastasis.
Likely chronic paranasal sinus disease with a component of fungal colonization, given high atenuatin of layering internal secretions.
No osseous changes noted.
Age-related involutional change.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE: Given his hypotension and septic picture, the patient was admitted to the ICU for further management.
Given his positive UA, he was started on vancomycin/zosyn as broad coverage for suspected urosepsis.
ICU course was also complicated by some initial renal failure (which resolved with fluids) as well as delirium.
He would like to return to the hospital for reversible causes of illness but would not want aggressive measures to prolong suffering.
