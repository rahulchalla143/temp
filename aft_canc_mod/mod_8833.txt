Her post operative course is as follows 1) Acute renal failure/oliguria: the patient had minimal output for several hours following the case.
Urology was consulted to eval for post renal causes - A renal US showed no hydronephrosis, she had no CVA tenderness, and a CT of her pelvis showed no evidence of ureteral or bladder injury.
Nephrology was also consulted to evaluate for intrinsic renal dysfunction.
Her oliguric renal failure was thought to be secondary to intraoperative hemodynamic change in the setting of existing diabetic nephropathy.
It was recommended than an MRA be obtained to assess for renal artery stenosis.
The patient was unable to get this scan due to clostrophobia and anxiety.
2) Acute blood loss anemia: her HCT fell from a preop of 30 to 26.6 post op.
Due to her age and medical history and oliguria she was transfused 2 units of PRBC with appropriate rise in HCT.
Her ACE inhibitor was held in the setting of acute renal failure.
She was restarted on her Enalapril on day of discharge  5) Dispo: she was followed by PT who felt she was stable for discharge without services.
Her PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11894**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12923**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will see the patient in follow up for continued management of her diabetes, hypertion, and renal function.
