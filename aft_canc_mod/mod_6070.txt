There, he was afebrile HR 124, BP 118/88.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia w/poor R-wave progression and TWI in V4-V6.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for PE but revealed a 2cm pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions.
TTE in ED revealed 2cm pericardial effusion w/o tamponade physiology.
He notes that he had an + episode of diarrhea this AM, otherwise denies melena/BRBPR/abdominal pain, or N/V.
He otherwise denies any fevers, chills, URI sx, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 117 bpm, poor R-wave progress, TWI in V4-V6, earlier EKG on day of admission from OSH the same except for HR of 129 otherwise no comparison.
OSH Imaging: OSH CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No abnormal fluid collections/free air; no acute intra bowel abnormalities, no evidence of pancreatitis.
No evidence of PE, Pericardial effusion ~2cm, subcentimeter mediastinal LNs, small left and tiny right pleural effusions.
CXR: negative for acute intrathoracic pathology .
========= UPPER GI: Initial scout image demonstrates a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, with associated atelectasis and consolidation of the left lower lobe.
The patient drank Conray without difficulty, with Conray passing freely into the stomach and small bowel loops, without holdup, atony, or obstruction.
Delayed images demonstrate contrast passage into small bowel loops within the lower abdomen.
IMPRESSION: No leak identified in the region of gastrojejunal anastomosis.
The afferent loop of the gastric bypass is not identified.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
============== CXRPortable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
There is left retrocardiac consolidation with accompanied pleural effusion which might represent either atelectasis or infectious process.
A smaller area of involvement is seen in the right lower lobe which may represent a focus of infection as well.
No evidence of edema is seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly consistent with known pericardial effusion.
Left retrocardiac consolidation which may represent a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54yoM w/h/o laparoscopic gastric bypass who was transferred from an OSH for evaluation of GIB and management of his pericardial effusion.
# GIB: Initially thought likely related to ulcerated surgical anastamosis, in light of recent steroid use.
He did have two small polyps removed in his colon, with path showing hyperplastic polyps.
He had no recurrent episodes of blood loss.
# Pleuritis and pericardial effusion: w/o evidence of tamponade physiology; most likely pericarditis ?
Elevated lipase which resolved within 24 hrs and no evidence of pancreatitis on CT at OSH.
No h/o recent URI/viral sx but difficult to rule out.
- cardiac enzymes negative x 2 - pain improved throughout hospitalizaiton - no NSAIDS due to GIB .
# leukocytosis: in the setting of having been on recent steroids; he has been afebrile and w/o subjective fevers.
# Polysubstance Abuse: last drink 10 days ago, no h/o withdrawal seizures - normal LFTs, but increased INR - SW consult, advised to abstain from alcohol.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. pericarditis/pericardial effusion 2. acute on chronic blood loss anemia from GI bleeding   Discharge Condition: Stable, Hct 30%.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with chest pain and blood loss from your bowels.
Your chest pain is from pericarditis, and you should follow up with a cardiologist in [**State 33977**] to repeat the heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) in a few weeks.
Call you primary care physician or return to the hospital if you have increasing chest pain, shortness of breath, fever greater than 101, blood in your stool, lightheadedness or any other concerns.
