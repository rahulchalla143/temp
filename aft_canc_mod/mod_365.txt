Her complaints of dizziness and syncope are consistent with the diagnosis of autonomic disorder (positive tilt-table test from Caritas [**Hospital6 5016**] was requested and exam performed on [**2116-2-19**] revealed "patient was progressively tilted from lying down to 60 degrees.
She developped a severe headache and began to "feel funny".
Patient also developed a rash on the back that was thought to be due to dilantin (which was stopped on [**2116-9-24**]; she had supratherapeutic levels for 2 days.. She was oriented to seek medical support in case the rash does not improve and importantly, if it is on the face.
No seizure or abnormalities on the neurological exam ocurred during admission.
Right sided subarachnoid hemorrhage without hydrocephalus or mass effect.
Small amount of left frontal subarachnoid blood is likely due to redistribution.
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage less conspicuous with no new intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Potential new focus of edema in the right frontal lobe of unclear etiology though MRI can be considered for further evaluation.
No aneurysm identified.
Brain MRI ([**2116-9-25**]): Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage reidentified with a small amount of subdural hemorrhage noted along the right convexity.
The previously noted right frontal hypodensity seen on CT, most likely represents hemorrhage within the subarachnoid space.
However, if this lesion is in fact intraparenchymal, contusion or subacute infarct are other diagnostic possibilities.
He also suggested the performance of CSF studies in a month to investigate for the possibility of the diagnosis of vasculitis.
