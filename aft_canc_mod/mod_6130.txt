Admission Date:  [**2178-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-5-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: PNA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy c stent removal  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.
In addition, she reported increased respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.
At OSH, she was found to have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent evaluation.
On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found that her y-stent migrated so it was removed was removed.
She was noted to have thrush in her trachea.
Currently, she has been mildly hypotensive this morning, but is currently off pressors thought to be secondary to a medication effect.
Past Medical History: # NSCLC - Received her first cycle of carboplatin and Taxol chemotherapy [**2178-7-9**] & Silicone Y-stent placed [**2178-7-4**] # tracheal stent placement # SVC obstruction on CT scan # GERD  Social History: per records TOB: [**11-21**] PPD for 20 years.
ventilated breath sounds.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

The mass also attenuates the right upper lobe pulmonary artery and vein and ends into the mediastinum causing atelectasis in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and left lower lobe.
Diffuse, scattered pulmonary nodules suggest metastatic disease and interlobular septal thickening consistent with lymphangitis carcinomatosa, Superimposed centilobular nodules with a tree- in- [**Male First Name (un) 239**] configuration probably due to recent infection The adrenal gland thickening is probably a metastasis.
stent culture [**7-29**]: WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2178-8-2**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who presented to OSH with pneumonia she is s/p y-stent removal at [**Hospital1 18**] and is being transferred to the ICU team for further management as unable to extubate after stent removal.
# Respiratory failure - Per the pulmonary team, the patient was intubated for airway protection in preparation for her bronchoscopy and stent removal, new stent could not be placed [**12-22**] anatomy.
Given her substantial pnuemonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure.
Pt required sedation with midazolam and fentanyl in order to remain synchronous c the vent.
Her oxygen saturations dropped precipitously and pt became bradycardic and then asystolic.
# Hypotension - Patient was hypotensive upon arrival to the ICU, possibly secondary to evolving sepsis versus medication effect, no evidence of active bleeding.
Sedation was also kept at the minimum level required for pt to be synchronous c ventilator.
# PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
Given her home steroid usage, concerned for both typical pneumonia organisms as well as opportunistic infections.
Patient was noted to have thrush in airway.
The stent was also sent for culture.
# NSCLC - Pt scheduled for q3 week chemotherapy.
This was held in the setting of severe infection.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
