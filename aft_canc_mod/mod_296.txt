Multiple metastasis is noted.
Degenerative changes in the cervical region with mild indentation on the spinal cord by bulging from to C4-C6-C7.
Extensive bony involvement by metastasis of upper sacrum and both posterior iliac bones with postop possible soft tissue extension on the left side from the iliac metastasis.
Retroperitoneal soft tissue prominence with bilateral dilated ureters.
CT Abd/PElvis: The lung bases demonstrate a small left greater than right pleural effusion.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The left kidney has moderate cortical thinning and has decreased in size since [**2136-2-9**].
Bilateral internal stents terminate in the distal bladder.
The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable without evidence of pneumatosis, free air or obstruction.
There are numerous periaortic lymph nodes from the renal veins to the aortic bifurcation, which have slightly increased in size since [**2136-2-9**], for example, an aortocaval node measuring 2.4 x 1.3 cm measured 12 x 10 mm on [**2136-2-9**].
There is increased soft tissue density along the left greater sciatic foramen and asymmetry of the left musculature as well as increased bony destruction since [**2136-2-9**] with possible involvement of the left sciatic nerve.
A penile implant and post prostatectomy clips somewhat limit evaluation of the distal ureters.
Pelvic free fluid and adenopathy which have increased since [**2136-2-9**].
Bone windows demonstrate diffuse metastatic sclerotic disease which has increased in severity at the level of the pelvis but is otherwise similar since [**2136-2-9**].
Diffuse anasarca is noted.
Increased bony destruction and soft tissue extension of a metastatic disease to involve the left sciatic foramen.
Increased periaortic and pelvic nodes since [**2136-2-9**].
Diffuse anasarca has increased since [**2136-2-9**].
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is moderate cortical thinning of the left kidney since [**2136-2-9**].
Scrotal U/S: Diffuse scrotal soft tissue edema, without fluid collection seen.
Discharge labs: [**2136-6-13**] 05:35AM BLOOD WBC-7.7 RBC-3.66* Hgb-10.9* Hct-32.8* MCV-90 MCH-29.7 MCHC-33.2 RDW-15.5 Plt Ct-203   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 69yo male with metastatic prostate cancer was admitted from the ED with hypotension, weakness, and acute renal failure.
Etiology of his hypotension appears most likely related to sepsis with genitourinary source vs hypovolemia in the setting of dehydration.
UA with 11-20 WBCs and moderate bacteria therefore he was started on zosyn presumptively.
Further management of UTI described below.
# Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to dehydration.
Cortisol and thyroid functions tests were done to rule out hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency and these were normal.
# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 2.4 on admission, trending down to baseline of 1.2 with IV fluid resuscitation.
Etiology thought to be pre-renal from hypovolemia as well as UTI.
Post-renal obstruction appears less likely given that nephrostomy tubes continue to drain.
# Weakness: Patient with history of metastatic prostate cancer with known thoracic and lumbar mets presented with 5 days of progressively worsening weakness.
He had subjective weakness and numbness as well as objective asymmetrical weakness on exam.
This is concerning for possible cord compression vs pathologic fracture.
He has chronic fecal incontinence which was unchanged.
He underwent MRI T/L spine to r/o cord compression which was negative but subsequently had pelvic CT that did show pelvis mass impinging on sciatic nerve.
Radiation oncology was consulted for possible palliative radiation, but this was not able to be offered.
# Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Patient follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and he unfortunately has been resistant to multiple therapies.
# Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Most recent A1c in [**3-12**] was 8.
Reportedly has had difficult to control diabetes with large variations in blood sugars.
# Pain: Patient continued to have pain although tolerable level.
He was continued on tylenol, MSContin and oxycodone for pain control.
# DVT: Patient with lower extremity DVT diagnosed in [**2136-3-4**].
# Anasarca: Patient with pitting edema to knees bilaterally as well as scrotal edema likely secondary to low albumin and malnutrition.
# Chronic systolic heart failure (non-ischemic): Patient with an  EF of 45% on his last TTE secondary to chemotherapy.
Patient hypovolemic and hypotension on admission.
Lasix was initially held then restarted as patient became anasarcic.
Oxycodone 60mg PO q4h prn pain 12.
Prochlorperazine 10mg PO q6h prn nausea 14.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety, insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.

Pain well-controlled   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and weakness.
We also started you on antibiotics for urinary tract infection.
We did an MRI which did not show compression of our spinal cord but did show a pelvic mass that is the likely reason for your weakness.
You were started on steroids and symptoms improved.
The following changes were made to your medications: 1) START lasix 20mg daily 2) START prednisone 60mg daily 3) STOP Keflex 4) START bactrim until [**2136-6-23**] 5) INCREASE Humalog sliding scale 6) INCREASE Lantus to 18U in the morning 7) HOLD lisinopril 8) DECREASE MS contin from 100mg to 45mg three times daily 9) DECREASE oxycodone to 30mg every 4 hours as needed for pain 10) START dilaudid 2mg every 4 hours as needed for pain 11) DECREASE metoprolol from 50mg to 25mg twice daily 12) START miralax 17 grams daily 13) START lidocaine patch daily  Please call your PCP with any questions or concerns.
