In [**Month (only) 216**] of [**2135**], she was started on dexamethasone after she presented with progressive weakness of her lower extremities and was found to have thoraco-lumbar metastasis to her spinal cord.
In mid-[**Month (only) 216**] she developed worsening headaches, nausea, blurry vision and subsquently underwent placement of a ventriculostomy and Ommaya reservoir.
Over the course of the day, however, Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 79909**] developed worsening lethargy, and by late evening was completely obtunded in the emergency department.
A CT scan was obtained which revelead a new bleed in the posterior third ventricle with associated mass effect.
Neurosurgery saw her and noted that her VP shunt was working properly; the area of likely hemorrhagic metastasis in the 3rd ventricle is non-operable.
She underwent wide local excision and bilateral inguinal node sentinel lymph node biopsy which revealed no melanoma.
[**2133-8-3**]:  Resection of soft tissue recurrence in apparent lymph node beneath right twelfth rib.
Restaging PET scan showed retroperitoneal disease which was biopsied on [**2134-2-18**] and proven to be melanoma.
Her torso CT revealed to be stable with further reduction of her disease, however, on head CT two suspicious lesion 1.0 cm in left frontal lobe and in the periventricular white matter on the left note is made of a small hyperdense focus which also enhances on post-contrast imaging, measuring in total 4 mm x 3 mm.
She underwent head MRI for confirmation  and was found to have at least [**6-8**] small lesions and well as the left frontal lesion.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 3929**], our radiation oncologist who felt she also had leptomeningeal involvement given the location of the lesions are on the surface of the CNS.
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 79909**] was seen on [**2136-7-4**] with progressive weakness and arthralgias in the bilateral legs, Right greater than the left.
This prompted MRI of spine on [**2136-7-6**] revealing a mass in the conus in T11-L1.
However, she was unable to walk as of [**2136-7-9**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cord compression.
By this time, she had minimal strength in the bilateral legs and was not able to move.
With rapid progression of disease off of vemurafenib, it was decided and she agreed to enroll on protocol 11-101 without WBXRT.
She as admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurologic observation with worsening headaches on [**2136-7-15**].
A paternal grandmother had pancreatic cancer while a maternal aunt had breast cancer.

New hemorrhage centered within the third ventricle, possibly secondary to a previously undetected small metastasis or possibly a spontaneous in nature.
Left frontal lobe region of vasogenic edema, consistent with known site of metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 79909**] is a 34 y/o F with widely metastatic melanoma presenting with HA, N/V and AMS.
Found to have hemorrhagic transformation of known brain mets.
# Hemorrhagic Transformatin of known brain mets: Pt presented to the ED and was obtunded on initial examination although would withdraw to painful stimuli.
A CT head showed a new bleed in the posterior third ventricle with associated mass effect.
Neurosurgery consulted and noted that her VP shunt was working properly; however the area of likely hemorrhagic metastasis in the 3rd ventricle was non-operable.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname 22056**] [**Last Name (Titles) 79909**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because of increasing lethargy.
In the emergency room, a CAT scan showed increased bleeding in the brain likely from a metastatic lesion.
We consulted with the neuro-oncologist team that knows Mrs. [**Last Name (un) 79910**] well and they advised us that, sadly, no further interventions or treatments are available to improve her medical condition.
