[**Name (NI) **] loss of consciousness.
No fevers, chills.
No localized weakness per family.
The patient also had poor PO intake.
The patient's symptoms worsened and the family brought him to [**Hospital1 18**].
Head CT revealed L parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
His abd CT revealed no obstruction, no evidence of metastatic disease.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: * Metastatic melanoma: - excisional biopsy of a nasal lesion in [**7-/2120**] with pathology revealing a lentigo maligna melanoma.
- Reexcision pathology revealed a lentigo maligna melanoma, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV, 1.75 mm thick, nonulcerated without perineural invasion.
One sentinel lymph node was negative for metastases.
- In [**8-/2122**], a left submandibular mass was noted with FNA confirming melanoma.
He underwent left radical neck dissection on [**2122-9-28**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] with 1 of 12 lymph nodes positive with extracapsular extension.
- [**2124-8-21**]: radical resection of recurrent metastatic melanoma left neck.
Pectoralis myofascial transpositional flap.
Non-oncologic history: HTN CKD vitiligo h/o colonic polyps   Social History: No smoking, no drinking  Family History: Non contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.6, BP 140/84, HR 76, RR 12, 96% RA GEN: Elderly man, unable to lie still in bed, frequently attempting to get out of bed, soft restraints on wrists, unable to cooperate with exam or history NEURO: Awake, not oriented to name, person, or date.
No localized weakness observed.
Not cooperative with exam otherwise.
[**12-28**] holosystolic murmur best heard at LLSB.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No apparent pain illicit on palpation.
L thigh graft donor area erythematous, not warm, not exudative, well-healed.
Pertinent Results: * Head CT [**9-25**]: Left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with potential small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal and temporal distribution.
No definite mass lesion identified; however, evaluation is limited without contrast.
* CXR [**9-25**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process * Abd CT [**9-25**]:  No evidence of obstruction.
Bilateral renal cystic hypodensities, most of which are too small to characterize but not significantly changed compared to [**2121**].
No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.
* CXR [**10-5**]: LLL opacity (my read), improving from [**9-29**] * Head CT [**10-3**]: unchanged SAH * Chest CT [**9-29**]: LLL aspiration pna, 1.2cm RUL nodule * CXR [**9-29**]: LLL atelectasis vs. aspiration * Head MRI [**9-27**]: no leptomeningeal metastasis, chronic microinfarctions * Head CT [**9-25**]: Left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with potential small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal and temporal distribution.
No definite mass lesion identified; however, evaluation is limited without contrast.
* CXR [**9-25**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process * Abd CT [**9-25**]:  No evidence of obstruction.
Bilateral renal cystic hypodensities, most of which are too small to characterize but not significantly changed compared to [**2121**].
No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27137**] was a 83-year-old man with history of metastatic melanoma status post left neck dissection on [**2124-8-21**] who was admitted for altered mental status.
He was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on chest CT on admission.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended medical therapy with blood pressure control, for SBP goal of 110 to 140, and anti-seizure prophylaxis with phenytoin, which was later switched to levetiracetam due to administration via a PICC line.
A head MRI showed no leptominingeal enhancement and, except for the known SAH, no other acute process.
The patient had long periods of somnolence interpersed with transient lucency when he recognized his family and was able to carry out small conversations.
* Tachypnea, O2 requirement, fever: The patient had two episodes of transient hypoxia and tachypnea.
During the first episode he was found to have a possible aspiration pneumonia and was started on clindamycin.
CXR and chest CT later revealed likely aspiration pneumonia.
A few days later the patient developed hypoxia with fever and was unable to control his secretions.
* Aspiration pneumonia: LLL opacity concerning for aspiration on chest imaging.
* UTI: found to have VRE in the urine, which was sensitive to ampicillin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
