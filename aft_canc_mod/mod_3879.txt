History of Present Illness: 85y/o male known to our service, who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a stay for resecton of a R fronal brain tumor diagnosed to be GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme).
Today, he suffered a witnessed fall at Rehab.
Ambulance flow sheet indicates that there was no trauma at the time of the fall.
Past Medical History: COPD HTN hyperlipidemia shingles  Social History: patient denies current use of tobacco/EtOH/IVD   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Upon Admission: BP:134/74       HR:61-85    R 16-18      O2Sats Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: No shoulder elevation on L XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
on LLE  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally  Toes downgoing bilaterally   Pertinent Results: CT head [**2153-10-30**]: FINDINGS: There are post-surgical changes following a right frontal craniotomy, with interval placement of a catheter that courses into the right frontal lobe.
Within the surgical resection bed, there continues to be fluid as well as a small amount of postoperative hemorrhage, similar in appearance from the prior study, with residual vasogenic edema within the right frontal lobe.
There continues to be a marked mass effect with obliteration of the right lateral ventricle, and leftward subfalcine herniation of approximately 16 mm, grossly unchanged from the prior study.
Early right uncal herniation is stable, with a known right temporal lobe mass, not clearly appreciated without contrast.
There has been no other interval change, without new foci of hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
There is minimal mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal sinuses.
Osseous structures reveal a right frontal craniotomy defect, with subcutaneous air along the right frontal soft tissues.
Stable continued local mass effect with obliteration of the right lateral ventricle and leftward subfalcine herniation.
CT head [**10-28**]: There is a right frontal craniotomy with residual residual pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air.
The right frontal surgical cavity has filled with fluid and expanded, with increased right subfalcine herniation.
There is new right uncal herniation.
There is increased sulcal effacement in the right cerebral hemisphere.
There is increased compression of the right lateral ventricle, as well as the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is no acute hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1140**] was readmitted with mental status changes and new left sided paralysis.
He was found to have increased midline shift from 12 mm to 21 mm and a large amount of cerebral edema around his brain mass.
On [**2153-10-29**] he was taken to the OR for steriotactic cyst aspiration plus Rickham reservoir (internally) for continued drainage as needed.. His post-op CT showed decreased midline shift.
His left arm was antigravity and his left IP was antigravity as well hence he was ablt to be transferred out of ICU on POD#2.
