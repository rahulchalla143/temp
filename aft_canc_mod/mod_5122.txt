She notes that she's had bilateral upper extremity weakness for ~3wks which she feels is progressively worsening.
Endorses fatigue and her most bothersome complaint is blurry vision which was her presenting complaint on her prior admission.
She ntoes that she's had some difficulty word-finding over the past month but denies ha/dizzyness.
Denies cp/palpitations/sob, but endorses cough x 3d, nonproductive, no other URI sx associated.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile w/ BP 94/60 HR NSR 96-97% on 2L.
CTA (-) for PE, and on echo in ED no significant pericardial effusion was noted.
Past Medical History:  Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer- c/b mets to brain, s/p brain XRT # bilateral posterior stroke with resultant blurry vision # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # Anxiety # Gerd # Degenerative disc disease  Social History: Lives in [**Location 8641**], NH with husband [**Name (NI) **].

No visual field defects noted.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Known left upper lobe spiculated mass concerning for malignancy is not clearly visualized.
Linear filling defect within a subsegmental branch of the superior segment of the right pulmonary artery likely attributable to motion artifact.
The finding represents a true pulmonary embolus, the size and location of the filling defect make it of doubtful clinical significance.
No evidence of aortic dissection.
14-mm spiculated left upper lobe nodule with mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy consistent with history of non-small-cell lung cancer.
CXR [**2-24**] -  No significant interval change versus prior with no evidence for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
MRI head [**2-27**] - Evolving lesions in bilateral occipital lobes and centrum semiovale bilaterally, differential is unchanged and includes PRES or embolic ischemia/vasculitis.
No new lesions are identified.
CHEM: Glucose-82 UreaN-31* Creat-0.6 Na-136 K-3.9 Cl-99 HCO3-27 AnGap-14 Albumin-2.9* Calcium-8.5 Phos-4.0 Mg-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 60 yo F with history of NSCLC complicated by brain mets recently discharged after admission for stroke now presenting with hypotension.
#  Hypotension - The patient was initially bolused 4 L IVF in the ED without much response in her BPs and was placed on levophed gtt on arrival to the ICU.
She was given 2 L of additional IVF boluses with success in weaning her off levophed.
The differential diagnosis included dehydration [**3-10**] poor po intake, infection, adrenal insufficiency, or possible PE.
Cardiac ischemia was unlikely given a EKG without ischemic changes.
The patient did have elevated troponins, but in the setting of flat CKs and renal failure.
She was given stress doses of IV dexamethasone for likely adrenal insufficiency (pt on steroids at home due to brain mets, has not tolerated decreases in steroid doses in past).
On the oncology floor, the endocrinology service was consulted and felt strongly that this was not adrenal insufficiency since she was still taking large dose of steroids at home.
There were no subsequent episodes of hypotension.
#  Elevated troponins - In setting of ARF, EKG w/o ischemic changes.
There were no episodes of chest pain during her stay.
#  Confusion/word finding difficulty/blurry vision - Likely residual from bilateral occipital strokes.
A repeat MRI brain showed evolution of the lesions consistent with either stroke or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
Neurology felt that patient exhibited signs of lower [**Last Name (un) 75355**] neuron weakness consistent with possible steroid-induced myopathy.
#  ARF - On presentation, Cr 1.3, up from baseline Cr 0.8.
#  NSCLC - Stage IV c/b mets to brain, s/p brain whole brain XRT.
She tolerated this well with no nausea or vomiting.
# Cough - No evidence of infection on imaging, afebrile.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued outpt crestor and zetia  # HTN: Held home anti-hypertensives given hypotension.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypotension NOS .
Secondary: # Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer- c/b mets to brain, s/p brain XRT # bilateral posterior stroke with resultant blurry vision # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # Anxiety # Gerd # Degenerative disc disease # Microhematuria   Discharge Condition: stable, improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with weakness and low blood pressure.
We checked for any sign of infection to explain your low blood pressure, but there were none.
If you experience any symptoms which concern you, such as fevers/chills, shortness of breath, or excessive nausea and vomiting, please call your doctor or go to the ED.
