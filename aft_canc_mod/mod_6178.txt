duodenal mass.
He underwent EGD on [**12-17**] which showed extensive clot and fresh blood oozing in the duodenal bulb.
CT of the abdomen was concerning for duodenal ulcer as well as diffuse thickening of the stomach.
On [**2108-12-21**] he underwent angiogram which showed Celiac and SMA arteriogram demonstrated a vascular stump off the common hepatic artery believed to be the stump of the left hepatic artery, a replaced right hepatic artery supplied from the SMA, and GDA coming off of the common hepatic artery.
There is no active extravasation or evidence of active bleeding.
He was continuing to have transfusion requirements to maintain his hct and received an additional 25 units over the course of the week with 6 units the day that it was decided to take him to the OR for an exploratory lap with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy .
No evidence of malignancy could be found at the time of exploration.
There was concern that this was an infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma, however frozen sections did not show evidence of malignancy and final pathology on the gastrectomy portion submitted showed: - Extensive hemorrhagic necrosis with associated transmural ulceration of the distal antrum/pylorus; focal microperforation is identified - Fundic and uninvolved antral mucosa with minimal chronic, inactive inflammation, focal hemorrhage and epithelial regeneration.
- No carcinoma seen.
On [**12-27**] (HD 13/POD3) He developed ARDS (A-a gradient 198, < 200), possibly secondary to transfusion reaction or possibly pneumonia.
All urine, blood and sputum (from BAL) were no growth.
He was still having low grade fevers through POD 9 and then on POD day 10 he again had fever to 101.1.
This showed free flow of contrast from the stomach to the jejunum, no evidence for leak or obstruction.
