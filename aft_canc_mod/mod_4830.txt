Admission Date:  [**2196-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-11-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2168-1-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: left arm tingling, diplopia, headaches, polyuria, polydypsia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CRANIOTOMY with resection of pituitary macroadenoma, [**2196-10-28**] PROCEDURE: 1.
Pericranial pedicle flap for isolation of frontal sinus.
Right PICC placed [**2196-11-12**]  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 28 year old man  who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-25**] in [**Location (un) 5503**], MA with 3-4 weeks of arm numbness, associated with headaches, polyuria/polydipsia, and double vision.
He reports that he had been having intermittant headaches for several years, but his symptoms had acutely worsened recently and were associated with periods of double vision.
He and his family had also noted increased fluid intake/urinary frequency of several weeks durations.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a whithered right arm with significant contractions; he has limited sensation/movement of this arm.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any changes in shoes size, hand size, or facial features.
He had not had any changes in bowel habits.
He had not noticed easy bruising, or changes in cold/heat tolerance.
ED course here was notable for brief desaturation to the 70's while sleeping that resolved on stimulation and 2L of nasal O2.
Patient was admitted to the floor and continued to by hyperglycemia to 300's-500's.
Endocrine was consulted yesterday and recommended broad endocrine work-up given concern for secretory adenoma and possible acromegaly.
MRI revealed mass as well as old left sided encephalomalacia concerning for old stroke but family cannot recall event.
Also recommended insulin as patient was persistently hyperglycemic.
This has so far revealed low LH and FSH, normal TSH, very marginally elevated AM cortisol, low testosterone and HgbA1C 17.0.
Patient never really got full trial of insulin sliding scale as persistent elevated blood sugars made surgery concerned and they put him on an insulin drip.
NSG requested transfer for persistent hyperglycemia and as they do not plan to proceed w/ surgery as an inpatient.
Aside from glucoses other major issue has been impressive apnea and desats while sleeping.
His paresthesias and weakness have never been supported by exam and have improved on their own.
Family History: Patient is unaware of any history of diabetes or other endocrinopathies.
Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: VS; BP 136/106  RR 16  100% RA, wt 160 lbs Gen; young male, lying in bed, NAD, he has underdevelopment of the left side of body.mild coarse facial features, no frontal bossing, HEENT; PERLA, EOMI, no [**Name (NI) **] field defects on confrontation, no diplopia, poor dentition.
mucous membranes moist, moderate sized tongue Neck -No goiter, no nodules, no acanthosis nigracans CV; RRR, no murmurs Pulm; CTA b/l, no gynaecomastia Abd; soft, NT, ND, no striae Extr; no edema, [**Last Name (un) **] looks doughy and squared Skin -no bruising, no paucity of facial, axillary and pubic hair genital -normal sized testes Neuro: Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3-->2mm.
No abnormal movements or tremors.
Sensation: Decreased to light touch in left arm and leg and pinprick in left arm.
However, patient is somewhat inconsistent with responses.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
There is a tender, slightly palpable cord over the cephalic vein on the LUE.
Similar appearance to sellar mass with suprasellar extension with compression of the optic chiasm, worse on the left.
Persistent left MCA territory extensive encephalomalacia, unchanged.
Sellar mass with suprasellar extension arising from the pituitary, most consistent with an adenoma.
There is compression of the optic chiasm, with relatively greater compression of the left optic nerve.
Extensive encephalomalacia along the left MCA territory, consistent with an old infarct.
No acute hemorrhage or infarct.
POST-OPERATIVE CT Head [**2196-10-28**] IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical changes are seen, with pneumocephalus and left frontal craniotomy.
No surrounding hemorrhage is identified.
Head imaging by MRI and CT showed a large 1.9 cm pituitaty tumor.
He also was seen by the sleep consult service due to episodes of witnessed sleep apnea and associated desaturations to the 70s.
Overnight from [**Date range (1) 84692**], the patient developed headache and complained of vision changes although bedside [**Date range (1) **] field testing was unchanged from prior.
Stat head CT was again done and was concerning for increase in size of suprasellar mass as well as possible hemorrhage within the mass.
He was therefore taken to the OR by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for emergent craniotomy and pituitary macroadenoma resection, after which he was taken to the SICU.
Post operative course complicated by hypertension >200 noted POD1, w/o imaging evidence of worsening interval swelling/hemorrhage from day of operation.
New onset diabetes mellitus was therefore from growth hormone stimulation of IGF-1 causing insulin resistance.
============================================= SICU COURSE: While in the SICU the patient was noted to have persistent polyuria with dilute urine and polydypsia; was found to have post-operative panhypopituitarism with multiple endocrine abnormalities: increased [**Hospital1 **], IGF-1, and cortisol, decreased free T3, FSH, testosterone.
Hyperglycemia with A1c = 17.0, C-peptide positive, GAD antibody negative.
He was also noted to have a septic superficial thrombophlebitis of the LUE near the antecubital fossa.
#1: PANHYPOPITUITARISM: #1A Polyuria: Initially thought to be secondary to ADH deficiency or hyperglycemia.
Persisted following insulin management of hyperglycemia, making ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) or primary polydipsia mixed with DI more likely.
NPO/no IVF trial ([**11-5**] midnight to [**11-6**] afternoon) completed, overall put out 13L of dilute urine and took in 0.4L w/o substantial serum concentration; results suggest unmeasured intake of free water/salt during NPO trial.
Urine output and polydypsia also improved more towards normal.
#1B Polyphagia: extremely large food intake, possibly secondary to hypothalamic damage.
Endocrine did not think likely secondary to metabolic effects of [**Hospital1 **]/IGF-1 given severity of polyphagia.
- Will need nutrition consult/education as outpatient (or prior to discharge from rehab facility) given newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.
[**Month (only) 116**] need calorie restriction if polyphagia persists and blood glucose poorly controlled.
Insulin dependence persisted following surgery, may not completely resolve due to incomplete resection of adenoma.
- MONITOR BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUES CLOSELY AS DIABETES WILL LIKELY RESOLVE AND LESS INSULIN WILL BE NEEDED AS [**Hospital1 **] AND IGF-1 LEVELS NORMALIZE AND ASSOCIATED INSULIN RESISTANCE IMPROVES.
#1E Thyroid Deficiency: Low TSH (.16) and low T4 (.74) on [**10-31**] suggests pituitary cause of hypothyroidism, likely present prior to surgery given low free T3 on [**10-23**].
#1F Testosterone deficiency: low FSH and low testosterone consistent with pituitary failure prior to surgery.
Bacteremia: [**11-1**] blood culture in the context of septic thrombophlebitis grew coagulase negative staphylococcus resistant to oxacillin.
Status post craniotomy and partial resection of [**Hospital1 **] secreting pituitary macroadenoma on [**10-28**].
Surgical site has remained clear, dry, and intact without evidence of infection.
Family is having difficulty paying rent secondary to expenses related to the patient's hospitalization; the hospital has advocated on their behalf with [**Location (un) 5503**] housing authority.
Sleep apnea: combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea, with periodic, self resolving desaturations to the low 80s.
- Patient cannot use CPAP because of sinus rest .
Studies consistent with anemia secondary to repeat blood draws, bordering on Fe deficiency.
Superficial thrombophlebitis in left cephalic vein.
No indication of septic thrombophlebitis; asymptomatic.
- We have been treating with warm compresses .
Ophthalmology has seen the patient and did not find evidence of pathology, and suggested corrective lenses.

Discharge Instructions: Dear [**Known firstname **], you were admitted to the hospital because of headache, changes in vision, and drinking and urinating large amounts.
You were found to have a tumor in your head, called a pituitary adenoma.
As a result of this tumor being removed, you were left with hormone changes that will now require multiple new medications as outlined below.
Please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room if you have increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, you lose consciousness, have a fever >100.4, you have diarrhea or vomiting for more than 24 hours, you have a large increase or decrease in your urination, you develop a headache or changes in vision, you have bleeding, or other concerning symptoms.
