Shortly after, a purulent material was expressed from his sternal wound during exploration; one minute after this, the patient was noted by his wife to "turn red all over", becoming tachypneic and tachycardic to the 130's, and with notable and new, diffuse wheezing.
MICU staff felt it was unlikely to be Redman syndrome, and more likely a transient episode of bacteremia caused by wound exploration or an anxiety attack.
[**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes continued, and thoracic surgery followed the patient; they felt the wound to be not infected.
On HD#[**3-17**], his erythema surrounding the wound improved.
Patient never developed a fever in the hospital.
CAD: Patient's lateral ST depressions on EKG that occurred during the episode after IV vanco infusion resolved with the resolution of tachycardia.
Sternal Wound: No more pus was expressed from the wound while in the hospital.
Thoracic surgery team examined the wound daily and felt the wound to be not contaminated.
Erythema surrounding the wound resolved.
6. small cell cancer in R lung: This is a new diagnosis for the patient from the FNA cytology done on [**2169-3-23**].
