Admission Date:  [**2150-11-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: Presumed lung cancer, transfer for palliative stenting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy with stent placement [**2150-11-13**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 60 y/o f with schizophrenia, htn, chf, copd, and a 50+ pack year smoking history who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2150-11-4**] from [**Location (un) 1036**] NH with sob and hypoxia, was given a presumptive dx of lung cancer, and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for palliative stenting.
She began to complain of shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxic (94% on 2Lnc) at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] ED.
During the admission, she was noted to have a left peri-hilar mass on CXR as well as a left pleural effusion, and a chest CT revealed a 3.5x5cm left suprahilar mass with impingment on the LUL bronchus and subsequent LUL collapse.
She underwent bronchoscopy showing a large lesion involving the left mainstem bronchus and completely obstructing the LUL take-off.
Her course was also complicated by the onset of new atrial fibrillation, for which she was treated with diltiazem and sent over on an IV amiodarone load.
She also was hyponatremic and was fluid restricted for presumed SIADH, and started on sodium tabs.
On admission, she had no complaints.
Occasional complaint of chest tightness that she's been having off and on for days, not severe, no sob, no f/c.
She has a mild productive cough, unchanged over the past few days.
)Chronic schizophrenia 2.
)Bipolar disorder 3.
)Seizure disorder 4.
3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally enhancing lobulated mass causing obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus and resulting in complete collapse/consolidation of the left upper lobe.
The left lower lobe bronchus remains patent, and the left lower lobe remains aerated.
Moderate left pleural effusion, with minimal compressive atelectasis on aerated left lower lobe.
Tiny 3 to 4 mm nodular densities within the right lung base.
Low-density lesion adjacent to falciform ligament most likely represents focal fatty infiltration.
Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
Tiny low-density lesions within both kidneys, which are too small to adequately characterize.
* [**2150-11-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2150-11-8**]: Left upper lobe has reexpanded.
Left lower lobe still collapsed around the left hilar mass accompanied by small left pleural effusion.
Mediastinum midline.
1) Lung mass: Her presentation with long-standing smoking, lung mass, and presumptive SIADH was highly concerning for malignancy, and an appropriate work-up was continued.
A CT chest performed on [**11-10**] revealed a 3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally enhancing lobulated mass causing obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus and resulting in complete collapse/consolidation of the left upper lobe, with patent LLL bronchus.
A moderate left pleural effusion was also seen.
Pleural fluid cytology from the OSH thoracentesis returned negative for malignancy, although only a small amount of fluid was obtained at that time.
BAL brushings from the OSH returned highly suspicious for squamous cell cancer, which was felt diagnostic.
She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy on [**11-12**], with findings significant for tumor infiltration of the submucosa in left mainstem bronchus, with LUL/lingula completely obstructed.
She tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
CXR PA/lat post-procedure without complications.
Work-up otherwise remarkable for negative head CT, abdominal CT without liver mets, bilateral adrenal adenomas.
She does have a pleural effusion, likely malignant, and is awaiting an out-patient PET scan to complete her metastatic work-up and assess disease burden.
2) Dyspnea: Felt secondary to above.
She also has a history of COPD, and was initially placed on a higher dose of Prednisone 40 mg PO QD for possible COPD exacerbation upon admission to the MICU.
COPD was ultimately not felt to be an important contributor, and quick Prednisone taper was initiated.
4) Atrial fibrillation: She was loaded on amiodarone IV at the OSH, completed at [**Hospital1 18**].
Of note, we have been avoiding Albuterol nebulizers to prevent med-induced tachycardia.
5) Hyponatremia: Urine electrolytes with elevated urine sodium, high urine osm, and low serum sodium was consistent with SIADH.
Lasix was avoided, and IV fluids were used only sparingly for lowish BP, now stable.
A random cortisol level of 21 ruled out adrenal insufficiency.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
If you experience fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or return to the emergency department for evaluation.
You have a scheduled PET scan on [**11-18**] at 0720 AM to rule out lesions elsewhere in your body.
