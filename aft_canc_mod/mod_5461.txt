Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65845**], the pt was doing well since her last discharge from [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-5**] until last night when she developed respiratory stridor.
Of note, the pt has been treated for a C diff infection diagnosed [**5-13**] which, per report, has been improving.
She also received Tylenol, Albuterol, and ASA given that she complained to the interpreter of some chest pain.

A CT scan of the chest and neck revealed a goiter with airway compression.
TSH was elevated at 7.13.
Path showed the patient to have papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with extrathyroidal invasion and nodal involvement, status post rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement on [**2173-4-14**], status post open tracheostomy on [**2173-4-16**], status post bronchoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2173-5-3**].

No focal opacities.
EKG: sinus, tachy, no ST changes .
There is a moderate-sized left pneumothorax.
There are foci of air within the mediastinum as well as air within the pericardium.
The lungs demonstrate bibasilar consolidative opacities posteriorly.
Coronary artery calcifications are identified.
Multiple small calcified lymph nodes are seen within the right hilum and mediastinum.
No clearly pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the axillary, mediastinal, or hilar regions.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is no evidence of intraperitoneal air.
There is air seen tracking along the musculature of the anterior and lateral abdominal wall as well as air tracking in the retroperitoneum bilaterally.
The gallbladder appears distended without evidence of pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema.
A rounded density is seen within its lumen consistent with gallstone.
The kidneys appear unremarkable on this non- contrast study and do not demonstrate any evidence of hydronephrosis.
The opacified loops of small and large bowel appear normal in caliber and contour.
No pathologic lymphadenopathy is identified in the mediastinum or retroperitoneum, although assessment is limited by lack of intravenous contrast.
No ascites is seen.
Pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear normal in caliber and contour.
No enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.

There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Bibasilar consolidative opacities are concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
There is a new opacity at the lateral base of the left lung, which could be overlying soft tissue; I would recommend routine radiographs if feasible to exclude a focal lung infection or infarction.
The heart is normal size and there is no appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Low limb lead voltage.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 69 yo Cambodian woman with a PMH significant for thyroid goiter s/p thyroidectomy in [**4-12**], s/p trach in [**4-12**], s/p PEG in [**4-12**], with newly diagnosed DM, treated for acinetobacter and enterobacter PNA in [**4-12**], who presented to our ED following an episode of respiratory distress/stridor.
She was suctioned in the ED, and had dramatic improvement in her hypoxia and symptoms.
[**5-26**]: Pt became acutely hypoxic to O2 sat 30s and tachypneic to 40s.
Bronch showed ~ 90% occlusion with hard stuck on debris.
MICU COURSE: She was transferred to MICU team, intubated and ventilated with low VT and moderate RR.
She was started on vanco and zosyn for fever and leukocytosis that were stopped after two days as it was felt that the respiratory cultures were colonization.
Her post-op CT showed pneumothorax, pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum, which was felt to have occured during her respiratory failure and forced oxygenation.
She had another short episode of resp distress which was felt to be due to leak around tracheostomy.
She also had one isolated episode in the intensive care unit where she developed a rapid atrial fibrillation; this was slowed with beta blockers and she converted back to NSR.
On the medical floor she had no further episodes of respiratory distress.
She had a repeat speech and swallow evaluation, which demonstrated that she was not safe to eat anything by mouth, with severe aspiration felt likely to be due to increased secretions.
Her lung exam was fairly benign, and CXR was not notable for any infiltrates.
The likely etiology of the patient's symptoms were felt to be a mucus plug.
# Fever/Elevated WBC:   The pt had an elevated WBC on admission, which rose to 17 on [**5-22**].
She was also noted to have low grade fevers.
The pt did seem to indicate that she had some mild LUQ abdominal pain, so abdominal Xray was obtained to rule out dilated bowel or bowel wall thickening (which it was negative for these things).
The pt was continued on treatment for her C diff with flagyl, and she did not have any diarrhea either.
She developed several loose stools after the MICU, and c.diif toxin was sent three times and returned negative each time.
She had a transient episode of atrial fibrillation in the intensive care unit, which was treated effectively with beta blockade.
#Hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy: The pts TSH was 13 with low Free T4 at 0.2   Her liothyronine was increased from 12.5 to 25 mcg [**Hospital1 **].
It was felt to be an anemia of chronic disease; she was started on iron supplementation.
Medications on Admission: colace Promote with fiber at 50cc/hr Flagyl 500 mg TID satrt [**5-13**] Liothyronine 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] Ca carbonate 500 cctid Lansoprazole 30 cc qd Metoprolol 37.5 mg po tid NPH 20 [**Hospital1 **] SSI   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY respiratory distress likely due to mucus plug respiratory distress due to acute tracheal obstruction s/p trach exchange fever papillary thyroid cancer s/p resection c.dif colitis pneumothorax diabetes mellitus type 2, well controlled atrial fibrillation SECONDARY: hypertension anemia   Discharge Condition: stable, ambulating, tolerating tube feeds, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: 1) Please take all medications as directed.
Your liothyronine dose has been increased 2) Call your doctor or return to the ER for worsening shortness of breath or stridor, fever, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms 3) Please keep all follow up appointments as scheduled 4) You will need to have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation to determine if you can have your trach capped to speak or eat once your secretions are less.
