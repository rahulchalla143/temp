On [**6-2**] after he had two falls at home which were described as mechanical and witnessed with no head strike or LOC.
He presented to [**Hospital6 **] for evaluation.
Upon work up CT of the head was done which showed a lesion in his posterior fossa on the left side, subsequent MRI imaging of the brain, which was done without contrast given his increased GFR, showed a left cerebellar brain lesion.
Given that he has a history of lung cancer there was a concern for metastasis vs meningioma given the appearance and location of the lesion.
Also of note per report the lesion was causing transependymal flow and transtentorial herniation with mass effect on the tectum.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
