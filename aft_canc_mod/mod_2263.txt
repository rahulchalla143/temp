Endobronchial tumor with pathology pending.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old male who had several episodes of post obstructive pneumonia in the past secondary to a lingular mass which was discovered via flexible bronchoscopy.
It was noted to be an obstructive tumor in the orifice of the lingula.
Several biopsies of these lesions proved to be non-diagnostic.
He was referred to Thoracic Surgery for more definitive evaluation of this via rigid bronchoscopy with debridement of the endobronchial mass which would allow alleviation of the post-obstructive pneumonia and better pathology examination of the specimens.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, he was in no acute distress.
There was no cervical adenopathy.
Abdomen was obese without masses.
The extremities revealed no clubbing or edema.
There were no telangiectasias on the skin and neurologically the patient was non-focal.
There was no note of operative complication.
He remained in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit during postoperative day one, on which the morning of he was extubated without difficulty.
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day two without any notable complications and immediately began ambulating and continuing with the rest of the chest Physical Therapy and pulmonary toilet.
He did develop some problems with atelectasis at the left base but with aggressive pulmonary toilet, this too did clear and the patient had his chest tubes discontinued on [**8-19**] after which the epidural and Foley was subsequently discontinued and the patient was switched to p.o.
The patient was set for discharge on postoperative day five with no notable pain issues any longer and a good respiratory status.
