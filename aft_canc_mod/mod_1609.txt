Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old female with breast cancer with metastases to bone and liver who presented with dysphagia and hypotension.
Hypotension: She was admitted with hypotension that was felt to be dehydration and hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO intake with dysphagia, hypercalcemia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.
Her hypotension was stabilized with IVF, 4L at admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], however volume status was constantly difficult due to poor UOP and tachycardia with peripheral anasarca suggesting poor intravascular volume.
This intervention helped urine output but did not have an effect on her persistent tachycardia.
She was also temporarily given Vanc/Zosyn due to concern for sepsis as a possible contributor but she had no other signs of infection other than hypotension and when her cultures were negative, all antibiotics were discontinued.
Altered mental status: She was admitted with altered mental status in the setting of dilaudid use and hypotension.
There was also some concern for hepatic encephalopathy as she had some asterixis on exam and elevated LFTs.
Her mental status quickly improved with increased blood pressure and holding Dilaudid.
A head CT was considered to evaluate for metastatic disease, however it was felt that patient's renal function was not adequate for contrast administration and that this was not an acute need to determine medical management.
Dysphagia: She was immunocopromised on chemotherapy and steroids with concurrent liver failure.
She also had a positive viral load for CMV and was treated for CMV esophagitis with ganciclovir for a [**2-17**] week course.
Hypercalcemia: This has been a recurrent problem for this patient with widely metastatic cancer.
Her corrected Ca was 11.6 on admission, which is only mildly elevated for this patient, who has been admitted with a Ca as high as 19 in the past.
Liver failure - She has known extensive liver metastases.
She also had no evidence of biliary obstruction on ultrasound.
She also has very poor synthetic function with a low albumin and elevated coags.
It was felt that her liver disease was a result of her metastases.
Elevated Coags: It was felt that her elevated coags were due to decreased synthetic function in the liver.
She was also given vitamin K due to a GI bleed.
GI Bleed: She had one episode of bright red blood per rectum on [**2113-11-14**] and remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit after the bleed.
She continued to have some black stools.
She was given vitamin K for an elevated INR and her Lovenox was held.
DVT: She has a lower extremity DVT for which she is on Lovenox.
This was held in the setting of a GI bleed.
