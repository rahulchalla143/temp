No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 69yo F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr < 1.5.
No evidence of infection on admission without fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, suprapubic tenderness or dysuria, UA with epis and does not indicate UTI.
On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin).
After failed improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without improvement in creatinine.
Cr steadily continued to rise, patient became oliguric and was volume overloaded.
However, given active bleeding (see below), she was trasferred to SICU and started on CVVH.
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy.
MELD 20 on admission with Childs Class C. Without evidence of encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation or asterixis on admission.
Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
MELD rose to >30 in setting of hepatorenal syndrome and patient was listed for ABO incompatible liver.
# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on [**6-13**] and mildly symptomatic.
Less likely cirrhosis induced cardiomyopathy.
Repeat TTE with still normal EF but new moderate PA systolic HTN.
In setting of rapidly progressive HRS, pt became oliguric and was unable to mobilize fluid.
This was likely [**2-15**] mild oral trauma in the setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.
As soon as pressure was released, active bleeding was visualized.
Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective intubation and packing.
The lesion was cauterized and the bleeding was controlled.
# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic hyponatremia from cirrhosis.
Albumin and PRBCs given for intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted diet.
She remained hyponatremic so fluid restricted further to 1.2L with improvement in Na.
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis though with acute drop on HD 2.
Unclear etiology without GIB during admission.
Unknown if patient has varices without endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably none on prior endoscopy.
Possible hct drop was in setting of volume challenge overnight and dilutional effect though WBC and platelets unchanged.
She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs both for anemia and volume challenge.
The evening following the EGD, she had several episodes of melena thus prompting transfer to the ICU to facilitate repeat emergent EGD.
The EGD [**6-22**] showed a lot of old blood around the polyp, but no active bleed from the stalk.
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit.
We were unable to completely correct her, and she began having significant oral bleeding.
By [**2198-6-25**], she was coughing blood, had an increased oxygen requirement.
She remained encephalopathic and was not protecting her airway sufficiently so she was intubated.
After intubation she had a pressor requirement which remained until time of death.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated lung volume.
On [**6-26**] she was begun on CVVH for acidosis and had increased pressor requirement with the addition of vasopressin.
On [**6-27**] she had increased pressor requirement and markedly increased oral bleeding.
Transfusions continued and she remained on high dose levo/vaso, though her pressor requirement was slightly less than the day prior.
She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor doses.
Melena and oral bleeding increased and she grew increasingly tachycardic.
Another family meeting was held and we discussed that she was decompensating rapidly and likely had an unsurvivable condition.
She was transitioned to comfort care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much discomfort.
