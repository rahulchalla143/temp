Mr [**Known firstname **] is well known the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with multiple stays here for BOOP exacerbations and pseudomonal pneumonia.
Per the patient the doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] sent out special sensitivities and his psuedomonas may be susceptible to an "older drug" though he doesnt know the name, though it appears doxycyline is a new drug on his med list.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence  of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an  infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].

-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].

No liver imaging was obtained given clinical stability and eventual stabilization of LFTs.
