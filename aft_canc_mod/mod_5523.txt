Moderate right hemothorax along with progression of previously visualized perihepatic hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of active arterial extravasation.
These findings are likely related to venous bleeding, either from post-procedure or from variceal rupture.
Evidence of cirrhosis with varices and a recanalized periumbilical vein.
Minimal air is seen in the right subcutaneous region, likely following the recent chest tube placement.
Right hemothrax better demonstrated on prior chest CT dated [**2136-7-18**] is mild-to-moderate in quantity.
There is no pneumothorax.
Shrunken nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
Limited evaluation of known hepatic lesions.
Patent main portal vein with hepatopetal flow.
Evidence of portal hypertension including splenomegaly and moderate intra-abdominal ascites.
CXR [**2136-7-22**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement.
The linear opacities along the right minor fissure have almost completely resolved.
A small gas bubble in the right soft tissues, at the site of the previous chest tube insertion, is also resolved.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or of pleural effusion.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2136-7-23**] 05:50AM BLOOD WBC-6.7 RBC-3.23* Hgb-11.2* Hct-31.0* MCV-96 MCH-34.5* MCHC-36.0* RDW-17.3* Plt Ct-70* [**2136-7-23**] 05:50AM BLOOD PT-18.7* PTT-35.4* INR(PT)-1.7* [**2136-7-23**] 05:50AM BLOOD Glucose-104* UreaN-10 Creat-0.6 Na-136 K-4.1 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-11 [**2136-7-23**] 05:50AM BLOOD ALT-61* AST-75* AlkPhos-69 TotBili-7.0* [**2136-7-23**] 05:50AM BLOOD Calcium-8.2* Phos-1.6* Mg-1.7  Brief Hospital Course: 62yo M with history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and ascites who was initially admitted to the medical floor for observation after schedule radiofrequency ablation of three HCC liver lesions and liver biopsy, complicated by right hemothorax.
On the floor the evening of admission, he became hypotensive to the 70s.
He was noted to have low UOP with concentrated urine, dry-appearing, and cool to the touch.
After discussion with IR, pt was sent emergently to CT given concern for intra-abdominal bleeding and was found to have a right-sided hemothorax.
He was given insulin/D50 and calcium; no significant ECG changes were seen.
His Hct remained stable and a repeat CXR showed near resolution of hemothorax.
He was discharged on oxycodone 5mg po q6h prn for pain in addition to his home dose of tramadol 50mg po BID.
# cirrhosis: diuretics were held after patient developed hemothorax, but pt was continued on rifaximin, lactulose, and pantoprazole during admission.
he began to develop trace edema in his LE on [**2136-7-23**]; his volume status and Hct were stable at this time so his diuretics were restarted.
He was also placed on levofloxacin for 5d for infection prophylaxis.
His home medication regimen included both omeprazole and pantoproazole, which was thought to be redundant, so pantoprazole was discontinued on discharge and pt was instructed to take only omeprazole 20mg po BID with plans to further discuss this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
# tachycardia: on [**2136-7-22**] pt developed tachycardia to the 160s.
He had not yet received his AM nadolol and was given this medication, after which his tachycardia resolved, but nadolol has little systemic effect so it is more likely that the tachycardia resolved spontaneously.
He denied a history of afib or being treated for a heart condition, and an EKG taken at the time revealed multifocal atrial tachycardia, so no further work up or treatment was pursued.
8. alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
EpiPen 0.3 mg/0.3 mL Pen Injector Sig: One (1) injection Intramuscular once as needed for anaphylaxis.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: acute post-procedure bleeding/hemothorax radiofrequency ablation  Secondary Diagnoses: hepatocellular carcinoma alcoholic cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
After the procedure, you were admitted for close observation to control post-operative pain and ensure that you were not actively bleeding.
You developed a bleed into your chest cavity and you received 6 units of blood cells, 3 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit of platelets to control your bleeding.
The following changes were made to your medications: STOP Pantoprazole and discuss at your next appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for three days (last dose [**2136-7-26**]) START oxycodone 5mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain  Followup Instructions: 1.
