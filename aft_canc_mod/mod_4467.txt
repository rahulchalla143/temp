Post-surgical changes, with volume loss of the right hemithorax.
Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
Increased reticular opacities in the lung bases bilaterally, could reflect a chronic interstitial abnormality.
Rounded opacity projecting over the left superior hilus, may reflect a vessel or a pulmonary nodule.
Small left apical ill-defined opacity is also FDG-avid, raising concern for a second site of neoplastic involvement.
Multifocal opacities predominate at the right lung base, likely reflecting infection or aspiration.
Component of mild volume overload, as described.
Extensive coronary artery atherosclerotic calcifications.

for lung cancer s/p lobectomy, bilateral PEs on coumadin who presented wtih acute SOB followed by coughing up 2 cups of hemoptysis.
He was admitted to the MICU where he received a bronchoscopy that initially showed blood in the L bronchus.
A brief description of his hospital stay according to problem is described below:  # Hemoptysis: His hemoptysis was likely due to his endobronchial lesion and its proximity/involvement with the pulmonary artery.
This lesion was found to be squamous cell carcinoma.
He had a bronchoscopy that revealed that the bleeding had stopped and he did not have hemoptysis during his hospitalization.
#Lung cancer: Patient mass found to be a squamous cell carcinoma.
#Atrial Fibrillation: patient found to have AFib in the bronchoscopy suite after his procedure.
Given his recent episode of hemoptysis, anticoagulation was not started given the risk of severe bleeding.
# COPD: Patient found to have severe emphysema on CT scan and with PLT's.
Dx: lung cancer and COPD 3.
