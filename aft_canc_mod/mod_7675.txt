Admission Date:  [**2121-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-11-21**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the duodenum with acute hemorrhage.
Debulking of retroperitoneal tumor component.
Bedside opening of incision and drainage   History of Present Illness:  This totally healthy robust 91- year-old man presented to me 2 weeks ago with evidence of a presumed upper GI bleed and hemorrhage from a tumor in the periampullary area.
This was further worked up with endoscopic ultrasound and a biopsy showed this tumor mass to be highly suggestive of a GI stromal tumor.
Both CAT scan and ultrasound examination revealed a hemorrhagic bleed extending into the retroperitoneum from the periampullary area.
There was a 4 cm tumor which was hyperenhancing in the third portion of the duodenum as it coursed close to the ligament of Treitz and this was intimate with the pancreas tissue itself.
The patient was mildly symptomatic from this and we observed him and cooled him down in the hospital and planned for an operative approach in a few weeks' time to allow the hematoma situation to reabsorb.
I indicated to him that he has had a symptomatic manifestation of a tumor which likely is malignant in its nature.
Since the news of his retroperitoneal mass and plan for upcoming surgery has tapered down to one glass of wine per day.
He belongs to a gym and exercises twice a week doing treadmill exercises and weight lifting.
His brother died of prostate cancer at age [**Age over 90 **].
He initially seemed somewhat inpatient, but later showed a good sense of humor and range of affect.
HEENT:  He has mild dry cerumen, which is not occluding the visualization of his tympanic membranes.
In his left external auditory canal, he had a small plastic foreign object which I was able to remove with a lighted curet.
He has his upper and lower bridge work with no dentures.
Neck:  Supple without carotid bruits or lymphadenopathy.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without ectopy or murmur.
No rales, rhonchi or wheezes.
No reproducible tenderness.
Back:  No point tenderness diffusely.
Extremities:  No edema.
Musculoskeletal:  No active joint effusions.
No muscle rigidity or cogwheeling.
No tremor noted.
Jejunum, resection (C-D): Unremarkable segment of small intestine.
Retroperitoneal mass (E-F): Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (see note).
- Eleven (0/11) lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.
- Pancreas with Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN-2), margin is free.
The tumor has a component with epithelioid morphology (epithelioid GIST), multinucleated tumor cells and a brisk chronic inflammation infiltrate.
The tumor forms a unifocal, encapsulated mass of 4.2 cm between the duodenum and pancreas (duodenal GIST) without involvement of the pancreas, gallbladder, or infiltration of the bowel wall.
Mitoses number up to 20/50 hpf and infarction and vascular invasion are noted.
Peripheral margins are negative with a 2 mm capsule at the inferior pole.
The features suggest a GIST with high risk for progression.
Debulking of retroperitoneal tumor component.
Geriatrics was also helping with post-op management and delirium prevention.
He has serous drainage from the previous drain site and a suture was placed.
His abdomen was soft, nondistended and the incision with staples had extensive erythema along the staple line.
On POD 6, the 5 staples were removed due to sero-sang, thick drainage.
A culture was send and showed STAPH AUREUS COAG +, MODERATE GROWTH.
The wound tracked medially 10cm and laterally 3cm.
The erythema improved after the wound was opened and drained.
Post-op Hyperglycemia: His blood sugars were noted to be elevated and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.
He was discharged with Glipizide 10mg [**Hospital1 **], and will follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] for blood glucose checks.
He was discharged home with Keflex for 5 days and will continue with wound care for his postop wound infection.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
