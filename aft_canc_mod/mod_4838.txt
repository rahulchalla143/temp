Admission Date:  [**2102-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-4-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-5-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**] Chief Complaint: Thoracic back pain and numbness and tingling of the thighs  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T7/8 Vertebrectomy T5-11 Posterior Fusion   History of Present Illness: 56 yo M who was in his usual state of health until 5 weeks ago he began to have new onset thoracic back pain.
It was localized and sharp and did not radiate to his legs or groin, it was not associated with shortness of breath or palpitations.
There was no history of trauma and at his PCP plain films and blood work were un revealing.
2 weeks ago he underwent an L-spine MRI because the pain had worsened and he was beginning to have mild tingling and numbness of his thighs.
These images were not concerning for cord compression or nerve entrapment but did reveal some bony abnormalities so he returned for a CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis last Thursday.
These images revealed several bony lesions in the T spine with ?
of compression fracture at T5/T6.
Over this past weekend he had worsening numbness and difficulty walking, but no bowel/bladder incontinence.
Neurosurgery was consulted given his acute onset of lower extremity symptoms and concern for thoracic cord compression.
At T7/T8 the lesion involves both the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements and encases the spinal cord causing complete effacement of the thecal sac and extrinsic epidural compression of the spinal cord.
There is no signal abnormality within the spinal cord indicating that this is a slowly developing process.
This most likely represents metastatic disease, much less likely primary bone tumor or infectious origin like TB.
Pathologic vertebral body fractures at T7 and T8 without evidence of retropulsed bony fragments.
Hyperintense lesion in the left lower lobe which might represent a lung mass, pneumonia or atelectasis.
Large centrally necrotic left lower lobe lung mass, with numerous adjacent satellite nodules compatible with primary lung cancer with lymphangitic spread.
Additional pulmonary nodules identified in the left upper lobe measure up to 4 mm, and there is a sub-3-mm nodule in the right upper lobe.
There is associated soft tissue component extending into the spinal canal and compressing the thecal sac tt T7-8, as better characterized on recent MRI.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Indeterminate hypodense lesions within the right kidney and liver, incompletely characterized on this single phase study, may represent benign cysts, though additional metastatic disease is not excluded.
Healed posterior rib fractures on the left.
On [**3-28**] CT of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis were obtained which ultimately showed multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally with the largest being on the left.
His exam remained stable prior to surgery with decreased sensation to light touch below the T6 sensory level at the xiphoid process and inability to distinguish proprioception in bilateral lower extremities.
Although he had a 4 L blood loss during the case, he tolerated the procedure well.
A JP was left in place for drainage of excessive bleeding.
His pain was well controlled through the weekend.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
