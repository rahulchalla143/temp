Admission Date:  [**2108-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-11-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for ARDS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Left IJ Quad lumen CVL - A-line  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 15685**] is a 48yo female patient who is intubated at the time of transfer from [**Hospital3 **].
This 48yoF has a history of alcoholism with recent detox, HTN, depression, anxiety/PTSD who presented to [**Hospital1 **] yesterday after about 24 hours of worsening shortness of breath, headache, non-productive cough, and subjective fevers and chills.
She presented in severe respiratory distress with a room air saturation of 73% and subsequently was placed on BiPap.
Her respiratory distress persisted with tachypnea into the 30s and so she was electively intubated.
Her WBC count was noted to be 19.3 (83%PMN) with a CXR showing patchy bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
She required high doses of propofol for sedation, and eventually became hypotensive, requiring pressor support.
Past Medical History: -hypertension -anxiety disorder -depression -PTSD -alcohol abuse s/p detox one month ago- during which she had a seizure  Social History: 1ppd smoker but no current alcohol or IVDA   Family History: father had CAD, also alcoholism  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Vitals: T100.2 axillary P107  BP121/61  R19  O2 sat92% on100%GENERAL:  patient is sedated, intubated, unresponsive HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2108-5-22**] - CXR: Supine positioning increases the cardiomediastinal caliber and causes pleural effusions to obscure large areas of lung.
Nevertheless there appear to be both widespread interstitial pulmonary abnormality as well as bibasilar consolidation, cardiomegaly, vascular engorgement and an indeterminate volume of pleural effusion.
Right internal jugular line passes at least as far as the upper right atrium but the tip is obscured.
No pneumothorax.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2108-5-24**] - CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process, although this study is limited due to patient motion.
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
Within the limitations of this non-contrast CT, no acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
T1-hyperintensity of the pituitary, without enlargement or a fluid level, which may indicate either mild hemorrhage or a small lesion, such as an adenoma.
No evidence of significant abnormalities in the brain parenchyma or along the cranial nerves on noncontrast evaluation.
Completely unremarkable appearance to the pituitary gland with no evidence of hemorrhage, micro- or macro-adenoma, or other lesion.
No acute intracranial process.

Her initial presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS with very poor oxygenation.
She was also started on very broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl (for aspiration), and Tamiflu (for possible viral etiology).
She did have septic shock with hypotension and tachycardia on presentation.
She presented on norepinephrine support for hypotension.
It was thought that her hypotension and tachycardia was from septic shock from the pulmonary infection.
She developed acute renal failure from ATN with admission Creatinine of 0.6.
Her urine sediment showed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN.
She was noted to have right eye ptosis and disconjugate gaze; MRI of the head was performed which did not show lesions to explain symptoms.
No visual field cut and intact extraocular movements.
This did improve but her altered mental status much worsened.
The MRI of the head showed high signal in pituitary likely hemorrhage vs. adenoma, 1 week later a dedicated MRI of the pituitary with contrast revealed no abnormalities and the radiologist thought the initial findings were most likely artifact.
No other electrolyte or vital sign abnormalities were noted so we held off further workup and she improved.
Of note, after extubation, she had clear delirium and toxic metabolic encephalopathy from all medications used for sedation during her prolonged intubation.
In addition, she had significant alcohol abuse and we questioned the diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy as she had disconjugate gaze, memory loss, confusions, and other consistent elements.
She had elevated AST with normal ALT that was thought to be from alcoholism but repeat LFTs returned to [**Location 213**].
She suffered acute kidney injury from ATN with a peak creatinine of 2.2, this improved to 1.3 upon discharge.
She has proteinuria with a protein/creatinine ratio of 0.9 so when her creatinine reaches baseline or a new baseline the [**Last Name (un) **] would be indicated.
There was no signs of withdrawal.
She also was treated with gabapentin and baclofen for chronic low back pain, tramadol was added given worsened back pain in the area of a decubitus ulcer.
