Admission Date:  [**2168-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-4-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxemia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer, hypothyroidism, and diastolic CHF, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2168**] s/p fall and with concern for C1 and C7 fractures, who now presents from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypoxia and evidence of R-sided pleural effusion on CXR.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] had an O2 Sat in the 80s and underwent imaging that showed a large right-sided pleural effusion.
Due to findings on CXR, the patient was admitted to the MICU for management of his pleural effusions (which have shown to be malignant effusions in the past), given that the Interventional Pulmonart team was unable to perform the procedure this evening.
The patient had no other concerns or complaints.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies  cough, dyspnea or wheezing.
Denies  constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: 1) Prostate cancer w known metastases to ribs and lungs, s/p prostatectomy and XRT to ribs ([**2163**]) 2) Recent C1 and C7 Fractures in [**2-/2168**] 3) Diastolic CHF (EF >50% per recent echo at DCFI) 5) HTN 6) Hypothyroidism 7) BPV 8) H/O cataract surgery 9) H/O shoulder pain 10) Appendectomy  Social History: He lives at [**Location (un) **] Independent Living.
Vitals: T 98.3 HR: 90 BP: 110/57 RR: 22 O2Sat: 97 on 3L NC Constitutional: AOx3, Comfortable HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic Chest: Decreased breath sounds at the right base compared to the left, crackles on the left Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, [**1-18**] Ejection Murmur appreciated in the RUSB, [**1-18**] Holosystolic Murmur at the Apex Abdominal: Soft, ND, Tender to Deep Palpation in the RUQ GU/Flank: No costovertebral angle tenderness Extr/Back: Warm, Well-Perfused, Trace Pitting in the Lower Extremities Skin: No rash .
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count.. FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
I doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, a tiny right apical pneumothorax.
Again seen is prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette; R>L effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation; unusual appearance to the right posterior ribs and right chest wall, unchanged.
Bilateral effusions and parenchymal changes essentially unchanged compared with earlier the same day.
Possible tiny right apical pneumothorax.
Abnormal increased density along right chest wall is unchanged, but of uncertain etiology.
Poor visualization of the right posterior fifth and sixth ribs.
Otherwise, rib lesions would be suspected.
[**2168-4-1**] Radiology LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: IMPRESSION: -No biliary dilatation is seen.
There are no specific signs of cholecystitis or other sources of infection -Bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites -Splenomegaly -Simple right renal cysts .
[**2168-4-1**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: Moderate right pleural effusion has markedly decreased in amount.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
There are persistent low lung volumes.
A small left pleural effusion has increased.
Left lower lobe and left mid perihilar opacities have increased since [**2-14**], unchanged from the prior study, could be worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Opacity in the right lower lobe is a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation, could be atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
[**2168-3-31**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion has recurred, displacing the mediastinum slightly to the left of midline.
Osseous metastasis involving right ribs are longstanding.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer, hypothyroidism, and diastolic CHF, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2168**] s/p fall and with concern for C1 and C7 fractures, who now presents from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypoxia and evidence of R-sided pleural effusion on CXR now s/p thoracentisis with possible HCAP.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: =================  #) HYPOXEMIA/PLEURAL EFFUSION/CONCERN FOR HCAP: Patient was admitted to the MICU with recurrent R-sided pleural effusion with hypoxia requiring no more than 4LNC.
Thoracentesis was performed at bedside with drainage of 1.5L of fluid with negative gram stain, exudative chemistry, and lymphocyte predominance with cytology pending at the time of discharge though overall felt to be c/w prior malignant pleural effusion.
Additionally, despite not having fevers, elevated lactate or a white count, he had a significant bandemia which was new for him and not felt to be related to his chemotherapy drug (not a listed side effect) or his steroids which generally cause demargination of mature neutrophils.
As part of the infectious workup, he underwent RUQ U/S which showed no evidence of cholecytitis.
The plan was to forego further thoracentesis in the future if and when these effusions recur and to instead treat them symptomatically with diuretics and opiates.
# ASYMPTOMATIC HYPOTENSION: Patient was intermittently hypotensive to as low as the 70's systolically without tachycardia and without symptoms.
On discussion with his daughter, it was determined that he has blood pressures that are this low and asymptomatic at rehab.
# Goals of Care: The patient and his HCP/daughter expressed their desire not to escalate care with invasive procedures such as central lines, picc lines, or pressors as patient is in the process of transitioning to hospice.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: ================== #) DIASTOLIC CHF:  The patient was diagnosed from an ECHO in [**2163**], but also had an ECHO at DCFI for concern that his chemotherapy regimen was causing cardiomyopathy, however there was no evidence of cardiomyopathy and his EF was > 50%.
Furosemide was held for hypotension while in the MICU, and restarted at discharge when his pressures could tolerate it for symptomatic management of his effusions.
#) PROSTATE CANCER: Pt has known prostate cancer metastatic to ribs and lungs, with documented malignant effusion on [**6-22**] and [**2-22**].
#) INSOMNIA: Patient had problems with insomnia during his stay.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 106273**],   You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath and were found to have fluid around your lung.
You were initially started on antibiotics but as samples of the fluid did not grow any bacteria we stopped these at the time of discharge.
You will be going back to your facility to focus on controlling your pain and shortness of breath.
