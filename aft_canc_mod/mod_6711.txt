M with widely metastatic melanoma including involvement of liver, lung, bone, subcutaneous nodules and multiple cerebral metastasis.
The therapy is complicated by colitis requiring steroid treatment.
Neurosurgery is consulted with regard to surgical resection of the lesion   Past Medical History: Metastatic melanoma (see below for oncologic history) HTN DM2 .
Past oncologic history: Mr. [**Known lastname 21207**] originally presented in [**2189-6-12**] with a 5-mm malignant melanoma of stage IIC (T4, N0, M0, [**Doctor Last Name **] level IV), at which time he had an excision and then he received interferon for 11 months.
Four months later, he went in for follow up at the VA and he developed a new right preauricular mass at the excision site and underwent reexcision as well as parotidectomy at the VA, followed by involved-field radiation with 5000 cGy in [**2191-7-13**] in Central [**State 1727**].
In [**2192-4-12**], he developed lesions on his lips, right leg, left occiput, and left temple.
All the lesions were excised and pathology revealed incompletely excised metastatic melanoma.
He additionally underwent a CT scan of the torso on [**2192-8-15**] which revealed lung, liver, soft tissue, bone, and adrenal metastasis.
On [**2192-8-23**], he underwent a CT scan of the brain that showed three lesions, two 15 mm lesions in the right and left frontal lobes with associated edema, but no evidence of shift and a third lesion in the right frontoparietal lobe.
Family History: His father had melanoma with extensive disease on his nose which required essentially entire excision of his nose and then he believes he developed metastatic disease.
He died of an MI at age 72.
He has no siblings.
Physical Exam: Upon admission: On examination, the patient is awake, alert, and appropriate His speech appear fluent and comprehension intact He does not appear in any acute distress.
mild papilledema.
hearing and SCM symmetric.
No abnormal movements.

Blood products are seen at the surgical site with a small area of slow diffusion involving the brain at the margin of surgical resection and most likely related to the surgical procedure.
Following gadolinium there is no evidence of a definite area of residual enhancement identified in the right frontal region.
The previously noted right posterior frontal enhancing lesion is also no longer visible.
There remains some mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and corpus callosum.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Marginal slow diffusion could be related to surgical procedure.
Small bilateral subdurals appear related to the recent surgery.
Small areas of susceptibility as before.
CT Head [**2193-3-7**]: FINDINGS: Multiple postoperative changes are notable in the brain including osseous defects consistent with right frontal craniotomy.
Right frontal defects are consistent with surgical mass excision.
A small amount of hyperdense fluid is seen layering posteriorly within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally consistent with a small amount of hemorrhage.
There is no other evidence of large intracranial bleeding.
The paranasal sinuses are notable for mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, more prominently on the left.
There is no evidence of large postoperative intracranial bleeding.
M with widely metastatic melanoma including involvement of liver, lung, bone, subcutaneous nodules and multiple cerebral metastasis.
The therapy is complicated by colitis requiring steroid treatment.
Review of system is notable for increased frequency of HA as well as difficulty negotiating stairways.
Neurological examination after surgery was intact, without focal deficit.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed: Please continue to take Colace/Docusate; while you require narcotic pain medication.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
