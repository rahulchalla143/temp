Images:  EEG: [**7-18**]: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG, because of intermittent  left temporal slowing in the theta range and a single sharp wave in the left anterior temporal lobe.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic region of dysfunction in the left temporal region.
Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
Standard position of orogastric tube.

Partial opacification of the nasal cavity and ethmoidal air cells is likely related to the patient's intubated state.

Psychiatry spoke to her and due to auditory hallucinations and concern for safety in a hotel alone, decided she would benefit from transfer to inpatient psychiatry.
In the MICU, the following potential diagnoses were considered non-convulsive seizure vs. catatonia vs. med overdose vs. NMS.
vs Seratonin syndrome vs. Dystonia vs. infection.
Ativan 2mg was given for concern of catatonia.
Psychiatry saw her and felt that she was sad and tearful but at no danger to herself or others.
Neurology reviewed her EEG with abnormal epileptiform waves in the temporal region and determined that given she had no h/o epilepsy, this presentation of AMS was not eplilepsy.
Psych was less convinced that this was an episode of catatonia given this episode was not preceeded by an unusual affect or features of psychosis.
While we considered that she could have aspirated if she was altered, WBC trended down without intervention.

You were admitted because you were found to have altered mental status.
After extensive testing of your blood, urine, and several imaging studies, you did not have any evidence of trauma to your head, infection in your brain, disruption in blood flow to your brain.
We discussed these results with psychiatrists and neurologists to better understand what had caused you to have an alteration in your mental status.
We concluded that you did not have a seizure, and that most likely your episode of altered mental status was related to your catatonic schizophrenia.
