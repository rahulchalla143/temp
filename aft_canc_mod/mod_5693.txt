Admission Date:  [**2130-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-9-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for right lower quadrant mass suspicious for cancer, status post percutaneous drainage of the right lower quadrant mass in [**2129-12-16**].
The patient had initially presented on [**2129-12-28**], with abdominal pain and a pelvic mass.
CT scan of her abdomen at the time showed a large 7-cm fluid collection in the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower quadrant, and inflammatory process involving the cecum and proximal ascending colon; ascending was suspected.
CT-guided drainage of the cecal mass on [**2129-12-29**], was nondiagnostic.
Pathology results from the right lower quadrant mass showed benign fibroblastic changes of chronic inflammation which could not rule out overlying cancer.
She was to undergo surgery for the right lower quadrant mass on [**2130-2-5**]; however, after long discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8488**], the patient decided to wait a few weeks to build up her strength before having surgery.
The elective resection was planned for [**2130-4-13**]; however, the patient presented on [**2130-4-10**], with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and a fever to 102.
History of a seizure disorder first diagnosed on her last admission in [**2129-12-16**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Significant for mother with hypertension.
Abdomen was flat, soft, right lower quadrant mass palpable and nontender.
CT scan showed a small fluid collection adjacent to the right colonic mass extending up to and around the gallbladder.
There was no extravasation of contrast.
There was an increase in size of the right colonic mass pushing through the abdominal wall.
Given the increase in the right colonic mass with possible reperforation, she was kept n.p.o., started on intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and ampicillin).
Drainage of the new fluid collection failed.
On postoperative day six, tube feeds were attempted; however, the patient developed diarrhea on the tube feeds, therefore they had to be discontinued.
The stool was sent for Clostridium difficile times three and was negative.
The patient denied any nausea or vomiting.
The PICC line was attempted to be placed; however, it was discovered that the patient had bilateral upper extremity deep venous thromboses as well as occlusion of the superior vena cava; therefore, the PICC lines had to be discontinued, and the patient received her antibiotics through peripheral IVs.
The patient remained afebrile until postoperative day 15, at which time she spiked a temperature to 102.6.
It was unable to be discontinued earlier given that the patient had no intravenous access secondary to her bilateral upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Blood cultures at the time the patient spiked grew out coag-negative Staphylococcus resistant to oxacillin.
In addition, a urine cultures grew out greater than 100,000 colonies of enterococcus and greater than 100,000 colonies of coag-negative Staphylococcus.
At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile, and there were no active infectious disease issues.
At that time, imaging revealed a left arm with central venous occlusion and venous outflow through numerous collaterals, and in the right arm central venous occlusion at the right axillary vein.
The patient had had a history of right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, and at physical examination she did have right upper extremity swelling.
In addition, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from interventional radiology was consulted regarding possible recannulization procedure.
The plan was if the superior vena cava syndrome symptoms persisted and/or central access was needed for central chemotherapy therapy, interventional radiology could recanalize.
ONCOLOGY:  The surgical specimen was read by pathology as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with 3/16 positive lymph nodes.
Their impression was stage III adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon with abscess extending to abdominal wall.
They believed that the patient was at high risk for recurrence and recommended adjuvant chemotherapy four to six weeks postoperatively.
NEUROLOGY:  During the patient's previous hospitalization in [**Month (only) 1096**] she developed status epilepticus and was in the medical intensive care unit for an extended period of time.
They had a long discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefit of her seizure medication and informed her that her risks for further seizure and possibly status epilepticus was high.
She was also informed that if she developed status epilepticus there would be a change that they would be unable to stop her seizures.
On the evening of postoperative day 10, the patient developed left upper extremity weakness at approximately 8 o'clock at night.
On physical examination, her cranial nerves were grossly intact, but she had decreased motor strength in her left upper extremity and decreased tone.
Concern was for a stroke (embolic versus hemorrhagic) versus seizure.
A head MRI was also obtained which was negative for stroke.
Toxic metabolic workup including complete blood count, urinalysis, liver function tests, and chest x-ray were all unremarkable.
The chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions; however, no evidence of infection.
An electroencephalogram was obtained which showed diffuse swelling with right temporal spikes consistent with a epileptogenic focus but no seizure activity.
Throughout the rest of the hospital course there was no evidence of seizures or stroke.
The patient continued to refuse her Dilantin even after several discussions regarding the importance of seizure prevention.
POSTOPERATIVE ISSUES:  The patient's pain was controlled with a morphine PCA well.
she was converted to Percocet for the pain which provided adequate pain relief.
The patient did have a Foley postoperatively.
There were issues of low urine output immediately postoperatively, and the patient did require albumin; however, her urine output improved and was adequate throughout the rest of the hospital course.
Intravenous access will need to be addressed if the patient does require central chemotherapy because of the bilateral upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Bilateral upper extremity deep venous thrombosis and superior vena cava syndrome.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:  Follow-up appointments will need to be made for the end of [**Month (only) 547**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Oncology, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Radiation/Oncology, as well as Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for postoperative followup.
