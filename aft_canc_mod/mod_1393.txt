She has known cerebellar metastasis-appearing lesions thought to be secondary to a primary lung malignancy although numerous searches for a primary source have been to no avail.
She has received IVIG therapy for a her paraneoplastic encephalitis and has also received cytoxan for the same.
She has baseline trouble with poor vision and double vision for which she occasionally wears a patch.

A NCHCT showed the presence of increased cerebellar metastases with compression of the fourth ventricle causing mild hydrocephalus as compared to previous CT scans.
MRI with contrast as compared to prior MRI in [**2126-3-8**] shows the presence of at least one large cerebellar lesion with surrounding edema that is contrast-enhancing with central necrosis, as well as the presence of at least two left hemispheric lesions of similar appearance.

- PEG tube placed [**5-25**] due to inability to tolerate PO intake - MRI of the brain and cervical spine notable for posterior cord enhancement at C4-C6 but was otherwise unrevealing.

- on discharge - complete right CN VI palsy was present with inability to abduct eye past midline as well as a partial left CN VI palsy.
Vertical nystagmus was present on upgaze.
Patient had mild proximal weakness, mild dysmetria and overshoot more pronounced on the left, mild truncal instability with unsteady gait, requiring assistance for ambulation.
[**2125-6-8**] - readmitted with respiratory failire thought to be [**1-9**] aspiration PNA requiring intubation and ventilation and failed extubation - Rx vancomycin and cefepime and ultimately narrowed to CTX for proteus that grew out of her sputum - tracheostomy and therapeutic bronchoscopy [**2125-6-15**] - [**6-17**] 5 days of IVIg, - Rx prednisone 60mg qd, and Pyridostigmine 60mg PO for symptomatic relief of muscle weakness and oculobulbar symptoms (disconjugate gaze and dysphagia).
- Failed Passey-Muir trial due to secretions .
Cancer workup - Features concerning for a small cell lung cancer, an exhaustive search for primary malignancy was performed.
- CT torso [**5-21**] showed no mass but GG in upper lobes (infx vs infl), borderline mediastinal LAD, prominent R-hilar node, increased endometrial fluid, confirmed by transvaginal U/S.
- ENT was consulted, and thought head/neck malignancy unlikely.
- Colonoscopy ([**5-24**]) showed a lipoma in the proximal ascending colon, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, - Mammography was negative.
- Dermatology examination showed no evidence of skin cancer.
- Bronchoscopy showed no suspicious lesions - PET CT showed no definitive mass or lesion, but did show uptake in bilateral hilar region and right lower lobe, presumed to be inconclusive.

HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.

VIII: Decreased Hearing bilaterally.
There is alos dysmetria and some ataxia on assessment of lower extremities, more so on the right vs. the left.
Pertinent Results: INDICATION: 75-year-old woman with anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies, presenting with worsening cerebral mets.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted and gradient echo sequences were obtained without contrast.
There is increase in surrounding FLAIR high-signal intensity and mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
The left temporal lesion measures 2.6 x 2.3 cm on the present scan as compared to 5 mm on the previous scan.
Similarly, there is an increase in size of the left parasagittal and left precentral lesions.
Mild obstructive hydrocephalus is seen.
There is no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and orbits are unremarkable.
Opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells is unchanged.
Considerable increase in size of left cerebellar lesion with increased mass effect on the fourth ventricle with mild obstructive hydrocephalus.
Increase in size of the supratentorial lesions with one new lesion seen in the left posterior temporal location.
Considerable increase in size of left cerebellar lesion with increased mass effect on the fourth ventricle with mild obstructive hydrocephalus.
Increase in size of the supratentorial lesions with one new lesion seen in the left posterior temporal location.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo, RHF, with a history of Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody syndrome, [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] myasthenic symdrome, with suspected small cell cancer with known cerebellar mets, p/w change in mental status, weakness, headache, and falling to the right side.
CT showed new and expanding cerebellar lesions.
Etiology was likely metastatic disease.
The fact that there was developing hydrocephalus and obstruction of the fourth ventricle was concerning for herniation.

You were found to have worsening brain metastases.
In conjuction with the neurosurgeons, you opted not to persue further treatment or diagnostics.
Your hospice providers will determine the benefit of medications used in limiting your pain and suffering.
