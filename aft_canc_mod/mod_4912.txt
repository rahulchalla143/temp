History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7111**] is a 61 y/o M s/p a recent admission for fatigue with liver and pleural biopsies significant for poorly differentiated carcinoma who presents from home with nausea and vomiting.
His symptoms began in [**8-24**], when he presented to an outside hospital with weight loss, fevers, and chills and was found to have multiple liver masses that were previously thought to be abscesses.
He is s/p multiple drains and antibiotic courses, most recently a six week course of ceftriaxone and flagyl completed on [**12-13**] for presumed liver abscesses.
Of note, there have been no positive cultures from the fluid taken from these abscesses to date so he has been on empiric antibiotic courses.
Patient reports nausea and dry heaves since [**12-13**] and vomiting since yesterday.
Reports 3-4 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting; no coffee grounds, mostly food contents.
He has also had DOE since that time, with a cough that has persisted for several months.
Denies diarrhea/abd pain/constipation/melena/hematochezia or fevers and chills.
He also endorses a 60lb unintentional weight loss in the last [**2-15**] months.

There is a presumed right pleural effusion with likely loculated component.
However, conceivably these pleural findings could also reflect a solid component and metastatic pleural disease cannot be entirely excluded particularly in light of given history.
There is likely associated atelectasis due to the volume loss at the right lower lobe.
Progression of large complex hepatic lesion which now occupies greater than 60% of the hepatic parenchyma.
Findings are concordant with recent biopsy results of poorly differentiated carcinoma.
At this point, there are no imaging features suggestive of abscess.
Increase in size and of numerous pulmonary nodules seen on limited views of the lung bases.
New appearance of multiple mesenteric implants suggestive of metastatic disease.
[**2192-12-19**] R HIP XR: Longitudinally oriented lucency with ground glass internal matrix and thick sclerotic rim.
The appearance is most suggestive of fibrous dysplasia rather than metastasis.
Lucency in the left sacral ala most likely represents bowel gas, but repeat pelvic film within the next several weeks could help to confirm this.
No new consolidations have been seen.
No new effusion or pneumothorax have been demonstrated.
[**2192-12-21**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia.
Anterolateral ST segment elevation suggests an acute injury pattern.
Consider acute myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-12-5**] sinus tachycardia and ST segment elevation are new.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion, primarily anterior to the right ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a small pericardial effusion primarily along the right AV groove.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is interval progression of the left retrocardiac consolidation that might represent interval development of atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.
Right multifocal basal abnormalities including lungs and pleura are unchanged.
No interval development of pneumothorax is demonstrated on the current radiograph.
DISCHARGE LABS: 136  97  11 ------------ 50 3.1  31  0.4  Ca: 7.9 Mg: 2.0 P: 3.2       7.8 43.1 > < 391      24.4  Brief Hospital Course: 61 year old male with recent pleural and liver biopsies consistent with undifferentiated carcinoma presenting with nausea and vomiting, course complicated by pericardial effusion.
##Nausea/vomiting: Patients symptoms were attributed to his underlying malignancy with significant involvement of his liver (mass occupies >60% of hepatic parenchyma on CT Abd).
Patient was hydrated with IVF and given zofran and compazine.
His symptoms improved and was tolerating a regular diet with minimal symptoms at the time of discharge.
##Carcinoma: Patient with recent right pleural biopsy and liver biopsy suggestive of undifferentiated carcinoma though primary source unclear.
CT abdomen was performed and showed interval progression of the mass in the liver, increase in size and number of pulmonary nodules and new appearance of multiple mesenteric implants.
No abscess noted.
Preliminary diagnosis was discussed with patient and social work was consulted to help with new diagnosis.
Pericardial Effusion: On day of planned discharge, patient was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive.
ECG showed diffuse ST elevations and patient had a triphasic rub on cardiac exam.
Code STEMI was called and patient was noted to have a small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade on bedside echo.
He was stable overnight in the CCU, and echo the next day showed smaller effusion size.
Given recent diagnosis of carcinoma, this effusion is likely malignant in origin.
It was felt that there was no need for urgent pericardiocentesis and patient was tranferred back to the medicine team.
CXR without signs of new infection, no abscess on CT abdomen, no diarrhea, and blood cultures from [**12-18**] and [**12-19**] with no growth to date.
His fevers were attributed to his underlying malignancy.
##Dyspnea: Dyspnea primarily on exertion w/o sxs of heart failure.
Rt sided pleural effusion on CXR.
After fluid resuscitation in the setting of his hypotensive episode (see above), patient developed a 4 liter oxygen requirement.
His underlying dyspnea was attributed to pleural effusion and general deconditioning given malignancy.
Attributed to patient's dehydration in the setting of nausea and vomiting.
Improved with fluid rehydration.
## Anemia: Patient with anemia below previous baseline of 26.
Iron studies during previous admission consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
No signs of active bleeding on exam (guaiac negative) and HD stable.
Alk phos remained elevated (271 on discharge).
Particle/Crystal(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Nausea and vomiting Metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma involving lung and liver (primary unknown) Pericardial effusion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 7111**],  You were admitted to the hospital with nausea and vomiting.
We believe that these symptoms are likely related to your underlying cancer involving your liver.
You also had a short stay in the cardiac intensive care unit as there was fluid around your heart, probably also related to the cancer- studies showed that your heart is working properly and the fluid is decreasing in size.
