No new foci of consolidations.
Interval development of large right and moderate-sized left pleural effusions with subsegmental atelectasis of the lower lung lobes.
* [**10-28**] TEE: No vegetation.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Regional WMA include near akinesis of the inferior and IL walls.
The remaining walls are mildly hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi.
RV mildly dilated with free wall HK.
Severe aortic stenosis is not suggested.
Moderate PA systolic HTN.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation.
* [**2177-10-24**] P-MIBI: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear images with mild, partially reversible perfusion defect in the distal anterior wall.
Severe global HK with depressed LVEF of 33%.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) MRSA bacteremia and septic arthritis: Seen by orthopedics who tapped joint, cultures significant for septic joint with MRSA in synovial culture.
While on medical floor, had atrial fibrillation with RBR with respiratory distress and septic picture and was transferred to MICU.
TTE on [**10-27**] remarkable for EF 30%, negative for vegetation and TEE the following day also negative for vegetation.
The pt was weaned down from NRB to NC from a respiratory standpoint.
Vancomycin dosing was adjusted to 750 mg IV bid for high troughs.
* 2) Ischemic heart disease: P-MIBI during admission with a mild partially reversible anterior wall defect.
* 3) CHF: EF on echo around 30%, serial imaging studies in ICU consistent with left-sided heart failure.
Given diuresis with i/o goal of negative daily with subsequent improvement of b/l pleural effusions.
* 4) Legionella pneumonia: Resolving multifocal pneumonia on CT. s/p 14-day course of Levofloxacin in 09/[**2177**].
Urinary legionella antigen negative.
Unlear about the etiology of his underlying renal insufficiency.
* 6) CLL: Elevated WBC at baseline, likely further exacerbated by infection though his current differential is consistent with CLL.
His chronic anemia and transfusion dependence likely [**2-6**] his hematologic malignancy +/- contribution from renal failure.

Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any of the following: fever, chills, night sweats, increasing R shoulder pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased shortness of breath.
You were diagnosed with a MRSA infection of your R shoulder joint and in your bloodstream.
