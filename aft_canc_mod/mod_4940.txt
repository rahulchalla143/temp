*** wet read *** intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilation CBD 1.6cm.
panc head mass, multiple liver masses.
portal vein patent w/ antegrade flow, but shown to be occluded at level of mass on CT. gallstones, negative son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) **] sign.
Large hypoenhancing pancreatic head and uncinate process mass (5cm), which has progressed in size and degree of local invasion.
This mass has resulted in occlusion of the portal vein from the confluence extending into the SMV and splenic vein.
Additionally, the mass encases the celiac axis and its branches, as well as the SMA and its proximal branches.
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, increased in the interval, and likely related to the large pancreatic head mass.
Diffuse metastatic disease to the liver, which has increased in size and number in the interval.
Additionally, numerous pulmonary nodules which are stable are noted, likely related to metastatic disease.
Trace free fluid within the pelvis.
Small to moderate pericaridal effusion.
