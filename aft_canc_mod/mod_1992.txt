BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1005**] is a 51-year- old gentleman with metastatic esophageal cancer associated with bulky abdomen lymphadenopathy causing obstructive renal failure who was admitted for hypocalcemia.
The patient had been previously admitted at [**Hospital1 188**] from [**2167-6-18**] to [**2167-6-30**] for acute renal failure which had improved and from where he was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] where he had been receiving Taxol.
On that date he had blood work done; which by report revealed a low K and a calcium of 5.9.
The symptoms persisted and progressed over the subsequent 2 days, at which time the patient was brought to the emergency room for evaluation.
He denies any recent significant weight change, fevers, chills, sweats, headache, visual changes, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, lower extremity edema.
intake for several months with decreased appetite.
No rubs, murmurs or gallops were appreciated.
LUNGS: There is dullness to percussion with decreased breath sounds bilaterally 1/2 up in the left lung and [**12-26**] third up in the right lung.
There is mild distention.
No tenderness.
No caput medusa.
There are some petechiae at bilateral nephrostomy tube sites.
EXTREMITIES: Trace edema at the ankles bilaterally.
There is jerking of movement of all 4 limbs, and there is positive Trousseau.
There is horizontal nystagmus.
There are slightly increased DTRs bilaterally.
RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  EKG reveals sinus tachycardia at 113.
QT was difficult to assess because of tremor-induced artifact.
Borderline low voltage.
Flattened T waves across the precordium.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 1005**] is a 51-year- old gentleman with metastatic esophageal cancer with obstructive nephropathy caused by bulky lymphadenopathy with bilateral nephrostomy tubes admitted for weakness, tremor and hypocalcemia.
intake, and possibly    recent increased renal excretion of potassium/magnesium    secondary to loop diuretic.
His electrolytes -    including calcium, magnesium and phosphorous - were    checked daily and repleted appropriately.
His tremor and    myoclonic jerking-like movements improved with the    repletion of the calcium and magnesium.
An x-    ray of his lungs revealed bilateral pleural effusion as    already suspected from his physical exam.
However, after    consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] it was thought that a    diagnostic thoracentesis was not necessary since the    patient did not have any symptoms of dyspnea or hypoxia,    and finding malignant cells in the pleural fluid would not    have changed his prognosis or management at this time.
PROPHYLAXIS: During his hospital stay the patient received    physical therapy to walk, PPI for gastric ulcer    prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Weakness, myoclonus, hoarse voice, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, esophageal cancer with metastasis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, bilateral nephrostomy tubes.
