History of Present Illness: The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed woman with a history of bipolar disorder, tobacco abuse, and cocaine abuse who presented to the emergency with a one-month history of neurological symptoms.
Her symptoms began one month ago when she suddenly started seeing ??????rainbows??????
She had several episodes of these bursts each week.
She never experienced any loss of vision or blindness.
She has had some difficulty with blurry near vision over the past month and noted that she also had trouble seeing her big TV from several feet away; she never experienced any blindness or double vision.
She denied seeing any people, animals, or other objects and only ever experienced rounded bursts of different colors.
She had no headache, weakness, numbness, tingling, changes in smell or taste, out-of-body sensations, or unusual movements associated with the color bursts.
She had only a single episode of nausea and vomiting associated with the color burst.
She has never had any symptoms like this before.
The onset of the headache was gradual and started on the left temporal aspect of her head.
Initially it was about [**5-31**] in intensity but it gradually grew worse over the next two weeks and at the time of presentation was [**12-1**].
She described the pain as sharp, constant, and unremitting.
She denied any throbbing or pulsing quality.
The pain was worse when she was supine and when she coughed or sneezed, and it occasionally woke her from sleep.

Review of systems is remarkable for unintentional weight loss of 25 pounds over the past few months, occasional night sweats and chills, and a recent dental extraction for an infection in her upper teeth.

No midline shift or evidence of herniation.
Left occipital mass measuring 2.4 x 1.1 cm in size, which appears to be intra-axial in location, with surrounding edema.
Given the peripheral location of the mass and the well-defined outlines, the mass likely represents metastatic disease than a primary brain neoplasm.
Although meningioma is in consideration given its peripheral location, the appearances are less typical.
Incidental 7 x 6 mm in pars intermedia cyst within the pituitary foci without significant mass suprasellar extension.
No evidence of acute infarct or hydrocephalus.
No masses or signs of hilar lymphadenopathy.
No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
Three necrotic 8-10 mm mediastinal nodes as described above are concerning for metastases.
Moderate paraseptal emphysema without pulmonary lesion.
Focal area of apparent small bowel wall thickening in the distal duodenum (4th portion) to proximal jejunum concerning for adenocarcinoma for which direct visualization with biopsy is recommended.
Minimal post-surgical pneumocephalus with minimal hyperdense material in the post-surgical bed, which may be a small amount of hemorrhage, but no large bleed.
No midline shift.
MRI final read pending at time of discharge  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cocaine abuse, tobacco abuse, and mood disorder who presented with a severe, constant, left-sided headache of two weeks' duration associated with a recent 25-pound unintentional weight loss, found on imaging to have a left occipital brain mass concerning for metastasis.
Hospital course by problem: #Brain mass: She initially presented with headache and visual disturbances; the visual disturbances did not cur.
Given its radiologic appearance, there was concern for metastasis.
A CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to search for a primary tumor; it revealed 3 mediastinal necrotic lymph nodes concerning for metastases and wall thickening in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum concerning for adenocarcinoma.
Other causes, such as tuberculosis, HIV, and sarcoidosis, were also considered; HIV test was negative and a PPD was placed on Day 1 which showed no induration.
Given the symptomatic nature of the brain lesion, excision biopsy of the lymph nodes and the intestinal lesion was deferred until pathology of the brain lesion could be obtained.
She was placed on Levetiracetam 500 q12h for seizure prevention given the prior visual symptoms.
The patient remained in the hospital in anticipation of the brain lesion resection on [**2157-11-30**] by the Neurosurgery service.
#Headache: Given the gradual onset, constant severe pain, left-sided location, worsening with supine position, and lack of previous history of headache, the brain mass was thought to be the most likely etiology of her headache.
Her pain was controlled with tramadol and oxycodone as needed.
Surgery was without complication and the patient tolerated it well.
Post op CT revealed post op changes with minimal hemorrhage.
Her post op MRI revealed post changes and adequate resection.

During the course of your hospitalization, several tests were done, including imaging of your head (CT and MRI scans) which showed a large mass in the back of your brain.
Because there was some concern that this mass may have been from the spread of a cancer somewhere else in your body, a CT scan of your body was done as well.
This showed some abnormalities in lymph nodes and in the wall of your gut.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
