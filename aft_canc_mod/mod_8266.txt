Patient presented to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital with worsening abdominal distension and vague abdominal pain over the past 5 days (starting Friday prior to presentation) after his most recent therapeutic tap on Tuesday prior to presentation at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital.
Reports that his pain is located in the RUQ, not associated with radiation.
He reports SOB which he attributes to his increased abdominal girth.
He denies worsening LE edema.

Radiology  [**2128-6-7**] CXR: fibrosis and hypertension are chronic.
Mild pulmonary edema is likely.
Left upper lobe edema is most prominent, alternatively pneumonia.
[**2128-6-7**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.Decreased size of the left flank hematoma compared to previous CT. Gas overlying the hematoma from recent paracentesis raises the question that the bloody fluid obtained was sampled from the hematoma.
Large volume of ascites remains.
Background of hepatic cirrhosis and multiple focal nodules which are characterized on the subsequent CT scan.
[**6-8**] BLE LENIs:  No lower extremity DVT.
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Unchanged bilateral parenchymal opacities that are slightly more radiolucent than on the previous image.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Diffuse perivascular and subpleural ground-glass opacities in the lungs are new since [**2128-6-7**], have appeared on top of pre-existing fibrotic changes and honeycombing.

[**2128-6-15**] CXR (PA/LAT) CONCLUSION:  There is slight increase in the opacities in the left lung base of indeterminate etiology and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] cannot be excluded  [**2128-6-18**] Abdominal US IMPRESSION:  Residual complex fluid collection in the left lower quadrant abdominal wall, though overall smaller in size than most recent prior  [**2128-6-18**] Renal US CONCLUSION:  Normal-appearing kidneys without evidence of obstruction.
Large volume ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: 54M history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis not on transplant list and ascites with frequent therapeutic abdominal taps, with a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for expedited liver transplant evaluation in setting of hepatic encephalopathy, elevated Cr and elevated PA pressure on TTE, presenting with worsening abdominal pain and distension with transient hypotension from OSH found to have VRE infected left flank hematoma likely iatrogenic in setting of multiple recent paracentesis performed with elevated INR.
He initially had good source control for his sepsis but had to have multiple drainages of the infected hematoma.
He required aggressive colloid resuscitation resulting in new oxygen requirement likely multi-factorial from ?
HCAP, atelectasis, underlying pulmonary hypertension, and ultimately became hypotensive on [**2128-6-18**] despite fluid resuscitation requiring transfer to MICU.
In the MICU, it was confirmed that the patient understood the seriousness of his illness and the fact that he is not a candidate for transplant and therefore would not benefit from interventions such as dialysis, intubation, or resucitation which would likely be futile given his poor prognosis.
# Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infected flank hematoma with peritonitis Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER with leukocytosis, tachycardia, hypotension, and evidence of peritonitis on paracentesis.
He was initially admitted to MICU GREEN with relative hypotension (SBP 80) and did not require pressor support.
He was started on daptomycin ([**Date range (1) 110635**]) in addition to 7-day course of ceftriaxone ([**2128-6-8**] - [**2128-6-14**]) for SBP with re-initiation of ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
Transplant surgery evaluated the patient given concern for secondary etiology of peritonitis such as micro-perforation in setting of recent paracenteses or nidus of infection from the hematoma.
It was discussed whether or not to place a drain for the hematoma; however, upon further discussion, it was thought that the risk would outweigh the benefit given his underlying coagulopathy and the hard composition of the hematoma.
Of note, he received albumin on day 1 and day 3 with day 3 albumin given for both SBP and the large volume repeat paracentesis performed on that day.
He initially improved; however, he started to have relative hypotension requiring colloid resuscitation thought to be from inadequate source control necessitating multiple other attempts of drainage of the infected superficial complex fluid collection, which turned out to be purulent in nature.
It was also clarified with radiology that his superficial flank abscess did not communicate with the peritoneum.
# Hypotension Patient was initially hypotensive on admission from sepsis and hypovolemia in setting of diuretics.
His blood pressure improved to SBP 90-110s with colloid resuscitation.
However, patient had trend down in SBP to high 70s/low 80s on [**2128-6-18**] again despite volume resuscitaton resulting in a trigger event and transfer back to the MICU.
Given his cardiopulmonary circuit issues with pulmonary hypertension, it is suspected that he may have significant RV pressure/volume overload leading to right-sided heart failure.
His hypotension may be due to interventricular dependence with septum bowing  into the LV resulting in decreased LV cardiac output and resultant hypotension.
There was no evidence of an intra-abdominal bleed, significant GI bleed, adrenal insufficiency, or severe ongoing sepsis.
He was transferred to ICU for persistent hypotension despite volume resuscitation and difficulty of further volume resuscitation in setting of oliguric renal failure.
Hypotension was likely multifactorial from ongoing sepsis with poor source control despite IR-guided drainage of hematoma in addition to decreased cardiac output in setting of R sided heart failure in setting of pulmonary and portal hypertension.
# Cirhosis (MELD 25) Patient has history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by ascites requiring frequent thoracentesis despite medical therapy.
He is not currently a transplant candidate due to severe pulmonary hypertension.
He had a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for expedited liver tranpslant evaluation in setting of hepatic encephalopathy, elevated Cr and elevated PA pressure on TTE.
Per OMR notes, however, it appears this workup has been halted at least temporarily because of his severe pulmonary hypertension for which he is recently seeing a pulmonologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Additionally, he is known to have multiple liver lesions in multiple segments on both sides of the liver, highly suggestive of HCC and with an AFP of 248 ([**3-/2128**]) and 148 (6/[**2127**]).
His diuretics were held given sepsis and hypotension in addition to nadolol.
He developed recurrent asterixis suggestive of further liver disease decompensation and toxic-metabolic effect from ARF.
The patient was not a candidate for transplant and therefore would not benefit from interventions such as dialysis, intubation, or resucitation which would likely be futile given his poor prognosis.
# Acute renal failure: sCr elevated from baseline of 0.8-1.0 on admission to Cr 1.5.
Likely multi-factorial from poor ECV in setting of maladapative vascular patterns in liver disease leading to ATN with component of CIN from recent contrast load, cannot exclude HRS as well.
# Hypoxemia Patient developed oxygen requirement on [**2128-6-14**] after 4 units of FFP, albumin 25 % 50 gm IV.
Impression was that current situation is multifactorial including primary pulmonary hypertension with RV failure likely hepatopulmonary syndrome given orthodeoxia, intracardiac shunt (R-->L), lung fibrosis, atelectasis related to splinting and abdominal embarrassment from ascites.
atypical infection for which he was started on HCAP coverage including cefepime and levofloxacin.
Likely from multiple blood draws but cannot rule out bleeding from multiple paracentesis in setting of low platelets and coagulopathy although seems unlikely given non-hemorrhagic ascites.
Other issue may be occult GIB as had + guiaic stool on [**2128-6-18**].
# Tachycardia: Patient had persistent tachycardia throughout hospital course.
It is likely that his tachycardia was compensatory given his cardiopulmonary circuit physiology.
# Hyponatremia: Na was 125 upon presentation.Likely in setting of hypovolemia and from sepsis.
He then developed recurent asterixis in setting of decompensated liver disease and toxic-metabolic issues from ARF.
The patient was not candidate for transplant and, therefore, would not benefit from interventions such as dialysis, intubation, or resuscitation which would likely be futile given his poor prognosis.
The family understood the patient's illness and prognosis and agreed with comfort-focused care.
