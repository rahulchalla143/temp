HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female whose past medical history is significant for myelodysplastic syndrome secondary to high dosed chemotherapy for breast cancer.
Patient was diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2181**], received multiple rounds of high dosed chemotherapy, who had stem cell rescue that responded quite well.
She developed myelodysplasia five years ago and is scheduled today for admission for a matched unrelated donor allogenic transplant.
The patient has been scheduled multiple times for this matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant, but the day has been pushed back secondary to fevers and infections.
In early [**2187**], the patient presented with fatigue and pancytopenia, was diagnosed with MDS.
The course of this disease has been complicated by multiple infections including Clostridium difficile and multiple fevers.
The patient was hospitalized from [**2188-6-14**] to [**2188-6-21**] for Clostridium difficile colitis secondary to Cipro and Flagyl therapy for rectal abscesses in [**4-22**].
Her most recent hospitalization prior to this one was in [**7-14**] for fever in the setting of nasal congestion.
Stage III breast cancer status post chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplant.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
The patient also has a history of colitis 20 years ago, unknown type.
ALLERGIES:  The patient reports an allergy to sulfa to which she gets rash and facial edema.
Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary:  She had clear lungs bilaterally, no wheezes, no crackles.
Her extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema with rashes.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 50-year-old retired nurse, patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with MDS diagnosed in early of [**2187**] that developed after high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue for Stage III inflammatory breast cancer, which was first diagnosed in [**2181**].
Her course prior to this admission was complicated by multiple infections, pharyngeal abscesses, perirectal abscesses, Clostridium difficile A colitis, as well as admission for fever and nasal congestion.
She reported abdominal pain occasionally, but this resolved on its own with bowel movements.
On day-6, the patient had a temperature to 100.1 and complained of sweats chronically.
No evidence for infection.
According to the protocol, she was started on acyclovir as well as fluconazole, and was monitored for infection further.
Patient occasionally had nonproductive cough, complained of myalgias and headaches along with her receiving the chemotherapy treatment.
Continued to have low grade temperatures while neutropenic.
On day -1, the patient had some cold symptoms, rhinorrhea, cough, and postnasal drip, and some shortness of breath overnight with dyspnea on exertion and pleuritic pain in his right chest with deep inspiration.
She also had diarrhea with poor appetite and abdominal bloating.
The patient was taking some p.o., was on GI prophylaxis and on bowel regimen, and for infectious disease, the patient had no cultures isolating any organisms.
Line sites had minimal erythema.
On day of transplant, the patient received stem cell infusion and developed right upper quadrant pain.
She reported shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
Shortness of breath persisted.
Later that evening the patient became hypoxic into the 70s on room air, in the low 90s on nonrebreather.
While being evaluated for the SICU admission, the symptoms resolved spontaneously.
It was thought at this time the patient had a reaction to her stem cell infusion.
It was unclear whether she had a reaction to the DMSO or if the cells released inflammatory cascade upon entering the pulmonary vasculature after infusion.
It was also unclear whether or not the patient had a pneumonia underlying all of the clinical picture at that time.
She had extensive pulmonary edema and fluid overload requiring diuresis.
She went into acute renal failure with creatinine that rose from 0.6 up to 2.8 within 24 hours.
It was thought that this hemoglobin was toxic to her renal tubules and caused an ATN picture.
However, we could not rule out that the pulmonary process that had taken place had also had some link to the declining renal function, or whether or not the DMSO caused a decline in renal function.
At this time, it was noted that the patient also had elevated troponin-T to 0.2, and back check of laboratories that were done showed that she had elevated LDH and CKs.
The persistent pulmonary edema  prompted a echocardiogram.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed an EF of 20% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, no masses or thrombi were noted on the echocardiogram done on [**2188-8-7**].
CT of the chest done on that day revealed pulmonary edema, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial thickening consistent with pulmonary edema, but could not rule out a pneumonia.
At this time, it was felt that the patient's history of receiving multiple cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents as well as chest wall radiation as well as multiple high doses of cytoxan could all have been combined to cause heart failure picture around the time of her transplant, and some degree of myocardial necrosis.
Although at no time did the patient ever have chest pain, chest pressure, chest tightness, or EKG changes.
It was not thought that the patient was ever in acute coronary syndrome.
On day +3 given this new picture, consultation with Infectious Disease specialists, renal specialists, cardiac specialists, and the primary Hematology team, it was felt that the best thing for the patient would be to continue cyclosporin for immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease.
It was determined to hold methotrexate or use of any other additional agents given the patient's poor renal function at that time.
Acyclovir and fluconazole were held because the patient had elevated LFTs in this clinical picture.
Complained of persistent dry cough, but this lessened each day with further diuresis.
It was thought that she could be having some type of septic picture developing.
The following day the patient reported much improvement in her symptoms, but in the afternoon of day +5, the patient spiked a fever to 102.7 that persisted.
No changes made in antibiotic coverage.
