He also had Abd CT w/o contrast [**2106-4-1**] which showed narrowing of post-bulbar duodenum (stricture as above), with cystic lesion at L4.
MRI cervical spine was reportedly performed today in [**Location (un) 1411**] w/o gadolinium and showed Thoracic lesions above.
Pt denies fevers, abd pain, diarrhea, or night sweats.

Pt also had trace aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids with one episode of significant aspiration with large consecutive sips of thin liquids.
Pt had a spontaneous throat clear in response to penetration which was moderately effective for clearing the airway, more so with nectar-thick liquids than with thin liquids.
Brief Hospital Course: In Summary (please see below for more details): 80 yo m with hx MVR bioprosthetic, AF on coumadin, 1 month hx of left shoulder and side pain, presents after MRI noted what looked like mets cancer at T1, T2, and T3.
Biopsy of the spine identified multiple myeloma as the cause of the lytic lesions.
His hospital course has included: - posterior lumbar fusions on [**2106-6-21**] - Anterior lumbar fusion [**2106-7-20**] - ileus and gastric outlet obstruction, requiring dilation - acalculous cholecystitis and infectious pericholecystic fluid - C difficile diarrhea - right sided exudative pleural effusion s/p chest tube and removal - health care associate pneumonia (treated with vanc/cefe/flagyl) - sacral decubitus ulcer On discharge, his condition has significantly improved.
Hospital Course: #) Multiple Myeloma: Pt presented initially with concern for metastatic disease seen on outside MRI.
He was found to have a pathologic L4 fracture in need of stabilization and his multiple myeloma was diagnosed via tissue pathology from posterior spine stabilization on [**2106-6-21**].
Heme/Onc and Rad/Onc were aware of patient but put further treatment or evaluation for multiple myeloma on hold until more acute hospital issues are resolved (see below).
#) Pathologic Spine Fracture: Pt had lumbar instability due to L4 lytic lesion found incidentally on initial MRI.
Pt had no symptoms at time of this discovery.
Due to extent of metastatic destruction, also needed second surgery for anterior spine stabilization.
Pt also had known benign duodenal stricture dilated x 4 at OSH ([**Hospital1 882**]/[**Hospital1 112**] - see Atrius records) in [**Month (only) 547**]/[**Month (only) 116**].
He became acutely obstructed on [**2106-6-25**] with AXR showing severe dilation of his stomach.
Afterward pt had some improvement but over the next 10 days twice become more distended and had NGTs placed twice with some bilious output from the NGT and abdominal relief each time.
Possible that the 2nd two events were due to total bowel distension and ileus [**2-24**] to narcotics, Cdiff, immobility, and limited diet as much as a problem with the duodenal stricture as they were not completely relieved with NGT placement and abdominal imaging showed persistently dilated bowel loops.
After his anterior fusion, abdomen remained distended possibly from gastric obstruction/post-operative ileus/narcotic use.
However there was concern for aspiration pneumonia and patient was transferred to MICU for respiratory distress.
#) Cdiff Infection: Pt started developing leukocytosis with low grade temps on [**2106-6-29**].
Was having very little stool but it was liquid and Cdiff toxin sent on [**2106-6-30**] came back positive on [**2106-7-1**].
Bowel distension slowly improved with this treatment and abdominal pain slowly resolved.
However, continued to have persistently dilated bowel loops as noted above.
#) Poor respiratory status: This was not present on hospital admission and CXR on [**2106-6-29**] had no effusion but PICC confirmation CXR on [**7-2**] showed large unilateral (right) effusion which had developed in the 3 day interval.
Pt had worsening of breathing status a day or two before this was observed as well as discomfort in R side which presumably was due to effusion although initially had been attributed to either Cdiff or Choleystitis as both were being evaluated at that time.
Pt was doing okay on 2-3L NC but fluid was not responding well to lasix when on the evening of [**7-5**] he became acutely tachypnic and was transfered to the ICU where he was briefly on BIPAP and CT surgery placed a chest tube with >1L of output.
Pt now with stabilized respiratory status and has largely resolved effusion on f/u CXRs.
After arrival to the floor, stayed comfortable on RA-2L NC with only minimal reaccumulation of R pleural effusion noted on f/u CXRs.
Completed 8 day course of Cefepime/IV Vancomycin as noted above for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia and WBC which had spiked up on day of hospital transfer trended down to the normal range with these treatments.
EKG was unchanged from previous, ABG shows alkolosis, Multiple CXRs and MRI with contrast ([**7-29**]) showed only stable atelectasis and stable right-sided pleural effusion, with no evidence of pneumonia or PE.
Started therapeutic heparin to treat presumptive PE on [**7-28**]; He was not fluid overloaded and did not improve w/ lasix.
Given aspiration risk, pleural effusion and previous HCAP, restarted IV vancomycin and cefipime on [**7-29**] for 1 week.
#) Question of Cholecystitis: During time when pt initially developed leukocytosis, low grade temps, and abd distension, concern developed about possible gallbladder process.
Abdominal CT had showed GB enlargement but picture muddied by fluid around gallbladder from small amount of ascites due to low albumin.
This showed evidence of acute cholecystitis with caveat that some question if could be falsely positive in setting of NPO status.
Development of R pleural effusion raised concern again for GB process and resulting sympathetic effusion in right lung.
However, pt improved again with drainage of pleural effusion and empiric treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia and GI consulting service agreed that less likely pt had cholecystitis in current setting although pt continued to remain at very high risk for acalculous cholecystitis due to his overall level of poor health.
Family actually thought patient looked better than he had the entire hospitalization that day but the next day delirium seemed further worsened and that night patient again required ICU transfer due to 2 blood containing bowel movements and a small Hct drop.
In the MICU patient had visual hallucinations and required restraints because started pulling at lines.
On POD2 after anterior spinal fusion pt became slightly agitated.
#) GI Bleed: Although patient had multiple above GI issues, no GI bleeding had been noted during first 3 weeks of hospitalization.
Pt had history of bleeding hemorrhoids and was on  [**Hospital1 **] omeprazole for GERD/GI prophylaxis considering his level of sickness.
On the afternoon of [**2106-7-13**], pt was reported to have a blood bowel movement while working with physical therapy.
On physician exam of the stool, it was brown with some blood streaking and patient had notable hemorrhoid protruding externally on physical exam.
In light of stool appearance with very little total blood, hemorrhoid, and pt report of past bleeding hemorrhoids, this bleed was attributed to hemorrhoidal source.
However, later that evening pt had a large maroon bowel movement in the setting of low grade new tachycardia and mild respiratory distress.
Stat Hct showed drop from 28.7 to 24.5 which was slightly outside the range of lab error and in the setting of this and other clinic changes (HR and RR), pt was transferred to the MICU and IV PPI initiated.
There was concern on a subsequent MICU admission for bleeding given a downtrending H/H.
#) Atrial Fibrillation: Pt had history of atrial fibrillation for which he had been on warfarin.
This was stopped on admission due to need for spinal surgery and relatively low day to day risk of embolic stroke compared to high risk of spinal bleeding on therapeutic anticoagulation.
Also has prosthetic mitral valve but it since it was a tissue valve, it did not need anticoagulation.
Warfarin was held on discharge given multiple comorbidities and relatively low embolic risk.
# Adrenal Insufficiency There was a question of adrenal insufficiency raised while the patient was hypotensive in the MICU.
Zyprexa 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia or agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital-[**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple myeloma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
