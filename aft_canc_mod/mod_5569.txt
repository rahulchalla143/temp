HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old white female who was initially referred for evaluation of microscopic hematuria and right adrenal mass.
Review of outside films did not demonstrate any ureteral or renal abnormality.
However, a magnetic resonance scan was performed which demonstrated a 3.6 x 4.4 irregularly shaped right adrenal mass with T2 hyperintensities.
On further questioning, the patient was found to have proximal palpitations, chest pain and headaches all precipitated by exertion several times per day for the last half year or so.
The patient had also developed night sweats starting [**9-/2111**], and reported a [**11-30**] pound weight loss between [**7-/2111**] and 12/[**2110**].
phenoxybenzamine and nifedipine with partial resolution of her palpitations and headaches.
A 24-hour catecholamine study revealed elevated normetaepinephrine of 493 and elevated combined metanephrine and normetanephrine of 633.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Soft, nondistended, nontender, no CVA tenderness, no palpable mass.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate postoperative complications.
The patient's pain was well controlled with intravenous morphine.
On postoperative day two, the patient had decreased breath sounds on the left chest, and the patient's O2 saturations began to decline.
The patient denied any shortness of breath, but an arterial gas revealed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 49 and a PO2 of 45.
A chest x-ray revealed opacification of her left chest.
The patient's poor oxygenation was felt to be due to a combination of her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and possible atelectasis/pneumonia.
A bronchoscopy performed on [**2112-1-17**] revealed some secretions on the right lower lobe, but the left side was indeed clear.
Chest x-ray showed marked clearing of the left side.
By postoperative day seven, the patient was in no further respiratory distress.
