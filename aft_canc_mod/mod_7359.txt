Likely right pleural effusion.
CT Head [**2-9**]: No evidence of mass lesion.
No acute intracranial process.
Large right pleural effusion which is causing compressive atelectasis of the posterior right upper and right lower lobes.
New moderate left pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis of the posterior left upper lobe and complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Cecal and ascending colonic wall thickening, consistent with colitis.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Right pleural effusion has decreased slightly, now moderate.
Left lower lobe collapse or effusion persists.
Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global hypokinesis and septal dysnchrony (LVEF = 40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.3 cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2-16**] post R thoracentesis FINDINGS: Interval decrease in right pleural effusion following thoracentesis, with residual small to moderate effusion remaining and no evidence of pneumothorax.
Previously noted left pleural effusion is difficult to assess due to exclusion of left costophrenic sulcus from the radiograph, but there is at least a small residual left effusion remaining as well as persistent left retrocardiac opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: #  Respiratory failure: In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt was hypoxic to low 90s on non-rebreather, likely due to septic shock.
Differential diagnosis at first included pneumonia, pulmonary edema from CHF, and ARDS.
CXR showed diffuse haziness bilaterally and  chronic pleural effusion R>L.
He underwent bronchoscopy which showed scant secretions and normal anatomy.
At the time of transfer to the floor, he was continued on ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia even though cultures were negative.
This intolerance should be noted for future reference.
Admission differential diagnosis included meningitis (altered mental status, high fevers), C. diff (pt has h/o C. diff colitis, currently has abdominal pain and high WBC count), and pneumonia.
It could be conceivable that his symptoms were from a viral syndrome or possibly related to his interferon treatment.
Differential included demand ischemia and ACS.
Cardiac cath 3 years ago at [**Hospital1 112**] showed no flow limiting lesions per patient.
He was given 325mg ASA but heparin was not started due to high INR.
#  Change in Mental Status:  Pt has tendency to become delirious during acute illnesses.
His head CT on admission did not show any evidence of mass lesion or acute intracranial process .
#  Idiopathic Myelofibrosis: Pt was continued on hydroxyurea but interferon was held as per Hem Onc recs.
#  Elevated liver enzymes: Likely related to hypoperfusion of the liver; trended down throughout hospital course but have not fully returned to [**Location 213**].
# Bleeding after heparin injection subQ: Pt had subcutaneous [**Location **] oozing after heparin shots.
Pt was given compression dressing and the bleeding stopped.
# FEN: Swallow eval showed that pt has mild to moderate dysphagia.
# Coommunication: With wife [**Name (NI) **] who is HCP.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: septic shock pneumonia pleural effusions   Discharge Condition: fair.
AFVSS   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with very low [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] pressure and difficulty breathing.
We never found the source of your illness, but have treated you for a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia and C diff colitis.
We also drained fluid from your lung (a thoracentesis) which helped your shortness of breath.
If you have fever >100.4, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness or any other concerns then please seek medical attention.
