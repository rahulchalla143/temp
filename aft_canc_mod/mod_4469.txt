Briefly, patient was admitted on [**10-14**] with SOB and DOE and was evaluated for valvuloplasty, however at that time was found to have a clot in the right atrium and procedure was deferred.
He remained anticoagulated and repeat TEE yesterday revealed persistent left atrial appendage clot with smoke.
Became hypotensive during the procedure and was given 2L IV fluids, thought to be multifactorial from poor PO intake, sedation, and afib with RVR.
Today, he underwent planned mitral vavuloplasty uneventfully with improvement in mitral valve area from 1.2 to 3.7 cm2 (gradient decreased from 10 to 2 mmHg); cardiac index was 2.5 L/min/m2; mean PCWP 17 mmHg with LVEDP 9 mmHg.
He currently has no complaints.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

[**12-18**]: CXR Findings concerning for bibasal consolidations worrisome for infectious process.

[**12-20**]: video swallow-final report pending, prelim report showed some aspiration   Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo gentleman with PMH significant for CVA, B-cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic afib on anticoagulation admitted for elective valvuloplasty for mitral stenosis.
Hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and pneumonia.
#: MITRAL STENOSIS: Patient initially presented for valuloplasty several months prior however clot was detected in the atrial appendage therefore he was sent home for further anticoagulation.
He returned this admission and was found to have persistant clot in the atria, however underwent mitral valvuloplasty without complication and was found to have a significantly reduced gradient post-intervention.
He was monitored briefly in the ICU but returned to the floor without needing intubation or pressor support.
Post-valvuloplasty ECHO showed mild rheumatic MS, moderate regurgitation.
Given his persistent atrial clot, his warfarin dose was increased and he will be discharged on this increased dose with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: After valvuloplasty, his rate was poorly controlled with HR in the 100s.
Given his hypotension and poor PO intake, he was inititially managed with fluids with improvement in HR and BP.
Additionally, he was started on metoprolol, which was weaned down from the initial 25 [**Hospital1 **] dosing when pt became bradycardiac with 2 sec pauses on tele.
He may also need titration of BBlocker as an outpatient and should be monitored for symptoms concerning for bradycardia.
Pt was without signs of heart failure.
ECG and cardiac enzymes were drawn at this time out of concern for possible ischemic event that may have caused worsening EF, however were not concerning for acute event.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt developed leukocytosis with bandemia and was found to have RLL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.
He was initially started on vancomycin and cefepime, switched to cefepime alone given low suspicion for MRSA with continued improvement.
# Wt Loss: Pt complained of recent 30 lb weight loss which was concerning for progression of his cancer vs decreased PO intake in the setting of valvular disease and fatigue.
While there was concern for aspiration given his new pneumonia and trivial aspiration on video-assisted swallow, speech and swallow felt that this could be improved with teaching the patient proper swallowing techniques and recommended no dietary changes given his poor nutritional status.
Macrocytic, initally thought to be secondary to poor nutritional status vs progression of malignancy.
Guiac stools were negative, CT abd was checked out of concern for retroperitoneal bleed s/p cath, however no clear source of bleed was found.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be a dilutional component given his fluid hydration while in the hospital.
Given recent wt loss, anemia and thrombocytopenia, pt was scehduled for f/u with his primary oncologist.
#  Skin Lesion: approximately 2 cm pigmented lesions with irregular borders, pt states has gotten larger over time.
Concerning for squamous cell carcinoma, pt is scheduled for outpatient f/u with dermatology.
# Hx seizures: no recent seizure activity.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 5176**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Mitral stenosis, Left atrial appendage clot SECONDARY: atrial fibrillation, pnemonia, b cell lymphoma, anemia, thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for mitral valve disease and were treated with valvuloplasty.
You were also treated for your atrial fibrillation with new medications (metoprolol and digoxin).
You continue to have a blood clot in your left atrium and so your INR should remain between 2.5 and 3 until the clot resolves.
Your hospital course was complicated by a pneumonia which we treated with antibiotics.
During the hospitalization, you were also found to have a low red blood cell count and platelent counts.
You will also need a repeat ECHO in 6 wks as the last echo done during this hospitalization showed that there may have been a decrease in your hearts pumping function.
