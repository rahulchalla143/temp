He presented to PCP today with SOB and orthopnea (needs to sit in a chair to sleep).
Continues to have non-productive cough, anorexia and fatigue.
He also notes increased abdominal distention but regular non-bloody bowel movements and regular urination.
CXR in [**Hospital 3390**] clinic today revealed large right sided effusion.
UA with 100+ protein, no WBCs.
CT torso with contrast showed simple large right pleural effusion with RLL collapse and abdominal free fluid.
Paracentesis not attempted due to poorly identified effusion.
Over ED course, dyspnea increased to 30-40, sats 92% RA and 94% on 2L so admitted to MICU.
In the MICU, patient reports feeling better, breathing is comfortable.
He received Torsemide 40 mg IV 1x and got a had a diagnostic thoracentesis which revealed a transudative effusion.
He was also found to be somewhat hyperkalemia to 5.5 but more torsemide was not given because of concern regarding renal function due to his chronic DM related renal disease as well as recent contrast administration.
Currently, he reports that he feels much better and does not have SOB when sitting or lying down.
He denies any pain but says that this abdomen continues to feel distended.

The extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially decreased.
There is an opacity at the right lung base, likely reflecting reexpansion lung edema.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No change in appearance of the left lung and of the cardiac silhouette.

Mesothelial cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes.

While in the emergency department, patient had respiratory rates in the 30 - 40s and was admitted to ICU for tachypnea.
# RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION: Patient presented to PCP's office for worsening dyspnea, was found to have increased pleural effusion.
CHF exacerbation seems most probable given recently reduced torsemide, abdominal distention with free fluid, simple appearing effusion, and weight gain.
Patient was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime, but the vancomycin was stopped after plerual fluid gram stain showed no microorganisms.
#  ACUTE ON CHRONIC CHF EXACERBATION: Suspected secondary to torsemide being held since recent admission and recent pneumonia.
Likely in setting of recent antibiotics.
# CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Suspected secondary to DM2, creatinine currently at baseline.
Last admission team suspected [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis and potentially HIV encephalopathy.
#  HYPONATREMIA: Mild, suspect hypervolemic secondary to heart failure.
