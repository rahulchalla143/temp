Admission Date:  [**2121-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-12-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-11-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: AMS, hallucinations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 92689**] is a 67 yo male with metastatic colon cancer s/p first and second line chemotherapy now on Erbitux who was admitted on [**2121-12-13**] with mental status changes.
Briefly, per notes, the patient began hallucinating during the days before admission, followed by increased somnolence, incoherence, and lethargy without history of falls.
Labs remarkable for worsening LFTs, hypokalemia, and mild leukocytosis with left shift.
On the floor he became tachypneic and dropped his satts from 98/2L to 88/4L.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint and quickly was placed on RA, but he continued to wax and wane in terms of his mental status.
A CTA showed no large PE (assessment for small PE limited by artifact) and he had negative LE doppler U/S's.
A head CT w/ and w/o contrast was negative for intracranial process.
He does not intelligibly cooperate with further history other than to deny HA, abdominal pain, CP and endorse SOB.
Osteoarthritis s/p bilateral knee replacement .
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in [**2121-5-2**] demonstrated a soft tissue mass at the base of the cecum concerning for malignancy.
The pathology from the resected specimen demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in the liver resection consistent with a colonic primary, and the colon lesion demonstrated a low-grade, moderately differentiated lesion in the sigmoid colon.
Family History: Remarkable for an aunt who had breast cancer in her 70s, a cousin who had breast cancer, the age is unknown; and an uncle who died of some form of leukemia in his 80s.
He has no brothers or sisters but has a daughter who is healthy.
HEENT: Mildly icteric sclerae.
LUNGS: CTA bilaterally anteriorly without w/r/r CV: HRRR, no m/r/g ABD: distended abdomen with midline surgical scar.
mild distension + fluid wave EXT: 2+ pitting edema b/L to knees.
[**2121-12-13**] 4:35 PM CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN: Visualized lung bases demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions, and minor bibasilar atelectasis.
Widespread ill-defined intrahepatic nodules and masses are grossly unchanged when compared to [**2121-10-23**], and remain consistent with metastatic disease.
As before, some of these masses are situated near the liver capsule, and deform the liver surface.
The overall amount of ascites within the abdomen has increased.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Numerous small mesenteric lymph nodes are not significantly changed.
The urinary bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter balloon in place.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Multilevel thoracolumbar degenerative changes are similar, and there is no sign of suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesion.
Unchanged appearance of widespread intrahepatic metastatic disease.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-12-13**] 4:34 PM CT CERVICAL SPINE: There is no fracture, or acute cervical spine malalignment.
There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion.
Mild degenerative change is seen at the atlantodental interface anteriorly and superiorly, likely calcification of the apical dental ligament.
Facet osteophytes result in mild neural foraminal narrowing on the left at C4/5, on the right at C5/6, and also on the left at C5/6.
Broad-based posterior disc bulges at C3/4 and C4/5 result in mild-to-moderate central canal stenosis.
Right paracentral disc bulge at C5/6 without significant canal narrowing.
IMPRESSION: No acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-12-13**] 4:34 PM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or evidence of acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is minimal periventricular white matter hypodensity, most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
There is an elevated hemidiaphragm.
There is some linear opacity at the right base representing mild atelectasis.
There are no pleural effusions.
No acute intrathoracic process.
No evidence for pneumonia.
Mild atelectasis at the right base and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm are unchanged.
Non-diagnostic small Q waves in the inferior leads.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes which are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-26**] anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-12-14**] 6:57 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the previous examination, there are no major relevant changes.
Due to projection, the pre-existing slight elevation of the hemidiaphragms is a little more visible.
No evidence of substantial pleural effusions.
No signs of hyperhydration.
Mild atelectasis at the right lung base.
No opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
No cardiac decompensation, no overhydration, no pneumonia.
There is some interval worsening in the right mid and lower lobe atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
No other interval change.
Interval worsening in atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2121-12-15**] 4:36 PM FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited secondary to severe edema bilaterally.
The SVC in the mid and distal portions on the left were difficult to visualize, though the color flow in these sections appeared normal.
Additionally, the exam was limited given patient discomfort and the right tibials and peroneals on the right were not visualized.
Allowing for these limitations, the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins on both right and left lower extremities demonstrated normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms.
No intraluminal luminal thrombus was identified.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2121-12-15**] 12:34 AM CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism, although assessment of the small segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches is somewhat limited by patient respiratory motion and contrast timing.
There is no acute aortic abnormality.
There are a few small mediastinal lymph nodes not pathologic by CT size criteria.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions and associated dependent consolidation of the lower lobes, right greater than left.
A previously identified subcentimeter right lower lobe pulmonary nodule is not well evaluated as it is present in the region of consolidated lung.
No new nodules are identified.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
No pulmonary embolism.
However, there is poor filling of the segmental branches for the left lower lobe.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation of a portion of the dependent lower lobes, right worse than left.
Large amount of ascites and evidence of significant hepatic metastatic disease.
These findings, including the need for further imaging if high clinical suspicion for PE were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4311**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4312**] at 12:30PM on [**2121-12-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-12-15**] 12:33 AM CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus or infarction.
There is mild periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with mild chronic microvascular infarction.
There is no evidence of abnormal brain parenchymal enhancement or focal mass lesion.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 67-year-old gentleman with metastatic colon CA presenting with AMS .
CXR showed RLL atelectasis.
# AMS - His mental status waxed and waned during his stay.
He had no intracranial disease by CT.  His AMS was likely from hepatic encephalopathy vs infection, though there was little evidence of infection.
He was given antibiotics as above as well as lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 92689**] also showed evidence of seizure activity in the final days of his stay.
Given his poor prognosis and acute decline, his family decided to transition to CMO status.
# ONCOLOGIC - Patient with widely metastatic colon CA s/p failed first and second-line chemotherapy, most recently started on Erbitux.
# ELEVATED LFTs - Likely related to progression of widely metastic colon CA with known involvement of liver.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology seen on Abdominal CT; cholecystitis is on differential and HIDA or U/S more sensitive for cholecystitis, but given comorbidities, patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention.
# osteoarthritis - comfort care as above .
# CODE - CMO  Medications on Admission: 1.
Prochlorperazine Edisylate [Compazine] 10 mg Tablet   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: metastatic colon cancer AMS  Discharge Condition: expired
