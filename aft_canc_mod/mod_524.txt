She also had on the study, a mediastinal mass and a lesion in her liver.
She previously had radiotherapy to a meningioma on the contralateral side.
The patient opted for a primary resection which in view of the MS peripheral edema and mass effect was justified.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2189-4-12**]: There is high T1 signal admixed with punctate areas of low signal within the right parietal operative bed.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
Other than the area of hemorrhage, there are no diffusion abnormalities seen within the brain.
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the left maxillary sinus, and to a moderate degree within the mastoid sinuses, representing an inflammatory process.
No definite pathological enhancement in this locale is seen to suggest residual tumor mass at this time.
The preliminary pathology was glioblastoma but final patholgy is pending at this time.
She was voiding and taking in food without difficulty.
The patient's pain was well controlled.
