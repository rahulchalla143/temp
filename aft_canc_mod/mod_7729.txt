There is suggestion of adjacent mass effect of the white matter tracks suggestive of an underlying mass.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is no evidence of midline shift or uncal or transtentorial herniation.
No acute fractures are identified.
IMPRESSION: Focal area of edema within the left frontal lobe with suggestion of mass effect on the adjacent white matter tracks and an underlying mass lesion is suspected.
No significant midline shift or uncal or transtentorial herniation.
MRI Head [**7-1**]: FINDINGS: There is an extraaxial mass identified arising from the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] measuring approximately 3.7 x 3.2 x 2.7 cm in anterior posterior x transverse x superior inferior dimensions.
Surrounding edema is seen in the left frontal lobe.
Mild mass effect is seen in the right lateral ventricle.
No midline shift identified.
There are no other abnormal areas of enhancement seen.
No focal abnormalities are seen otherwise.
No acute infarcts noted.
IMPRESSION: Left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma with mild frontal lobe edema in the adjacent brain.
No hydrocephalus or midline shift.
The cervical common carotid, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries appear normal, without evidence of stenoses or irregularities.
The distal cervical right internal carotid artery measures 4.8 mm in diameter, and the distal cervical left internal carotid artery measures 5.1 mm in diameter.
There are mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine.
HEAD CTA: The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their major branches, are patent without evidence of stenoses or aneurysms.
There is an extra-axial mass abutting the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**], as described in the preceding MRI, with vasogenic edema in the left frontal lobe and mild rightward shift of the anterior falx and septum pellucidum.
A large branch of the left middle cerebral artery extends to this mass, suggestive of some contribution to its blood supply.
Meningeal blood supply to this mass is not adequately assessed on this study.
No evidence of intracranial arterial stenoses or aneurysms.
Probable left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma with mild vasogenic edema in the left frontal lobe and mild rightward shift of midline structures, as seen on the preceding MRI.
Meningeal blood supply to the mass would be best evaluated by a conventional angiogram, if clinically indicated.
Post-surgical changes of the left frontal lobe.
2-mm rightward shift of midline structures.
MRI Head ([**7-10**])-Post-op: FINDINGS: Patient is status post recent resection of the known left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass lesion representing a meningioma.
Post-surgical changes are noted, in the left frontal and the parietal/temporal regions.
There is also a small to moderate amount of extra-axial fluid collection noted on the left side, maximum transverse dimension of 1.3cm.
Small amount of subdural fluid is also noted on the right side in the frontal and temporal regions.
There is moderate amount of vasogenic edema at the site of the resection, with mild shift of the midline structures to the right side measuring approximately 6 mm.
There is also mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
On the post-contrast images, there is minimal enhancement of the adjacent meninges and in the soft tissues.
Thus, assessment for residual tumor is somewhat limited.
No new areas of abnormal enhancement are noted in the remaining brain parenchyma otherwise.
There is evidence of restricted diffusion in the periphery of the surgical bed and t is unclear if this relates to blood products, edema or infarction.
Status post resection of the known left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass lesion representing meningioma, with post-surgical changes in the form of extra-axial fluid collection, moderate-sized on the left side as well as blood products within the surgical resection cavity and in the adjacent soft tissues.
Minimal to mild enhancement noted in the adjacent meninges and in the soft tissues.
Moderate vasogenic edema in the surgical resection cavity along with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and shift of the midline structures to the right side by 6 mm, not significantly changed compared to the pre-op planning study.
blood products, edema or infarction- close f/u MR for better assessment.
Left skull base tumor (D-J): Meningioma (WHO Grade I); see note.
Note:   There are focal areas of hypercellularity and high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, but no other atypical features are seen.
White Petrolatum-Mineral Oil 42.5-56.8 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for irritation.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-16**] days for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
