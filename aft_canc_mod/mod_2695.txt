She originally developed symptoms in [**2143-10-25**] and presented to [**Hospital3 2568**] for a sense of movement in her vision, nausea, and gait instability.
She had an LP which showd lymphocytic meningitis and she was treated for TB meningitis.
Two weeks later she returned with progressive symptoms, and had respiratory failure due to a paraneoplasitc syndrome, as she had a positive anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody titer.
On [**2144-1-25**] she was admitteed to [**Hospital1 18**] neuro service for inability to wean from the vent.
She had a workup which revealed a single enlarged subcarinal lymph node, which was removed by VATS revealing a poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
She was transferred to the MICU for chemotherapy for presumed small cell carcinoma of the lung, and got one cycle of carboplatin/taxol.
In the interval, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia and received a 14 day course of Zosyn, then amikacin and ceftaz.
Past Medical History: - Adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features, presumed SCLC - Paraneoplastic disease as above with cranial neuropathy and respiratory failure, trach and ventilator dependent since [**10-27**] - HTN and bilateral renal artery stenosis - heel and decubitus pressure ulcers - hypercholesterolemia - PVD - Hyponatremia/SIADH - Depression - Iron deficiency anemia - B12 deficiency - DVT left leg, [**11/2143**], on coumadin - PEG tube on chronic tubefeeds - perivascular white matter changes on MRI consistent with small vessel disease.
- adenexal cyct seen on CT at OSH, not further explored surgically  Social History: currently at [**Hospital6 58717**], had been living independently previously.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o CHF, PNA HISTORY: 76 y/o with endocrine cancer and respiratory failure.
Evaluate for CHF or pneumonia.
There has been also resolution of the previously seen left pleural effusion and reexpansion of the left lower lobe.
The previously seen bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.
There is a suggestion of a 3.1 cm cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe which shows some wall thickening.fungal or bacterial infectious processes are to be considered as possibilities .
Since the prior study there has been clearing of bilateral pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
No evidence of pneumothoraces.
Low lung volumes are also noted bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Interval clearing of bilateral pulmonary congestion and the majority of the right upper lobe infiltration.
CT is recommended for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Bilateral low lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76 year old woman with neuroendocrine tumor and paraneoplastic syndrome of muscle failure presents for chemotherapy.
Paraneoplatic syndrome with anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] at 1:640 dilution (at [**Hospital3 **]).
The patient has respiratory muscle weakness, but was ruled out for NMJ dysfunction with EMG studies.
It is hoped that this syndrome may improve on chemotherapy once underlying disease is treated, but as it's secondary to demyelination chances are that it will not.
It was noted that she had a persistent alkalosis, but blood gasses were not checked.
Has h/o PNA and her CXR shows possible residual caitation, but this was felt to not be a containdication to chemo per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].
4. h/o DVT left leg, 11/[**2143**].
HTN / renal artery stenosis.
Hyponatremia/SIADH - She was hyponatremic on admission.
Depression - prozac was continued.
Iron deficiency anemia - iron was continued.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features, presumed SCLC, s/p cycle 2 of carboplatin/taxol Secondary: - Paraneoplastic disease as above with cranial neuropathy and respiratory failure, trach and ventilator dependent since [**10-27**]  - HTN - heel and decubitus pressure ulcers - Hyponatremia/SIADH - Depression - Iron deficiency anemia - DVT left leg, [**11/2143**], on coumadin - PEG tube on chronic tubefeeds   Discharge Condition: patient stable and ventilated, and had no complaints.
