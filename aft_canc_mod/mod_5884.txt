During course there was also concern of pericholecystic fluid/acute cholecystitis and he has been followed by surgery.

<B> RADIOLOGY </b>  [**2180-7-14**] 12:20 AM # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96898**]   CHEST (PA & LAT) Somewhat limited examination secondary to low lung volumes.
No definite superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2180-7-13**] 5:01 PM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96899**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST No acute intracranial process.
Heterogenous liver attenuation in addition to striking portal adenopathy may indicate an acute hepatitis.
Mildly distended gallbladder, wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid.
However, in the setting of no significant right upper quadrant symptoms and no elevated white blood cell count, this seems unlikely to be consistent wtih acute cholecystitis.
Mild gallbladder wall edema, which is nonspecific in the setting of trace ascites.
Extensive periportal lymphadenopathy.
Stigmata of portal hypertension including recanalized paraumbilical vein and anterior abdominal wall varices.
No focal pancreatic or liver lesions identified.
Echogenic liver which is suggestive of fatty infiltration; however, liver fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be entirely excluded.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
Unchanged echogenic and heterogeneous liver parenchyma, without a focal mass seen.
[**2180-8-9**] Renal U/S IMPRESSION: Normal renal son[**Name (NI) **] without hydronephrosis.
[**2180-8-8**] EGD 2 cords of grade  1 varices at the lower third of the esophagus Erythema in the stomach body and antrum compatible with gastritis Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**2180-8-16**] Colonoscopy Polyps in the sigmoid colon and ascending colon Diverticulosis of the whole colon Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids Unable to evaluate the cecum and valve because loop formation and patient's uncomfort and pain.
Mild heterogeneity in the liver echotexture, possibly slightly decreased from previous examination.
No focal lesion detected.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation or gallstones.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) ACUTE ON CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE: Most likely acute alcoholic hepatitis given known history of alcohol abuse, AST/ALT > 2, and negative hepatitis viral serologies (negative viral load in the case of Hep C).
His presentation was initially concerning for an obstructive lesion given the new perihepatic LAD on abdominal CT, but his AP was normal and a RUQ U/S showed no obstruction.
He had no additional risk factors for aquisition of other hepatitis viruses (no recent unprotected sex or IVDU).
His presentation was also concerning for hepatic vein/IVC thrombosis, but a liver U/S with doppler was negative for clot.
His hepatitis serologies indicated previous exposure but no active infection (HBsAg neg, HBsAb pos, HBcAb pos, HBV DNA undetect, HCV RNA undetect, anti-HAV neg).
He had a liver MRI that showed no focal lesions, but fatty infiltration, periportal LAD, and signs of portal HTN.
He continued to complain of vague RUQ pain, so an U/S was repeated, with no changes noted.
Furthermore, his LFTs have trended down and stabilized; his AST remained only slightly elevated at discharge, although his TBili was very high.
He had elevated INRs (max 2.6, decreased to 2.0) which were treated w/ PO vitamin K.  Outpatient liver clinic appointment scheduled to follow liver disease and consider transplant.
2) ENCEPHALOPATHY: Patient was encephalopathic when admitted, with an elevated ammonia level.
He was treated with lactulose 30-45cc QID, but his dose was later decreased to 30cc TID due to exacerbation of hemorrhoids and pain and blood with bowel movements.
Overall his mental status has improved and he has been AAOx3, but with some residual confusion.
Also, his gait is still slightly unsteady and he continues to have asterixis on exam.
3) ANEMIA: The patient had macrocytic anemia on admission (Hct=27.7) and his hematocrit continued to slowly decrease during his stay.
Blood smear showed occasional schistocytes and 2+ target cells.
Given his history and labs, he was thought to have anemia from chronic liver disease and possible bone marrow suppression due to alcohol use.
[**Month (only) 116**] have also been due to hemorrhoidal bleeding.
He had no s/sx of transfusion reaction and his Hct was 25.3 at discharge.
4) FEVER: The patient spiked a fever to 101.9 on [**7-14**] and was subsequently worked up for infection.
CXR was negative for pneumonia x2, urine analysis and cultures were negative, and blood cultures were negative.
Initial abdominal ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis and showed trace ascites (<1cc), although he did have ascites later on, and received two ultrasound-guided paracenteses, negative for SBP.
His fevers resolved and he had been afebrile from [**2180-7-19**] to [**7-29**], when he started spiking fevers again.
On [**8-3**], he spiked a fever up to 104.5 with hypotension to 80s and tachycardia to 110s.
5) HYPONATREMIA: Patient had low-normal serum sodium at baseline, decreased to 131/132 at times during his stay.
He appeared euvolemic with no evidence of third-spacing of fluid on exam.
It is possile that these low-normal levels are secondary to cirrhosis and intravascular volume depletion, leading to increased fluid retention.
Adrenal insufficiency is also possible, but less likely given his stable blood pressure.
6) ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient had no signs of alcohol withdrawal during his hospital stay.
7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient had a creatinine spike to 2.6 from his baseline of around 0.8.
8) SEIZURE HISTORY: Patient has an unclear history of seizures, in setting of EtOH withdrawal vs. head trauma vs. childhood issue.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] House  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Alcoholic Hepatitis  Secondary: Alcohol Abuse History of hepatitis C infection Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental status has improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a diagnosis of acute on chronic liver failure and encephalopathy (changes in your mental status) due to the liver failure.
