600cc ascites fluid was negative for SBP, and patient was prophylaxed on Rifaxamin.
He progressively regained mental status and respiratory status and after remaining afebrile he came back to the floor on HD# 19 with no antibiotic coverage.
# Respiratory Distress: Ddx included PE (pt has not been on SQ hep [**1-28**] coagulopathy from liver dz), aspiration (tube feeds), increasing abdominal distention leading to atelectasis and poor inspiration, fluid overload, hepatopulm syndrome.
CTA was not done as suspicion was low for PE due to adequeate oxygenation.

Recent melanotic episodes, EGD done [**7-19**] with fundic varices but no active bleed.
No further episodes of GI bleeding were noted.

initially had some symptoms of encephalopathy on the floor.
Rifaxamin for SBP prophylaxis.

coags were stable on D/C -Pt requires MRI of Liver to determine if there is a mass suspicious for [**Company 191**].
likely to require Biopsy if MRI shows liver lesion suspicious for [**Company 191**].
