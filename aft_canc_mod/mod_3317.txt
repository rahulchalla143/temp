Distal small bowel obstruction.
Innumerable enlarged lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen and pelvis, compatible with known diagnosis of CLL.
Diffuse anasarca.
RUQ U/S ([**2176-7-24**]): Limited evaluation of gallbladder due to multiple air containing stones as viewed on CT causing diffuse posterior shadowing.
No definite evidence of air within the wall itself.
Gallbladder scan ([**2176-7-25**]): The above findings are consistent with severe liver dysfunction without evidence of common bile duct obstruction.
MRCP ([**2176-7-26**]): Intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts appear unremarkable.
There is no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Gastric wall thickening and hyperenhancement likely representing post-operative changes and possible ongoing ulcer disease.
Pleural effusion and moderate ascites.

Thickened folds of the gastric body and limited gastric distensibility.
Nonocclusive thrombus present within the right basilic vein.
Followup study may be performed is there is clinical concern for venous occlusion.
Malignant lymphoma involving ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes.
Organizing peritoneal hemorrhage.
Diffuse pseudomembrane colitis, extending to both margins.
Hemorrhage and fibrotic serosa and mesocolic fat.
Mild pseudomembranous colitis, extending to the margins.
Fibrosis and hemorrhage of serosa and mesocolic fat.
Unremarkable small intestinal mucosa.
Hemorrhage and fibrosis of peritoneum.
No intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or abnormal enhancement.
Mucosal thickening in multiple paranasal sinuses with features as described above.
Bilateral airspace consolidation with moderate pleural effusion and atelectasis, suggestive of ARDS.
Massive mediastinal, hilar, axillary, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy due to chronic leukemia.
Two loculated fluid collections versus abscesses, one at the left flank and one anterior to the rectum, which may be communicating.
Edema in the peritoneal fat and small amount of ascites.
An NGT was placed with immediate bilious output and symptomatic relief.
He was not a candidate for ERCP given his recently laparotomies x 2 and perforated ulcer repair.
HIDA and MRCP were performed without evidence for CBD obstruction.
He underwent CT torso which demonstrated pancolitis, ARDS, and large L pleural effusion.
As his WBC rose to 57 and he had new-onset diarrhea, it was felt to be indicative of fulminant C.diff colitis.
