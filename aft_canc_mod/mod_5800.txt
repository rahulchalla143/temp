He felt dyspneic with associated R-sided low, anterior chest pain.
Pt also describes feeling fatigued with subjective fevers.
Pt received approx 1.0 L NS with resolution of SBP to 100s-120s in ED, continued to receive approx 2 more liters.
CTA not done as pt PE felt low prob, IVC filter in place.
F/u CT [**8-30**] demonstrated 3.3-cm right inferior hilar mass with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, mild subcarinal and suprahilar lymphadenopathy.

MIBI [**2-28**] IMPRESSION: Moderate septal and apical fixed defects.
Stress [**2-28**]: 3 min on [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] stopped for dyspnea IMPRESSION: Uninterpretable EKG in the absence of anginal symptoms.
Cxr:IMPRESSION: Extensive right lower lobe consolidation.
Likely small right pleural effusion as well.
[**2-28**] spirometry FVC FEV1 fEV/fvc 2.63 1.65 63 72% 75% 104% Impression: Mild restrictive ventilatory defect.
Right infrahilar mass encasing the bronchus intermedius and the right inner lobar pulmonary artery as seen on prior examination.
There is worsening loculated pleural effusion on the right with worsening right lower lobe and right middle lobe airspace disease which may be secondary to post-obstructive pneumonitis; however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Unchanged interstitial opacities and bronchovascular bundle thickening involving the lingula and right middle lobe which may also represent an infectious or inflammatory process; however, lymphangitic spread cannot be excluded.
Right pleural effusion has nearly resolved following placement of a pleural catheter.
Only a small residual effusion remains, with a small hydropneumothorax component.
Post-obstructive pneumonia in right lower lobe, with additional areas of infectious consolidation involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left.
Possible component of necrotizing pneumonia as described.
Extensive mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy with neoplastic encasement/obstruction of airways and encasement of interlobar right pulmonary artery.
Indeterminate left adrenal gland lesion without change since [**2138-1-20**] torso CT. .
Interventional pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter to drain the pleural effusion on the right side.
Mr. [**Known lastname 70691**] has post-obstructive pneumonia that was treated with Levofloxacin.
The CT showed resolution of the right pleural effusion.
However, the patient responded clinically to the Levofloxacin and the Staph Aureus may be a colonizer or a contaminant.
He may continue to have low oxygen needs.
Urinary retention.
He was noted to have large prostate on imaging though not on treatment for BPH (and prostate not enlarged by DRE).
Given history of NSCLC, some concern for cauda equina or spinal cord compression, however, complete neuro exam (including rectal tone) w/in normal limits.
A voiding trial failed and a foley catheter was placed.
If the voiding trial should fail, pt will need to have an indwelling foley and should have an outpatient referral to urology.
[**Known lastname **]: He was tachycardic to the 120's on admission in setting of fever and witholding of betablocker.
Patient understands the severity of his illness and the graveness of the recent developments.
