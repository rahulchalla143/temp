The mass is contiguous with left hilar lymphadenopathy, and is most consistent with bronchogenic carcinoma in this patient with extensive emphysema.
2) Inflammatory changes distal to the mass with small airways disease in the adjacent left upper lobe, likely post obstructive inflammatory/infectious in etiology.
3) Spiculated 11-mm diameter right lower lobe lung nodule with morphology raising the concern for a synchronous primary lung cancer.
Differential diagnosis includes a metastatic focus as well as an inflammatory etiology.
4) Nonspecific bilateral bronchial wall thickening and scattered central lobular opacities, most likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
5) Mild tracheomalacia.
6) Evidence of prior granulomatous infection.
Chest X-ray [**2168-1-6**]: Large left-sided hilar lung mass, COPD, but no acute pneumonic infiltrates.
UE US bilateral [**2168-1-7**]: No DVT of either upper extremity.
CT torso [**2168-1-8**]: 1) Compared to the prior study of 3 days ago, there has been interval development of numerous focal densities with irregular margins, at least one with questionable area of cavitation, consistent with septic emboli or an atypical infection.
2) Stable appearance of a large lobulated irregular left upper lobe mass with obstruction of the apical posterior segment of the left upper lobe bronchus.
Echo [**2168-1-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Coronary arteries without angiographic evidence of disease.
Moderate to severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of the lower half to [**2-12**]'s of the LV with a dyskinetic septum.
3.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle with a severe decrease of RV function.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is  not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2168-1-8**], there ae new wall motion abnormalities seen with a significant decrease in LV and RV function.
Renal US [**2167-1-26**]: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Repeat CT showed LUL mass obstructing LUL bronchus; mass contiguous with LUL LAD.
Also showed post-obstructive inflammation, spiculated mass 11 mm RLL, ?
evidence of prior granulomatous disease.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2168-1-5**] and bronchial washings/brushings came back suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
On HD #3 the patient spiked fever of 101.4 with an associated leukocytosis to 36.6.
On repeat chest CT [**1-7**] there were new multiple pulmonary opacities.
There was a concern that the new opacities on chest CT could represent septic emboli.
Metastatic spread was also unlikely given very rapid progression over days.
New opacities were likely to represent new pneumonia with focal consolidations.
The next day she developed tachypnea on the floor with RR of 36, became diaphoretic and exam was consistent with CHF exacerbation.
The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
CXR showed known masses and signs of CHF.
EKG revealed 3-4mm ST elevations in V3-4 with q waves in same leads, new compared to [**2167-1-3**] EKG.
The patient was taken to the cath lab because of concern for ischemic heart disease: EF 28%, mild non-obstructing CAD, severe LV/RV dysfunction (?
New cardiomyopathy was diagnosed as [**Last Name (un) **]-tsubo apical ballooning syndrome based on ventriculography images.
Repeat TTE on [**2167-1-23**] showed no significant change or recovery of ventricular function from prior echocardiogram.
The patient subsequently completed 10 days of Vancomycin and 14 days of Zosyn for Pseudomonas pneumonia.
She was also treated for COPD with high dose IV steroid taper and standing alb/Atrovent MDIs and fluticasone.
However, she failed extubation and had to be re-intubated in 24 hrs for increased RR/WOB and copious secretions.
She was restarted on high dose steroids due to marked wheezing on lung exam.
Sputum was sent for culture and grew Pseudomonas that was now resistant to Zosyn.
ID service recommended Imipenem and Cefepime for double coverage although the organism was only intermediately sensitive to Cefepime.
Extensive discussions were held with the patient (when sedation was decreased) and the family regarding prognosis and further treatment options including need for tracheostomy.
Atrial fibrillation.
She was on heparin drip but developed significant hematuria requiring transfusion.
Renal US on [**1-26**] did not show hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Heparin drip had to be discontinued and hematuria started to clear.
