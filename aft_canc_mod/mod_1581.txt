Admission Date:  [**2176-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-9-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tylenol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**] Chief Complaint: Diffuse Body pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 87 y/o female with a h/o AD and spinal stenosis who presented to the ED with diffuse body pain.
She sustained a fall in [**3-26**] which results in vertebral fractures and since that time she has been mobile only from chair to chair.
She has complained of chronic back pain for quite some time.
Over the past two days, her family noticed that she was complaining of more pain over several areas of her body.
In addition, her abdomen was becoming more distended and she was complaining of abdominal discomfort.
ED course: She presented to the ED with diffuse body pain.
Initially, there was concern for worsening back pain and she was admitted to the medical floor.
However, the results of her laboratory testing returned and she was found to have acute renal failure.
She was also found to be hyperkalemic and was given kayexalate, D50, insulin, and calcium given concern for peaked T waves seen on EKG.
She was also given 1 amp of sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis [**2-23**] to ARF.
A renal U/S revealed moderate to severe B/L hydronephrosis.
A subsequent CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple abdominal lesions along with ascites concerning for metastatic disease.
KUB was without evidence of obstruction.
Given her ARF and metabolic acidosis, she was admitted to the MICU for possible urgent HD vs. urgent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement with IR.
No CP or SOB.
No urinary symptoms.
Positive for abdominal distention and diffuse body pain.
Past Medical History: AD Spinal stenosis Chronic low back pain Osteoporosis Gastric ulcers s/p partial gastrectomy s/p C-section x 2 Compression fractures   Social History: Married with two children and lives with husband.
Family History: non-contrib  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.8 HR 81 BP 137/71 RR 22 99%RA General: Frail 87 y/o female in mild distress [**2-23**] to pain.
Ext: 1+ pitting edema B/L.
Neuro: Unable to provide history or follow commands.
Moves all 4 extremities without difficulty.
[**2176-9-21**] Renal U/S In the setting of moderate-to-severe bilateral hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal or pelvic mass is a concern and CT of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended.
Moderate ascites.
Incompletely characterized right hepatic lesion could also be further evaluated with CT. .
[**2176-9-21**] Abdomen/Pelvis CT Multiple abdominal omental and mesenteric masses with a large volume of ascites, likely peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Omental masses would be amenable to percutaneous biopsy.
Bilateral left greater than right hydronephrosis and hydroureter tracking down into pelvis without clear visualization of the point of obstruction.
Suggestion of mucosal thickening and irregularity of the gastric fundus, though evaluation extremely limited.
L1 compression deformity of unknown chronicity.
[**2176-9-21**] KUB No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Degenerative changes in the spine and SI joints, with possible compression at L1.
[**2176-9-21**] CXR No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2176-9-21**] EKG NSR at 70 with occasional APCs.
No acute ST changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 y/o female with a h/o AD and spinal stenosis who presented to the ED with body pain and was found to be in acute renal failure [**2-23**] to B/L hydronephrosis from multiple abdominal lesions, as well as likely metastatic disease.
# Acute renal failure/B/L hydronephrosis with metastatic appearing lesions, poor prognosis.
# Code - DNR/DNI, discussed in full with pt's family, including pt's husband who is the health care proxy .
# Dispo - c/o to floor.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] husband [**Name (NI) 382**] and sons present for discussion.
The pt's CT scan strongly suggests metastatic cancer.
However, the appearance on the CT scan is highly suggestive of a metastatic cancer process.
