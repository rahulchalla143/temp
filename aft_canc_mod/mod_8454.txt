HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male, status post unrelated donor renal transplant in [**2105**] for nephropathy of unclear etiology.
He developed papillary thyroid cancer in [**2114**].
He underwent workup of this weight loss and was found to have an EBV- driven posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder with Hodgkin-like features.
He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2118-10-4**] after being hospitalized from [**9-19**] through [**9-30**] with fatigue, and low platelets, and increased LFTs.
In the 24 hours prior to surgical consultation he developed a syncopal episodes.
A CT scan demonstrated free air in his abdomen.
He underwent an exploratory laparotomy, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch repair of a duodenal perforation with irrigation.
It was noted that the patient had PTLD, progressive, with lytic bone lesions and splenic lesions of unclear etiology.
He had a staph coag-negative bacteremia.
An ultrasound of his right upper quadrant was done; and this demonstrated a right pleural effusion and ascites, sludge within the gallbladder, and no evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
__________ to assess for sources of coag-negative staph.
The left atrium was mildly dilated, and EF was greater than 55%.
He had 1+ aortic regurgitation.
There was trivial mitral regurgitation, and no mitral valve prolapse.
He continued to have large amounts of drainage and weeping from generalized edema.
This demonstrated a subcapsular wedge-shaped lesion of the transplanted kidney with concern for infarct.
Air was seen within the collecting system of the transplanted kidney; likely secondary to reflux of air from bladder.
There was interval decrease in the amount of ascites within the abdomen and pelvis with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain positioned behind the left lobe of the liver.
There were small pockets of persistent air within the abdomen and pelvis.
Wedge-shaped splenic lesions consistent with splenic infarct were noted; not significantly changed from previous study.
There was partially visualized right middle lobe with small infiltrate as well as an irregular area of high attentuation collection within the pelvis behind the bladder; likely representing nonopacified segments of bowel.
Given persistent rise in LFTs, worsening jaundice and cachexia, and persistent generalized pain, and malnutrition his prognosis was very poor.
Of note, he grew out VRE from blood on [**2118-10-12**].
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient's wife was instructed to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] office or Dr.[**Name (NI) 6001**] office for further orders or any concerns for uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Include posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease; Hodgkin's-like cancer; status post duodenal perforation on [**2118-10-4**]; malnutrition; chronic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy; status post living unrelated renal transplant in [**2105**]; chronic pain.
