Admission Date:  [**2131-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-5-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma    Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Biopsy of Anterior chest wall mass Thoracentesis PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: 77 yo F w/ ho CVA 2 [**Last Name (un) **], afib on coumadin, DM2, CAD, COPD who was sent to the ED for a persistently elevated INR off of coumadin for 5 days which was preventing bx of a L knee soft tissue mass.
The pt reports the mass growing over the past 5 months which has progressed to the point that she cannot walk.
An MRI done was notable for an enhancing mass in the suprapatellar pouch.
She also note a growing chest wall mass that has increased in size over the last 3 weeks.

Large anterior chest wall mass encasing the manubrium with evidence of manubrial erosion.
Small left paraaortic lymph nodes.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Findings consistent with metastatic disease or lymphoma .
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic infarctions in the left middle cerebral artery territory distribution .
[**2131-9-26**]: Chest wall mass, fine needle aspiration: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Interval increase in size and number of bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
Enlarged left periaortic lymph nodes.
Atrophic kidneys with mild prominence of the collecting systems bilaterally.
The fullness of the collecting systems may be secondary to marked bladder distention.
Possible soft tissue density mass within the left renal pelvis, however, this is not clearly delineated on this non-contrast examination.
Further evaluation with ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Multiple ill-defined low density lesions within the posterior subcutaneous tissues of the back and buttock which may represent lymphomatous masses.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2131-10-24**]: Pleural Fluid: Non-specific reactive T cell dominant profile; no phenotypic evidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in specimen .
New patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation within the left lower lobe, concerning for acute infection.
New moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Interval decreased size of anterior chest wall mass, mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy, and multiple pulmonary nodules.
High attenuation soft tissue thickening of the inferior aspect of the posterior right diaphragm and upper abdominal wall/peritoneal fascia.
Given the rapid appearance since [**2131-9-25**], most likely consideration is retroperitoneal hemorrhage, perhaps tracking from a lower source.
Has there been any recent intervention on the right side to explain these findings?
#Diffuse Large Bcell Lymphoma - On admission, coumadin was held and the patient was placed on lovenox.
Abd/Pelvic CT showed pulm nodules increased in size from [**9-25**] and multiple SC masses in back and buttocks.
The biopsy returned consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
She became transiently neutropenic after the chemotherapy but this resolved with neupogen.
Repeat CT torso was notable for decrease in tumor burden.
On the day of transfer on [**2131-10-1**], she had increased tachypnea and shortness of breath.
She had bibasilar crackles on exam but her CXR was not consistent with failure.
A TTE was done notable for normal EF, mild pulmonary systolic hypertension, and [**1-28**]+AR.
A chest CT and CXR were not notable for pneumonia but notalb for bilateral effusions and evidence of volume overload.
On [**10-23**], she was sent to the MICU for respiratory distress and hypercarbia.
Neurology was consulted for concern of neuromuscular weakness contributing to her hypercarbia as she also had proximal weakness on exam.
Neurology did not feel that she has an inherent NM disorder such as Myasthenia but that her LE weakness should be further evaluated for a spinal process.
She had a CT neck notable for tracheomalacia but a stent was felt unnecessary as it would only provide minimal palliative symptom benefit and the patient was a poor surgical candidate.
She remained tachpneic and hypoxic.
She also had increasing LFTs and an abdominal US notable for sludge.
She became afebrile on these medications but she continued to have a leukocytosis.
Repeat US was notable for cholelithiasis but negative for cholecystitis.
On [**10-11**], she remained afebrile but developed increasing wbc count and diarrhea so stool studies were sent which were negative.
She again developed low grade temps.
After her thoracentesis on [**10-25**], a follow up CT scan was notable for ground glass opacities and an infiltrate.
She remained afebrile on these medications.
## elevated alk phos - The patient noted RUQ pain around [**2132-9-30**].
At that time she also developed increasing LFTs including alkaline phosphatase.
Abd US on [**10-3**] di not note duct dilatation or stones but she was started on cefepime/clindamycin for concern of cholecystitis.
She continued to have abdominal pain and elevated LFTs.
A repeat US on [**10-10**] was notable for cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis.
Over the next week her abdominal pain improved and her LFTs except alk phos normalized.
On [**10-26**] she had a recurrence of abdominal pain so surgery was consulted and a HIDA scan was ordered.
She continued to require pain medication for her abdominal pain.
There was concern that she was bleeding from her thoracentesis site vs developing an RP bleed so lovenox was stopped.
Her hematocrit stablized and she remained off of anticoagulation except for ppx w/ subcutaneous heparin.
