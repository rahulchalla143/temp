Along the anterior margins of the suture chains in the anterior mediastinum, there is a new heterogeneous and necrotic mass measuring 3.6 cm x 3.6 cm.
The mass directly abuts the aortic arch, and lies immediately inferior to the confluence of the left internal jugular and left subclavian veins.
Though there is a loss of fat plane, no frank invasion of the adjacent vascular structures is identified.
Moderate centrilobular emphysema is noted.
There is no pleural effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries and aortic arch are noted.
A small hypodensity in the left lobe of the thyroid likely reflects a tiny nodule.
The esophagus is fluid filled and patulous, with a large hiatal hernia noted.
Small calcified gallstones are noted.
The common bile duct is mildly dilated diffusely, without evidence for a distal obstructing lesion, measuring up to 10 mm.
There is severe colonic diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
There is no free air or free fluid.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes by CT size criteria are identified.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is in bladder, with air within the bladder likely related to instrumentation.
There is no pelvic free fluid or adenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
There are multilevel degenerative changes, with a dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
3.5-cm necrotic mass along the suture margins of a left upper lobectomy, concerning for local recurrence.
Mildly dilated common bile duct, without evidence for distal obstructing lesion.
Severe colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Large hiatal hernia with a fluid-filled esophagus, placing the patient at risk for aspiration.
At the most inferior aspect of the temporal lobe, there is persistent nodular-shaped rim enhancement (17:8 and 6:18).
The amount of right hemispheric edema is unchanged.
Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and effacement of the right hemispheric sulci are unchanged.
There is no uncal herniation.
Expected pneumocephalus overlies the right frontal lobe.
There is no diffusion restriction to indicate an acute infarct.
Curvilinear enhancement of the medial surgical bed, and persistent enhancement of the inferior right temporal lobe.
Unchanged right hemispheric edema, mass effect in the right lateral ventricle, 7 mm leftward shift of midline structures and effacement of the right cerebral sulci.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 81M presented electively for right cranitomy for mass resection.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1108**] Rehab Unit at [**Hospital6 1109**] - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: RIGHT TEMPORAL MASS   Discharge Condition: NEUROLOGICALLY STABLE   Discharge Instructions: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS WOUND CARE: ??????
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**9-11**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
