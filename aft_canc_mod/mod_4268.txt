No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Mild sinus disease.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Extensive multilevel degenerative changes.
No concerning lesions to suggest pathologic fracture.
Severe osteoathritis with large loose bodies, including one superior to the patella.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2136-12-20**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
One of the screws is not attached to the fixation plate and should be correlated with its desirable position, most likely is supporting fracture line.
No acute fracture is seen.
There are degenerative changes particularly at the MTP joints with normal alignment.
ECHO Study Date [**2136-12-25**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric hypertrophy.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
No obvious causes of dysphagia noted by EGD Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Sigmoidoscopy: Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids (biopsy) Stool in the colon.
Await biopsy reports.
Recommend manometry if the symptoms of incontinence do not resolve with treatment of hemorrhoids.
She was prepped and brought to the operating room for a left femur ORIF.
She tolerated the procedure well without any complication.
On POD#1, she was transfused 1u PRBC for postoperative anemia.
Her course was complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR resulting in flash pulmonary edema.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient went into atrial fibrillation post-operatively and once when she missed one of her doses of metoprolol.
She does not have a history of atrial fibrillation.
# Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute, now resolved: Patient had pulmonary volume overload after IVFs.
ECHO was suboptimal but did not show systolic dysfunction.
She likely has diastolic dysfunction given her age and history of hypertension.
# Left femur fracture, s/p ORIF:  She is working with PT.
This was felt to be secondary to volume depletion and resolved with additional fluids.
This was likely related to volume overload/post op atelactasis.
She also had a flexible sigmoidoscopy for fecal incontinence prior to her surgery.
She can have meds crushed with applesauce and thickened liquids.
She can eat ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
White Petrolatum-Mineral Oil 42.5-56.8 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic QID (4 times a day) as needed for dry eyes.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Eagle [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Center - [**Location 23723**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Left distal femur fracture Postoperative anemia  Secondary Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation with RVR Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient's pain was controlled.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a fracture of your left femur.
If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, severe nausea, vomiting, new redness, increased swelling, pain, drainage, have a temperature >101, or have any symptoms that you are concerned about, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room for evaluation.
