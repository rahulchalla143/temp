History of Present Illness: 59F with multiple medical problems including ESRD s/p failed renal transplant on PD currently, severe AS/moderate MS, GI sarcoma s/p surgery/radiotherapy in [**2111**], HTN, and CAD s/p NSTEMI.
Who was admitted from the vascular clinic with a new open area on her right foot noted to be draining "dark fluid" with increased confusion since [**2126-6-22**].
Patient had been complaining of right foot/right great toe pain since [**2125-5-25**] and was previously seen by vascular surgery in [**2126-3-26**] with decreased pulses on the right foot.
At that time arterial duplex noted patent bilateral femoropopliteal vessels, SFA stenosis on the left, greater than 50%, poor visualization of the tibial arteries bilaterally and likely bilateral iliac disease.
Since that time she has had continued pain in her right foot, with severe pain even at rest, but does not know if she has ever had claudication or prior ulcers.
She denied any fever or chills but had some nausea and had one episode of emesis today.

# Hypotension: SBPs in 60s-70s in a woman with a history of hypertension which was previously difficult to control.
Patient had leukocytosis to >20 and underwent an infectious workup which was unrevealing.
She underwent ECHO cardiogram which showed aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation.
Shock was attributed to a cardiac cause, after discussion with cardiology it was determined that ECHO severely underestimated aortic regurgitation which appears to be wide open with essentially laminar flow across the valve.
TTE showed severe AS with severe aortic regurgitation.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that her hypotension was secondary to cardiogenic shock from wide open MR.  Cardiac cath revealed a cardiac index of .58, 80% circ lesion.
Leukocytosis: Patient admitted with leukocytosis to 13 which trended up to 20.
She was afebrile without clear sign of infeciton.
CXR was clear, RUQ u/s was negative for acalculous cholecystitis.
Calcific aortic stenosis: Patient with a history of severe aortic stenosis.
She was unable to compensate for the combination of aortic stenosis and worsening aortic regurgitation.
Right lower extremity Dry Gangene: She was initially admitted to vascular surgery for angioplasty.
She was ultimately transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension.
Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hyponatremia.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out.
Ansiocoria: History of right eye blindness in setting of right retinal artery occlusion however no documented history of ansiocoria.
Head CT did not show any acute intracranial process.
- daily HCTs - transfuse to 25 given CAD .
Renal Mass: History of mass in renal kidney which is concerning for malignancy.
Decubitus Ulcer: Patient with large decubitus ulcer related to inactivity.
# FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds # Prophylaxis: SQH # Access: peripherals, right PICC # Communication: patient - Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17171**]) - Son [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17172**]) .
Cardiac surgery was consulted regarding her asymtomatic AS but it was decided that her symptoms were note severe enouugh and she was too high risk for open heart surgery.
She was therefore pre-opped and consented for her vascular sugery and on [**2126-6-27**] was taken for an abdominal aortogram, a lower extrem angio and an angioplasty of both the right anterior and posterior tibial arteries.
After her angio she continued to have poor blood flow to her Right lower extremity.
The procedure went forward with no complications.
During awakening preceding extubation she did not return to baseline mental functioning and only intermittently responded to commands.
Because of her poor baseline pulmonary and cardiac function she got an echo of her heart which revealed her baseline cardiac function.
There was no interval change in her CXR either.
An EKG showed no change.
She was kept intubated because of her poor respiratory drive.
Overnight between [**7-3**] to [**7-4**] she became hypotensive into the 70s and 80s, failed to respond to fluid boluses times 3, and finally responded to a bolus of albumin.
Unfortunately she developed a decline in her respiratory status, and her hypotension returned, at this point she was transferred to the CVICU again for persistent hypotension.
She was transfused a single unit of PRBC for hypotension and anemia.
She was weaned off the neo on [**7-4**] [**2125**] though she continued to have low BPs.
She became hypotensive without any endorgan symptoms.
Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.
She had persistent fevers and remained pressor dependent.
Cultures were sent and a course of antibiotics tailored for a pseudomonas pneumonia.
Beta-blocker was not initiated due to persistent hypotension.
Intermittent colloid administered for intravascular contraction.
By the time of discharge on POD **** the sternal wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
GI was consulted for a dropping Hematocrit and melana.
Hematocrit was stable at the time of discharge with no further melana.
She was afebrile at the time of discharge and WBC was decreasing on Bactim.
The vascular surgery team had evaluated her right BKA and did not believe it to be the source of the elevated WBC.
