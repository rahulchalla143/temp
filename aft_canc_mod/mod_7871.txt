History of Present Illness: 73yo Female with Myeloproliferative disease, ANCA associated vasculitis, PMR on long standing steroids, and diverticulosis who presents with 2 days of malaise, severe frontal HA, fever, chills, and nausea.
In ED received pt was SaO2 >95% on RA, no respiratory distress.
Given Vanc and Levo on floor for possible PNA as well as stress dose steroids for PMR.
Approx 11pm the previous night the pt developed SSCP, initially attributed by pt to "heartburn".
On morning of transfer, however complained of increased shortness of breath and CP, sinus tachy, SaO2 to 90% -> 80 -> 50% -> 30%.
Pt bagged, but remained tachypneic, tachycardic and complained of "impending doom".
In unit, repeat CXR showed development of new b/l infiltrates.
In addition, pt subsequently developed elevated  TnT 0.24 at last draw.
ECG sinus tach without any ischemic changes.
Myeloproliferative disease - ET -> myelofibrosis 2.
LGIB - diverticulosis 4.
HTN 5.

PERRL, op w/o obvious lesions.
no m/r/g diffuse rhonchi with expiratory wheezes soft, NT, ND, BS+, no HS megaly no c/c/e,  echymosis on arm r>L, oozing skin lesion of L thigh.
Marked pulmonary septal thickening and bronchovascular bundle thickening.
Sarcoidosis can also have this radiographic appearance, but is considered less likely.
No evidence of diverticulitis.
Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect .
CXR: Extensive b/l air space consolidation .
Respiratory Failure:     CXR on admission to MICU ([**10-14**]) c/w acute pulmonary edema felt to be related to ischemia (also c/w edema on on CT -septal thickening) vs. diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, although hct stable, no blood from ett.
Pt with multiple risk factors for CAD and was under acute stress.
Troponins rose with ST depressions in V3-6.
She was not r/o for PE given renal failure.
She was diuresed and improved quickly on the vent with decreased oxygen requirements.
She was changed to pressure support and then extubated on [**10-15**] without complication.
Given the elevated troponins and depressed ST she was started on heparin, asa, and beta blocker.
Echo on [**10-15**] demonstrated no wall hypokinesis, and mild AR/TR/MR.
Cath demonstrated mild diastolic dysfunction and totally occluded D1.
Pt at risk for infection due to your chronic immunosupression.
She became afebrile and remained so for the rest of the admission.
Vanc stopped on [**10-16**] and pt remained afebrile on levoflox.
5) Skin Tears - Due to chronic steroid use, the pt has developed skin tears.
