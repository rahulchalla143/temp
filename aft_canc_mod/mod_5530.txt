Patient was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in [**2128**], and was found to have metastatic disease in [**Month (only) **] of [**2131**].
[**Name2 (NI) **] last brain imaging here was done in [**2132-3-24**] and showed significant interval decrease in size of the enhancing metastatic lesion within the right frontal lobe, as well as diminished associated vasogenic edema.
Per husband, at approximately 2pm on [**8-23**] she began to complain of severe bitemporal HA and nausea and vomiting.
We were contact[**Name (NI) **] by them stating that they wished to transfer her here because a head CT showed "hemorrhagic conversion of a prior known met."
Past Medical History: -- breast CA, see above -- diet controlled DM -- HTN -- COPD (asthma and bronchitis) -- s/p hysterectomy in [**2124**] for menorrhagia -- h/o lithotripsy for kidney stone in [**2112**]  Social History: -- accompanied by husband -- two daughters in college -- She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.
Family History: Her mother had coronary artery disease and lung problems.
[**Name (NI) **] father died of esophageal cancer.
A first cousin has breast cancer.
Physical Exam: VS: Afeb BP 102/67 HR 90 RR17 100% RA  GENERAL: LUNGS: CTAB, no wheezing/rhonchi/rales, no crackles CV: RRR, no murmurs/gallops/rubs, no JVD ABD: + BS, soft, non-distended, non-tender, no HSM EXTREMITIES: no erythema, WWP  NEUROLOGICAL: (EXAM DONE ON PROPOFOL with possibility of lingering vecuronium) Intubated and Sedated.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above along with a small focus of possible parenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal parasagittal location.
6 x 4 mm lobulated aneurysm, at the confluence of the anterior communicating artery and the A2 segments of anterior cerebral arteries, posisbly ruptured given the extent of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Subcm focal lucent lesion in the right frontal bone- correlate with bone scan.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Findings compatible with right frontal lobe infarction, possibly due to right ACA A1 segment vasospasm as evidenced by diminutive caliber on CTA.
Anterior communicating aneurysm clip in place with limited evaluation of residual patency.
Interval decrease in amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage with residual blood product in the inferior left frontal region.
Punctate left frontal hyperdensity may represent a treated metastatic lesion.
Additional intracerebral metastases are better demonstrated on prior MRI from [**2131-10-25**].
There is no definite vasospasm.
Intra-arterial slow hand infusion of 5 mg of verapamil in each of the left internal carotid artery, right internal carotid artery and left vertebral artery.
No evidence of new intracranial arterial stenosis to suggest vasospasm.
No new territorial infarction.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Expected evolution of the paramedian right frontal lobar infarct which now shows minimal volume loss.
She underwent coiling of the aneurysm x 2, she recevied an intravenous fluid bolus of 500 cc for a systolic blood pressure in the 80's.
Her urine output was also borderline oliguric with an average hourly output of 30cc/hr.
She had RUE weakness both before and after angio.
On [**8-25**] she continued to remain in the ICU for vasospasm watch.
On [**8-26**] she was noted to continue to have low systolic blood pressures in the 90's.
She complained of headaches in the afternoon ad was started on firoicet.
She did not require the firoicet overnight on [**8-27**] into [**8-28**] and stated that her headaches were imrpoved.
In the afternoon of [**8-28**] she had a moderate headache for which Fioricet was given and provided relief of symptoms.
She remained stable in the ICU over the weekend of [**8-30**] and [**8-31**] with no issues.
On [**9-1**] she was noted to be bradycardic and hypotensive, pacers were put on standby and she received a CTA/P instead of a cerebral angiogram.
The CTA/P was stable and however it showed a right frontal hypodensity which was old and seen on [**8-24**].
She complained of back pain which had worsened but no images were obtained.
Her nimodopine was held for the bradycardia and her EEG continued to show frontal slowing.
On [**9-3**] her exam remained stable in the morning and she underwent a cerebral angiogram which showed no definitive spasm but verapamil was given.
She had an MRI of the Brain and L/S spine on the afternoon of [**9-3**] which showed a small left frontal infarct and a L5-S1 herniated disc abutting the descending S1 nerve root.
In dicussions in EEG conference it was noted that one of her coils might be compression the anterior cerebral arterys.
On [**9-6**] she was noted to have tachycardia while on levophed and as a result it was stopped.
the tachycardia soon resolved and her blood presure management agents were changed.
A CXR was obtained which showed that she had pulmonary vascular overload and her IV fluids were stopped.
She was started on Cipro and a foley catheter was replaced for a UTI on [**9-15**] after it was noted that she was continuously having Post void residuals in excess of 400 CCs.
Medications on Admission: unknown  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Subarachnoid aneurysm from ruptured aneurysm SVT Left thalamic infarct left subacute centrum semiovale infarct Urinary retention Urinary Tract Infection cerebral vasopsasm   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort.
