The patient who was originally being evaluated for abdominal pain underwent a CT abdomen for diverticulitis which showed a possible lesion of the left lower pole of the anterior kidney.
An MRI confirmed enhancement of a 2cm mass, consistent with renal cell carcinoma, and the patient underwent a laproscopic left partial nephrectomy on [**7-16**].
Following the surgery, the patient was hypoxic and hypotensive, and was found to have SBP in the 60's-80's.
D-dimer was checked and he underwent a CTA to rule out PE which was negative, and showed only bibasilar atelectasis.
The patient was started on Neosynephrine gtt for hypotension and also received lasix 20mg IV for hyperkalemia.
He complained of abdominal pain and nausea, and had a leukocytosis of 18.5 and he was given Reglan 10mg IV push.
He underwent a CT abdomen/pelvis which showed left retroperitoneal hematoma from the site of left nephrectomy extending superiorly into perisplenic region and inferiorly into left pelvis.
On [**7-17**], the patient underwent IR for embolization (particle and coil embolization of the left kidney and TLC) of the lower pole left renal artery.
He was subsequently edematous and complained of dyspnea and was intubated [**7-18**].

Pertinent Results: [**2111-7-19**] 01:00PM   CK(CPK)-1051* [**2111-7-19**] 01:00PM   CK-MB-18* MB INDX-1.7 cTropnT-0.32* [**2111-7-19**] 11:41AM   LACTATE-13.4* K+-5  CT: prelim The patient had approximately 95 cc of visipaque contrast infiltration in his left hand.
Bibasal consolidations, likely atelectasis with small pleural effusions.
S/P Partial nephrectomy with a 9.1 x 5.7 x 6.6 cm hematoma in the perinephric space, without significant compression of the left renal vessels.
No bowel obstruction/ secondary signs of ischemic bowel.
Ill-defined hypodense lesion in the left hepatic lobe, is not well assessed in this study.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo M with diverticulitis, HTN, Dyslipidemia, PVD who was found to have a left renal mass and who initially presented for left partial nephrectomy being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for hypoxia and acute renal failure.
He continued to deteriorate clinically including rising lactic acidosis to 13 and became increasingly difficult to oxgenate.
Concern was for septic shock though no clear source was located.
General surgery saw and did not feel that there was an acute abdominal process based on CT and exam that would benefit from surgical intervention.
He was started on CRRT given his rising lactate.
Shortly thereafter, he became bradycardic and hypotensive to the 60's and briefly lost his pulse.
