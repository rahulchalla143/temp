Prior to this event, patient had been doing well since his discharge from the hospital on [**2115-5-16**], and had afebrile, mentating well, eating well, ambulating and moving bowels without difficulty.

Physical Exam: On admission:  v/s: T 98.2  HR 96  BP 90/50  RR 18  SP02 94% room air Gen: pleasant middle-aged male, sickly appearing, no acute distress Neuro: Patient awake and alert to person and place, though is disoriented to time.
Patient is able to recall the President of the United States CV: atrial fibrillation, normal S1 and S2, no murmur Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abdomen: soft, distended, non-tender.
[**2115-6-6**] Abd CT: 1) Progression of right and left intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No evidence of an abscess.
5) No enhancing liver lesions.
6) Decreased size of low attenuation splenic lesion, suggestive of evolution of infarct.
7) Stable anterior abdominal wall hernia containing loops of small bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
Pull back cholangiogram demonstrating obstructed left hepatic duct, with a patent right hepatic duct, and a patent anastomosis.
Bleeding from the right tube insertions site, possibly from the  intercostal artery, controlled by manual compression.
Left hepatic duct stented with 8 mm x 18 mm Protege.
[**2115-6-10**] Chest Xray:  Interval appearance of a moderate sized right pleural effusion, the definite nature (simple or complex) of which cannot be determined on this study.
Improved aeration at the left lung base, however, increased atelectatic  changes at the right lung base.
Partial bilateral lower lobes atelectasis unchanged.
MICROBIOLOGY:  [**2115-6-4**] Bile: VRE+, Gram negative rods, rare yeast; [**6-4**] blood: non-fermenter (sensitive to Meropenum), [**6-8**] blood: negative  PATHOLOGY:  HEparin dependent antibodies: Negative  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old gentleman with a history of cholangiocarcinoma complicated by a common bile duct obstruction who presented on [**6-4**] with fevers and reported blood output from his right biliary catheter and bilious leaking around the drains.
On admission he presented with fevers, mental status changes, and a low hematocrit.
He had a prolonged hospital course as detailed:  With regards to his underlying biliary disease the patient underwent cholangiogram with successful upsizing from a 10-French right percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tube to a 12-French drain on hospital day 2.
On hospital day 7 the patient underwent internalization of his PTC drains via interventional radiology but had a post-procedure chest x-ray that revealed a right-sided pleural effusion and dropping hematocrit.
It was thought that he had a hemothorax from injury to an intercostal blood vessel during the procedure and he received 2 prompt units of blood with stable subsequent hematocrit levels on serial checks.
He had a slight rise in LFTs and total bilirubin after drain internalization but these trended downwards towards his baseline levels by day of discharge.
From a neurologic standpoint the patient's mental status had improved after commencement of antibiotics and blood transfusion upon admission as well as IV fluids to correct pre-renal acute renal failure.
From a cardiovascular standpoint he remained in normal sinus rhythm and stable on his home amiodarone regimen with intermittant episodes of atrial fibrillation.
From a pulmonary standpoint, as stated above, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a pneumothorax requiring diuresis.
He continued to have mild congestive heart failure throughout his hospital course requiring intermittant diuresis and he was discharged on home oxygen therapy, which he had been taking in the past, as well as a standing regimen of [**Hospital1 **] Lasix.
There were no episodes of respiratory failure or distress during his hospitalization.
He also had a low platelet count and hematocrit and required several transfusions of blood and platelets after hemothorax that occured during his PTC internalization on hospital day 7.
He was found to be heparin-dependent antibody negative and the etiology was presumed to be secondary to Linezolid.
From an immunology standpoint he was started on empiric levofloxacin and linezolid while pan-cultures were pending; coverage was eventually taylored to include approximately 2 weeks Linezolid and Meropenum when admission culture data revealed meropenum-sensitive non-fermenting gram negative bacteria and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from his blood and bile.
Repeat pan-cultures several days after antibiotics started were negative and he remained afebrile for the remaining duration of his hospital course.
From a GI standpoint nutrition services were consulted for starting the patient on nutritional supplements and [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes was consulted with recommendation for re-starting the patient on home insulin therapy, which he had been taking in the past.
From a renal standpoint the patient had an elevated creatinine as well as hyponatremia on admission.
He received several days of hypertonic saline IV fluids with improvement in his hyponatremia and bolused IV fluids with resolution in his acute renal failure.
You should return to the ED or notify your physician with any worsening fevers, abdominal pain, worsening jaundice, worsening swelling of your legs, worsening nausea/vomitting.
