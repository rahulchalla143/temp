With this episode, she was hypertensive to the 200s, which resolved without intervention.
CT of the chest showed no evidence of pneumothorax, but did show hemorrhage around biopsy site, and new bilateral pleural effusions.
On evaluation in the radiology suite, she complained of shortness of breath and sleepiness while denying chest pain, headache, or palpitation.

Extensive ST segment depressions most prominent in the inferolateral leads which may be due to myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-3-17**] the rate is markedly faster and inferolateral ST segment changes are more prominent.
QTc interval is also shorter in the setting of a rapid heart rate.

The patient developed hemoptysis and the post- procedure CT scan demonstrated possible aspiration.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2189-5-29**] 3:49 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-19**] through [**5-28**]: Heavy asbestos-related pleural calcification obscures larger areas of both lungs.
Bilateral pleural effusion and/or pleural scarring is unchanged.
Moderate-sized hiatus hernia is longstanding.
Brief Hospital Course: Aspiration Pneumonitis: Patient had a witnessed aspiration event during the IR lung bx.
CXR was consistent with aspiration pneumonitis, as was CT scan.
Imaging also showed hemorrhage around bx site.
Afib/flutter: Pt w/o history of known afib/flutter.
There was evidence of hemorrhage around bx site, with per IR is normally seen after biopsy.
Lung Mass: Previous biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenoCA.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: adenocarcinoma of the lung  secondary: hypertension, atrial fibrillation, anemia   Discharge Condition: Good and stable.
The procedure was complicated by blood loss and hemoptysis (coughing up blood).
During this period, your blood pressure was elevated at times as high as 190s.
You heart also exhibited an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial flutter/fibrillation.
