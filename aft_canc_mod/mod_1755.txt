Subsequently, on surveillance imaging, the patient's left medial temporal lesion was shown to have expanded significantly in size.
Associated with this radiographic progression were symptoms of intermittent aphasia as well as progressive headache.
Her paternal grandfather had brain cancer (?type) and died at the age of 60.
Her maternal grandfather had renal cell cancer.

The satellite lesions along the superior aspect of the mass are either increased in size or more conspicuous due to technique.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2125-8-31**]): Expected postoperative changes with small amount of blood within surgical resection cavity and along left cerebral hemisphere.
Persistent mass effect and 5-6 mm rightward subfalcine herniation.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] w/ and w/o contrast ([**2125-9-1**]): Postoperative changes are seen in the left temporal region with blood products and air in the surgical cavity.
Residual enhancement is seen at the posterior-superior part of the surgical cavity.
Surrounding edema is identified and mild midline shift is seen.
Interval increase in rightward shift of midline structures by  approximately 2 mm.
Slight interval increase in layering left subdural hemorrhage.
CT Head [**2125-9-3**]: In comparison with the prior examination, again there is evidence of pneumoencephalus and similar pattern of hemorrhage with edema producing effacement of the left ambient cistern.
There is evidence of persistent effacement of the sulci in th left convexity.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, and the configuration of the ventricles appears similar in comparison with the prior study.
In comparison with the prior study, there is evidence of persistent midline shifting, measuring approximately 7 mm towards the right, which is slightly smaller in comparison with the prior study.
Low- attenuation areas are again demonstrated as well as hemorrhagic foci adjacent to the left ambient cistern apparently unchanged since the prior study and suggesting edema and ischemic changes, please correlate clinically.
Persistent fluid collection and left subdural hematoma, apparently unchanged since the prior examination.
There is minimal residual pneumocephalus, soft tissue swelling, and edema in the surgical bed.
The focus of hemorrhage in the left ambient cistern is unchanged.
There is stable mass effect in the left cerebral hemisphere with sulcal effacement, partial compression of the lateral and third ventricles, and approximately 5 mm of midline shift.
There is no evidence for new hemorrhage, acute infarction, or increasing mass e ffect.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain clear.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change or new acute intracranial process.
Post-surgical changes from left-sided craniotomy and temporal lobe mass resection are stable, as is the focus of cisternal hemorrhage and the extent of left cerebral mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2125-8-31**] for elective resection of her temporal mass by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Her pain was well controlled initially with IV, and then PO pain medication.
Despite her excellent clinical course, post-operative MRI revealed swelling of the tumor resection site -- causing a right-[**Hospital1 **] midline shift.
She was also maintained on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
She was ambulating, voiding, and taking in food without difficulty.
She did have some cognitive deficits however, so that is why she will be going home with 24-hour supervision.
