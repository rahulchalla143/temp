On tracings from EMS, appears that patient is intermittently paced which is wide complex and this may have been mistaken for VT.
[**Hospital **]hospital EKG also concerning for inferior STEMI, but on my review, this appears only on paced beats with ST elevations in II and III and ST depressions in I. .
He was placed on dopamine gtt with persistent hypotension and levophed was added.
CT head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia.
Cardiology was consulted from the ED; they did not feel that his presentation was consistent with acute STEMI.
ECHO performed at the bedside showed preserved EF (> 55%) with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is not sedated but is intubated and unresponsive to voice and painful.
On further questioning, the patient's wife notes that the patient has had a cough productive of sputum for the past few months; he has been treated intermittently with antibiotics for this.
She reports no recent fevers at home.
The patient did not have any other particular complaints in the past few days.

NECK: R ej iv in place, jvd not easy to appreciate given habitus  CV: RRR, no appreciable murmur but difficult to hear given coarse breath sounds.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

# PEA arrest: Circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear.
From family history, the patient falls asleep frequently during the day, likely secondary to chronic hypercarbia in the setting of not using CPAP and exacerbated by patient multiple narcotic pain medications.
It was felt likely that additional narcotics may have  depressed his already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA arrest.
Other possibilities for PEA arrest, including MI, electrolyte abnormalities, PE, hypothermia were felt to be unlikely after further investigation.
The patient also had a brief period of atrial flutter on telemetry that resolved spontaneously during his MICU stay.
He was instructed regarding the importance of wearing his CPAP machine as instructed, and the risks of a recurrent episode of PEA arrest should he not do so.
# Respiratory failure:  The primary precipitant remains unknown, though the patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per wife due to sputum production).
Sputum on [**12-20**] grew Coag + Staph aureus and the patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for and 8 day course.
The patient's oxygen requirement improved and he did not spike any additional fevers while on antibiotics or after they were stopped.
He may have had an anoxic brain injury as a result of his arrest.
The patient continued to improve during his hospitalization, but memory remained sluggish at discharge, thoug hpt clearly understood his surroundings, his indication for hospitalization, treatment recommendations and instructions for follow-up.
It was recommended that if his memory difficulties persist that he see a behavioral neurologist as an outpatient.
No additional neurologic deficits were noted.
# Diabetes mellitus: The patient had a FSBS in the 300s on arrival to the ICU.
# Chronic pain: On presentation all of the patient's chronic pain medications were stopped due to altered mental status.
The patient was noted to be very somnolent on this regimen which included frequent prn oxycodone.
On discharge he was advised to use a lower dose of oxycontin (10mg po tid) at home to prevent sedation and further respiratory difficulties.
# CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI.
Troponin slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from hypotension.
These enzyme elevations resolved quickly and pt was restarted on his statin.
# h/o BPH - pt on ditropan and urecholine on admission.
his ditropan was held [**2-8**] concerns that anticholinergic effects could have contributed to his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# psych - pt continued on effexor.
# h/o CAD - pt continued on aspirin, metoprolol, ACE, and statin.
# h/o AVR x 2 - pt not on coumadin, as discussed in his last cardiologist note [**2177-12-2**].
He was on a heparin pump at some point, but this was complicated by heparin induced osteoporosis as well as infection.
# disposition - home VNA was set up, but would not be able to start services until Friday, [**2178-1-2**] given the holiday.
Given his lack of acute medical issues (IV medication requirement, cardiopulmonary monitoring) this was felt reasonable.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-8**]  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure 3.
Pneumonia 4.
Acute renal failure  Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Coronary artery disease 3.
Hypertension 4.
Tracheobroncheomalacia with tracheal stent 5.
Chronic pain 6.
Obstructive sleep apnea 7.
Hypercholesterolemia 8.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had stopped breathing and your heart had stopped.
On admission you were also found to have a pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics.
To prevent a recurrence of this episode and improve your alertness, we strongly recommend that you wear your BiPAP/CPAP at night and that you decrease the amount of oxycontin that you take.
You are having some difficulties with memory that should continue to improve gradually over the next few weeks.
Please see a behavioral neurologist if you are still having memory difficulties after this time.
You still had a cough on discharge, likely left over from your resolving pneumonia.
Please follow-up with a behavioral neurologist if you continue to have memory difficulties.
