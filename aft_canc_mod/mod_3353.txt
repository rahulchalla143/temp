Admission Date:  [**2171-7-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-8-16**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**] Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is an 84F with a suspicious RUL nodule who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
Picc line placement  Flexible bronchoscopy and right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection serial bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet Picc line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is an 84F with a suspicious dominant right upper lobe mass, which is just over 3cm.
The smaller smooth bordered nodules in the left lower lobe were indeterminate, but bear further watching on followup CT scanning.
Her pulmonary function test today does show some degree of impairment of her lung function consistent with her emphysema.
She appears to have some likelihood of respiratory failure or worsening oxygen requirement following this operation.
COPD 3.
Hypothyroidism 4.
GERD 5. s/p hip replacements '[**34**], '[**35**], '[**54**], '[**55**] 6. s/p CCY 7. throat cancer s/p local radiation '[**61**]  Social History: A 35-pack-year ex-smoker, discontinued in [**2154**].
GENERAL:  Well-nourished, well-developed elderly woman in no apparent distress.
NECK:  The neck incision is clean, dry, and intact and healing well without fluctuance, purulence, or erythema.
LUNGS:  Distant breath sounds with some coarse left lower lung field and right upper lung field rales.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ON DISCHARGE [**2171-8-16**] Gen: no acute distress CV: RRR, no murmurs Pulm: distant coars breath sounds in the R lung fields, clear breath sounds in the L lung fields Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended  Pertinent Results: PICC XRAY [**2171-8-14**] Uncomplicated ultrasound of fluoroscopically-guided single lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.
CXR [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old woman s/p RUL lobectomy, now s/p bronchoscopy and PEG, repeat bronchoscopy for right lung collapse done.
There is complete white-out of the right hemithorax consistent with total collapse of the remaining right lung.
Patient has known loculated right pleural effusion.
There has been interval increase in shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the right side, otherwise no changes in interstitial opacities in the left lung due to pulmonary edema.
L10 (G-H): Lymph node(s) with non-necrotizing granulomas; no malignancy identified.
L12 (I): One lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomas; no malignancy identified.
L11 (J): Lymph node(s); no malignancy identified.
Right upper lobe (K-Q): No malignancy identified.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main bronchus).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted and taken to the OR on [**2171-7-19**] for Flexible bronchoscopy and right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy, right upper lobectomy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection complicated by an avulsion injury to the posterior recurrent branch of the pulmonary artery which was repaired.
The pt's initial post operative course was complicated by ongoing respiratory compromise requiring re-intubation x2, BIPAP support and pulmonary tiolet via almost daily bronchoscopies for pulmonary tiolet.
She had intermittant confusion and occasionally refused interventions.
Since this surgery, pt has had a complete white out of her right lung which has required daily bronchoscopies and aggressive pulmonary toilet with little to no improvement on CXR.
On [**2171-8-15**] she received a R US-guided chest tap by interventional pulmonology which yielded no fluid.
