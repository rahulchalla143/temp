ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7860**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis and hypertension who had been in a generally reasonable functional state prior to presentation.
He presented on [**11-8**] with repeat episodes of bright red blood per rectum and some abdominal pain for which he was admitted to the Medical Service.
At the time of his admission, he had not had any notable fevers, no trauma to the abdomen and no hematemesis.
He wasn't in any distress on admission.
He had a mild amount of tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant, but otherwise no rebound or guarding.
His EKG showed T- wave inversion in Lead III which was new.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service and started on antibiotics which included levofloxacin and Flagyl for his bandemia and underwent a CT scan which showed some nonspecific circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon.
He therefore underwent his sigmoidoscopy with a variable colonoscope on [**2161-11-13**].
This was a limited exam of the left colon due to lack of bowel preparation but blood was noted in the colon with significant diverticulosis.
Postoperatively, the patient continued to have significant abdominal pain and on further workup, was found to have free air in the peritoneum and therefore there was concern for colonic perforation.
As the patient's clinical status deteriorated, the Surgical Service was consulted and a decision was made to take the patient to the Operating Room given the fact that he had evidence of peritonitis with free air under the diaphragm indicating likely colonic perforation with gross spillage of stool.
There was concern that he had had myocardial infarction, but given the fact that his septic state would not improve without surgery after consultation with General Surgery, Colorectal Surgery and Gastroenterology, it was decided that the patient should be taken to the Operating Room.
There was no evidence of a tumor.
This was subsequently sent for pathology and showed evidence of colitis, but no other malignancy.
His pain was controlled with a variety of narcotics.
There were no other issues.
In terms of his respiratory status, the patient developed pulmonary edema postoperatively secondary to large fluid requirements and some cardiac insufficiency.
These were complicated by pleural effusions and what appeared to be an ARDS picture.
In terms of his cardiovascular issues, after his initial myocardial infarction, the patient continued to have a mild troponin leak.
During the course of the patient's hospitalization, he began to experience repeated episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
These never did progress to a sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
Unfortunately, secondary to the patient's poor nutritional status and his gross infection, his wound dehisced on postoperative day 8 at which time he was subsequently taken back to the Operating Room and re- explored and repaired.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, but there wasn't any evidence of cholecystitis or bile duct obstruction and it was felt to be secondary to his septic state and cholestasis.
Renally, the patient continued to progressively develop acute renal insufficiency with rising creatinine which at the time of his death was twice his baseline.
Hematologically, the patient did have an anemia secondary to a combination of blood loss, malnutrition and volume.
He also had thrombocytopenia which stabilized.
There was no evidence of heparin-induced antibodies.The patient's most critical issues included his Infectious Disease issues.
His peritoneal fluid grew out gram- negative rods which included E. coli and were consistent with feculent material.
Given this poor prognostic sign, a meeting took place with the family to determine the patient's overall status and goals for treatment.
It was felt at this time, given his respiratory failure, his septic state, his adrenal insufficiency, his renal failure and his Candidemia, that the patient should be made a Do Not Resuscitate, but the family wanted to continue all aggressive medical care which the ICU team agreed to.
Given his failure to improve and grim prognosis, it was decided by the family to make the patient Comfort Measures Only which was done on [**2161-12-6**].
The patient expired at [**2186**] hours on [**2161-12-6**] with the final cause of death being respiratory arrest.
