Admission Date:  [**2175-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-7-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement (right IJ)   History of Present Illness: 72 year-old female with past medical hx of Lung CA s/p lobectomy, CHF, presented from OSH w/resp distress.
* In our ED, she received lasix 60 IV x1 with minimal response, placed on propofol, and had a CT of her abdomen due to a distended abdomen.
Lung CA s/p lobectomy 2.
Asthma 4.
Liver hemangioma 6.
Anemia 7.
COPD 8.
Hyperlipidemia 9.
Hypothyroidism 10.
Gastritis 11.
Depression 12.
HTN   Social History: married, lives with husband/son, 35 pack yrs, no etoh   Pertinent Results: CT abdomen: Large mass replacing most of the right lobe of the liver and a second smaller hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver that are incompletely characterized on this noncontrast study.
Fat-containing right-sided abdominal wall hernia.
Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar lung opacities with possible interlobular septal thickening consistent with CHF/fluid overload.
A second smaller hemangioma is seen within the medial segment of the left lobe, measuring 2.3 x 2.5 x 3.1 cm.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Lower anterior abdominal wall fat-containing hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: Active problems on admssion included 1)hypercarbic respiratory failure, 2)oliguric acute renal failure, 3)large liver mass seen on the abdominal CT, 4)intermittent supraventricular tachycardia, 5)Hypotension.
CXR on admission showed bilateral retrocardiac opacity and later showed RUL opacity.
She was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for empiric coverage.
She was initially given Lasix 100 mg IV for a concern for CHF from pulmonary edema seen on CXR but was later thought unlikely since her CVP was only 10.
She was also started on steroids for COPD exacerbation.
In the ICU, there was difficulty extubating secondary to her agitated MS, but was successfully extubated on [**2175-7-5**].
In terms of ARF, she presented with Cr of 2.3-2.8 and became oliguric and peaked at 3.5.
Renal was consulted whose impression was oligurid renal failure->ATN from hypoperfusion +[**Last Name (un) **].
In terms of 22 cm liver mass seen on the abdominal CT, liver team was consulted.
She has a hx of liver hemangioma and this is likely the expansion of the hemangioma.
The family and the team decided to not pursue with any surgical procedure.
She had episodes of SVT to 140's with hypotension to SBP 80's on [**2175-6-29**] of what appears as AVNRT.
In terms of hypotension, she had intermittent episodes of hypotension which appears to be positional, likely from the liver compressing on IVC?.
This in addition to the systemic illness may have worsened her renal failure on admission.
Or she may have had episodes of AVNRT with hypotension prior to admission to have caused the renal insult.
1)Respiratory failure: Patient likely had MRSA PNA +/- COPD exacerbation.
Pt got Albuterol/fluticasone and a very short course of steroid taper for the possible COPD exacerbation.
2)Renal failure: Pt had ischemic ATN in the ICU from presumed hypoperfusion episode.
She also developed hypernatremia which was corrected with IV D5W to correct the free water deficit.
She also develop metabolic acidosis and was supplemented by sodium bicarb.
Her delirium was thought likely from toxic metabolic etiology secondary to combination of hypothyroid, ICU delirium, steroid use, hypernatremia, and acute infection.
She was initially kept NPO due to aspiration risk from mental status change.
She passed swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate po diet with normal consistency and thin liquids.
4)Hypertension: She was continued on po metorprol and Hydralazine for BP control.
5)Tacchycardia: Pt had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, likely AVNRT, in the ICU which was controlled with Diltiazem then was switched to metoprolol.
On the floor, she again had an episode of SVT for 1 hr which was finally broke with IV Diltiazem.
She had a very slow decline in Hct and got a total of 4 units of PRBC during the hospitalization (2 units in the ICU, 2 units on the floor).
If she continues to have a decline in Hct despite increased Epogen dose, she would need an outpatient EGD + colonoscopy to rule out GI bleed.
7)Liver mass: Pt with known history of giant liver hemangioma that was has followed as outpatient.
The CT and MRI of abdomen again demonstrated giant mass that appears as hemangioma.
Please seek medical attention if you develop fever, chills, chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, cough, confusion, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms.
