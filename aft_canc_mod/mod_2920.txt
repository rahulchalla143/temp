Admission Date:  [**2106-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-4-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2026-7-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD Colonoscopy Capsule endoscopy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79 year old male with a history of PE, COPD, Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diastolic dysfunction and hypothyroidism presenting with bright red blood per rectum.
The patient was in his usual state of health until approximately three weeks ago when he developed sudden onset dyspnea and was hospitalized with pneumonia.
He was subsequently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 61516**] with a pulmonary embolism and was treated with Lovenox and transitioned to Coumadin.
On the day prior to admission, he developed acute onset abdominal cramping and asked to use the commode.
According to the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab records, the patient had a large grossly bloody bowel movement (approx 1 Liter).
He was feeling otherwise well, aside from continued dyspnea on exertion, and denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, headaches, change in diet, dysuria, fevers or chills.
He reports that his abdominal pain subsided to intermittent "rumblings," and his review of systems was otherwise negative.
He denies a history of blood per rectum before.
He had another soft, marroon stool while in the ED.
He also developed some worsened shortness of breath during his ED course and was treated with 20 mg IV lasix.
Past Medical History: COPD Atrial fibrillation (one brief episode recently, started on digoxin) HTN BPH Hypothyroidism s/p partial thyroidectomy CAD (per records, no h/o MI or cardiac cath) h/o Klebsiella, MRSA, Pseudomonas infections h/o VRE UTI .
Used to only use oxygen at night, now requiring approximately 4 liters after recent PE and pneumonia.

Portable chest xray ([**2106-3-19**]): Patchy opacity projecting over the right mid and lower hemithorax progressed since prior examination.
Differential for this finding includes early aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, with asymmetric alveolar pulmonary edema felt less likely.
Chest CT [**2106-3-26**]: FINDINGS: Superimposed upon marked centrilobular emphysema are ground- glass opacities and subsegmental atelectasis in the dependent portion of the right upper and lower lobes, and to a smaller degree in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
Secretions and a small fluid level is identified in segmental branches of the right bronchus.
There are no pleural effusions.
A multinodular thyroid is partially visualized.
There are coronary artery and aortic vascular calcifications, but the heart and great vessels at the mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable.
No pathologic adenopathy is present.
Degenerative changes are present in the osseous structures, but no suspicious lesions are identified.
Dependent right lung ground-glass opacities with bronchial secretions is most suggestive of aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonitis.
Right renal upper pole structure, which may be due to a renal lesion or adjacent bowel; ultrasound is recommended to exclude possibility of a renal mass.
Incompletely distended bladder.
Poorly defined structure at the base of the bladder likely represents an enlarged prostate, though a bladder mass cannot be entirely excluded.
Multiple consistencies of barium were administered to the patient under constant video fluoroscopy.
Oral phase was characterized by mildly impaired bolus control with premature spillover with thin liquids.
Pharyngeal phase is characterized by mildly reduced laryngeal elevation with all consistencies of barium.
There was a mild amount of residue within the valleculae after all consistencies.
Patient demonstrated penetration with consecutive sips of thin liquids.
There was one mild aspiration with teaspoons of thin liquid.
Echo [**2106-3-22**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.5 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 70% (nl >=55%) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 2.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.1 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.1 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 228 msec  INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Pt had been doing well until time of transfer to MICU when being turned in bed, developed sudden acute SOB w/ HR to 100s, SBP to 190s, O2 sat to 90s on FM, RR 45 on continuous neb.
During ICU evaluation, pt had diffuse rales, wheezes, and poor air movement.
Of note, pt stated that he had dull chest pressure in epigastrium prior to this acute episode, similar to what he had had previously when tachycardic during last admission.
Pt had previously developed similar anginal symptoms during last admission to MICU in setting of tachycardia associated w/ 1-2mm ST depressions in V4-6, presumed to be rate-related ischemia indicative of a stable angina syndrome.
Once diuresis was achieved, his oxygen requirement returned to his baseline 3-4 L NC.
On the Floor: A/P: 79 year old male with a history of COPD with recent admissions for PE and pneumonia, on anticoagulation, presenting with bright red blood per rectum.
Patient has never had a GI bleed in the past and has never had colonoscopy previously.
No history of DVT by ultrasound during previous admission.
COPD/Pneumonia: Patient with wheezing on exam and is on steroid taper for recent COPD flare.
Complicated by worsening pneumonia by CXR.
Started Vanc/Ceftaz given recent weeks in hospital/nursing home setting with cough and worsened infiltrate on CXR.
He had round the clock nebs and some minor changes to regimen in house, but at discharge restarted outpatient regimen of nebs, Singulair, Advair, and Spiriva.
Thought to be in acute setting of PE in combination of underlying lung disease.
Diastolic dysfunction: required IV Lasix in the ED for volume overload.
