Admission Date:  [**2127-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-3-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: extubation PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with recent admisison for PNA who presents from rehab with respiratory distress.
Patient has a PMH of HTN, Alzheimer's, and chronic anemia who presents from her rehab facility after intubation for respiratory distress.
In fact, the patient's daughter visited her mother this morning and noted her to be very responsive and was without complaints.
The patient's daughter also reports that her mother was being treated for some "GI" infection which appears to have been possible c. diff.
At approximately 1350 today, the patient was found to be in respiratory distress with accessory muscle use and retracting.
CXR showed worsening pleural effusions with pulm.
Alzheimer's dementia 3.
Anemia of chronic disease 9.
Recent multifocal PNA 10.
R ACA infarct [**2-10**] with L-sided weakness and aphasia  Social History: Since the R ACA stroke, pt has been living in a rehab.
Fully dependent, as she is hemiplegic on left and alert and oriented to first name only.
Drugs: denies   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: T 97.5 BP 122/78 HR 80 RR 15 O2 100% on vent General: Russian speaking, not responsive to voice, intubated HEENT: ETT and NG in place, sclera anicteric, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP elevated above jaw, no bruits appreciated Lungs: rales present [**3-5**] way up lung fields b/l CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no grimmacing to palpation.
MODERATE GROWTH.
CXR [**2127-3-18**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions with question of mild superimposed edema.
No definite pneumonia identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 39350**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian female with PMH of HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA who was admitted from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management.
# Respiratory failure: On ABG at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab the pt had a mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic picture.
On admission the pt didn't have any evidence of pneumonia (she had recently completed a course of antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia), and PE seemed unlikely as the pt had been on subcutaneous heparin at rehab and her oxygenation improved with intubation.
The pt's chest xray did show mild pulmonary edema and effusions, so the pt was diuresed with IV lasix, which she tolerated well.
On the day of extubation the pt was noted to have a leukocytosis and new infiltrate on chest xray, so a new course of antibiotics was initiated for a 7 day course for ventilator/hospital-acquired pneumonia (of Vancomycin and Cefepime) which she completed.
The pt's sputum culture grew out gram + cocci in pairs and clusters.
# Anemia: Baseline Hct low 30s, however was 24 on recent discharge, currently stable at 28.
No evidence of bleeding.
Attributed to chronic disease in past.
As seen in "results" section cardiac enzymes were cycled and trended down, elevation was likely demand in the setting of hypoxia.
# afib with RVR: the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR to the 140s.
This resolved with IV metoprolol and there were no further episodes.
# HTN: On admission the pt's BP was elevated, further supporting evidence of pulmonary edema.
During this admission the pt's left hand became edematous and ecchymotic.
Left upper extremity ultrasound was ordered to evaluate for upper extremity thrombus.
The ultrasound showed a non-occlusive thrombus in the left axillary vein.
If her peripheral IV access fails, she may be anticoagulated with Lovenox in the meantime.
EMERGENCY CONTACT:  daughter [**Name (NI) 4248**] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39351**] (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39352**] (h)  ****Goals of care**** Several discussions about goals of care were undertaken with the family (daughter, son-in-law, and grandson) by the medical team and palliative care consult team.
The patient's prognosis including her aspiration risk, the fact that this would not be prevented by a PEG tube, and the low likelihood that her mental status would significantly improve.
The family was unable to make a decision on whether or not to change her goals of care to comfort during the admission and would like to continue to monitor her at rehab for a few more days.
Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution [**Date range (1) **]: [**10-21**] mL PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: acute systolic congestive heart failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia Secondary: hypertension, Alzheimer's dementia, s/p recent stroke, anemia, afib with RVR   Discharge Condition: stable, breathing comfortably on room air, responsive to tactile stimuli, minimally responsive to voice, with spontaneous movements   Discharge Instructions: The patient was evaluated for respiratory distress.
This was thought to be from pulmonary edema and she improved with diuresis.
After extubation, she developed a pneumonia and completed a course of broad spectrum antibiotics.
She was also found to have a left upper extremity non-occlusive thrombus, likely related to a PICC line that was subsequentliy removed.
Currently, the family is undecided about moving towards hospice/palliative care, so any concerning symptoms (such as fever, chills, shortness of breath) should be discussed with the family before sending her to the hospital for re-evaluation.
