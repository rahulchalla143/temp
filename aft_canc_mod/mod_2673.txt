[**Name (NI) **] was last in his USOH 6 weeks ago when he developed dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough.
Patient ignored symptoms for several weeks, and finally saw his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2182-3-25**].
Patient was started on moxifloxacin for presumed pneumonia, but chest xray and cultures (unclear if blood or sputum) were negative, so antibiotics were stopped after 4 days.
During this admission patient developed an acute maculopapular rash which was later biopsied by dermatology after discharge and was reportedly consistent with allergy.
He had a PET scan on [**4-15**] which was negative except for increased bilateral adrenal uptake.
Patient's outpatient oncologist pursued TTE today to rule out SBE, which was negative for vegetations but worrisome for Afib with RVR to the 130s.
Labs revealed an AGMA, Cr of 1.5, thrombocytopenia to 47 and anemia to Hct 27 from baseline in the 30s.
EKG showed afib with a RBBB.
Patient was guaiac positive on exam with brown stool, and had an NG lavage which was negative.
Patient tolerated platelets well but while getting blood transfusion developed rigors, tachypnea and afib with RVR to the 160s.
Transfusion was stopped, and repeat CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Because of a documented allergy to versed, this drip is stopped and propafol is started.
T cell lymphoma (EATCL): similar to a very aggressive form of NHL, diagnosed in [**2175-7-20**] at [**Hospital3 **] after patient presented with RLQ abd pain and found to have perforated small bowel from infiltrative lesion.

Bowing of the interventricular septum to the left, raising a question of pulmonary hypertension and correlation with ECHO could be performed.
Moderately distended gallbladder with sludge, but no specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] findings of acute cholecystitis.
While this diagnosis cannot be excluded, the clinical presentation does not seem indicative of cholecystitis.
Small right pleural effusion also noted.

Cardiac ECHO ([**2182-4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 68 yo M with a h/o lymphoma s/p auto-BMT in [**2176**], Afib (off anticoagulation) and PVD who was admitted for subacute dyspnea on exertion and generalized weakness, hypotension and acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and found to have diagnosis of HLH, expired during this admission after being transferred to ICU.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a second time after worsening respiratory distress on the floor, with CXR consistent with ARDS.
Broad antibiotic coverage was started with linezolid/meropenem/vancomycin, as well as voriconazole (for presumed aspergillus) and acyclovir (for herpetic appearing lesions) and he was started on pressors.
Skin lesions on buttocks were biopsied by dermatology service and found to be growing [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fungal coverage was changed to micafungin, bronch was done and showed no e/o PCP but patient was started on prophylactic dose of bactrim daily.
Patient continued to be hypotensive and was supported with fluids, albumin and IVF, and HLH was treated agressively with high dose IV steroids, as well as Alemtuzumab.
ICU course was also complicated by acute renal failure, which improved with IVF so likely pre-renal.
He also was noted to have afib with RVR and was started on a diltiazem drip when BP tolerated, however he was often hypotensive.
Initially thought to be [**2-20**] medication effect as he was on voriconazole, however even after stopping remained elevated, RUQ u/s showed no portal vein thrombosis, most likely elevation in liver enzymes due to HLH.
# Hypotension: Concern for sepsis given that patient met SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea and tachycardia, but no obvious source.
Initially on broad spectrum Abx for HCAP given recent admission although Vanco/Cipro peeled back after a couple days when less likely PNA.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was intubated twice during admission.
It appears there is somewhat of a chronologic association with platelet/blood transfusion, and differential was TRALI, CHF, pneumonia.
Respiratory failure improved fairly quickly and was extubated.
On the floor, oxygen saturation remained in high 90s initially, however he was transferred to ICU again for respiratory distress, CXR was consistent with ARDS, for which he was intubated again, see ICU course above.
# [**Last Name (un) **]/AGMA: patient presented with [**Last Name (un) **], which improved with fluid resusication, indicating some extent of pre-renal state which was supported by FeNa<1%.
patient also has ABG with metabolic acidosi with appropriate respiratory compensation prior to intubation.
Renal failure quickly improved with Cr back to baseline but bumped up again to 1.5 a few days later thought to be due to contrast load from imaging in ED.
However, he developed episodes of ventricular tachycardia captured on telemetry.
He was lightheaded during one episode but for the most part remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
However, pt continued to have A fib with RVR and occasionaly with abherancy (went in and out of RBBB).
# HLH: Repeated BM aspirate had findings consistent with HLH.
Pt was Parvovirus IgM positive.
# Edema: Pt developed significant LE edema and scrotal swelling, likely [**2-20**] aggressive IV hydration.
# Transaminitis: Pt had rising LFTs and elevated bilirubin.
Liver consult was initiated and felt that the elevation in liver enzymes were secondary to either shock liver from pt's initial hypotensive state or from his HLH.
Liver enzymes started to trend upwards again when voriconazole was started for presumed aspergillosis infection, and after voriconazole was stopped they continued to uptrend, repeat RUQ u/s showed no portal vein thrombosis.
#Calcium/PTH: Pt with hyperparathyroidism and low calcium, likely [**2-20**] poor vit D absorption in pt with celiac disease as well as steroids.
Medications on Admission: # metoprolol tartrate 50 mg Qam and 25 mg Qpm # digoxin 125 mcg daily # simvastatin 40 mg Tab Oral # Tylenol PM Extra Strength  Discharge Medications: N/A, expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Afib with RVR Respiratory failure Septic shock ARDS  Discharge Condition: Expired   Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: Expired   Completed by:[**2182-6-4**
