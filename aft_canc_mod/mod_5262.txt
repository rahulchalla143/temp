He had dyspnea on exertion for 6 months and exertional chest pain.
He had a 10-year history of mitral valve prolapse followed by serial echo's which showed worsening MR in recent months.
He admits to progressive DOE and exertional chest pain.
Denies any symptoms at rest.
No PND or palpitations or orthopnea/[**Known firstname **] syncope.
Preop cardiac cath showed a left-dominant system  with a patent stent of his mid left circumflex, 3+ MR, ejection fraction of 62% and a cardiac output of 4.18 L/min.
Echo done in [**2139-6-10**] showed mild AI, moderate MR, mild TR and an ejection fraction of 70%.
RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  Preop carotid series showed antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries and moderate plaque with bilateral 40% to 60% carotid stenoses.
Preop chest x-ray showed multifocal asbestos-related plaque with some calcified plaque in the left hemithorax with a suggestion of left atrial enlargement, but no other cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Preop EKG showed sinus rhythm at 62 with atrial premature depolarizations.
Moderate-to-severe mitral valve prolapse with 2+ MR and 2+ TR.
Mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation.
Coronary artery disease with left circumflex stent in     [**2133**].
Elevated cholesterol.
Pulmonary asbestosis.
Bilateral carotid artery stenosis with peripheral     vascular disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post inguinal hernia repairs, status post multiple nodule removals for neurofibromatosis and status post basal cell carcinoma on his back.
ALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies.
He had multiple subacute nodules.
He had a significant left eye droop.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a grade 4/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
His abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
His extremities were warm and well perfused with trace edema on the right greater than the left.
He had bilateral 1+ femoral, DP and PT pulses; and a soft carotid bruit on the left and 1+ on the right.
He was transferred to the cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on an epinephrine drip at 0.02 mcg/kg/min, a nitroglycerin drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, and a propofol titrated drip.
He had some short bursts of AFib, but was in sinus rhythm in the morning at 73 with a blood pressure of 123/48.
He had a 10% right apical pneumothorax, from which he was not symptomatic post chest tube pull.
A cardiology consult was requested for evaluation of his atrial tachycardia and first-degree AV block.
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit, but remained hemodynamically stable as his heart rate rose to the 70s.
On postoperative day 4, he went back and forth between sinus bradycardia and Wenckebach rhythm.
On postoperative day 6, he was back in atrial fibrillation but maintaining a good blood pressure of 127/58.
Heparin was restarted, and first dose of Coumadin was given of 2 mg later that afternoon for coverage of his atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day 7, he remained in atrial fibrillation.
He had some hyperkalemia with a K of 6.0.
He went back into sinus rhythm and then back to atrial fibrillation on the day of discharge - [**9-30**] - with an INR of 1.8 on Coumadin therapy.
Coronary artery disease; status post left circumflex     stent in [**2133**].
Pulmonary asbestosis.
Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral carotid artery     stenoses.
Coumadin 3 mg to be dosed of the afternoon of the 21st     and Coumadin 3 mg to be dosed on the afternoon of the     22nd with INR to be drawn by the VNA and then called to     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5017**] for continued dosing with a target INR of     2.0 to 2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
