History of Present Illness: The patient is a 85y/o gentleman who has a history of mild splenomegaly that has been increasing slowly.
He is thought to perhaps have some disorder of myelodysplastic syndrome.
Of note is he also has had colon cancer and had a metastasis to his liver.
He was noted on recent scanning to have some abnormalities in his spleen.
It is unclear whether this enlargement is due to his metastatic disease or progression of his myelodysplastic syndrome.
Past Medical History: PMH: AAA with expansion after EVAR, HTN, COPD, hypercholesterolemia, metastatic colon CA s/p adjuvant chemotherapy, +ETOH, MDS anemia PSH: L colectomy, segment [**3-17**] liver resection for metastatic colon CA/open CCY '[**63**], EVAR [**2163**], redo EVAR [**2166**]   Social History: Significant EToH use including [**3-17**] cocktails daily.

Small residual hematoma in LUQ.
Upon arrival to the recovery area, patient was noted to have a SBP in the 80s.
His BP actually improved to 100 systolic after these interventions, but the patient soon became unresponsive.
A central line was placed in the L femoral vein, and patient began to get hypotensive again to the 60s and was very pale and tachycardic.
This line was promptly removed and pressure held for 55 min, with no evidence of bleeding after.
Epidural was restarted for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received epidural with good effect and adequate pain control.
He became intermittently agitated the first few days post-op and this was treated with small doses of ativan.
He did show any signs of severe alcohol withdrawal.
Due to intermittent confusion and agitation, patient did not take much po initially.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**2172-3-4**] to rule out splenic/ portal vein thrombosis and it showed no evidence of thrombosis.
On [**2172-3-5**] a CT scan was performed to evaluate for subdiaphragmatic collection due to persistent hiccups.
No collection was seen on CT and patient's hiccups were improving upon discharge.
GU/FEN: The patient suffered acute renal insufficiency during his hospital stay, likely from hypotension, possibly exacerbated by cross clamp of aorta during re-exploration.
His Cr post-operatively was maximally elevated at 2.8.
Cxr's were followed that initially showed pulmonary edema, but this improved greatly with the lasix.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Patient was started on ASA 325 daily due to rising platelet count.
VASCULAR: The patient underwent a duplex of his L subclavian artery on [**2172-2-28**] that showed a 1.9 cm linear tract arising from the puncture site.
Follow up duplex on [**2172-3-2**] showed no pseudoaneurysm.
A CTA was performed on [**2172-3-3**] that again showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
