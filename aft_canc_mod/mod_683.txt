HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old male with history of renal cell carcinoma, lung metastases who has lesions, last one being on [**2119-9-11**].
Bronchoscopy at the time showed moderate bleeding in the right lower lobe distally, no bleeding from the endobrachial lesions.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**8-28**] to the had right lower lobe bleeding mass cauterized at that time.
The patient has had multiple episodes of this hemoptysis at home.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Included metastatic renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2116**], status post right nephrectomy and chemotherapy.
The patient was found to have metastatic disease to the lung and hilum which was treated with x-ray therapy, laser therapy extending into the right middle lobe bronchus.
In [**8-2**] the patient was found to have metastatic brain lesion to the right cerebellum status post stereotactic surgery.
In [**2119-5-2**] the patient was found to have metastatic disease to the left basal ganglia, status post stereotactic radiosurgery.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, normal, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2+ distal pulses bilaterally.
The patient was intubated status post the hemoptysis for preventative measures.
Chest CT from [**8-24**] showed the worsening of the right lower lobe mass, infrahilar mass and some satellite visions.
The patient was going to have interventional radiology for right brachial arterial embolism.
On [**2119-9-17**] the patient had an episode of hemoptysis about 30 ml.
On that day patient had a repeat bronchoscopy which revealed fresh blood clots and clotting of the right bronchus.
The patient had desaturations as well down to the 40's with increased respiratory rate and increased blood pressure, positive hemoptysis.
Blood cultures were taken times two as well as urinalysis, urine culture.
The patient had right internal jugular line.
It was decided that this line will remain in due to patient's poor peripheral access and therefore was changed over wire with the tip sent for culture as well.
The patient remained afebrile that day but however, the line remained in.
Further XRT was planned for patient to have palliative measures to the bleeding source and the right lower lobe.
The patient was suctioned as needed prn for increased bleeding as well.
On [**9-20**] the patient remained afebrile with a T max of 101.8.
The right IJ culture grew out gram positive strep and positive cocci.
On [**2119-9-21**] the patient was extubated and patient was made DNI status post extubation with no further intubations necessary.
The patient's cardiovascular exam revealed an irregular irregular rhythm with a rapid ventricular rate.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation and transferred to the floor on [**2119-9-21**].
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclera.
Neck, no bruits, no jugulovenous distension.
Heart was irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities were warm with no edema.
The patient had no episodes of hemoptysis on [**2119-9-21**] while on the floor and remained afebrile.
The patient remained in house for further XRT treatment, for further palliation of his bleeding source.
The patient had no episodes of hemoptysis as I said for the last two nights.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 110's and 130's, had some runs of NSVT as well as VT which were both asymptomatic.
In terms of ID the patient remained afebrile and will continue the Vancomycin.
