HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and chronic renal failure.
Over the past year, the patient has had increasing lower extremity edema and recurrent leg cellulitis.
The patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital (from [**1-1**] until [**1-19**]) with complaint of weakness, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath.
During his hospitalization, the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and was diuresed extensively with loss of 25 pounds.
The patient complained of nausea, vomiting, and poor po intake, and underwent an EGD, gastric biopsy was concerning for amyloidosis.
While on the Medical Service, the patient had two episodes of chest pain without electrocardiogram changes.
He began to have episodes of hematemesis.
Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus x15 years complicated by diabetic nephropathy.
Chronic renal failure.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram in [**2144-11-23**] at [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center disclosed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly decreased left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50-55%, RVH.
Erosive esophagitis and gastritis with evidence of fold thickening and nodularity of the stomach.
Coronary artery disease.
Cardiac catheterization in [**2142-12-25**] disclosed a 30% lesion in the marginal branch of the left anterior descending artery, and 30% lesion in the right coronary artery.
Anemia treated with iron supplementation and Epogen.
Plasma cell dyscrasia.
Prior episode of ischemic colitis diagnosed by colonoscopy [**2142-4-24**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus, no history of hypertension or kidney disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention appreciated, no thyromegaly, no cervical lymphadenopathy.
Heart regular, rate, and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at right upper sternal border.
No rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, and no masses.
No lower extremity edema.
CHEST X-RAY:  Evidence of congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, cardiomegaly.
Large amounts of clotted blood was noted in the antrum of the stomach.
Pulmonary:  Patient required intubation on [**1-21**] for respiratory arrest due to mucus plugging.
As noted above, the patient's chest x-ray disclosed the presence of bilateral pleural effusions.
Laboratory data was consistent with a transudative effusion.
In addition, the patient has required repeated bronchoscopies during his MICU stay due to recurrent purulent secretions.
On [**1-31**], the patient was noted to have purulent secretions in the main stem bronchi and right lower lobe, consistent with a ventilator-associated pneumonia.
BAL culture disclosed presence of gram-negative rods.
Furthermore, on [**2-6**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy which disclosed moderate secretions and partial obstruction of the bronchus intermedius and left main stem bronchus.
Large amounts of clotted blood was noted in the antrum of the stomach.
In addition, the whole stomach was noted to have nodularity and erosions compatible with an infiltrated disorder.
Biopsies were done and pathology disclosed no evidence of neoplasm.
However, it was noted that there was deposition of acellular pale eosinophilic material with a moderate degree of staining with [**Country **] red.
Since [**1-22**], the patient has not had any further episodes of hematemesis.
However, he has had episodes of dark stools and clots per rectum.
Cardiology:  As noted above, the patient complained of chest pain early in his hospital stay, and was noted to have a troponin elevation to 1.1.
Echocardiogram was consistent with a restrictive cardiomyopathy with a normal ejection fraction.
A repeat echocardiogram was done to rule out pericardial effusion causing tamponade as an etiology of the patient's hypotensive.
There was no evidence of pericardial effusion on the echocardiogram.
Furthermore, patient was noted to be febrile and there was concern for a distributive shock.
Renal:  As noted above, the patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency due to FFGS and diabetic nephropathy.
Renal service has been followed the patient and his renal decompensation was initially attributed to ATN in the setting of the patient's gastrointestinal bleed.
[**Country 7018**] red staining of the patient's kidney biopsy from [**2142**] was negative for amyloidosis.
During his MICU stay, the patient had declining urine output.
In addition, he had episodes of hematuria requiring placement of a three-way Foley.
A renal ultrasound did not disclose evidence of hydronephrosis.
However, he requires dialysis due to his worsening metabolic acidosis.
The patient's last episode of hematemesis was [**1-22**].
It is believed that the patient's gastric biopsy is consistent with a light-chain gastropathy, presumably from the multiple myeloma.
On [**2-1**], the patient was noted to be positive for Clostridium difficile.
CT scan of the chest and abdomen did not disclose evidence of an abscess.
Patient currently remains on Flagyl for treatment of his Clostridium difficile infection and meropenem for treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Endocrine:  Patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.
In addition, patient has been started on stress dosed steroids for treatment of adrenal insufficiency in the setting of sepsis.
Nutrition:  The patient has very poor nutritional status with an albumin in the range of [**12-25**].3.
Vascular:  On [**2-8**], it was noted that the patient had modeling of his feet and ischemia of his toes.
