Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right video assisted thorocoscopy, right thorocotomy Right middle, right lower lobectomy  [**1-24**] for hilar lesion Tissue flap.
Mediastinal lymphnode disection.
He has had recurrent, right sided pneumonias in recent months and was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 1562**] w/ shortness of breath.
CT scan here of airway showed large tumor burden on right with almost total collapse of RLL (see below for report).
Patient then had rigid bronch on [**1-4**] which showed tumor origin extending into RLL orifice, obstructing entire RLL.
Past Medical History: PMH: h/o tularemia [**2138**] (hospitalized) h/o babesiosis- 5 yrs ago (hospitalzed) chornic/recurrent right sided pnas 2-4 episodes in last year- last admit few weeks before current admission GERD eye surgery OTHER DATA: CT scan at [**Hospital1 1562**] by report [**12-18**]: R lower lobe infiltrate spirometry at [**Hospital1 1562**] [**2162-12-30**]: FEV1 2.63 (79% predicted).
Flow volume loop with mild obstruction.
Impression "Stage I COPD" thinks he may have had TIA many years ago w/ right arm tingling- not worked up   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital3 4298**].
Denies family h/o anesthesia complications  Physical Exam: He is a thin elderly male in no acute distress.
Cervical exam reveals no supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
Thorax is symmetrical without lesions or masses.
Abdomen is benign without masses or tenderness.
Extremities show no clubbing or edema.
Pertinent Results: CT trachea [**2163-1-1**]: Near-complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to a mass which obstructs the right lower lobe segmental bronchi and extends up to the level of the right middle lobe origin.
The right lower lobe had a white necrotic obstructing lesion emanating from the superior segment of the lower lobe (S6) and completely obstructing the right lower lobe.
CXR [**2163-1-24**]: Moderate right pneumothorax with chest tubes in place.
FINDINGS: Compared with the prior study, the right chest catheter remains in place, and there is a persistent lower component pneumothorax, unchanged from prior.
A bit more patchiness in opacity is seen in the right lower lung field, a finding which should be reassessed on subsequent followup studies.
Possible developing airspace disease in the right base.
There is continued moderate-sized right basilar pneumothorax, which is unchanged in size.
There is continued extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
[**2-2**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak on.Please do at 10am HISTORY: Right middle and right lower lobectomy.
There is a small caliber chest tube in the lower right hemithorax.
Moderate-sized right pneumothorax, most of which is seen adjacent to the diaphragm.
The overall appearances and size of postoperative right pneumothorax are little changed from one day previous ([**2163-2-1**]).
IMPRESSION: No short interval change in postoperative right pneumothorax.
[**2163-2-3**] 7:24 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Interval evaluation after right middle lobe and right lower lobe lobectomy.
Moderate sized right pneumothorax, which is most prominent in the lung base but also may be barely seen in the apex, remains unchanged.
Extensive right subcutaneous emphysema is present and prevents the exact estimation of the apical part of the right pneumothorax.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2163-2-4**] 6:51 AM Reason: please eval for change--compared to [**2-3**]--9:30pm [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy, s/p CT removal, worsenign crepitus and voice change REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for change--compared to [**2-3**]--9:30pm HISTORY: Status post right middle and right lower lobectomies and chest tube removal, with worsening crepitus and voice change.
Evaluation of the right-sided intrathoracic detail is once again limited by the extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
There is no change in the position of the heart and mediastinum, including the trachea.
There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
OR was delayed for acute chest pain with bradycardia, no EKG changes or increase in cardiac markers were seen.
Per cardiology note, this presentation was consistent with an increase in vagal output likely [**1-20**] pain, a cold room etc.
Patient developed some voice changes concerning for increase in subqutaneous emphysema.
CXRY done in evening- stable, no changes.
PLAN: [**2-4**] a.m CXR stable and without changes.

Bradycardia episode pre-op.
Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**]/Thoracic Surgery office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**]for: fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, redness and excessive foul smelling drainage from incision sites.
