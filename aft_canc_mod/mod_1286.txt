Admission Date:  [**2152-7-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-7-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Anesthesia IV Set-Clamp / Flagyl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Rapid heartrate  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 36698**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old lady, with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and GI bleed (not currently anticoagulated), who was discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2152-7-14**] after admission for afib w/ RVR, attributed to a urinary tract infection, which converted in the ED after diltiazem, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics for her UTI, now readmitted with afib with RVR, with increasing oxygen requirement.
On her previous admission, the patient had presented with malaise, fevers and occasional dysuria.
Per her daughter, she was doing well yesterday but did have a fever up to 101.3 last night, which responded to Tylenol x2.
CXR showed bilateral lower lobe opacities R > L, mild interstital opacities and small bilateral effusion, ?atelectasis vs. PNA.
Labs significant for a leukocytosis to 12.4 with 86.3%.
She also had elevated BNP up to 5944.
Of note, UA had cleared (negative nitrites, no bacteria).
She was triggered immediately for tachycardia and hypoxia.
Due to volume overload and pulmonary edema apparent on physical exam, she was given furosemide 40 mg IV x1.
Additionally, given the question of pneumonia on her chest x-ray, she was started on empiric coverage for HCAP with cefepime/vancomycin/azithromycin.
Denies any particular discomfort at this time but does appear very tachypneic.
ROS negative for history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:      Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Paroxysmal afib - Mitral regurgitation- ECHO '[**42**] w/ EF 65%, 3+ MR, 2+TR, LVH -CABG: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -PACING/ICD: 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - h/o GIB x2, most recently in [**2-/2152**], now off anticoagulation and ASA - hearing loss - polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] - Osteoarthritis - Osteoporosis - depression - depression - s/p 3 C-sections - s/p appendectomy - h/o diverticulitis - s/p right knee replacement  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current or past  tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease  or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
CARDIAC: Tachycardic, irregular rhythm, no MRG.
LUNGS: Markedly decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally.
Poor air movement.
EXTREMITIES: Trace edema, no cyanosis or clubbing.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
Microbiology: [**2152-7-15**] BCx x2 pending [**2152-7-13**] 3:26 pm URINE    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2152-7-15**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe opacities could relate to pulmonary edema, but underlying infection not excluded.
TTE [**2152-7-17**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Trivial mitral stenosis (due to mitral annular calcification).
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-5-16**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Ms. [**Known lastname 36698**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yoF with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and GI bleed (not anticoagulated), who was discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2152-7-14**] after admission for afib w/ RVR, attributed to a urinary tract infection, which converted in the ED after diltiazem, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics for her UTI, readmitted with afib with RVR, with increasing oxygen requirement.
She was evaluated by the EP service, who felt that digoxin may actually worsen her cardiac output due to her underlying diastolic dysfunction seen on TTE.
# Hypoxia: Likely due to multiple factors including pneumonia, acute on chronic heart failure, and poor cardiac filling due to afib with RVR.
She had a high O2 requirement with non-rebreather mask for several days despite diuresis with lasix and antibiotics, which raised concern for possible underlying PE.
Could not obtain CT PE to confirm due to renal failure, so she was empirically started on IV heparin.
# Pneumonia: CXR on admission showed pulmonary edema with bilateral lower lobe opacities, and pneumonia could not be excluded.
Given her high O2 requirement and recent hospitalization, she was empirically treated with IV vancomycin/cefepime.
After discussion with pt and family, anticoagulation was continued due to patient's prolonged period of atrial fibrillation.
# Hypertension: Home lisinopril and amlodipine were held due to starting propanolol for rate control.
