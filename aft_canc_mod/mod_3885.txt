No pleural effusion.
Mildly prominent azygous vein.
No significant abnormalities in limited AP view.
*  DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2138-12-3**] 11:09 AM ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY); DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL FINDINGS: -The liver echotexture is diffusely heterogeneous, particularly within segments 6 and 7, though no focal liver lesion is identified.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The hepatic arteries are likewise widely patent; however, appear prominent, which may be related to chronic liver disease.
-The gallbladder and common duct appear normal.
No evidence of portal or hepatic venous thrombosis.
Heterogenous liver echotexture, particularly within segments 6 and 7, though no focal masses identified.
* CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2138-12-4**] 2:53 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
Small hiatal hernia is present.
The liver demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement, but no focal liver mass is identified.
Residual splenic tissue is seen in the left upper quadrant.
A small amount of free fluid is seen throughout the abdomen and surrounding the right kidney as well.
No soft tissue mass is noted adjacent to the right kidney.
Several small lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the abdomen.
There is no free air.
There is mild wall thickening in the cecum and focal loops of small bowel in the left lower quadrant.
Low attenuation material is seen within the superior mesenteric vein and main portal vein.
Free fluid is seen tracking into the pelvis from the abdomen.
There is no pathologic lymphadenopathy within the pelvis or inguinal regions.
IMPRESSION: 1) Heterogeneously enhancing liver without focal mass.
Low attenuation material is seen within the superior mesenteric and portal veins.
This could represent thrombosis even though arterial and vascular flow to the liver was noted to be widely patent on the ultrasound of 1 day prior.
2) Ascites thoroughout the abdomen.
3) No soft tissue mass is identified adjacent to the right kidney.
* DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2138-12-6**] 1:17 PM LIMITED LIVER DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: 2D, color and Doppler wave form imaging of the main portal vein shows wall-to-wall flow without evidence of thrombosis.
Esophageal varices (ligation).
Brief Hospital Course: Initially, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was hypotensive with SBP to 70 and tachycardic to 150s.
There was also a clot in the fundus of the stomach.
No gastric varicies were seen.
Two grade 2 esophageal varices were banded without complication.
