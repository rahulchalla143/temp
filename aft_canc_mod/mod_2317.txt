Was discharged to rehab on [**1-31**] but readmitted [**2-1**] for hypoglycemia (66) and weakness.
Today his L foot was noted to be cooler than the R, and an "arterial ultrasound" showed a "distal clot" (notes aren't more specific and the actual report isn't currently available).
Accordingly, he is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and management of ischemic L foot  Past Medical History: IDDM CAD s/p CABG '[**93**] s/p stents '[**04**] AFib HTN, hypercholesterolemia CHF orthostatic hypotension hyponatremia hypothyroid multiple myeloma thrombocytopenia MRSA bacteremia nephrolithiasis PSH: s/p CABG x4 '[**93**], s/p R CEA '[**08**] ([**Doctor Last Name 1391**]), s/p R rotator cuff surgery x2, s/p open appy (remote  Social History: married denies tobacco, ETOH or drug use  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE: 97.9, 82, 104/56, 20, 96 on RA A&Ox3, NAD.

Doppler waveforms show triphasic waveforms of the femoropopliteal areas on the right as well as the posterior tibial artery on the right side.
There are similar findings seen with pulse volume recordings with amplitude loss and waveform widening at the level of the ankle and metatarsal bilaterally.

Nonspecific IV conduction defect Poor R wave progression - possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction Nonspecific inferolateral T wave flattening Since previous tracing of the same date, no significant change  Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2112-2-13**] at 12:07:14 PM      FINAL  Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior posterior wall, and akinesis of the interventricular septum.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is no pericardial effusion.
