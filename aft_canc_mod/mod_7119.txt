HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is the fifth hospital admission this year for this 79-year-old African American man with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Patient noted worsened dyspnea for the week prior to admission; nursing home M.D.
Patient also reported increased cough productive of yellow sputum.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oxygen dependent.
Prostate cancer with bone metastases.
Chronic atonic bladder and is chronically catheterized.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Renal mass.
CT scan of the abdomen in [**2143-2-16**] showed a large cystic mass with multiple septations and small area of enhancement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has been living in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing Home Rehabilitation since discharge from [**Date range (1) 107423**] [**Hospital1 1444**] admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmur.
Extremities:  No edema.
Electrocardiogram:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute with a normal axis, slight ST depressions in V5 and V6.
Chest x-ray showed large lung volumes, no infiltrate or effusion.
IMPRESSION, PLAN, AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 79-year-old male with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presenting with respiratory distress.
Impression was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with possible upper respiratory infection as precipitant given his reports of increased sputum.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation:  On admission, he was started on high dosed intravenous steroids, Solu-Medrol at 80 mg IV tid, and was given albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments every three hours.
He experienced subjective improvement in his symptoms daily, although he continued to have wheezing and dyspnea on minimal exertion, which was his baseline even on discharge.
Given his end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and his dyspnea with almost any activity, the Intensive Care Unit's attending pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**] suggested that the patient may benefit from opioid treatment to blunt his sensation of dyspnea and to improve his quality of life.
Given that patient has some wheezing even with high-dosed steroids, we suspect that he may not be very steroid responsive.
He developed mild tachycardia and anxiety, and were given frequent albuterol nebulizer treatments.
Unfortunately, given his end-stage lung disease, he is likely to have recurrent hospitalizations in the future.
Likely renal mass on CT scan in [**2143-2-16**].
The patient would not be an operative candidate even if he had renal cell carcinoma; no further workup is indicated at this time.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Urinary tract infection.
Albuterol nebulizer treatment q2-4h prn for worsening dyspnea.
Ipratropium nebulizer treatments q4h prn for worsened dyspnea.
Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], hold for loose stools.
Senokot two tablets q hs, hold for loose stools.
