PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 98.1, heartrate 105, blood pressure 110/76, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air, increasing to 93% on 3 liters by nasal cannula.
In general, the patient is in mild respiratory stress and tachypneic.
Head and neck examination reveals pupils equal, round and reactive to light, moist mucous membranes, mildly elevated jugulovenous distension.
Heart examination revealed tachycardia with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds, no distention or tenderness and no guarding.
No costovertebral angle tenderness was noted.
Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
A chest x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumonia, subsegmental atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle, and a mass in the left lower lobe, unchanged from prior examinations.
A computerized tomography scan of the chest revealed the development of an extensive bilateral pulmonary embolus involving the superior and inferior left pulmonary arteries as well as the inferior right pulmonary artery.
No pericardial effusion was noted.
There was a small left pleural effusion.
No interval change in the left lower lobe mass was noted.
The head computerized tomography scan was performed and showed no evidence of any intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhages or mass lesions.
A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a markedly dilated right ventricular cavity, with preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis was noted.
Pulmonary - The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for his pulmonary embolus.
He was very dyspneic with exertion.
He developed acute onset hypertension, followed by hypotension and tachycardia requiring pressors and fluids.
The course was complicated by pleural effusions and a pneumonia, which made extubation difficult.
Thoracentesis of the pleural effusion revealed an exudate consistent with a parapneumonic effusion.
Serial chest x-rays revealed improvement in the congestive heart failure as well as the left lower lobe pneumonia.
Infectious disease - The patient's pneumonia was treated with a variety of antibiotics, including Augmentin, Levofloxacin, Zosyn and Vancomycin.
Culture data showed Escherichia coli that was pansensitive to antibiotics, and the patient improved while on Ceftriaxone.
Mental status - Following extubation, the patient had episodes of confusion which were thought to be related to medications.
At the time of this dictation, the patient still had episodes of delirium and confusion requiring a 1:1 sitter for safety.
