HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old female who presented to an outside hospital in [**2173-3-13**], with three weeks of malaise, anorexia, progressive abdominal distention and increasing abdominal pain.
On workup, she was revealed to be markedly jaundiced and laboratory work revealed abnormal liver function tests.
Please refer to previously dictated discharge summary for details of her admission.
The patient now presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for definitive resection of a mass at the head of the pancreas.
Left total hip replacement with a revision restatic of the right leg.
Colonic polypectomy.
Multiple trauma with right arm fracture, injured lower back, right tibial fracture, ankle fracture, left shoulder fracture.
Congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy.
Intraoperatively, she had been noted to have local invasion by the tumor into the portal vein.
She was on an epidural for pain control.
On postoperative day number one, the patient was doing well with pain relatively well controlled.
By late on postoperative day number one, the patient, however, became increasingly confused, agitated, and started falling on some of her lines and yelling at family members.
The patient's pain control on the epidural was somewhat suboptimal late on postoperative day number one with a Dilaudid PCA added for better pain control.
On postoperative day number three, the patient received a unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit.
On the night of postoperative day number three, the house officer was called to the patient's bedside when the patient was noted to have become tachypneic to the 40s, and tachycardic to the 120s and 130s.
A stat chest x-ray was ordered to rule out pulmonary edema.
This was ultimately negative for pulmonary vascular congestion.
In the Intensive Care Unit, series of cardiac enzymes were drawn and the patient was ultimately ruled in for myocardial infarction.
The study revealed the patient had no central pulmonary embolism but was inconclusive about possible segmental pulmonary embolisms.
The patient was also noted to have heterogeneous enhancement of the right lobe of her liver relative to the left suggesting hyperemia.
The patient had no evidence of an intra-abdominal abscess.
There was no extravasation of oral contrast.
The patient's blood cultures ultimately grew out E. coli.
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain cultures ultimately also grew E. coli.
The patient's sputum grew out coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, gram negative rods, beta Streptococci.
Wound cultures grew coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus.
On [**2173-5-19**], the patient was screened for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
She was started on tube feeds when she began to have bowel movements.
The results of the patient's pathology studies ultimately revealed that the patient had a clear cell cancer of the pancreas.
It should also be noted that the patient had a transient period of thrombocytopenia with her platelet count trending down into the 50,000 and 60,000 while in the Intensive Care Unit.
Studies were sent for Heparin induced thrombocytopenia which were ultimately negative.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction.
