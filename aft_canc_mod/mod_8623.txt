Pt became hypotensive overnight down to 80s/60s and a fluid bolus was given overnight.
In the AM it was clarified that vitals were to be discontinued and to only to be given bolus if symptomatic.
Plan was to transfer to home hospice tomorrow, but today [**11-10**] at about 12:00 pt became more SOB and then apneic and died of cardio-pulmonary arrest.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic HF: (EF 20%) In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was hypotensive in 70s, and given a 250ml bolus and responded to 122/57.
Pt was initially euvolemic and w/o orthopnea, PND, or DOE on the floor, but later to become volume overloaded.
Pt was treansferred to the CCU for milrinone since unable to tolerate fluid challenge for renal failure.
Pt continued to devleop hypotension [**1-15**] CHF.
Pt was transferred back to the floor, and became slightly overloaded and went up to lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], goal was to keep pt even.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt's baseline Cre usually 1.6-1.8.
Prerenal [**1-15**] CHF possibly leading to intrarenal ATN.
On transfer back from the CCU her Cr was still elevated at 2.3.
# Hypotension: Initially thought to be in the setting of overdiuresis.

# CAD: s/p CABG with recent stent of LIMA to LAD.
No chest pain or palpitations currently.
EKG unchanged from previous w/o acute ischemic changes.
Trops were elevated [**1-15**] renal disease and remained flat.
# Rhythm: Pt occasionally had NSVT, but would remain asymptomatic.
