An ultrasound was performed on the [**2179-7-6**], and this revealed, in a fairly limited study, a large complex right adnexal cystic mass, ovarian in origin.
The kidneys were unremarkable and there was a small amount of free fluid noted within the posterior cul-de-sac.
A followup CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was then performed on [**2179-7-8**], and this revealed once again the solid cystic and right adnexal mass measuring 15 x 12 x 8 cm.
There was no significant free fluid or irregularities suggestive of ascites.
Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] in the past week has been hospitalized for pulmonary embolism.
She developed a blood clot in her leg and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation.
A CTA of the chest revealed ascites with bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned, the patient suffers from diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and recently was diagnosed with a DVT and pulmonary embolism.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had her left ovary removed through a vertical midline incision in [**2160**].
She denies any history of pelvic infections or abnormal Pap smears.
She worked for an astronomy magazine called [**Hospital Ward Name **] & Telescope, and she worked there for years and years.
Oral mucosa without evidence of thrush or mucositis.
NECK:  Supple, no masses, no thyromegaly identified.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey, negative cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
BACK:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
A large vertical midline incision is noted.
I am unable to palpate any mass or irregularity.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There is no bleeding identified on speculum exam, the cervix is normal in appearance.
Bimanual exam is dominated by a pelvic mass that extends over to the right side.
RECTAL:  Reveals good sphincter tone without mass or lesion.

10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2179-8-14**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
RADIOLOGY ========= Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2179-8-11**] 10:36 PM In comparison with study of [**8-4**], there is increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.
This could represent acute pneumonia, atelectasis, pleural effusion, or some combination of these conditions.
Prominence of the pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, although it also could be a manifestation of substantially lower lung volumes.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Low precordial lead voltage.
ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-8-12**] there is no significant difference.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Anterolateral ST-T wave changes raise consideration of myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-8-13**] the anterior ST segment depressions and T wave inversions are more apparent.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2179-8-17**] at 11:48:32 AM      FINAL The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] was admitted after undergoing exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, right salpingo-oophorectomy, drainage of ascites, total abdominal hysterectomy, infragastric omentectomy, appendectomy, cystoscopy, and repair of ventral hernia.
Her intra-operative course was complicated by blood loss anemia and she was transfused 2 units of PRBC.
*) Cardiovascular She had no cardiac events during this hospital course.
Chest radiograph demonstrated findings suggestive of pneumonia, and she had a leukocytosis.
Arterial blood gas revealed an acute respiratory acidosis.
Chest radiograph revealed bilateral pulmonary effusions.
She had no significant EKG changes during her hospital course.
*) FEN/GI Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] was started on a regular diet post-operatively which she tolerated well until post-operative day 3 when she experienced nausea and emesis.
Her diet was cautiously advanced after resolution of nausea and passing of flatus.
*) Hematology Due to concern for bleeding in the setting of blood loss anemia requiring transfusion, Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] was kept on prophylactic heparin until post-operative day 3 when her home lovenox dose was started.
Initial work-up of her fever revealed urine culture significant for enterococcus and sputum culture demonstrating oropharyngeal flora.
Of note, on post-operative day [**7-3**], she had multiple loose bowel movements.
She had no fever or abdominal pain.
Her stool tested negative for C. difficile.
She then experienced superficial wound separation.
There was no evidence of fascial dehiscence or infection.
Ms. [**Known lastname 19075**] was eventually discharged on post-operative day 9 in stable condition: afebrile, able to eat regular food, under adequate pain control with oral medications, and ambulating and urinating without difficulty.
