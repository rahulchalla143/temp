On the day of admission, the patient refused to eat at all or take any of his medications.
The patient denies any cough, sputum production, SOB, CP, N/V/D, fevers or chills.
Head CT (obtained to r/o ICH) showed stable R frontal and L temporal mets with edema and bony involvement, but without significant change since [**2144-10-5**].
bilateral infrahilar opacities concerning for evaloving infection.
He has no other concerns at this time.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: # Early stage lung cancer s/p right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection [**9-/2134**] without evidence of recurrence.
- [**9-/2141**]: Abdominal pain and lower GI bleed, colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated 4-5cm mass in the mid-rectum at 10cm, path showed poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**3-/2142**]: Low anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy and mesenteric and periaortic lymphadenectomy (T3N2M0, [**8-17**] lymph nodes involved, with a distal margin that was clear by < 1 mm, k-RAS wild type) after completion of neo-adjuvant capecitabine-based chemoradiation.
- [**2142-6-13**]: C2 FLOX, changed from [**6-10**] to [**6-12**] due to abdominal pain and nausea.
Urgent CT demonstrated nonocclusive thrombus in left renal vein and interval enlargement of sclerotic focus in left aspect of T12.
- [**2142-6-13**]: Bone scan, spine MRI, and CT torso showed multiple bone metsmetastasis.
CT demonstrated small bowel thickening suggestive of enteritis.
- [**8-8**] - [**2142-8-12**]: Hospitalized for weakness, abdominal pain, and increased ostomy output and dehydration.
CT revealed epiploic appendagitis.
Therapy was complicated by oxaliplatin-related neuropathy involving the palms, feet and distal calves.
- [**2143-10-9**]: CT TORSO showed increased sclerotic bony metastatic disease unclear if due to disease progression or response to treatment.
- [**8-/2144**]: New seizure, brain mets on CT and MRI.
Atrial fibrillation.
Family History: Unremarkable for colorectal or other malignancy.

No new intracranial hemorrhage or increased mass effect.
CXR ([**2144-11-9**]): Extent and distribution of rib-based metastases appear overall unchanged since [**Month (only) 359**].
No vascular congestion.
Interval development of b/l infrahilar opacities raising ?
Lower extremity venous ultrasound ([**2144-11-9**])- No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the main, lobar, and segmental branches.
Assessment of subsegmental arteries is limited due to motion artifacts and multifocal lung opacities.
Multifocal pneumonia with a likely component of superimposed pulmonary edema.
Moderate diffuse emphysema 4.
Bilateral mild pleural effusions.
Multifocal osseous metastases, progressed since [**2144-6-1**].
EKG: AFib with rate 156   Brief Hospital Course: 71 year-old man with metastatic rectal CA with brain mets reulting in seizures presenting with tachycardia, fever, and CT findings consistent with multifocal PNA.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit initially for hypotension and stabalized.
Given the progressive nature of his underlying malignancy, family meetings were held and the decision was made for the patient to be DNR/DNI.
Extended family gathered at the patient's bedside and he died without pain on [**2144-11-13**].
# Septic shock: Patient initially hypotensive, concerning for sepsis due to pulmonary infection, also complicated by hypovolemia as patient was not taking adequate oral intake at home.
CXR showed new multifocal pneumonia, and so broad spectrium antibiotics were initiated (vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime).
# Rectal CA: KRAS wild-type, metastatic disease with mets to brain and bone.
Per recent d/c summary, poor performance status has prohibited him from continuing chemotherapy.
# Seizure history: No seizures since end of [**Month (only) 359**], time of last dose increase.
CT head in ED showed unchanged vasogenic edema surrounding metastatic disease.
# Anemia: Unclear cause, though likely anemia of chronic dz.
Stable to slightly elevated above baseline, likely hemoconcentrated.
Labs were significant for low reticulocyte count, suggesting bone marrow failure.
# Pain control: Patient was continued on home methadone and hydromorphone prn as needed for pain control.
