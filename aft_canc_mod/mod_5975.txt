Admission Date:  [**2129-7-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-7-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: [**Doctor First Name **]  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Increased lower extremity edema and change in mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is an 84 yo female with a history of dementia, htn, hypothyroidism, TIA ([**9-1**]) who is being transferred to the CCU for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
She presented from a long term care facility with increased confusion and new lower extremity edema.
Her daugheter expressed that her mother had decreased appetite and confusion over the last 10 days.
However, she became increasingly confused and unable to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
A CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions L>R and moderate pulmonary edema.
Cardiology was consulted and felt this troponin bump most likely attributed to heart failure rather than ACS.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient had a 4 L O2 requirement and appeared volume overloaded.
There was suspicion for pulmonary embolism as a cause of her hypoxia.
CT for PE could not be done secondary to poor renal function.
Echocardiocardiogram was done to evaluate for signs of R heart strain, and indeed demonstrated severe RV dilatation and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume overload new compared to prior echo 10/[**2127**].
Small pericardial effusion was also noted.
[**Hospital 75195**] transfer to the CCU was initiated for workup of new RV dilatation, apparent R sided heart failure, further diuresis in the setting of borderline hypotension and preload dependence, and altered mental status.
She denied any difficulty breathing or chest pain.
She further denied nausea or abdominal pain.

Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Findings are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested for possible right ventricular overload.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Severe right ventricular dilation.
Abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-9-20**], severe right ventircular dilation is now present.
The right ventricle appears to have been mild to moderately dilated on prior study, but views were limited.
CXR [**2129-7-19**]: AP chest compared to [**7-19**], 3:46 a.m., heterogeneous bibasilar opacification has worsened.
In the setting of progressive moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and upper lobe vascular engorgement, this is most readily explained by dependent pulmonary edema, but pneumonia particularly aspiration could be contributing.
Bilateral pleural effusion is at least small.
Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet developed since [**2128-8-25**] could be due to progressive tortuosity of the innominate artery or interval development of a space-occupying lesion, most commonly a goiter but not necessarily benign.
CXR [**2129-7-20**]: Opacification at the lung bases is improving and moderate cardiomegaly may have improved as well all pointing toward decreasing cardiac decompensation and improving pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist left greater than right.
The greater extent of opacification at the left lung base makes pneumonia a possibility.
Leftward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet points to a space occupying lesion such as a goiter, but requires evaluation since this is a new finding since [**2128-8-25**].
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
CTA Chest [**2129-7-21**]: Dilatation of the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery with filling defect in the main pulmonary artery which extends into the left pulmonary arteries.
There is also bowing of the interventricular septum suggesting right heart strain.
This filling defect in the pulmonary artery could represent a saddle embolism, however, due to the increased density of contrast and early bolus timing, mixing artifact in the pulmonary artery should also be considered.
The case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a decision to anticoagulate and repeat the study at a later date was planned due to elevated creatinine.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo female with dementia (AAO x [**11-26**]), CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**1-2**], TIA in [**9-1**], hypothyroidism, stable meningioma p/w increased lethargy, weight gain, and LE edema, hypoxic to 94% 4L on presentation found to be in acute right sided diastolic failure secondary to pulmonary embolism.
Acute diastolic right heart failure: On [**Name (NI) **], pt with severe RV dilatation new since [**9-1**], at least borderline PA systolic HTN, and nl LVEF.
LENIs negative and subsequent CTA equivocal (saddle-embolic v. mixing artifact w/ suboptimal study) but submassive-massive subacute PE most likely etiology of RV failure; LV failure may have been due to RV impingement of LV filling.
She will likely require at least a one-year course of anticoagulation given her degree of cardiac impairment, with the duration to be weighed against the risk of bleed.
Left heart failure: Pt fluid overloaded on presentation.
[**Month/Day (3) **] showed nl EF although some degree of diastolic dysfunction was suspected.
It was postulated that RV dilatation have been impinging on LV filling and forward flow due to the septal wall motion abnormality observed.
Pt was transferred to CCU initially as she became hemodynamically unstable in the setting of diuresis, likely due to her preload dependence.
Patient did have some desaturation to 80s% during night, possibly OSA, but CPAP would not be tolerated due to her dementia.
Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9.
This was thought secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of consciousness on admission as well as intermittent disorientation.
This was likely secondary to medication effect from ativan and haldol received in the ED as well as due to acute illness including hypoxia and hypotension.
CT head negative; urine culture negative, and blood cultures with no growth; TFTs nl; electrolytes nl; BUN elevated but not frankly uremic level.
She did have several nights of agitation requiring soft restraints and IV Haldol, but 2 nights before discharge, patient slept through the night and did not require chemical or mechanical restraints.
Possibly secondary to worsening dementia vs. subacute medical illness.
As mentioned above her Remeron was held since it was thought to possibly be contributing to her change in mental status.
A speech and swallow consult was sought since patient has dementia and is at risk for aspiration.
She also had been noted to have asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia to 30s in the past which were also observed on this admission.
For these reasons, her metoprolol was once again discontinued on this admission.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: [**4-8**] ml PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Massive pulmonary embolism - Acute diastolic heart failure - Non-thrombotic troponin elevation - Acute renal failure - Delirium  Secondary diagnosis: - Hypothyroidism - Hypertension - Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with increased lower extremity swelling, increased weakness, weight gain, and decreased oxygenation.
You were found to have a clot in your lung that was responsible for fluid overload.
- You need to take furosemide (Lasix) to prevent fluid buildup.
- Please stop taking your metoprolol due to slow heart rate.
- Please stop taking your Remeron due to leading to increased sleepiness.
Please call your primary care physician or return to the hospital if you experience any increased shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, lower extremity swelling, if you gain more than 3 lbs, or for any other concerning symptoms.
