HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 4469**], twin number two, [**Known lastname 2795**] is  the former 1025 gram 26-6/7-weeks twin admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit secondary to prematurity and respiratory distress.
Pregnancy notable for diamniotic-dichorionic IVF twins, via donor egg secondary to ovarian failure.
Pregnancy complicated by:  1) Bed rest at 21 weeks, 2) admitted with question of rupture of membranes, testing negative, placed on terbutaline, 3) betamethasone complete [**9-4**], and 4) preterm contractions treated with magnesium sulfate.
Mother developed signs of chorioamnionitis with fever to 102.6 on the day of delivery, prompting treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin, and Vancomycin initiated greater than four hours prior to delivery, and c-section for vertex/transverse lie.
This infant emerged with a heart rate less than 100 and poor respiratory effort, requiring PPV.
Apgars were [**7-8**], and he was intubated in the delivery room for respiratory distress.
Maternal history is remarkable for depression and anxiety and hypothyroidism on Prozac, Klonopin, and Synthroid.
Coarse breath sounds, no murmur.
Three-vessel cord, no hepatosplenomegaly.
No hip click, no sacral dimple.
He was subsequently able to be weaned off of oxygen by day of life 65, and he has remained in room air with intermittent mild retractions since that time.
Baby was started on caffeine citrate for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity on day of life 10, which he remained on until day of life 52 (34-2/7 weeks gestation).
Baby has had no apnea and bradycardia for several weeks.
He does have an occasional desaturation with feeding.
Cardiovascular:  Baby exhibited signs of a patent ductus arteriosus, and received one course of indomethacin on days one to two.
He then had symptoms that persisted and had an echocardiogram on day of life four, which showed a moderate PDA.
He received a second course of indomethacin, and then had a repeat echocardiogram on [**10-4**], which showed no PDA.
He has had no further issues cardiovascularly.
On day of life 11, he had a Broviac inserted in the operating room at the [**Hospital3 18242**] secondary to difficulties with access.
He was initially maintained NPO and on PN secondary to issues with his PDA and treatment with indomethacin, and was begun on enteral feedings on day of life 13.
GI:  Baby had physiologic jaundice requiring phototherapy.
All have been within normal limits with no intraventricular hemorrhage and no periventricular leukomalacia.
Infectious disease:  Because of extreme prematurity, concern for chorioamnionitis,  baby had an initial blood culture and CBC sent.
On day of life 26, baby had increased in apnea and bradycardia while on CPAP.
He had another sepsis evaluation done.
At that time, he did not exhibit any other symptoms, but continued to have increased spells.
His blood culture from [**10-23**] grew out gram-positive cocci, which ultimately was ID'd as coag- negative Staph.
Baby has had no further issues with infection.
Integumentary:  Baby has a small hemangioma on his back and a nevus simplex on his neck.
He was first noted to have retinopathy of prematurity on [**11-22**], with exam showing Stage 1, zone 2 retinopathy in the right.
Next exam also showed ROP on left eye, and last exam on [**2164-12-5**] showed Stage I retinopathy in Zone II bilaterally, 6 o'clock hours on the right and 5 o'clock hours on the left, with plan to repeat in two weeks.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following: daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings, or 3.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Chronic lung disease.
Status post presumed sepsis of coag-negative Staph bacteremia.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
