The patient was transferred to the Medicine Service from the Orthopedics Service because of postoperative diarrhea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection one year ago, inferior vena cava thrombosis secondary to his carcinoma who was initially admitted to the Orthopedic Service of [**Hospital1 69**] for surgical evaluation of his T10 lytic lesion and mild to moderate cord compression.
The patient had presented on [**2186-2-21**], to [**Hospital3 4527**] Medical Center with the complaints of right leg numbness and left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
He had no other symptoms such as bowel or bladder dysfunction or diarrhea and incidentally was found to have a T10 lytic lesion on the CT scan done to evaluate his abdominal pain.
The patient was started on Decadron for his mild to moderate cord compression and went to the Operating Room after his Coumadin was reversed with fresh frozen plasma for attempted tumor debulking and vertebral stabilization procedures.
The patient then spent some time in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on clindamycin postoperatively and had an MRI guided embolization procedure of the T10 intercostal artery to attempt a reduction in blood loss for future planned surgeries and spinal stabilization.
It was thought that his large blood loss was due to large network of intercostal and thoracic collaterals that had occurred secondary to his inferior vena cava thrombus.
Two days later he began to develop profuse watery diarrhea and nausea.
He had no other symptoms of fever or chills at that time.
Hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection in [**2185-2-21**].
Inferior vena cava thrombosis thought secondary to initial compression of the IVC by tumor.
Chronic pleural effusion status post pleurodesis in [**2185-5-23**].
Pleural biopsy showing granulomatous disease but no metastatic disease of the pleura or lungs.
Hepatic adenoma resected ten years ago which was incidentally found on CT scan after a motor vehicle accident.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco, alcohol, drug or steroid use.
General:  Pleasant obese male in no acute distress.
Some slight white plaques on the tongue and soft palate.
No rubs, gallops or murmurs.
Abdomen obese, soft, mildly distended.
Mild tenderness bilateral lower quadrants with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Trace edema bilateral lower extremities with V-boots.
RADIOLOGY:  MRI of the spine done [**2186-2-23**]:  There is a lesion within the posterior portion of the vertebral body at T10 with epidural tumor causing mild to moderate cord compression with evidence of abnormal signal intensity in the spinal cord at this level.
Chest x-ray on [**2186-3-3**] showed low lung volumes but no obvious congestive heart failure.
CT of the abdomen done [**2-10**] showed no evidence of recurrent hepatoma and stable right pleural-based nodules with no _______ of subcutaneous varices and a thrombosed infrarenal IVC.
This is a 38-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection one year ago, inferior vena cava thrombosis, who was admitted with T10 lytic lesion with mild to moderate spinal cord compression by soft tissue mass status post spinal column stabilization by Orthopedic Surgery complicated by large blood loss transferred to the Medicine Service for management of profuse watery diarrhea.
Stool electrolytes were obtained which showed that the patient had a stool osmolar gap of less than 50 consistent with a secretory diarrhea which could be secondary to Clostridium difficile or perineoplastic syndrome from his hepatocellular carcinoma.
At the current time the patient has passed three loose bowel movements over the past 24 hours of much decreased volume.
T10 lesion/spinal cord compression:  The patient was admitted initially for management of his spinal cord compression from T10 soft tissue mass.
Because of the initial large blood loss in his surgery, a resection of the mass could not be performed on his initial surgery and his spinal column was fused and reinforced with metal rods.
The patient remained stable from this point of view postoperatively, however, he began to develop bilateral extensor tone on his lower extremities and this was later accompanied by bilateral lower extremity paralysis of the hamstrings and calves.
A Neurology consult was obtained that felt that this constellation of neurologic deficits was consistent with upper motor neuron disease consistent with spinal cord compression.
The patient underwent radiation therapy times one of his mass at T10.
The following day he returned to the Operating Room, on [**2186-3-14**], for tumor debulking and widening of the spinal canal.
He does have intact joint position sense and gross touch of his bilateral lower extremities.
His legs have extensor tone with locked quads in both legs at this time.
Ileus:  Concomitant with his diarrhea the patient also developed an ileus.
His abdomen was distended and he had dilated loops of both small and large bowel on KUB and abdominal CT scan.
There was no evidence for bowel obstruction or colitis on these studies and no free air.
He was encouraged to get out of bed to chair with the help of Physical Therapy at least once a day, to decrease his narcotic analgesic at this time.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Because of his large secretory diarrhea, Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] has had large potassium and magnesium losses in his stool.
Nutrition:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] was placed on TPN after being NPO for six days while having his diarrhea and ileus.
His anticoagulation is currently being held at this time secondary to his large blood losses during surgery and hematoma that is seen on the latest CT scan.
Pleural effusions:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] has a history of developing pleural effusions status post his liver resection one year ago.
After a large workup by the Interventional Pulmonary Service at that time, it was found that the patient did not have evidence of metastatic or neoplastic disease, however, his effusions were exudative and pleural biopsies showed granulomatous disease of the pleura.
Currently he also has small bilateral effusions that are not compromising his oxygen saturations.
Hypertension:  Previously Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] was on nadolol for his high blood pressure.
A question of whether there are other metastatic foci at this time.
Currently he has no evidence for recurrence of his hepatocellular carcinoma in his liver by CT scan.
Panniculitis:  This was seen incidentally on his CT scan of his right superficial abdominal wall.
He has currently no evidence for infection or large inflammation at this time and we are turning the patient frequently throughout the day to decrease him lying on one side.
Urinary tract infection:  The patient developed a urinary tract infection with Klebsiella oxytoca and E. coli in the setting of a Foley catheter.
Hematologic:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] had large volume blood loss of 20 units during his initial surgeries and had transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets as well.
He has a history of thrombocytopenia in the setting of some mild portal hypertension status post his caudate liver resection.
