The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-6-5**], at which time RV biopsy demonstrated cardiac amyloidosis, as well as a bone marrow biopsy with e/o multiple myeloma.
ECHO showed e/o new systolic heart failure on top of preexisting diastolic heart failure and is s/p cardiac catheterization with e/o 50% left main disease, 50% LAD stenosis.
Since discharge, the patient reports weight gain, as well as DOE.
He denies orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He waited until he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2178-7-22**] where he was noted to have elevated JVD and 3+ LE edema.
When he initially presented to [**Hospital1 **], the patient was noted to have change in mental status that was attributed to uremia, [**Last Name (un) **], and medication side effect from torsemide.
His CXR showed recurrent right pleural effusion.
He was treated for acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure with IV lasix but of note this was limited by his BP's.
While on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was being diuresed on Lasix drip 30 mg/hour, with diuresis limited by increasing creatinine.
The patient also has an element of systolic failure, which could also be improved with milronone.

Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Old inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-8-22**] no significant changes are noted.
However, the lung volumes have decreased and a small pleural effusion is unchanged at the right lung base.
Right pleural effusion and trace of ascites seen in the right upper quadrant.
Arterial and venous flow is documented within each of the kidneys, however, further Doppler analysis cannot be performed as the patient is unable to hold his breath.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 109642**] is 77M with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, systolic and diastolic heart failure, cardiac amylodosis, and multiple myeloma who initially presented from OSH with weight gain and need aggressive IV diuresis, requiring CCU admission for initiation of milrinone drip.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Patient with baseline restrictive disease secondary to his cardiac amyloid.
He presented with diffuse peripheral edema, worsening abdominal distention and JVP elevated to 12 cm, consistent with right sided failure.
He also presented with right pleural effusion that represented transudate [**3-12**] CHF.
He was then transferred to the ICU for diuresis with milrinone for inotropic effect and pulomary vasodilation allowing right sided unloading.
He was also continued spironolactone and torsemide after period of autodiuresis from [**Last Name (un) **] ended.
He was counseled on the importance of daily weights and CHF management.
Nephrology was consulted and felt this was likely ATN vs pre-renal due to hypoperfusion.
It was unlikely a sequelae of MM or amyloid as no protein was found in the urine.
Community Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt developed cough and leukocytosis with CXR findings of right upper lobe infiltrate.
# Cardiac amyloidosis with restrictive myopathy: The patient has history of cardiac amyloidosis confirmed on RV biopsy, and has resulting restrictive heart disease, with subsequent R sided dilation and R sided heart failure as above.
# Multiple Myeloma: During his last admission, patient was found to have a monoclonal kappa band and severe hypogammaglobulinemia on SPEP/UPEP.
He underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed 40% plasma cells.
Abdominal fat pad biopsy both performed [**5-28**], revealed no amyloid but RV cardiac biopsy was positive for amyloid.
# Coronaries: The patient has history of 3VD s/p NSTEMI during his last admission.
It was decided that the patient was too high risk for CABG, as well as PCI given his amyloidosis and was discharge on medical management of his CAD.
# Afib: Stable.
He was continued on coumadin for goal INR of 2.0-2.5 given for increased risk of bleeding with amyloid.
# BPH: stable, continued doxazosin .
# DEPRESSION/sleep: stable, continued amitriptyline, zolpidem.
