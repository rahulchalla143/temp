Pertinent Results: [**2139-7-8**]: WBC 6.6, HCT 13, PLT 324, MCV 101 Na 138, K 4.8, Cl 104, Bicarb 21, BUN 116, Cr 5.1, Gluc 107 Ca [**39**].3, Mg 2.2, P 4.6 PT 19.5, PTT 29.1, INR 1.8  [**2139-7-14**] WBC-7.2 Hct-32.3* MCV-91 Plt Ct-143*  [**2139-7-15**] Hct-32.6* Glu-85 UreaN-38* Cr-2.5* Na-137 K-4.2 Cl-104 HCO3-21*  EKG: Afib @ 95 bpm, normal axis, normal interval, TWI II, III, AVF, new ST depressions V4-V6  CXR [**2139-7-8**]: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
No definite evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms, given semi-upright study.
Bicap was applied over the bleeding AVMs and hemostasis achieved.
Internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old lady with DM2, Afib on Coumadin, HTN, HL, CKD(baseline Cr 2.8-3.5) anemia (baseline HCT 25) and prior lower gastrointestinal bleeds who presented from home with weakness and was found to be profoundly anemic in the ED, with HCT of 13.
LOWER GI BLEED [**3-17**] bleeding AVMs in colon: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with weakness, maroon stools and HCT 13, which was concerning for GI Bleed.
The most likely source of her LGIB was diverticular bleed and also on the differential are arteriovenous malformations.
Per report from GI fellow and ED resident, she had guiac positive maroon stools with fresh clot on presentation.
She required a total of 7unts of PRBC over 48 hours given tachycardia and continued maroon stools.
Her tachycardia resolved and her hct stabalized out.
In the ICU she continued to have some bloody bowel movements but was otherwise stabe and so transferred to the medical floor.
Endoscopies were performed and found bleeding AVMs.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ON COUMADIN/EKG CHANGES: Pt's INR  was 1.8 on admission and she received Vit K 10mg IV x 1 and 2u FFP.
Her baseline ECG had some ST depressions which were more pronounced in the setting of tachycardia and GI bleed.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt was normoglycemic on admission labs.
PCP to increase dose as needed for optimal control.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Baseline creatinine appears to be ~3.0.
Perfusion-related renal injury given significant anemia seems most likely.
HYPERTENSION: pt has hx hypertension but was hypotensive (relative to her baseline) in the ICU, likely in the setting of volume depletion from blood loss.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: - Lower gastrointestinal bleeding, from arteriovenous malformations - Anemia, severe, from acute blood loss and chronic kidney disease  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: - Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Atrial fibrillation - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Chronic kidney disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] with a lower gastrointestinal bleed and a critically low hematocrit of 13.
Active bleeding was seen in the colon from what is called an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) and were stopped.
