Admission Date:  [**2105-5-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-6-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-4-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC  History of Present Illness: 70 yo male with CMML who just completed Etoposide ([**Date range (3) 50989**]) who presented to Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic today for blood transfusion and following transfusion developed fever and acute onset of shortness of breath.
The patient states that he has been getting more short of breath over the last few days.
He became very SOB after taking only a few steps in the clinic today.
He also notes decreased appetite and progressive weight loss.
Oncologic history: [**9-/2103**] presented to his PCP's office with a several-month history of diminished appetite and a 1-week history of intermittent chest pain.
His PCP recommended further evaluation at the [**Hospital6 3105**] Emergency [**Hospital1 **] where the patient was subsequently admitted for a questionable diagnosis of pleurisy.
Blood work at the time of the admission revealed leukocytosis and anemia.
A chest x-ray allegedly showed a left upper lobe lesion, and this was confirmed on chest CT.
There was no accompanying adenopathy in the lung.
Notation was made on abdominal and pelvic CT of splenomegaly and a question of prostate cancer.
It revealed a myeloproliferative disorder consistent with CML.
Cytogenetic negative for BCR-ABL rearrangement.
The patient's white blood cell count allegedly declined with the addition of Hydrea to 19,000.
Patient underwent bone marrow aspirate/biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] [**12/2103**] which showed hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia and left-shifted granulopoiesis, consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Flow cytometry was also consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Significant for scarlet fever at age 4.
Removal of 2 lesions, one on the patient's face, which was most likely consistent with actinic keratoses, and one on the patient's anterior chest wall consistent with a likely dysplastic nevus.
Oropharynx with one small superficial buccal ulceration, no exudates, thrush, or petechiae.
NODES: There are no palpable cervical, supraclavicular lymph nodes.
Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: * WBC-.3* RBC-2.30* HGB-7.0* HCT-19.9* MCV-87 MCH-30.6 MCHC-35.3* RDW-14.7 PLT SMR-RARE PLT COUNT-<5* * DIFF: NEUTS-80* BANDS-4 LYMPHS-0 MONOS-16* EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 * LFTs: ALT(SGPT)-58* AST(SGOT)-18 LD(LDH)-102 ALK PHOS-56 TOT BILI-1.1 DIR BILI-0.5* INDIR BIL-0.6 * CHEM: ALBUMIN-2.4 CALCIUM-7.8* MAGNESIUM-1.8 GLUCOSE-138* UREA N-45* CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-11 * Radiologic Studies: CT abd- 1) New heterogenously diffuse low attenuation throughout the spleen, which is suggestive of a major splenic infarction in the interval.
No definite intravascular thrombus is identified within the splenic artery or vein.
2) Dramatic increase in intra-abdominal and intrapelvic ascites in the short interval since the prior exam.
3) Essentially unchanged appearance of the colon extending to the rectum showing bowel wall thickening and edema consistent with the patient's history of Clostridium difficile colitis.
*   Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo male with CMML admitted from clinic with neutropenic fever after blood transfusion.
He subsequently developed major splenic infarction, of uncertain etiology, requiring ICU monitoring.
Splenic Infarction: Mr. [**Known lastname 20622**] developed a major splenic infarction of unclear etiology.
Potential etiologies included his underlying CMML vs infectious (+AFB fungemia) vs embolic/thrombotic (DIC vs HIT).
In addition he was treated empirically for his AFB + fungemia with INH/Rifampin/Ethambutol/Pyrazinamide and erythromycin.
It was felt that systemic [**Doctor First Name **] infection could be consistent with this picture.
Heparin was held over concern for HIT (although his low plts were felt most likely in setting of consumption from splenomegaly + productive deficit from recent chemotherapy).
The patient was managed medically with antibiotics and transfusions prn, however he continued to decline clinically and complained of increasing pain in his abdomen.
Pain was controlled with IV morphine as needed, and the patient died on [**6-11**].
Fever and Neutropenia: The differential included transfusion reaction vs. infectious cause of neutropenic fever.
The patient was started on empiric treatment with Cefepime for neutropenic fever.
CXR was also negative for infiltrate.
On [**5-31**] stool came back positive for c diff.
Cefepime was continued because of neutropenia.
KUB and CT of the abdomen revealed changes consistent with c.diff infection.
Patient continued to have profuse diarrhea with 6-9 bowel movements a day.
On [**6-7**] the CT scan of the abdomen was repeated because the patient had worsening of his abdominal exam and showed unchanged appearance of the colon.
However, interval development of major splenic infarction was seen (see below).
Pancytopenia/Anemia - Finished Etoposide [**2105-5-27**].
His white count recovered on [**6-7**] but he remained transfusion dependent for plts and pRBCs.
He then was transfused an additional unit of pRBC's, 2units of FFP and a unit of plts in the ICU prior to changing goals of care to comfort measures only.
Tachycardia - Sinus.
Most likely [**3-11**] fever, pain and/or anemia.
EKG w/o signs of R heart strain.
Hydrea 500 mg qod was discontinued due to pancytopenia.
RLE erythema: Calf mass was noted on [**5-30**].
RLE US was negative for DVT.
The erythema within the calf gradually resolved.
This was presumed to be a spontaneous intramuscular hemorrhage.
