female with pertinent history of MDS x 2 years, chronic anemia requiring blood transfusions (last transfusion 1 wk prior to admission), and recent admission for melanotic stools w/ neg GI workup.
Pt was recently discharged [**9-16**] from [**Hospital1 **] following admission for GIB, and subsequent stabilization w/o intervention.
Following discharge reports that she was feeling tired and weak, with decreased appetite.
+for black, tarry stools (states she has had this intermittently x 6-8 weeks).
No abdominal pain.
She had been on Cipro for treatment of asymptomatic UTI x 1day which was changed on hospital day 2 to Cefepime since she was considered to be functionally neutropenic with an ANC of 320 and declining.
She was seen in the unit by GI who performed a push enteroscopy on [**9-27**] despite recent negative EGD and found no source of bleeding to mid jejunum.
She continued to have melenic stools but vitals remained stable.
Despite having no previous cardiac history, she also developed a mild troponin leak that peaked at 1.04 and CK's of 160's with 17MB.
She was never symptomatic and was treated medically with aspirin and B-blocker.
In total she was transfused another 4 units PRBC's with appropriate increase in Hct from 17.4-29.3, which has been stable for the last 12 hours    Past Medical History: 1) MDS-evaluated [**1-22**] for anemia leukopenia and fatigue seen by DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] with bone bx=nondiagnostic.
Pt had moderate response to procrit.
in [**2-24**] pt developed more profound anemia and at that point developed guaiac positive stools and has required occasional transfusion.
2) Melena/guaiac positive stools, s/p workup positive only for ileal diverticulosis.
[**6-18**] Colonoscopy- Diverticulosis of the entire colon Otherwise normal Colonoscopy to cecum [**6-18**] EGD- Normal EGD to second part of the duodenum [**6-28**] SBFT Ileodiverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
No source of bleeding identified within the small bowel.
Small non bleeding ileal diverticulum 3.
No site of GI bleding  3) Osteoarthritis 4) diphtheria in [**2115**] treated with penicillin 5) repeatedly positive PPD due to work-related TB exposures and negative CXR (per pt's report) 6) a CVA in [**2159**] that led to right-sided hemiparesis (minimal residual) and increased distractibility 7) a fall in [**2168-11-2**] that caused a right wrist fracture 8) hypothyroidism 9) history of cystitis 10) cataracts 11) HTN 12) hypercholesterolemia 13) back pain 14) hip fx, s/p surgery [**9-25**]   Social History: Pt lives alone in senior living facility.
1 brother died of colon CA, and one sister also died of colon CA.
Her mother died in her late 60s from CAD and obesity.
Diffuse white lesions of tongue.
no m/r/g LCA b/l +bs.
No le edema.
[**Name (NI) 4056**] Pt has undergone extensive endoscopic workup which has all been negative, although she continued to have melenic stools now with no BM x 5d.
Difficult to assess what proportion of anemia is due to GIB versus progressoin of her MDS.
Elevated troponin- Pt small troponin leak with ST depressions on ECG consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.
ECG changes now resolved and planned to transfuse as above and medically manage with B-Blocker but hold on ASA due to bleeding risk.
UTI- although asymptomatic and afebrile, pt is neutropenic and was being treated more aggressively as neutropenic fever with Cefepime 2g IV q8h day discontinued [**9-30**] since UA clear.
Decline coincides with starting Cefepime and metoprolol although leukopenia is no a major SE of these meds.
