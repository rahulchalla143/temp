History of Present Illness: 78-year-old man with h/o recent relapse of pre-B cell ALL with chemotherapy currently on hold for newly diagnosed metastatic epitheloid rhabdomyosarcoma with diffuse mets including extensive pulmonary involvement and bilateral malignant effusions; s/p palliative XRT to para-aortic and psoas masses.
ChemoTx was tolerated well but pt had increased dyspnea that admission with restaging CT showing marked progression of his sarcoma with liver, pulmonary, adrenal, psoas, and peritoneal mets with bilateral pleural effusions.
He was diuresed and had IP drainage with 1.2L removed from each side, both positive for malignant cells.
He had subjective improvement in SOB but continued need for NC, unclear amt.
Also that admission, CT showed splenic and portal vein thrombosis and he was started on Lovenox but was actually held at the time of discharge due to thrombocytopenia.
He then had a clinic appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] today and noted to have low bp's to 80/40's and hypoxic to 80% on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] sent to the ED.
ROS on arrival with decreased energy, orthostatic changes in his blood pressures, and "decreased oxygen levels" since XRT which ended 2 wks ago.
Endorses abd pain x3 mos, decreased appetite, and inability to take good PO's.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: # Metastatic epitheloid rhabdomyosarcoma: Diagnosed [**8-/2183**], s/p  XRT to retroperitoneal mass and psoas muscle.
PET-CT on [**2183-8-30**], which showed FDG avidity in the periaortic mass as well as lesions in the left psoas muscle, a left peritoneal implant, a 4-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule, and osseous lesions in the left iliac bone, right and left proximal femurs, and S1 vertebra.
MRI of the L-spine on [**2183-8-25**] also showed a lesion in L3.
Biopsy of the psoas muscle nodule [**2183-9-2**] was consistent with epithelioid rhabdomyosarcoma [**9-/2183**]: admitted for palliative chemoTx and found to have malignant bilateral pleural effusions # ALL: - diagnosed with Ph-negative pre-B-cell ALL in [**2178**].
Chemo course was complicated by bladder obstruction related to MTX and two hospitalizations for PNA.
- in [**9-/2182**], had evidence of relapse and was admitted for reinduction.
Treated again per the [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol with treatment being held during the prolonged maintenence phase when  he was discovered to have an abdominal mass consistent with a metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.
- his leukemia therapy has been held and he is currently under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] for sarcoma.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD s/p cath in [**2170**], preserved EF 55% with low normal systolic function Hyperlipidemia Squamous cell skin cancer s/p multiple excisions Hyperplastic colon polyp, [**2176**]  Social History: Never smoked.
Family History: Brother had CAD and lung disease.
A maternal uncle died of an MI at 54 years.
Mouth is extremely dry appearing but no thrush noted No JVD noted Lungs fairly CTAB without gross w/c/r/r, but with only fair to poor air movement RRR with no m/g appreciated, bilateral radial pulses not well palpated.
Diffuse TTP of abdomen periumbilical, but is soft, ND, BS+ No BLE edema noted, BUE's with eccymoses, and PIV in L arm CN 2-12 grossly intact, no focal deficits noted, mental status is conversant and grossly without deficit   Pertinent Results: Labs at Admission:  [**2183-10-27**] 05:57PM BLOOD WBC-0.9* RBC-3.34* Hgb-11.0* Hct-30.9* MCV-93 MCH-33.0* MCHC-35.7* RDW-14.1 Plt Ct-48* [**2183-10-27**] 05:57PM BLOOD Neuts-43* Bands-0 Lymphs-33 Monos-13* Eos-9* Baso-1 Atyps-1* Metas-0 Myelos-0 [**2183-10-27**] 05:57PM BLOOD PT-14.0* PTT-27.4 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2183-10-27**] 01:15PM BLOOD Glucose-124* UreaN-29* Creat-0.8 Na-134 K-4.9 Cl-99 HCO3-23 AnGap-17 [**2183-10-27**] 01:15PM BLOOD ALT-15 AST-29 AlkPhos-69 TotBili-0.7 [**2183-10-27**] 01:15PM BLOOD Lipase-14 [**2183-10-27**] 01:15PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2183-10-27**] 01:15PM BLOOD Albumin-2.8* Calcium-8.6 Phos-4.2 Mg-2.2 [**2183-10-28**] 03:24AM BLOOD Cortsol-26.6* [**2183-10-27**] 01:22PM BLOOD Lactate-5.6*  Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a 78-year-old man with h/o pre-B cell ALL with (chemo on hold), newly diagnosed widely metastatic epitheloid rhabdomyosarcoma with mets to liver, pulmonary, adrenal, psoas, and peritoneal mets with bilateral pleural effusions who presents with hypoxia and hypotension.
Hypotension/tachycardia: Felt to be secondary to volume depletion and hemodynamic compromise from his disease progression.
He remained tachycardic even after fluid boluses.
Chest x-ray showed extensive involvement of tumor and bilateral pleural effusions, but no clear infiltrate to suggest pneumonia.
He has an impressive CXR with extensive pulmonary metastatic disease with "innumerable" pulmonary nodules, and recently had 1.2L drained from each side.
DDx included worsening of metastatic disease vs re-accumulation of pleural effusions which appeared possible by CXR vs PNA vs PE given pt not currently on anticoagulation.
CTA was not pursued because patient would not have been a candidate for anticoagulation due to sanguinous pleural effusions.
His air hunger was treated with morphine and ativan which his blood pressure tolerated, as well as continued drainage of his pleural effusion via his pleurex catheter.
Splenic and portal vein thrombosis: Anticoagulation with Lovenox was deferred  due to thrombocytopenia.
Widely metastatic epitheloid rhabdomyosarcoma: S/p 1st cycle ([**10-20**] = day 1) of vincristine and cyclophosphamide.
Pancytopenia: Felt due to chemotherapy, given counts have dropped since pt started chemo on [**10-20**].
