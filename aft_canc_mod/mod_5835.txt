Past Medical History: - cholangiocarcinoma being followed up by oncology - coronary artery disease status post PTCA and 3 stent placements - hypertension - h/o cholangitis [**2116-5-17**] - ERCP in [**3-/2116**], [**4-/2116**], [**5-/2116**] - osteoarthritis - s/p colon resection - depression - bilateral total knee replacement - benign prostatic hypertrophy - Parkinson's disease - REM behavior disorder - obstructive sleep apnea - periodic limb movements - excessive daytime sleepiness - Lumbar spinal stenosis - s/p verterbroplasty [**2-23**]  Social History: no alcohol or drug use.
His father died of a coronary artery disease.
No definite consolidation or superimposed edema is identified.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Limited imaging in the included upper abdomen reveals the tips and numerous clips in the epigastric region.
No definite focal consolidation or infiltrate noted.
AP ABDOMEN 5:10 A.M. [**4-4**] HISTORY: Cholangiocarcinoma, upper GI bleed, aspiration pneumonia.
Rule out perforation or obstruction.
IMPRESSION: Supine view of the entire abdomen and upright view of the upper abdomen show no evidence of intestinal obstruction or perforation.
There has been an intervening cementoplasty in the lower lumbar spine.
More spinal degenerative osteophyte formation and mild derangement has developed.
Brief Hospital Course: 86M w/ cholangiocarcinoma s/p metal biliary stenting, now with hematemesis and likely aspiration pneumonia .
# Acute blood loss anemia with upper GI source.
# shock: hypovolemia from GI bleeding vs sepsis from asp pneumonia.
Broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for aspiration pneumonia were administered.
A cosyntropin stim test showed relative adrenal insufficiency, so stress dose hydrocortisone was administered.
# Respiratory failure: history of developing respiratory failure after hematemesis suggests aspiration of bloody gastric contents, although admission cxr not impressive for pna.
Empirically treated for aspiration/community acquired pathogens with vanc/levo/flagyl.
Pt initially had acute respiratory acidosis and a large A-a gradient; consistent with aspiration, but during the 12 hour period after admission, lactic acidosis developed and worsened despite treatment of septic shock.
PE was considered, given the large A-a gradient, but the patient's active GI bleeding precluded anticoagulation.
# CAD: positive troponins at OSH, negative when repeated here at [**Hospital1 **].
# Parkinson's disease: continue outpt sinemet  # Depression: continue home regimen of bupropion, methylphenidate  # Goals of Care: DNR, discussed with daughter/HCP on admission.
As the patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate despite aggressive medical supports, the family, after consultation with the MICU team and the GI consult team, decided that Mr [**Known lastname **] would prefer to be made comfortable rather to undergo further invasive procedures with a low likelihood of benefit in terms of survival and quality of life if he did survive.
