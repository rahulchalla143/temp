The patient does report black stool with constipation as well, but she is on iron therapy.
She denies any change in bowel habits.
At the rehabilitation facility, the patient's initial vital signs were stable but subsequent hypotension developed to a blood pressure of 80/56 with a heart rate of 132.
In the Emergency Department, a nasogastric lavage revealed frank blood changing to a fruit-punch color with no clearing of bleeding after two liters of fluid.
Gastric adenocarcinoma (poorly differentiated); diagnosed in [**2105-7-17**].
(a)  The patient received no chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical intervention.
Rheumatoid arthritis (on chronic prednisone).
Aortic stenosis (with a valve area of 0.9 cm2 and an ejection fraction of 65% on an echocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1129**]).
Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy secondary to cholecystitis.
Chronic lower extremity ulcerations.
Status post colonoscopy in [**2105-7-17**] (done at [**Hospital6 1129**]) which showed diffuse "small/mild diverticula."
She has been there for seven weeks for physical therapy and treatment of her lower extremity ulcerations.
CODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate/do not intubate but wishes for aggressive treatment.
In general, the patient was a comfortable elderly woman in no acute distress.
Jugular venous pulsation was flat.
No bruits or radiation of murmurs.
No wheezes or crackles.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur heard everywhere.
The patient was tachycardic but regular.
Extremity examination revealed ulnar deviation of the bilateral digits.
Mildly tenderness to palpation.
The patient had chronic superficial lower extremity ulcerations which did not appear erythematous or purulent.
The patient did have tenderness around the ulcerations.
Rectal examination revealed the patient was guaiac-positive with brown/hard stool.
No focal deficits.
Skin examination revealed no rashes.
There were bilateral lower extremity ulcerations.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at a rate of 104.
A computerized axial tomography of the chest done in [**2105-7-17**] (per [**Hospital6 1129**] report) revealed a dilated pulmonary artery and small bilateral pleural effusions, with no metastases.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy report commented on blood in the fundus and in the bulb, deformity of the pylorus, and a small hiatal hernia.
A follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy was planned for the following morning due to the inability to move the large blood clot in the stomach.
The repeat upper endoscopy showed a mass in the fundus and antrum with no obvious bleeding site.
There was blood in the fundus and old adherent blood found throughout the stomach.
The hematemesis was thought likely due to an ulcerating mass.
GASTRIC ADENOCARCINOMA ISSUES:  The patient has known metastases in her liver.
She did not wish for chemotherapy or surgical intervention.
The patient also did not wish to discuss her prognosis and diagnosis; however, she was fully aware of her illness.
It was thought that an adrenal insufficiency state would be more harmful.
AORTIC STENOSIS ISSUES:  The patient's aortic stenosis was stable with a valve area of 0.9 cm2.
She had no evidence of congestive heart failure during this admission.
NUTRITIONAL ISSUES:  The patient was encouraged to drink clears; however, she had a small appetite.
However, the patient wished to pursue aggressive treatment of further bleeding episodes for now.
Aortic stenosis.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
