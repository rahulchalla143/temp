Admission Date:  [**2186-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-11-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10682**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 76M with history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, HTN, COPD, DM2 presented to the ED with AMS, determined to have hyperglycemia, stable brain mets and possible infection.
He had just been treated for cough with Levoquin by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] and was shown to have progressing brain mets.
He has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of his mental status over the past 4-5 days, with delay in his dexamethasone taper to continue at 5 mg TID instead of going to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
On review of symptoms, patient's wife states that he has had some intermittant incontinence over the past week, subjective chills (no temperature taken) and a "rattly cough" noted today in the ED.
CT abdomen and pelvis was then done to evaluate for possible intra-abdominal source of infection - this was negative for acute process.
He was extremely agitated in the ED, requiring haldol and zyprexa.
Review of systems: unable to obtain as patient non-verbal   Past Medical History: -Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer -CAD s/p CABG in [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein grafts to a diagonal, circumflex marginal, and right PDA.
PET CT showed contralateral lymph node and bilateral SC node involvement as well as innumerable bony lesions.
FNA of supraclavicular lymph node on [**12-13**] confirmed the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
CSF cytology was negative for malignancy x3, ruling out leptomeningeal involvement.
No alcohol or illicits.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Father's side of family with CAD but all lived to 80-90's.
Mother's side died from stomach ulcers that became cancerous (several members with same diagnosis).
No other cancer in family.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.6 BP: 144/91 P: 114 R: 16 O2: 96% on 4L O2NC General: Awake, agitated, lying in bed in restraints HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear  Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: minimal breath sounds throughout left hemithorax when auscultated anteriorly, right hemithorax CTA with no wheezes or rhonchi.
CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, well perfused, trace edema in bilateral feet, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis Neuro: alert, oriented x 0, non-verbal.
No acute hemorrhage or midline shift.
Multiple hyperdense foci consistent with known metastatic disease and better evaluated on MRI of [**2186-6-29**].
A component of hydrocephalus cannot be excluded.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I believe there is a hetergenous density appearance of the basisphenoid, which correlates with extensive MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**] [**Last Name (Titles) 32341**]s in that area, as seen on the [**2186-6-29**] study, and is consistent with metastatic tumor involvement.
There is prominent atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous internal carotid arteries.
Markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm, left base opacity and mediastinal shift to the left are likely due to left lower lobe collapse.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions at the left lung base.
There is partial collapse of the left lower lobe, increased since the previous study and incompletely imaged on this study.
Multiple hypodense lesions throughout the liver, consistent with hepatic metastases.
Diffuse osseous metastases as seen before and stable compression fracture of L3 with mild retropulsion.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old male with history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, HTN, COPD presented with AMS, found to have bandemia, left lung collapse, stable brain mets,  and positive blood cultures.
# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy:  This was likely secondary to septicemia +/- hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the setting of known brain metastases s/p radiation therapy.
# Septicemia with GPCs in blood culture  # Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state  # Small cell lung cancer, metastatic  Patient was initially admitted to the medical ICU.
Ranitidine HCl 150 mg daily Tamsulosin 0.4 mg qhs Tiotropium Bromide 18 mcg daily   Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Toxic/Metabolic encephalopathy  Secondary: Septicemia with bacteremia Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state Small cell lung cancer, metastatic  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: N/A  Followup Instructions: N/A
