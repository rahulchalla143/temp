Partial omentectomy.
Segment III mass resection 6.
Segment II-III mass resection, segment III hamartoma resection.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman presented to the [**Hospital 7912**] in [**Month (only) 205**] with left-sided abdominal pain and chest pain.
He had a CT scan of his abdomen that revealed a mass measuring approximately 7 cm x 7 cm x 8 cm as well as several liver masses consistent with metastases.
In mid [**Month (only) 205**], he underwent a CT-guided biopsy showing neuroendocrine tumor and these were also seen on a PET scan identifying the mass in the pancreas and lymphatic involvement of the celiac trunk as well as FDG uptake in several of the liver lesions.
These liver lesions have also shown the presence of octreotide uptake.
The patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] (Pancreaticobiliary Surgery), Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Hepatobiliary Surgery), and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (HemOnc) on [**2190-9-8**] to determine whether or not the pancreatic tumor and liver metastasis can be removed surgically.
Past Medical History: PMH: hypertension, depression (currently untreated), hemorrhoids, and a single kidney since birth.
PSH: tonsillectomy at age 5 but no other surgeries.
Family History: His family history is remarkable for his father who had colon cancer in his 60 which was surgically treated.
He has 5 siblings and no other family history of malignancy.
Physical Exam: On Discharge: VS: 97.7, 75, 140/84, 16, 95% RA GEN: Somewhat anxious, but in NAD HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, Neck supple CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB Abd: Bilateral subcostal incision open to air with steri strips and c/d/i.
b.  Omentum, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
c.  No tumor seen.
Body and tail of pancreas, pancreatectomy (J-P): Atrophy of exocrine pancreatic acini with no tumor seen.
Antrum, distal gastrectomy (Q-V): Unremarkable stomach with antral mucosa; no tumor seen.
One of six lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma ([**1-21**]).
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (AN-AO): No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Mild steatosis in benign liver.
c.  No increased fibrosis or iron deposition on special stains; reticulin stain evaluated.
Mild steatosis in benign liver.
c.  No increased fibrosis or iron deposition on special stains; reticulin stain evaluated.
Pancreas (Endocrine): Resection Synopsis Staging according to American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual -- 7th Edition, [**2188**]  MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type:  Partial resection, pancreatic body and tail, partial resection, pancreatic head.
WHO Classification:  Well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma (Gross local invasion and or metastases.
MICROSCOPIC TUMOR OF EXTENSION  Margins:  Margin(s) involved by tumor:                                         Proximal pancreatic margin.
Primary Tumor (pT):  pT3: Tumor extends beyond the pancreas, but without involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery.
Distant metastasis (pM):  pM1:  Distant metastasis, site(s)): Liver.
Extensive metastatic disease in segments IV through VIII as described.
[**2190-9-29**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia.
There may be ST segment elevation in the inferior leads but without reciprocal changes.
There is early R wave progression across the precordial leads.
Early precordial T wave amplitude is less prominent.
ST segment elevations, particularly in leads II and aVF, are somewhat concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with the history of biopsy proven metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma was admitted to the HPB Surgical Service for possible resection of the tumor.
On [**2190-9-28**], the patient underwent subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, antrectomy with gastrojejunostomy, partial omentectomy, open cholecystectomy and segment III mass resection, segment II-III mass resection, segment III hamartoma resection, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Neuro: The patient received Bupivacaine via epidural catheter and Dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
The patient has an allergy to Codeine and his oral pain medication was changed to achieve optimal pain control.
Anxiety: The patient has had experienced anxiety attacks during hospitalization.
The patient was instructed to f/u with PCP for anxiety evaluation and needs to continue Ativan.
CV: The patient had an episode of tachycardia post operatively, secondary to pain/anxiety.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound was evaluated daily and no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
After last transfusion, the patient HCT level improved, no additional transfusion were required.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diabetic diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
