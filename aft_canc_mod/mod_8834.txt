Circumferential thickening of the esophagus.
Fatty infiltration in the wall of the ascending and transverse colon which can be seen in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo M with EtOH abuse admitted with weakness, found to have multiple, severe electrolyte abnormalities, mild EtOH hepatitis and acute on chronic anemia.
He was admitted to the ICU in management of his weakness and impressive metabolic derangements.
His Na was depressed to 118, accompanied by severe hypokalemia (2.0), hypomagnesemia (1.3), and a metabolic alkalosis, all of which can be explained by recent hypovolemia from poor PO intake.
His elevated lactate and [**Last Name (un) **] also speak to this diagnosis.
His phosphate was dangerously low (0.9), suggesting possible refeeding syndrome as his PO intake improved.
He did not develop re-feeding syndrome and with the assistance of a dietician was taking in a full diet with stable electrolytes in the days prior to discharge.
He was also found to have transaminitis with evidence of fatty liver on his CT torso.
He may have a component of NASH as well as probable mild alcoholic heatitis.
Social work raised concern for memory and/or cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcoholism.
The GI team was consulted due to the finding of thickened esophageal wall on CT chest and acute on chronic anemia in the setting of guaiac positive stool.
EGD revealed Z-line irregularity, gastritis and duodenitis.
He was placed on a PPI and must follow-up with his PCP for biopsy results of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum.
Due to poor prep and a large polyp, it is recommended that he return for repeat colonoscopy in 8 weeks.
