Admission Date:  [**2185-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-8-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] Chief Complaint: Left neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 84994**] is a 56-year-old man with a history of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, sickle cell trait, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma (s/p chemotherapy), unilateral orchidectomy, pulmonary embolism (on coumadin), sleep apnea, adjustment disorder, presenting with acute onset left neck pain, including hemibody symptoms.
Mr. [**Known lastname 84994**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] up at 10 a.m. on [**Last Name (Titles) 1017**] with pain at the base of his neck on the left (he points to the area of the manubrioclavicular joint on the left).
It was associated with neck stiffness and was aching in character.
The pain worsened and came to include the posterolateral neck, slight distal from the origin of the left trapezius.
He then awoke with burning pain in both feet and in his left hand.
He developed a headache that radiated from the pain in his neck.
Review of systoms reveals a number of positive features: The pain varied slightly with breathing, he thinks.
His family noted that he was not talking much and that his speech was slurred, but he was not sure whether this was because of a speech difficulty, or because of [**9-30**] pain.
He travels to [**Country 16573**] frequently and has been there within the last few months: Once in [**Month (only) 1096**], when he actually developed diabetic coma, returning to the US in [**Month (only) 404**], then again in [**Month (only) 958**], returning on [**5-3**].
In the ED, pain was controlled, Neurology saw him and CT angiograms of the chest, neck and head were performed, along with a plain film of the neck.
His pain improved with Dilaudid, but did not resolve completely.
No pain on chewing, visual changes.
No sick contacts, no extramarital sexual relations, no smoking, drugs or alcohol.
Past Medical History: - Sickle cell trait - no manifestations, per patient - Obesity, recent BMI 31.8 - Hypertension, on lisinopril, amlodipine, atenolol - Diabetes, on insulin, poorly controlled per [**Location (un) 2274**] notes - Cancer of the prostate, radical prostatectomy [**2175**], now nocturia and frequency - Leydig cell testicular tumor, s/p unilateral orchidectomy - Sleep apnea - Colon polyp, small adenoma on colonscopy [**2182**], repeat advised [**2184**] - Impotence, erectile dysfunction - Anemia, leading to diagnosis of multiple myeloma - Multiple Myeloma, diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy (50% plasma cells), s/p velcade/decadron, controlled per patient, IgA type, IgA level 1900 in [**2184-8-21**].
No bony lesions on skeletal survery in [**2184**].
Significant steroid toxicity per Oncology note, so subsequent treatment could be revlimid or velcade alone.
- Dyslipidemia - Alcohol abuse, dependence and some struggle to stop when starting coumadin for PE in [**Month (only) 404**].
- Steatohepatitis - Pulmonary embolism, on coumadin (for four months now) - difficult to keep INR stable, presently supratherapeutic.
Likely provoked during hospitalization for diabetic coma.
- Diabetic coma, glucose in 600s, occurred while in [**Country 16573**] in [**Month (only) **] - hospitalized there and given large amount of IV fluid, noted to also have cough and fever.
Also presented to Urgent Care [**Location (un) 2274**] with symptomatic hyperglycemia.
- Diabetic retinopathy - Latent TB, negative AFB - Hypothyroidism in [**Location (un) 2287**] notes - previously on levothyroxine - Lower extremity edema, given Lasix, amlodipine discussed as cause also.
Reports a history of EtOH (~4 beers/day w/Scotch, however has recently cut back to 1/day), no smoking, no illicits.
Ice packs on upper left trapezius and region of sternoclavicular joint.
Sternoclavicular joint region very tender and slightly erythematous under area that ice pack placed.
Systolic murmur that radiates to the subclavian arteries, but not the carotids, loudest at both RUSB and LLSB, No R/G.
Respiratory: CTA throughout, good air entry, no wheeze.
Guarded movements of neck, left arm, clumsy left hand but possible pain limitation (also per patient).
Fundoscopy, reflexes, gait and vibration sense deferred (but should be checked).
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation may be present.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified  MRI Clavicle: IMPRESSION: Bone marrow edema and enhancement of the left medial clavicle and manubrium concerning for left claviculomanubrial joint infection and osteomyelitis with surrounding reactive edema.
No drainable fluid collections.
The left medial clavicle and manubrium are better imaged on this dedicated study and given differences in imaging technique, abnormalities likely have not significantly changed or have possibly minimally progressed since the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2185-6-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 84994**] presents with numerous medical problems, including multiple myeloma, latent TB, h/o testicular and prostate cancer p/w acute onset left neck pain with left arm weakness in setting of cracking/stretching his neck, developing with strep bovis bacteremia of unclear source.
Strep Bovis Bacteremia: Found on culture after patient was spiking fevers while in-house.
Subsequently grew Strep bovis.
Bacteremia cleared [**2185-6-23**].
Multiple imaging performed of patient's left neck/shoulder as he complained of significant pain in the area.
MRI of claviculomanubrial region was consistent with osteomyelitis and possible septic joint, however no fluid was available for aspiration.
Unfortunately the yield of bone biopsy in setting of antibiotics is quite low and since the pre-test probability is high for osteomyelitis in this patient, it was decided to treat presumptively for osteomyelitis.
Unfortunately, the patient reported a significant pencillin allergy of facial swelling and difficulty breathing.
Pathology was consistent with adenomas.
In discussion with patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was felt the patient no longer needed anti-coagulation for a provoked PE occuring in [**1-30**].
Since heparin could be safely stopped, the patient had another colonoscopy which was terminated due to a poor prep.
His hematocrit was trended and was stable, requiring no blood transfusions.
The patient had no further complications.
This was felt to be the likely source of patient's bacteremia, as no other potential source was found.
TEE was performed and was negative for vegetations.
Imaging on presentation was consistent with significant muscle strain.
It was felt the sudden movement may have also caused minor trauma to clavicularmanubrial region allowing strep bovis to seed the joint and ultimately infect the clavicle, which exacerbated the patient's pain in this area.
He experienced no pain prior to discharge.
Hypertension: Hypertensive peaks appeared to occur with pain and resloved with pain control.
This was felt to be due to patient's infectious state, repeated blood draws, and slight ooze from patient's polyps as he was notably guaiac positive with brown stools.
SPEP drawn consistent with IgA subtype.
Patient will schedule appointment with [**Hospital1 **] Behavioral Health for further assistance.
Bactrim and antivirals likely given in context of velcade/decadron and naltrexone given past alcohol use.
Monthly Zometa was also given as part of chemotherapy.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*10 Adhesive Patch, Medicated(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Strep bovis bacteremia SC joint septic arthritis Presumptive sternal and manubrial osteomyelitis Neck Strain Colonic Adenomas Secondary: Multiple Myeloma Diabetes Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of neck pain and subsequently developed fevers.
You were found to have a bacterial infection in your blood called Streptococcus bovis.
This caused you to have an infection in your breast bone (The sternum) as well as the joint that connects your sternum to the left clavicle, which exacerbated your neck/shoulder pain.
You should contact the infectious disease doctors if [**Name5 (PTitle) **] have any concerns about this.
This may mean you are bleeding from the polyps that were removed in your colonoscopy*****  You will need a repeat colonoscopy in one year.
START: Gabapentin 400 mg three times per day (this is a pain medication) 6.
START Dilaudid 2-4 mg to be taken every four hours as needed for pain 7.
