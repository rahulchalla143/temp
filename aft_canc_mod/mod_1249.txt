[**2149-2-7**]: Technically successful aspiration and placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter within a pelvic collection secondary to sigmoid perforation.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 80-year-old gentleman who is very healthy.
He recently had a left inguinal hernia repair and in analysis of the hernia sac by the pathologists, a low grade lymphoma was discovered.
Patient had a large 12 cm cystic type lesion in the right retroperitoneum in the right lower quadrant.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
MODERATE GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
[**2149-12-2**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia.
Right bundle-branch block.
[**2149-12-2**] ABD PORTABLE: IMPRESSION: Multiple air-filled loops of dilated small bowel are consistent with small-bowel obstruction vs. less likely ileus.
Dilated loops of small bowel with no definite transition points noted.
Multiple cystic lesions in the pancreas with the largest in the head of the pancreas measuring 8 x 7 mm could represent an IPMT.
Left adrenal adenoma or myelolipoma.
There is a 1.6 cm thin spetated cyst in the left kidney mid polar region which should be further evaluated with a dedicated ultrasound.
Decrease in size of pelvic abscess with percutaneous catheter coiled within.
While there is no free intraperitoneal air or oral contrast within the abdomen or the abscess, a persistent defect in the wall of the sigmoid colon cannot be excluded.
Multiple cystic lesions within the pancreas are stable and may represent IPMN.
Stable right and left adrenal nodules.
Multiple hypodense lesions throughout the liver, unchanged.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
Calcification within the body of the pancreas measures approximately 11 mm x 7 mm and may be within the pancreatic duct as there is upstream dilation of the pancreatic duct up to 6 mm.
(and more) ************This report contains an addendum*********** DIAGNOSIS: I. Pelvic mucin (A-B): A. Mucin with abundant atypical appearing single and small groups of epithelioid cells, some with cytoplasmic vacuoles consistent with reactive mesothelial and histiocytic cells; no carcinoma seen, see note 1.
No expression of cytokeratin 20, a marker of colonic and appendiceal epithelium or LeuM1 is demonstrated in this sample.
Note 1: Immunostains performed on the permanent sections demonstrate that the atypical epithelioid cells seen at the time of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis are mesothelial and histiocytic in origin, resulting in a discrepancy with the original frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm with low grade cytologic atypia, dissecting mucin, and focal extra-appendiceal mucin with neoplastic cellular elements (all with low grade cytologic atypia); see note 2.
Five periappendiceal lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/5); several lymphoid deposits appear to be comprised of monotonous, small lymphoid cells without well-developed germinal centers or mantle zones.
Immmunohistochemical work-up to demonstrate involvement by the patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma is in progress and will be reported in an addendum to be released by Hematopathology.
C. No high grade dysplasia is seen in the appendiceal tumor or extra-appendiceal mucin deposits.
D. Appendiceal proximal margin assessment is limited due to the extent of the adherent right lower quadrant mass; however, only a single tissue block (slide C) demonstrates a section of appendix free of neoplasm.
Peritoneal nodule, biopsy (M): Dissecting mucin within fibroadipose tissue with reactive mesothelial lining consistent with implant from low grade appendiceal mucinous tumor.
Note 2: The behavior of low grade appendiceal mucinous tumors is variable with recurrent cases presenting with the clinical syndrome of pseudomyxoma peritonei and its associated complications.
Studies of patients with such tumors were associated with 5 and 10-year survival rates of 86 and 45%, respectively (Misdraji et [**Doctor Last Name **], American Journal of Surgical Pathology, [**2140**]).
ADDENDUM: Reason for addendum:  reviewed by hematopathology Hematopathology note: DIAGNOSIS:  Involvement by low-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, favor small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Sections show multiple foci of dense lymphoid infiltrate comprised of a monotonous population of small mature-appearing lymphocytes.
A small lymph node is noted in Section Cz.
The architecture of the lymph node is effaced by a monotonous lymphoid infiltrate with a vaguely nodular pattern.
The lymphocytes are monotonous, round, small to medium-sized lymphocytes with round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, condensed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant to moderate amount of cytoplasm.
There is a focal collection of histiocytes in the lymph node.
DRC (CD21) highlights rare scattered residual follicular dendritic reticular meshwork.
Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are in keeping with involvement by small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL).
Brief Hospital Course: The patient diagnosed with cystic abdominal mass was admitted to the General Surgical Service for elective surgical resection.
On [**2149-1-28**], the patient underwent appendectomy and removal of retroperitoneal appendiceal mucocele, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA and SC Toradol with good effect and adequate pain control.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications with minimal requirements.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint, he had several episodes of sinus tachycardia postoperatively; vital signs were routinely monitored.
On POD # 5, patient developed acute respiratory distress s/t food aspiration and was transferred into ICU.
Chest x-ray demonstrated right lund opacification which correlates with large scale aspiration.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Abdominal x-ray revealed small bowel obstruction.
On POD # 10, patient's abdomen was found to be distended and abdominal CT scan was obtained.
CT demonstrated sigmoid colon perforation with intraabdominal abscess.
Patient was started on IV Flagyl and Cipro, IR placed [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter to drain abscess, cultures were sent for microbiology.
Cultures back positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa sensitive to Cipro.
On POD # 15, repeat abdominal CT demonstrated decrease size of intraabdominal abscess and no contrast leak.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound was examined routinely, no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Dulcolax 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1)  Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Respiratory distress s/p aspiration 4.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
*Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
PICC Line: *Please monitor the site regularly, and [**Name6 (MD) 138**] your MD, nurse practitioner, or [**Name6 (MD) 269**] Nurse if you notice redness, swelling, tenderness or pain, drainage or bleeding at the insertion site.
* [**Name6 (MD) **] your MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the Emergency Room immediately if the PICC Line tubing becomes damaged or punctured, or if the line is pulled out partially or completely.
Contact your [**Name2 (NI) 269**] Nurse if the dressing comes undone or is significantly soiled for further instructions.
