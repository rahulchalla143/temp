A CTA was performed which showed bilateral pulmonary embolism.
She was initially normotensive and then have one episode of hypotension to about 100s.
However, given that she has bilateral PE and EKG shows right heart strain, she was admitted to the MICU for observation.
Positive for RUQ pain that is chronic and related to her liver metastases.
Recent 20 pound unintentional weight loss.
Recurrent metastatic uterine cancer - 6 cycles carboplatin chemo, CT scan [**2136-10-11**] with mets to liver, spleen, retrocaval nodes, and distal ileum serosal soft tissue.
Recently switched to Doxil chemotherapy for disease progression.
Possible mild "lupus" with positive [**Doctor First Name **] antibodies in [**2134**], which is considered equivocal.
Right knee meniscus tear repair.

[**2136-11-10**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are few prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.
There are multiple filling defects within the main pulmonary arteries bilaterally, extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches consistent with pulmonary emboli.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
The lung window images reveal no areas of consolidation or lung nodules.
The airways appear patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
Mild right basilar atelectasis noted.
The visualized portion of the upper abdomen, the imaged portion of the liver again demonstrates multiple areas of low attenuation consistent with hepatic metastases.
A soft tissue density/node is again visualized in the epicardial fat, measuring 1.3 x 1.5 cm.
There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions in the osseous structures.
Filling defects within right and left main pulmonary arteries extending to the segmental and subsegmental branches consistent with multiple pulmonary emboli.
Metastatic liver disease.
[**2136-11-10**] CT of head: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage.
MRI with and without gadolinium is more sensitive for picking up of brain metastases.
EKG [**2136-11-10**]: Sinus tachycardia at rate 101.

EKG [**2136-11-11**]: Sinus tachycardia at rate 106.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific low amplitude T waves.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression could be due to left anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific T wave flattening.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-11-11**] no significant change.
