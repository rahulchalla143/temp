The right lung is grossly clear, but there is probably a small right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Left lower lobe opacification likely represents atelectasis/consolidation plus effusion.

NONCONTRAST CT, (has had recent dye load), please evaluate l  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old woman with CLL admitted with multiple abdominal mets, and LLL obstruction [**1-6**] hilar LAD on CT abdomen.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: NONCONTRAST CT, (has had recent dye load), please evaluate lymphadenopathy, LLL collapse, infiltrate.
INDICATIONS: 85-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, admitted with abdominal metastases and left lower lobe obstruction secondary to hilar lymphadenopathy on the abdomen CT.
Question lymphadenopathy, left lower lobe collapse and infiltrate.
At the request of the referring physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3173**] contrast was not administered because of a recent dye load.
A coarse calcification is noted the right lobe of the thyroid.
The pulmonary arteries cannot be assessed for filling defects.
There is only trace pericardial fluid but a small-to- moderate left- sided pleural effusion of low density is somewhat larger.
Although the left anteromedial basal segment appears spared, all other portions of the left lower lobe are collapsed, likely due to post-obstructive atelectasis.
The overall degree of atelectasis has progressed since the prior day.
A large subcarinal mass of 51 x 26 mm in axial dimensions (2a:27) is now fully visualized, although not as well depicted without [**Year (4 digits) 3173**] contrast.
A large mass along the right infrahilar region and adjacent portion of the lower left mediastinum measures 61 x 37 mm (2c:74), but was better depicted with contrast.
There are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is marked lymphadenopathy in the left axilla.
There are also several slightly prominent right hilar lymph nodes, but these are not over 8 mm in diameter.
A small right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis appears unchanged.
There are also gallstones and a new small amount of ascites.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Subcarinal nodal mass.
Mass in the left infrahilar region with post- obstructive atelectasis, which has progressed to near left lower lobe collapse.
Somewhat larger bilateral pleural effusions.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Multiple abnormal masses in the upper abdomen, better depicted on the recent abdominal CT.
Known pulmonary embolism not visualized given the lack of contrast administration.
INDICATION: History of CLL with leukocytosis, left upper quadrant pain, and cough.
Additional history from the online medical record indicates that there is hematuria.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a large 5.6 x 3.2 cm mass in the inferior mediastinum at the G-E junction.
There is a large 4.2 x 1.9 cm subcarinal mass that compressess the esophagus.
The most superior slice also suggests an additional visualization of a left hilar node, which is compressing the superior segment bronchus of the left lower lobe resulting in postobstructive collapse.
There is additional atelectasis at the left base with a moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
There is a trace pericardial fluid.
A nonocclusive pulmonary embolism is present in the visualized portions the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, partially visualized on this study.
Widespread metastatic disease is identified, with a large, 5.9 x 3.7 cm heterogenous mass in the left upper quadrant, overlying the spleen, with a small amount of associated ascites.
Innumerable additional omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal soft tissue nodules/masses consistent with metastases are also noted.
Multiple metastatic deposits are noted about and within the right adrenal gland.
There is no free air or free fluid.
The small bowel loops appear normal.
Multiple hypodense lesions are present in the kidneys, all probably simple or dense cysts.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a large lobulated mass within the right superior lateral wall of the bladder measuring 6.0 x 2.9 cm.
There are multiple markedly enlarged lymph nodes along the right external iliac, right common iliac, and left paraaortic lymph node distributions.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lesions are identified.
Widely metastatic disease with innumerable peritoneal implants, including a large left upper quadrant mass, and bulky iliac and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Lobulated mass within the bladder wall.
While a primary bladder malignancy remains a consideration, other primary neoplasms (such as lung or ovarian) with implants on the bladder should also be considered.
Mediastinal adenopathy with likely left hilar adenopathy (partially visualized) causing post- obstructive collapse of the superior segment of the left upper lobe.
Nonocclusive pulmonary embolism of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
Massive splenomegaly with multiple indeterminate 1-cm lesions, either metastases or small foci of infarction secondary to splenomegaly.
Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old woman with CLL, multiple new abdominal masses, new bladder mass, with RLL PE, with concern for anticoagulation given hematuria.
INDICATION: 85-year-old woman with CLL, multiple new abdominal masses, and with new bladder mass.
Patient has now presented with right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and with concern for anticoagulation given hematuria.
IVC venogram demonstrated no thrombosis in left iliac, IVC, and both renal veins were noted at L2 level.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 y/o russian woman with history of Stage 0 CLL presented with cough, abd pain, and hematuria, found to have LUL collapse secondary to LAD, multiple abd mets, and new bladder mass.
Metastatic cancer of unknown primary Presented with hematuria, found to have new bladder mass on CT scan, in addition to peritoneal and lung mass.
Urology consult service followed, recommended urine cytology for diagnosis.
Per urology, biopsy of mass not advisable given risk of procedure (bleeding, poor functional status).
Given inability to obtain a diagnosis, and extent of metastatic cancer (as well as unliklihood it is progressive CLL or transformation), comfort/palliative care was recommended.
The main symptoms were pain and dyspnea both were treated with oxycontin and oxycodone.
She did not want to take morphine secondary to previous side effects.
LLL collapse/possible post-obstructive pneumonia: was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics that were stopped when patient requested they be discontinued.
Leg edema is likely from IVC filter and abdominal metastases compressing on the venous return.
Leg elevation recommended.
CLL/hemolytic anemia: The patient's labs showed evidence of a hemolytic anemia.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing.
Oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for dyspnea or pain.
Oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Five (5) mg PO Q3H (every 3 hours): patient may refuse if she is not in discomfort from pain or dyspnea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastases from unknown primary malignancy Symptoms of pain, dyspnea, leg edema - possibly related to wodespread cancer History of CLL, autoimmune hemolytic anemia Pulmonary embolism   Discharge Condition: fair, going for ongoing hospice care   Discharge Instructions: You are being discharged to extended care facility for further care.
