History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22950**] is a 46-year-old man, with history of glioblastoma multiforme,  s/p resection in [**2135-6-6**], chemo-irradiation with Nuvigil, 2 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, and 3 cycles of XL-184.
His family came home found found him to be confused and having difficulty expressing himself.
The patient did not recall any clonic activity and this is not his usual symptom after having a seziure.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] was called while patient was in the ED, and recommended BP control with hydralazine, as well as giving increased dexamethasone for persistent headache and possible cerebral edema.
Patient reported some blotchiness with hydral in ER.
He had a head CT while in the ED which showed possibly small punctate area of hemorrhage, as well as some edema which was noted on MRI 2 days ago.
Neurosurgery was consulted in ED, and did not feel there was any surgical issue at this time.
[**Name (NI) **] denies tobacco, drugs, or alcohol.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
GENERAL:  NAD, Comfortable, appears stated age, pleasant, some minimal difficulty with word finding SKIN:  No lesions, rashes, bruises HEENT:  AT/NC, PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, no conjuctival pallor, MMM, clear oropharynx, no erythema NECK:  Supple, trachea midline, no LAD LUNG:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no R/R/W CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1&S2, RRR, no R/G/M ABDOMEN:  Soft, +BS, NT, ND, no rebound, no guarding EXTREMITIES:  No C/C/E.
Extraocular movements are full; there is no nystagmus.
Motor Examination:  There is no drift or pronation.
Stable appearance to extensive vasogenic edema in the left temporoparietal lobe.
The acuity of this hemorrhage is uncertain as there are no recent prior CTs for comparison, although some susceptibility artifact in this region on the prior MR suggests that it was present at that time.
There are no areas of hemorrhage outside of the lesional cavity.
No new mass effect.
[**2136-1-20**] Chest X-Ray:  Mild left basilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22950**] is a 46-year-old man, with history of glioblastoma multiforme,  s/p resection in [**2135-6-6**], chemo-irradiation with Nuvigil, 2 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, and 3 cycles of XL-184.
He is presented with expressive/receptive aphasia and hypertensive urgency.
(1) Aphasia:  CT head with edema, possibly small punctate foci of hemorrhage in surgical bed, but edema unchanged from prior MRI 2 days ago.
His symptoms were thought to be most consistent with post-ictal aphasia after a seizure than due to edema or stroke.
He had no evidence of increased intracranial pressure on serial neuro exams.
(3) Hypertensive Urgency:  Possibly elevated BP due to increased dexamethasone dose.
There was no evidence of increased intracranial pressure on serial neurological examinations.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Aphasia, likely post-ictal - Hypertensive urgency  Secondary - Glioblastoma multiforme  Discharge Condition: Mental Status:  Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:  Alert and interactive Activity Status:  Ambulatory - Independent  Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for confusion and difficulty speaking.
