On transfer, patient with persistent AMS, unable to answer questions.
He has remained afebrile and with improved heart rate following fluid resuscitation; 170/72, 99%RA, 20-26.
Past Medical History: - NSCLC - Stage 4 disease, initially presented early [**Month (only) **] with N/V secondary to his diabetic gastroperesis.
During that admission, he was found to have a right effusion and a large 4.6 x 7.6 x 7.7 cm right hilar mass of slightly heterogeneous texture and infiltrative margins with peribronchial wall infiltration and septal thickening suggestive of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
His pleural fluid and TBNA/EBBX of the mass all were positive for NSCLCA.
He had PET scan on [**6-24**] were he was found to have complete collapse of the right right lung and large pleural effusion s/p pleurex catheter placement for recurrent effusion [**Date range (1) 95587**], 10 rounds of radiation.
- DM type 1, followed by [**Last Name (un) **], with history of DKA (last admission in [**2175**]) and also history of seizures related to hypoglcyemia.
- Bipolar disorder - last manic episode 2.5 years ago.
Denies recent depressive episodes.
- Dyslipidemia - HTN   Social History: Per prior [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note: He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1411**]/[**Location (un) 686**].
Family History: Per prior [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note: Father died of Lung Ca at age 50 (Non-smoker-Probable asbestos exposure) and was apparently an alcoholic as well.
Brother with a history of alcoholism and depression.
?s sign as pt c/o pain with mild palpation; no rebound/guarding Ext:  Warm, well-perfused, 2+ DP, 1+ edema at ankle   Pertinent Results: On [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission [**2176-8-10**]:  WBC-9.9 RBC-4.02* Hgb-10.7* Hct-39.9* MCV-99*# MCH-26.7* MCHC-26.9*# RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-517* Neuts-94* Bands-0 Lymphs-5* Monos-1* Eos-0 Baso-0 Atyps-0 Metas-0 Myelos-0 Glucose-1290* UreaN-51* Creat-1.9*# Na-137 K-8.3* Cl-85* HCO3-9* AnGap-51* Calcium-8.6 Phos-2.6* Mg-1.9 Osmolal-410* ASA-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Ethanol-NEG pH-7.18* Lactate-5.7* Na-141 K-7.5* Cl-95* calHCO3-10* Urine Dipstick: Blood-TR Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-0.2 pH-6.0 Leuks-NEG .
Micro: [**8-10**], [**8-12**] Bcx: pending [**8-10**], [**8-12**] UCx: no growth [**8-12**] Sputum: Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions.
Interval worsening of aeration of the right lung, likely due to combination of increased right pleural effusion and post-obstructive collapse due to known right hilar mass.
Superimposed consolidation is not excluded.
Abdomen x-ray [**8-10**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without signs of bowel obstruction or free intra-abdominal air.
CXR [**8-12**]:  Compared to [**7-16**] through [**8-11**]: Right lung is now entirely collapsed with little if any increase in the volume of right pleural effusion.
Tubing projecting over the left lower lung obscures what appears to be developing consolidation.
Left upper lobe is clear.
No pleural effusion.
Interval complete collapse of the right upper lobe, progression of right lower lobe and middle lobe collapse.
Unchanged endobronchial mass within the right lower lobe bronchus and unchanged severe loculated right pleural effusion.
New small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
Small amount of fluid within the gallbladder fossa is most likely due to fluid overload.
[**8-13**] CT Head: No evidence for hemorrhage.
No large acute territorial infarct is identified.
[**8-14**] LENI: Occlusive thrombus within one of the paired left posterior tibial veins and the left peroneal vein.
There is nonocclusive thrombus mobile within the lumen of the right common femoral vein.
[**8-12**] Bronchoscopy: endobronchial lesion from carina to RLL subsegments - all of these orifices appeared narrowed, erythematous and edematous, easily collapsible.
No obvious secretions/mucous plugs.
diabetes type I, ketoacidosis:  Pt with type I DM.
Pt had hyperglycemia, acidosis, large anion gap, and ketonuria, large osmolar gap on admission, with partial respiratory compensation.
Serum potassium elevated on admission although likely total body potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis.
With resolution of DKA, pt's mental status improved although he continued to be agitated given his bipolar disorder.
Psych meds were restarted and pt received haldol PRN for agitation, with further improvement in his mental status.
# Respiratory failure, acute: Pt was intubated [**2176-8-10**] at time of coffee-ground emesis (see below) to protect airway [**1-29**] agitation and vomiting.
Right lung was noted to be entirely collapsed on CXR with little if any increase in the volume of known malignant right pleural effusion.
Pt had bronchoscopy with results above.
# pulmonary embolism: Pt noted to have Right pulmonary embolism on chest CT. LENIs positive for b/l DVT.
It was felt that because PE and collapse are in same lung, pt may not be hypoxic as V-Q may still be matched.
Pt was put on lovenox which was stopped given his thrombocytopenia and changed to fondaparineux as it has less likelihood of decreasing platelets.
bleeding, gastrointestinal, NOS: On the morning of admission, pt had episode of coffee-ground emesis.
No intervention was performed given he was intubated and he was medically managed with IV PPI.
Pt required 1 unit pRBCs for low Hct on [**8-11**].
Pt with known malignant R pleural effusion.
Code status discussion also intiated and final decision pending.
Bipolar disorder: Pt's psych meds were intially held as pt was NPO due to altered mental status and concern for aspiration.
Pt began to have visual and auditory hallucinations and suicidal ideations with no plan.
Pt's agitation and hallucinations improved.
In setting of altered mental status and agitation, CT head done which was negative for bleed.
COURSE ON MEDICAL FLOOR: Because of his poor performance status, his oncologist was not likely going to treat his NSCLC, and palliative care was consulted; he made the decision to go home with hospice.
His two biggest issues on the medical floor were hypoglycemia (he does not eat because he has no appetite), and he had low blood sugars for several nights requiring D50; [**Last Name (un) **] followed along and adjusted his sliding daily.
His other issue was tachycardia (sinus tachycardia in the 100's at rest increasing to 150's with ambulation); this was attributed to his known pulmonary embolism and was not treated.
