The pathology examination showed metastatic malignant melanoma.
- In [**2189-8-1**] started chemotherapy with temozolomide with initial decrease of the pulmonary lesions and than disease stability.
- Disease progression was further documented by CT chest ([**2191-5-5**]), the brain CT was negative for metastatic disease.

[**4-6**] harsh systolic murmur best heard over LUSB with palpable thrill.
Crackles at left base.
ABDOMEN: Mildly tender to palapation suprapubically.
SKIN: Continued rash diffusely over back with 1-2mm discreet erythematous macules.
Moderate right pleural effusion with subsequent right atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly, signs of mild fluid overload.
Increased size of the left hilus that should be further evaluated by CT. No evidence of pneumonia.
CXR ([**8-28**]): Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged main and left pulmonary arteries are unchanged.
Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged.
Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Again seen is severe cardiomegaly with enlargement of the pulmonary arteries which are unchanged.
Moderate right and mild left pleural effusions with adjacent lung atelectasis remain stable since the prior radiograph.
A small nodular opacity in the left upper lung on correlation with chest CT dated [**2191-7-25**] represents lung nodule and in view of history is concerning for metastasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR ([**8-29**]): Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and hugely dilated main and left pulmonary arteries are longstanding.
The extent and nature of bibasilar consolidative abnormalities are better displayed by the concurrent chest CTA reported separately showing left lower lobe atelectasis and a large right lower lobe pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present.
No pneumothorax.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is right venticular hypertrophy.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild tricuspid stenosis (area >1.5cm2).
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is at least moderate pulmonic valve stenosis (severity of the gradient may be underestimated).
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Right lower lobe pneumonia with simple mild-moderate right and moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Dilated main and left pulmonary artery with sparing of right pulmonary artery is suggestive of pulmonary stenosis.
Global cardiomegaly with dominant right chamber involvement, sever calcification of mitral annulus and mild calcification in the pulmonary outflow tract likely involving pulmonary valve.
Stable left upper lobe pulmonary nodule since [**2191-7-25**].
Evaluation of another known nodule in the right lower lobe which was limited due to right lower lobe consolidation.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: =================================== BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY =================================== Mrs. [**Known lastname 66402**] was admitted to this hospital from an OSH for expedited work-up of new pulmonary masses, likely secondary to metastatic melanoma.
Her hospital course was complicated by pleural effusions, chronic hypoxemia and urinary tract infection.
=================================== ACTIVE ISSUES =================================== # Hypoxemia: Patient transferred with new oxygen requirement and endobronchial mass.
Initial decompensation was thought to be [**2-2**] post obstructive pneumonia.
In ICU, patient diuresed aggressively with IV lasix with improvement of hypoxia to 4LNC.
Pt completed course of antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia on [**9-6**].
Pt continued to require 4LNC thought to be [**2-2**] endobronchial mass however intervention was deffered to outpatient follow with interventional pulmonary.
# Metastatic melanoma: Patinet with history melanoma and possible metatstic lesions to lung causing hypoxia.
No further decisions were made regarding goals of care.
# Afib: Patient suffered from rapid afib with rapid ventricular response.
However head imaging should be completed prior to starting warfarin to rule out mets to brain .
# Urinary Tract Infeciton: Patient had foley catheter while in ICU.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt had Cr to 1.3, which was in setting of diuresis.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having shortness of breath.
A bronchoscopy was completed which showed a mass in your airway and thus you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
You completed the course of antibiotics for the pneumonia prior to discharge.
You were given medication to help slow heart rate down.
You also developed a urinary tract infection while admitted and were started an antibiotic.
