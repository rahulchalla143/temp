Admission Date:  [**2199-11-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-12-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Found Unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubated in the ED on arrival, extubated [**12-8**]  History of Present Illness: 72 year old man with history of marginal zone lymphoma s/p splenectomy presented to the ICU after being found unresponsive for up to 1 hour.
He was known to have had a recent flu vaccination and exposure to [**Location (un) **] droppings while doing carpet work.
EMS found the patient to be tachycardic, but with poor pulses and hypotension.
In the ED, he was still found to be unresponsive with the following vital signs: T 101.3, HR 144, SBP 72, RR44.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for likely sepsis but no clear source found (cultures unrevealing).
His sputum grew unspeciated yeast; gram stain showed rare squamous cells, few polys, few yeast, and no bacteria.
Gram stain and CSF cultures were negative for microrganisms and growth.
Coagulation labs were elevated on admission with PT 22.8 and PTT 130.0.
During course of admission, his coags remained elevated and platelets progressively dropped (to nadir of 46K).
There was evidence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
Prior to transfer to the ICU, the patient was panscanned; head CT at the OSH showed multiple areas of bilateral hypoattenuation.
A 2nd CT scan from the OSH demonstrated multiple brain lesions, some located in watershed areas, but no evidence of increased intracranial pressure.
Chest CT had large, dependent consolidations with air bronchograms and multiple foci of airspace opacity.
This was considered possibly pneumonia secondary to aspiration versus CHF exacerbation.
At time of transfer to the ICU, the patient was almost completely unresponsive to voice/noxious stimuli (no real sedation from OSH, small amounts on transfer, no sedatives while in ICU).
He had been treated broadly with antibiotics and antifungals on vancomycin, ceftazadine, azithromycin, clindamycin, acyclovir, and liposomal ambisome.
Extremities had 3+ pitting edema to the thighs, flaccid muscle tone, and absent reflexes.
Pupil equal round reactive to light, doll's eyes showed no movement, he was non responsive to painful stimuli, and had minimal corneal or gag reflexes.
Neuroradiology observed basal ganglia and cerebellar lesions consistent with watershed infarctions and some remaining lesions that were not located in watershed areas.
The questin of septic emboli was raised since the patient appeared to be septic with hypotension at presentation.
However, a source for embolism was not found: TTE/TEE were negative for vegetations, PFO, or suspicious aortic disease.
In the course in the ICU, EEG showed no evidence of seizure activity.
It showed diffuse slowing consistent with toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
n admission was almost completely unresponsive to voice/noxious stimuli (no real sedation from OSH, small amounts on transfer, no sedatives while here).
Neuro exam @ OSH w/ evidence of brainstem findings, however, here, pt?????
Over time, he had slow recovery in mental status.
The leading diagnosis was overwhelming sepsis with hypotension and watershed infarctions.
Cultures at OSH and here were unrevealing, including tests for histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, and nocardia.
He'd been NPO in the ICU and was getting free water repletion for hypernatremia secondary to inadequate oral intake and resulting hypoalbuminemia.
He also had anasarca with weeping fluid from lesions in the upper extremities due to the volume overload.
The patient also developed acute renal failure likely ATN in setting of hypoperfusion.

[**11-29**]: CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN (Final [**2199-11-29**]): CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN NOT DETECTED  STUDIES: [**11-27**] ECG Sinus rhythm, Nonspecific inferolateral T wave changes, No previous tracing Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 97 182 82 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 35947**] 39 48  [**11-28**] EEG- This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a slow and low voltage background rhythm predominantly in the [**3-5**] Hz delta frequency range with very low voltage superimposed theta frequency activity at times.
In addition, there was occasional mild to moderate amplitude generalized delta frequency slowing.
These findings suggest deep, midline, subcortical dysfunction and are consistent with a  moderate to severe encephalopathy.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
Note was made of sinus tachycardia with  occasional ectopy on the cardiac monitor.
[**11-29**] MRI head - The MR [**First Name (Titles) 29765**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] areas of abnormal increased signal intensity on the FLAIR and fast spin-echo images that were seen as hypodense areas on the CT scan.
These were identified in the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally, greater on the left than right, in the globus pallidus bilaterally, and in the right frontal subcortical and periventricular white matter.
Also identified on the MR, but not on the CT scan, is a region of hyperintensity in the mid-brain on the left, as well as several smaller white matter lesions bilaterally in the frontal white matter.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
These areas demonstrate a normal slow diffusion on the diffusion weighted series, and there is mild contrast enhancment in the right frontal periventricular white matter, the globus pallidus bilaterally, and the brainstem lesions.
These findings are most suspicious for infarction in these locations.
Note that the globus pallidus involvement is characteristic of severe hypoxia or hypoperfusion.
However, the remainder of the lesions are not locations typical for this etiology.The magnetic resounance arteriography study [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] no significant abnormalities.
The vertebral arteries, vertebrobasilar junction, internal carotid arteries, and their major intracranial branches appear normal.
Note that there is an artifact across the mid-portion of the basilar artery, as well as across the internal carotid arteries that produces an artifactual apparent stenosis.CONCLUSION: Multiple posterior fossa, brainstem, and supratentorial lesions, most suspicious for infarction.
The bilateral globus pallidus involvement would suggest global hypoxia or hypoperfusion.
However, the distribution of the remainder of the lesions is more suspicious for an embolic source.
[**11-29**] Echo TEE - no vegetations, no sign of endocarditis The left atrium is normal in size.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Conclusion: No evidence for endocarditis.
No evidence for intestinal obstruction and no radiographic findings to suggest ischemic bowel.
No soft tissue masses or radiopaque calculi.
There was mild pooling of residue in the vallecular space and to a lesser degree into the piriform sinuses.
Trace penetration during the secondary swallowing phase was noted but no frank aspiration.IMPRESSION: No aspiration.
Please refer to the detailed Speech Pathology report in CCC for a comprehensive evaluation of this swallowing study including comments and recommendations.
[**12-16**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow obstruction.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen on any valve.
The absence of a vegetation by  2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.
[**12-17**] THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pancreatitis.
There is no dilation of the extra or intrahepatic bile duct.
No free air, free fluid, or pathologic lymphadenopathy is seen within the abdomen.
A rounded low attenuation structure is seen in the right paraspinal region inferior and posterior to the psoas muscle and the right ureter which may be slightly anteriorly displaced.
This measures approximately 30HU in attenuation with possible slight rim enhancement and is of uncertain cause or significance.
The adjacent vertebra is unremarkable and it doesnot appear to represent a thrombosed vessel.
There is no pathologic inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
A small right fat containing inguinal hernia is present.The osseous structures are unremarkable.
The soft tissues demonstrate mild edema.
IMPRESSION:Moderate to large size bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis which are unchanged from the prior outside study.
No evidence of pancreatitis.
Presacral fluid collection and rounded right paravertebral low attenuation structure posteriormedial to right psoas muscle, of uncertain cause,as described above.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 72 year old man with history of diet controlled DM and marginal zone splenic lymphoma s/p splenectomy.
He also had hypotension complicated by CNS hypoperfusion, respiratroy failure s/p intubation, ARF secondary to ATN, and anemia of chronic disease.
His decreased mental status was considered secondary to presumed sepsis and hypoperfusion.
Extremities are mostly flaccid with very slight movement of the fingertips and right toes.
MRI showed a cerbellar/basal ganglia watershed infarct with other areas suspicious for an embolic event.
Carotid ultrasound and TEE were negative for thrombus, diminishing likelihood of septic emboli.
No organism was identified since blood, urine, CSF, and sputum cultures had no growth.
IV vancomycin was started [**11-27**] at 1g every day and was increased to 1g twice daily on [**12-17**] for a trough of 8.5 thought to be due to improved renal clearance.
These are needed since the antibiotics can cause liver damage and decrease blood cell counts.
The patient's neutrophil count has trended downward and is now near pt's baseline per old clinic records given his underlying marginal zone lymphoma and longstanding history of leukopenia.
It likely is resolving neutrophilia with possible contribution of meropenem-induced leukopenia.
It was likely due to hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2 [**12-9**]).
He autodiuresed large quantities of urine and improved greatly after he started thin liquid/pureed diet with supplemental sugar free shakes.
The anasarca was resolved at discharge and the patient's upper extremity hand and arm wounds from past weeping of fluid were healed or healing well.
He had required free water replacement for hypernatremia in the ICU and again on the medicine floor, likely due to third spacing of intravascular fluid.
A heart murmur detected [**12-13**] that may have previously been muffled due to anasarca.
Repeat echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic LV function, so the changing murmur was likely due to fluid shifting as third-spaced fluid was mobilized and excreted.
Bilateral pleural effusions and multiple peripheral consolidations documented improving on serial chest CT before leaving the ICU.
The patient denies abdominal pain and does not appear tender to palpation.
Lasix was discontinued upon arrival to the medicine floor for concern of pancreatitis induced by lasix; however, lipase remained elevated.
There were no clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and abdominal CT with oral and iv contrast (w/prehydration for renal prophylaxis) showed no evidence of pancreatitis or biliary obstruction.
Repeat abdominal CT scan with contrast is recommended in [**4-6**] months to evaluate for pancreatitis and for evolution of an incidentally identified  uniformly appearing small presacral fluid collection with adjacent hypodensity.
The patient's blood pressure was elevated in the 120-160s.
The patient has anemia of chronic disease with hematocrit at baseline in the high 20s since admission.
iron studies suggest chronic disease.
For prophylaxis, the patient was given a PPI, sc heparin, aspiration and fall precautions, colace/senna, and an air mattress.
