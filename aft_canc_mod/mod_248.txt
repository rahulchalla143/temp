Reportedly, she developed fever and was found to have decreased oxygen saturation to 80s at room air at the NH and some confusion and was transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
She had denied chest pain, and reported mild sob.
Denied abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria.
She had been minimally mobile at NH and was taking heparin SQ TID for DVT prophylaxis.
And she had an elevated WBC to 15.
She had a head CT that did not show evidence of acute CVA.
But was empirically treated with therapeutic dose of lovenox after a D-dimer was found to be mildly elevated.
A chest CXR showed worsening pul edema, but given extensive lung mets, a consolidative process could not be ruled out.
She was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for UTI as well as possible pneumonia, and admitted to the floor.

Spinal fusion hardware in the mid thoracic region is unchanged in position.
Again seen are innumerable pulmonary nodules, compatible with known history of metastatic disease.
Since the [**2158-10-13**] examination, there has been interval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion and mild underlying pulmonary edema is present.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2158-10-22**] CT Head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process or evidence.
No evidence of metastatic disease, though please note MRI is more sensitive.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Ground-glass opacification in the right middle lobe likely reflects infectious process with new right greater than left small-to-moderate pleural effusions.
Unchanged left sixth rib, left pectoral and T11 vertebral body metastases with interval vertebral fusion, which is incompletely characterized.
No left lower extremity DVT above the knee.
Diffuse subcutaneous edema.
No left upper extremity DVT.
Diffuse subcutaneous edema.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, laterally directed jet of at least mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen (likely moderate 2+).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2158-10-24**]: MRI T/L spine: Metastatic disease to L3 vertebral body is again identified and unchanged.
Indentation on the thecal sac and moderate spinal stenosis is also seen at this level.
Fluid collection is identified in the upper lumbar posterior soft tissues at L1 level measuring 3 x 2.5 cm which likely is postoperative in nature, but MRI appearances alone cannot help in excluding infection in this postoperative collection and clinical correlation is recommended.
No evidence of retroperitoneal fluid collection, however, a large fluid collection in the subcutaneous fat posterior to the paraspinal region extending from L2-T10, larger than on MR from 2 days prior.
L3 compression fracture secondary to metastatic disease.
Lytic lesion within the posterior rib at the T8 vertebral level.
Multiple pulmonary metastatic nodules.
Bilateral pleural fluid, right greater left.
Possible kink in the centralv enous catheter on the scout, unchanged from prior CTA Chest - d/w RN taking care of pt by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2158-10-27**].
PENDING STUDIES: - Pleural fluid cytology - TSH - Pleural fluid beta2-transferrin and protein electropheresis - [**10-22**] Blood cultures pending, no growth to date - [**10-26**] Pleural fluid culture, no growth to date  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases who was discharged to NH from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-10-19**] after an admission during which she was diagnosed with extensive bony metastasis, and was treated with T9-L1 posterior fusion for unstable T11 metastasis.
On this admission, she presented with fevers, confusion, hypoxia and  felt to have sepsis due to UTI.
Hypotension: She was admitted with hypotension that was fluid responsive.
It was ultimately felt to be sepsis due to UTI.
Hypoxia: She has extensive pulmonary disease as evidenced by her CXR and CTA.
No evidence of PE as above.
She had the new development of pleural effusions felt to be either related to her spinal wound drainage or the fluid resuscitation in the ICU.
# Urinary tract infection:  Admission UA was consistent with infection.
Urine culture grew E Coli and Klebsiella both sensitive to cipro and Bactrim.
There was some concern for delirium induced by cipro and her antibiotics were changed to bactrim.
Wound drainage s/p Spinal Fusion:  She recently had spinal fusion on [**2158-10-11**] and her wound drained a large amount of serous fluid during her admission.
She had multiple imaging studies that showed a fluid collection around the wound.
There was concern that her new pleural effusions may be related to leakage of CSF.
Beta2 transferrin and PEP are pending at the time of discharge, which will help determine if the pleural fluid is CSF.
Metastatic renal cancer with mets:  Patient was recently found to have extensive bony mets and has reportedly had difficulties controlling pain.
Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease secondary to underlying cancer.
# HTN: Valsartan was held given episode of hypotension that responded well to fluid boluses.
She refused a chest film to confirm patency of indwelling chest port.
Delirium/Anxiety: She was mildly delirious during her admission with difficulty with attention.
She expressed a desire to focus on comfort, but a full discussion of hospice was deferred until her delirium improves.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Pending studies: TSH, blood culture, pleural fluid culture, cytology, beta2 transferrin and PEP - Needs neurosurgical/ortho-spine followup for her wound in 2 weeks.
