Developed fever and pulm infiltrate in weeks prior to transplant, s/p nondiagnostic VATS.
Post transplant course complicated by febrile neutropenia, respiratory failure requiring intubation, [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlusive disease w/ hepatic failure, acute renal failure, graft vs. host disease, seizures, small intracranial hemorrhage, transient episode of bradycardia/asystole of unclear etiology, and pericardial effusion.
Slowly recovered after extubation on [**6-28**] with mild residual confusion/delerium, stable [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlusive disease, recovery of renal function.
He remained neutropenic and pancytopenic on day 15 after therapy, and prophylactic antibiotics were started (Levaquin).
A repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**5-3**] that showed markedly hypocellular marrow with increased lymphocytes, plasma cells, and with background eosinophilic debris.
Obvious leukemic infiltration was not present, however in the absence of a cellular marrow smear it is difficult to ascertain complete absence of myeloblasts.
He had a line placed on [**5-19**] for initiation of the preparatory regimen with busulfan/cytoxan, started on [**5-23**], which he tolerated well with mild nausea and some diarrhea.
Methotrexate was not started secondary to his pleural effusion, which drained 700cc of bloody fluid on thoracentesis on [**6-22**].
Pt's course was complicated by several problems outline below, including graft vs. host disease and cyclosporine toxicity (see below).
There were no schistocytes on a smear, and a HIT ab was negative.
His low platelets could be secondary to splenomegaly.
He had been complaining of some left ear pain and sore throat at the time, as well as a productive cough.
A CT of the chest on [**4-26**] showed several ill-defined nodules in both upper lobes, mostly centrally located, with a single ill-defined nodule in the RML.
Ambisome was started on [**4-27**] for presumed pulmonary aspergillosis.
Additionally, he continued to spike and was found to have [**12-25**] blood culture bottles positive for diphtheroids on [**4-24**], sensitive to vancomycin.
A repeat CT scan on [**4-30**] showed worsening of the lung lesions, and ID recommended discontinuing flagyl and cefepime, and starting meropenem, in addition to a pulmonary consult.
A CT scan on [**5-3**] showed rapid progression of bilateral nodular masses which were then quite extensive in the upper lobes, L>R, as well as interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, and thus voriconazole was added to the antibiotic regimen.
The patient had a VATS on [**5-5**], the biopsy of which showed patchy acute and organizing pneumonitis with patchy accumulation of intraalveolar macrophages and fibrin, without evidence of malignancy, viral inclusions, or granuloma.
He continued to spike fevers up to 102, and had a repeat chest CT scan on [**5-10**] that showed continued increase in the size of the bilateral consolidations most prominent in the upper lobes, which was felt to be most consistent with continued progression of an infectious process such as aspergillus, [**Month/Year (2) 10305**], or PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also a slight interval increase in size of the L pleural effusion, which then appeared partially loculated, and the patient clinically worsened with new O2 requirement.
He temporarily improved, with decreased O2 requirement, but continued to have a productive cough.
PFTs on [**5-10**] demonstrated a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced diffusing capacity suggestive of an interstitial process.
A repeat CXR showed worsening of the L pleural effusion with LLL consolidation and RLL consolidation.
A repeat CT scan on [**5-21**] showed interval decrease in size of the bilateral consolidations most prominently seen in the upper lobes, with interval increase in size of left sided pleural effusion, with interval resolution of the small right sided pleural effusion.
His fever curve trended down on [**5-10**], and he was afebrile through his reinfusion on [**5-30**].
On [**6-2**] there was noted to be some erythema surrounding his TLC, therefore vancomycin was added.
On [**6-4**] (day 5 s/p MUD) the patient spiked a fever of 103 and flagyl was added for presumed C. Diff.
A CT of the sinuses was repeated, which demonstrated new opacification of the posterior left sphenoid sinus, which appeared consistent with mucosal thickening.
A CT of the chest/abd/pelvis at the same time showed persistent multifocal pulmonary opacities, most extensive in the upper lobes, slight decrease in the size of left pleural effusion, with persistent loculation in the upper left hemithorax, hepatosplenomegaly, and no evidence of colitis or enteritis.
The patient spiked up to 104.5 on [**6-5**] with rigors, at which time cefepime was also added and imipenem discontinued as it was thought he may have developed imipenem resistant organisms.
A sputum gram stain on [**6-6**] demonstrated gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, however he was already on vancomycin.
The patient was transferred to the ICU on [**6-9**] secondary to hypotension requiring pressor support, which was weaned off within 24 hours.
However, on [**6-12**] Mr. [**Known lastname 10304**] temp increased to 101.7 and he again became hypotensive requiring pressors.
IV Bactrim was started on [**6-13**] for stenotrophomonas coverage after he spiked a temp of 102.4 and became hypotensive requiring further pressors, however it was discontinued when his blood cultures came back negative and his platelets dropped.
Pt's respiratory function and presumed pulmonary aspergilliosis improved on ambisome.
Pt continued to have persistent fevers.
Pt [**Name (NI) 10306**] was changed on [**7-5**] d/t gram positive cocci bacteremia, treated with Vanco.
No evidence of herpes encephalitis on MRI.
Levaquin was discontinued on [**7-21**] as the patient had been afebrile for many days, without positive blood cultures.
Cefepime was started on [**7-25**], however was changed to aztreonam secondary to development of a rash that had also been previously noted with cefepime.
The CT thorax showed possible new lung nodules, however it was not clear as the study was difficult to compare to the previous CT scan.
The patient defervesced by [**7-26**], presumably secondary to the gancyclovir, and has been afebrile since.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  On [**4-27**] the patient complained of some chest pain and continued to spike a fever, therefore an echo was performed on [**4-28**] to assess for pericarditis, which was normal, without evidence of effusion or vegetations.
On [**6-9**], at the time of development of his [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlussive disease, with rapid development of ascites and massive fluid overload with presumed redistribution hypovolemia and decreasing urine output, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became hemodynamically unstable and had to be transfered to the ICU for pressor support and closer monitoring.
On [**7-4**], pt was bradycardic and had 17 seconds of asystole which spontaneously resolved.
Pt had no repeat episodes of pauses off metoprolol.
Echo on [**7-6**] showed moderate pericardial effusion, increased in size, but no evidence of tamponade physiology.
The patient developed tachycardia up to 150 just after receiving his dose of pentamidine on [**7-19**].
That night he was again found to be tachycardic up to 160.
An EKG at the time showed atrial flutter.
A repeat echo will be performed should the patient go back into a-flutter, to investigate the status of his pericardial effusion.
An echo was done on [**7-26**] that showed a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular invagination, right atrial collapse, and impending tamponade, therefore on [**7-27**] the patient had a pericardiocentesis that removed 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
The fluid was sent for culture and cytology - no evidence of infection or malignant cells were found.
[**Last Name (un) **] Occlusive Disease: On [**5-6**] the patient was noted to have a rising total bilirubin to 2.6 with abdominal distention and a palpable liver edge.
A RUQ US on [**5-9**] showed hepatosplenomegaly, as well as a large amount of sludge within the nondistended and otherwise unremarkable gallbladder.
On [**6-6**], Day 7 s/p MUD, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed hyperbilirubinemia, with RUQ pain and tenderness, and icterus, worrisome for rapidly progressive VOD.
Despite this, an US on [**6-7**] did not show ascites, and the liver appeared unchanged in size, and there was no reversal of blood flow.
His INR climbed to 2.4 that night, with elevated PT and PTT, and total bili of 5.3.
He developed shortness of breath that was thought to be secondary to rapid abdominal distention.
He also developed bilateral pedal edema, facial edema, and IVF were changed to keep vein open.
He was started on a defibrotide protocol on [**6-7**], and ambisome was decreased due to potential hepatotoxicity.
On [**6-9**] he had to be transfered to the ICU secondary to hemodynamic instability with blood pressures falling to 90/30, and heart rates into the 140s.
Normal flow [**7-14**] U/S and CT.  On [**7-29**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an acute elevation of his LFTs - AST 65, ALT 107, ALP 469, LDH 234.
Voriconazole was stopped secondary to concern for hepatotoxicity, and changed to caspofungin.
Pt's transaminitis likely d/t voriconazole in setting of cyclosporine, and improved by d/c.
DIARRHEA:  The patient had loose bowel movements from [**Date range (1) 10308**] that were negative for C. Diff.
The diarrhea seemed to resolve until the night before his reinfusion when he had 2 loose bowel movements.
After reinfusion, his diarrhea worsened, and he had 4-5 episodes of diarrhea on day 3.
The patient had diarrhea, thought to be secondary to graft versus host disease, that was responsive to solumedrol.
He did not have any diarrhea while in the ICU on Solumedrol and cyclosporine.
Pt remained diarrhea-free on steroids and cyclosporine through discharge.
Thereafter it slowly began trending down and his urine output was good, suggestive of non-oliguric ATN.
On [**6-7**], however, the patient was noted to have a new diffuse erythematous macular rash, thought to be a sign of GVHD.
Pt rash resolved with resolution of his GVHD, and he was rash-free for a couple weeks prior to discharge.
NEURO: On [**6-10**], while in the ICU, the patient was noted to have R gaze preference and progressive obtundation.
An MRI on [**6-11**] also demonstrated no acute intracranial pathology.
He continued to have occasional twitching of his left arm and eyelid suggestive of seizure that was responsive to ativan, and he was noted to be confused and agitated.
An EEG at this time showed frequent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing with a low voltage theta frequency background, consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
No epileptiform or lateralizing features were seen.
He was noted to be talkative and interactive s/p extubation, and his altered mental status was thus attributed to his hepatic and renal impairment which was resolving at the time of his improvement.
Pt had generalized tonic clonic seizures x 2 on [**2102-6-20**] in the ICU and was reintubated.
Pt had small focus bleed in right frontal sinus at the time, which was not thought to be the cause of his seizures.
Defibritide was held d/t risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, but restarted in a few days.
An MRI on [**7-11**] negative for mass lesion.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have a baseline level of confusion after transfer to the BMT floor on [**7-11**], however it worsened over the first week of [**Month (only) 4278**] to the point where his answers to questions were incoherent and he no longer knew in which hospital he was.
A repeat CT of the head was performed on [**7-22**] which showed hypodensity of the white matter in both parietal and occipital lobes, right worse than left.
Given the recent onset of these findings, and the history of cyclosporine administration, consideration of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome was suggested.
An MRI of the head was performed on [**7-23**] to further evaluate these findings, however the patient was uncooperative and it was therefore a poor study - it did again demonstrate hypointensity in the occipital and parietal lobes bilaterally.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did have an isolated elevated ammonia level at 115 on [**7-23**], however it was in the 20s on [**7-24**] and lactulose was not started.
Cyclosporine was discontinued on [**7-23**] because of cyclosporin toxicity as suggested by an MRI on [**7-23**] showing questionable edema in the occipital and parietal lobes bilaterally.
A repeat MRI on [**7-26**], which was not limited by pt uncooperation like the first study, showed no abnormal signal in the white matter to suggest cyclosporin toxicity.
Pt's mental state was back to baseline by [**7-28**] with only mild residual confusion.
However, on [**6-5**] nutrition recommended that he start supplemental TPN in addition to PO, as his PO had decreased s/p reinfusion secondary to nausea and vomiting, and on transfer to the ICU he was placed exclusively on TPN in early [**Month (only) **].
After transfer back to the BMT unit, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was strictly on TPN until he was cleared to eat by speech and swallow on [**7-17**], and he began taking in PO, very minimally secondary to poor taste.
VERTIGO:  The patient experienced a one time episode of vertigo while getting blood and while getting high dose ARA-C. Otoscopic examination was unremarkable.
He had an MRI with gadolinium which was negative for any abnormalities except for mastoid and sphenoid fluid.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient had a history of a visual field cut defect and optic disc swelling right greater than left.
They recommended an orbital MRI to rule out leukemic infiltrate.
The patient had a fine cut MRI of the orbits which was negative for a leukemic infiltrate or mass effect.
He also was noted to have a subconjunctival hemorrhage of the right eye on [**6-14**] that was seen by ophthalmology and presumed to be secondary to low platelets.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (M7) s/p allo matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant on [**2102-5-29**] Complicated by: 1.
Repiratory Failure requiring intubation 2.
Febrile neutropenia 3.
Vaso-oclusive Disease with hepatic failure 4.
Acute renal failure 5.
Small frontal intracranial hemorrhage 7.
Pericardial effusion   Discharge Condition: Pt was in stable condition on discharge.
He was afebrile for > 2 weeks, without diarrhea or rash, and his mentation continued to clear during the weeks prior to discharge.
Return to the hospital if you experience any fevers, chills, diarrhea, rash, abdominal pain or cramping, confusion, shortness of breath, palpitations, change in mental status, bright red or black stools, seizures, acute loss of limb strength, pain or burning with urination.
Do not wear any body lotion or excessive jewelry.
