She is now status post her second Arimidex with progression of disease and status post Taxotere, Adriamycin, and Navelbine.
The patient also noticed some dyspnea with lying flat as well as with any activity.
Patient denies any pain, denies any stridor, denies any other chest pain, denies bony pain, denies passing out, denies cough, denies fever or chills.
She has metastatic disease to her lung, liver, and bones.
She had malignant pleural effusions in 12/[**2112**].
Cervical cancer at age 20 status post cone removal.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, pleasant, no acute distress.
Facial plethora noted with periorbital edema and erythema.
Her neck is supple with distended neck veins.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  She has right greater than left upper extremity diffuse swelling; non-pitting edema; no cyanosis; 2+ distal pulses.
Neuro exam: Cranial nerves II-XII intact; awake, alert, and oriented times three; 5/5 strength upper and lower extremities; lower extremities show no calf tenderness; no swelling of her lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA OR STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 5.0, hematocrit 35.1, platelets 231, Chem-7 unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed no consolidation, no widening of the mediastinum, no effusion, no lymphadenopathy noted.
CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but showed a 3 cm SVC thrombus with retrograde flow through azygous and lumbar veins returning to the heart via the inferior vena cava.
No evidence of pulmonary consolidation.
CT head also done in the Emergency Department showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  49-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to lungs, liver, and bone apparently on Xeloda and Herceptin being admitted for superior vena cava syndrome secondary to thrombus.
Given the patient's significant symptoms of dyspnea as well as facial swelling, she was started on a TPA infusion for a total of 24 hours.
The patient was monitored for signs of bleeding.
The repeat CTA showed complete clearance of clot along wall of the superior vena cava and a very small filling defect.
There was a fibrin sheath or residual clot--it was unclear--along the terminal portion of the Port-A-Cath just above tip.
Given the small filling defect and likely fibrin sheath on the Port-A-Cath, further intervention was considered with Interventional Radiology as well as Surgery.
There was thought that the current catheter placement was likely causing some vessel wall injury which led to the clot formation.
After approximately one month of full anticoagulation, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is the Surgical consult, agreed to advance the catheter into the right atrium to avoid further vessel injury and likely further clot formation.
In addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended to avoid sclerosing agents to be used in the Port-A-Cath, which may cause additional vessel wall injury and possible clot formation.
The patient's blood counts were followed closely without any evidence of neutropenia or anemia.
The patient had an MRI of her pelvis done to evaluate her persistent hip pain.
The patient's pain was fairly well controlled with her Fentanyl patch and p.r.n.
Code status:  Patient preferred not to have heroic measures done and instructed the house status to make her Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate, as well as she provided a health care proxy form, which is her husband, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
Superior vena cava clot with associated superior vena cava syndrome.
Metastatic breast carcinoma.
