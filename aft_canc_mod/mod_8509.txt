Admission Date:  [**2184-8-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-8-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-9-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing / Thimerosal / Carboplatin / Taxol / Erythromycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, cough, nausea, emesis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central catheter placement nasogastric tube placement  History of Present Illness: 54 year old female with recurrent ovarian cancer, recently d/c'd on [**8-3**] with gastritis/esophagitis, who presented on [**8-7**] with increasing SOB, cough, nausea and vomiting x 3 days and acute onset bilateral edema.
Per the patient, she had experienced no diarrhea with the nausea and emesis and instead noted decreased ostomy output.
No BRB in ostomy output.
She has baseline SOB due to asthma but she felt that this had worsened over the 1-2 weeks prior to admission, particularly with exertion.
No orthopnea or PND, but worse when lying on her sides (either side).
+ sinus congestion in week preceding admission.
No fevers, chills.
Of note, she had received desensitization for carboplatin on [**8-5**] with a significant amount of IVF and her primary oncologist felt that she was fluid overloaded and she was sent in for diuresis and electrolyte monitoring.
In the ED course she had a leukocytosis, elevated lactate to 3.6, hypokalemia, and an elevated pro BNP.
CTA for PE was negative but demonstrated bilateral ground glass changes and nodular opacities consistnent with acute infection, with atypical vascular congestion being more unlikely.
A central line was placed for concern of sepsis and she was given 3L given, cx sent, and vanc/cefepime/fluconzole/flagyl were started.
She was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis where broad spectrum antibiotics were continued.
CT abd/pelvis showed SBO and NGT placed, bowel rest.
Cefepime was changed to levofloxacin on [**8-8**] and vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued today ([**8-9**]) due to clinical improvement.
Bilateral LE U/S performed for LE edema which showed no evidence of DVT.
Due to nausea/emesis/abd pain/elevated bilirubin RUQ US obtained which showed contracted gallbladder completely filled with sludge and tiny [**Known lastname **] and no evidence of cholecystitis.
ECHO was performed to evaluate etiology of LE edema and showed hyperdynamic EF, small pericardial effusion, no significant change from prior.
Currently on the floor she has mild SOB with positional changes that responds to albuterol treatments.
No hemoptysis.
Nausea and vomiting has remarkably improved and she is tolerating clears without difficulty.
+18lb weight loss in last 2 months d/t decreased appetite.
No current sinus or nasal congestion.
No sore throat.
Mild dysphagia initially after removal of NGT this afternoon, now improved.
No abdominal pain, dysuria.
Oncologic History: She was originally diagnosed in [**2180-4-20**] with stage III C adenocarcinoma of the ovary.
She received two cycles of Taxol and carboplatin, but had a severe platinum allergic reaction requiring a switch to Doxil and Taxol for several additional cycles of second line therapy.
She then developed mucositis on this regimen and received 5 additional cycles of single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Taxol.
She developed a large bowel obstruction during her fifth cycle which required a  diverting ileostomy performed on [**2183-11-21**].
She subsequently received four cycles of Halichondrin B as part of the 06-125 protocol, but had progressive disease and was taken off the protocol on [**2184-4-1**].
Family History: She had a maternal grandmother with heart disease who at the age of 83 developed colon cancer.
There is no other cancer in her family.
Her father had a gastric ulcer and died of renal artery stenosis.
Physical Exam: VS: 95% on RA, 96.8, 18, 95, 112/55 GEN: comfortable, NAD, conversive, eating broth HEENT: PRRLA, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, OP clear Neck : supple, unable to assess JVD on right d/t line but flat on left, no [**Doctor First Name **] CV: tachy, RR, no M/R/G PULM: Decreased BS bilaterally at bases, R>L, no wheezes, no crackles GI: soft, minor tenderness around umbilicus, no reboung or guarding, no tap tenderness, ileostomy in place and draining actively while in room EXT: 4+ edema b/l to thighs, pulses palpable, no cyanosis, clubbing NEURO: AAOx3.
This demonstrates small- bowel obstruction with transition point just proximal to the stoma site.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral ground glass change and nodular opacities likely represent acute infection.
Consider opportunistic infection based on immune status.
Atypical edema is a less likely cause for these findings.
Mediastinal lymph nodes have progressed in size, though a component of this may be reactive.
Dilated fluid filled esophagus may represent more distal obstruction in the abdomen.
Evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen incompletely evaluated.
LE U/S Bilat 8/20: No evidence of DVT .
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 54 year old female with recurrent ovarian ca who presented with SOB, cough, nausea, emesis, and edema who was found to have SBO and pneumonia.
#)SBO - Upon admission the patient was found on CT Abdomen to likely have a small bowel obstruction with transition point at the site of her ostomy.
Her diet was slowly advanced until she was tolerating solids and liquids without difficulty.
Complicating her course in the last several months has been chronic appetite loss as well as chronic nausea.
#) PNA - The inital concern was for aspiration pneumonia in the setting of nausea and vomiting.
#) Esophagitis - She was recently hospitalized for esophagitis, and fluconazole was continued throughout her stay for concern for [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.
#) LE edema - She had no evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction on ECHO.
Also, she had no obvious pelvic or abdominal mass causing lymphatic obstruction/venous obstruction secondary to ovarian CA and mets.
Most likely cause of edema is hypoalbuminemia in the setting of very poor nutritional status, which was exacerbated by fluid load from chemotherapy/   Medications on Admission: MEDS AT HOME: 1.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
