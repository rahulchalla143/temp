Admission Date:  [**2168-8-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-8-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-3-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine, [**Location (un) **] Firm HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma (stage III, non-small cell lung cancer) sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for upper gastrointestinal bleed.
During preparation for nasogastric lavage in the Emergency Department, the patient had an episode of hematemesis of approximately 500 cc of frank blood.
He denied any bright red blood per rectum, melena, or hematemesis previous to this episode.
However, he did complain of some lightheadedness and dizziness prior to admission.
He was noted to have a drop in hematocrit from 38 earlier in the month to 31 while in the Emergency Department.
On initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy, grade II varices were seen with no active bleeding, portal gastropathy, and a clot in the fundus of the stomach.
During the administration of the packed red blood cells, the patient developed fever and tremors, and the transfusion was discontinued.
On the second esophagogastroduodenoscopy it was assumed that the source of bleeding was from esophageal varices and these were banded.
Hepatitis C diagnosed in [**2154**].
Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in [**2166**] with increasing acid-fast bacillus (2714 to 62,605 over the last two months).
Stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Right upper lobe lung resection secondary to non-small cell lung cancer; status post chemotherapy.
His sclerae were mildly icteric.
He had mild oral icterus.
No thyromegaly.
His chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally except for decreased breath sounds at the right base.
He had an intact well-healed surgical scar at the right posterior thorax.
There were no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
His abdomen was soft and distended.
He had a positive fluid wave as well as shifting dullness.
He had palmar erythema and spider angiomas were present on his chest.
He had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
On neurologic examination, he was alert and oriented times three, and there were no gross motor or sensory deficits.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray on [**2168-8-1**] revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
No free air under the diaphragm.
A chest x-ray on [**2168-8-3**] revealed bilateral pleural effusions, loculated right effusion, bilateral basilar atelectasis.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 59-year-old male with hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleed from esophageal varices; status post non-small cell lung carcinoma resection of the right upper lobe.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was seen in the Emergency Department and initially presented for abdominal pain with decreased appetite and early satiety.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient had hematemesis of approximately 500 cc.
He has no history of prior gastrointestinal bleeds.
The patient had previously been diagnosed with portal hypertension (per abdominal imaging) but had no esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed prior to this admission.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy times two with esophageal varices banding.
No active bleeding was seen; however, there was a clot in the fundus of the stomach which was unable to be manipulated to examine for sources of bleeding within the stomach.
The patient had bloody/melanotic stools for two days after banding, but no blood or melena was noted the two days prior to discharge.
When transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells, the patient developed fever and tremors, and the transfusion was stopped.
Investigation of this transfusion reaction indicated a nonhemolytic transfusion reaction, and no contraindications exist to subsequent blood product transfusions.
The patient's baseline hematocrit at the beginning of this month was 38; which fell to approximately 30 on admission, and dropped as low as 26.
secondary to possible megablastic anemia.
Thrombocytopenia was also thought secondary to liver disease and was stable throughout his hospital course.
ASCITES:  Per clinic note at the beginning of the month, the patient was without appreciable ascites.
However, on presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient had an extremely distended abdomen with shifting dullness and a positive fluid wave.
On [**2168-8-3**], a diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis was performed at bedside which revealed a polymorphonuclear neutrophil count of approximately 500; however, no organisms were seen on Gram stain or grew out in cultures.
He was treated with cefotaxime as well as ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Due to acute presentation of ascites over the period of this month, the patient underwent Duplex Doppler of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out portal vein thrombosis.
On examination, no portal vein thrombosis was seen.
Of note, the gallbladder had a few stones and an edematous wall; however, no other signs of acute cholecystitis.
Diffuse hypodense lesions were also seen in the liver, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA:  The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis C in [**2154**] and hepatocellular carcinoma within the last year.
The patient has had a dramatic increase in AFP over the last two months, increasing from 2714 to 62,605.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a low-grade fever of approximately 100 to 101 over the first few days of his hospital course.
Numerous etiologies of low-grade fever existed including possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, atelectasis, tumor fever, or unknown infectious source.
He never mounted an elevated white blood cell count.
Therefore, he was treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with a combination of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime.
The patient had a minimal oxygen requirement following extubation which improved with incentive spirometry use.
Bilateral effusions were seen on chest x-ray; dated [**2168-8-3**].
There was no layering of fluid.
However, a loculated effusion was seen in the right apex as well as fluid in the major fissure.
It was deemed that there was not enough fluid present for a thoracentesis, and no further action was taken during this hospitalization.
Esophageal varices; status post banding.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Loculated right-sided pleural effusion, status post partial pneumonectomy.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy scheduled for [**2168-8-18**] at 1 p.m. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42908**] for possible repeat banding.
