He has been treated with intravesical BCG as well as BCG and Interferon and his most recent bladder biopsy demonstrates persistent multifocal CIS.
The patient had a preoperative stress test which showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia.
He had mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.
Two JPs were left in place as well as bilateral ureteral stents.
It was likely that the obstruction in part was due to the ostomy appliance material.
A CT urogram was obtained on postoperative day number six which showed no ureteral leak.
The patient also complained of some right leg weakness.
This was initially presumed to be due to epidural placement.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a rule out MI protocol immediately postoperatively which showed elevated CKs up to 6,000; however, his CK MB was 22 for an MB index of 0.4.
He was kept on telemetry for monitoring.
On postoperative day number eight, he experienced postprandial epigastric discomfort which resolved with Tums; however, given his significant cardiac history and diabetic history, a second rule out MI protocol was performed which showed nonspecific T wave inversions in V1 through V3; however, his enzymes were negative.
Sips were begun on postoperative day number seven and his diet was advanced without difficulty.
As stated under cardiac, the patient experienced epigastric discomfort on postoperative day number eight.
At this point, a loopogram will be obtained prior to discharge to evaluate for ureteral leak.
for DVT prophylaxis.
He again started complaining of right lower extremity pain on postoperative day number nine.
He had a slight increase in leg swelling, 1+ pedal edema on the right compared to none on the left.
His pain was diffuse including his anterior and posterior leg as well as his thigh.
He reported having a history of right lower extremity pain as well as some asymmetrical swelling ever since back surgery many years ago.
Although the clinical suspicion for DVT was low, LENIs were obtained on the date of discharge.
