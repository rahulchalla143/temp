Admission Date:  [**2187-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-8-17**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Increased shortness of breath and malaise  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catherization and stent in RCA, LMCA, and LAD  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 80 y/o M with a h/o metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell CA, GERD who presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with 2-3 days of increasing SOB and fatigue, saying he was "gasping" for air by the time he got to the hospital.
At [**Hospital1 **], had elevate CK, MB, TnI and a CXR indicating possible pneumonia and mild CHF and was started on B-blocker, nitro drip, ASA, lasix, ceftazidime/azithromycin.
A CT of his torso showed mediastinal LAD, hilar LAD, B/L pleural effusions, multiple pleural calcifications c/w prior asbestos exposure, B/L LL infiltrates, RUL infiltrate, and a R inguinal fluid collection.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt had a cath with cypher and hepacoat stenting of RCA, PTCA to LAD and LCx with hepacoat in LAD and distal LM, hepacoat to ostium of LM.
Pt's post cath course was complicated by two episodes of fever up to 101-102 with new diarrhea, RUL and RLL opacities.
Also, pt has bilateral pleural effusions, L>R, s/p left thoracentesis that does not support empyema, though with pleural fluid appearing transudative in nature.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2187-8-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
)CAD -- Pt was admitted with three vessel disease and severe left main disease.
Pt was considered to not be a surgical canidate given functional status and metasatic squamous cell CA.
Once the patient was on the floor, he was noted to be mildly hypotensive with systolics in the 80's (mentating well, producing urine) with a Cr of 1.2, so his ACE-I was held, with plans to restart as an outpatient.
Pt had no chest pain or SOB for the rest of the admission, no abnormalities on telemetry, and was considered stable for discharge.
However, given hypotension and Cr of 1.2, his ACE-I was held, and he was kept 0.5-1.0 liters positive for two days with no compromise of respiratory status, as it was felt he was hypovolemic.
He had bilateral pleural effusions that were tapped, and the analysis was most consistent with a transudate, no empyema, no malignant cells seen on cytologic exam.
Given the clinical findings and lab values, he was felt to be dry and the azotemia secondary to a prerenal etiology.
Diagnostic possibilities included pneumonia, infected pleural effusion, R. groin abscess secondary to a metastatic nodal site, and diarrhea/C difficile.
His blood and pleural fluid cultures were negative, his pleural fluid analysis had a pH of 7.46 making empyema unlikely, and his R. groin swelling had no pain, erythema, or pus.
An ultrasound of the right groin showed a fluid collection that could represent a hematoma or an abscess; surgery evaluated the right groin lesion and felt that it was unlikely to be infected.
He was treated for the two most likely items on this differential, the pneumonia and C. diff diarrhea, with levofloxacin for the pneumonia and metronidazole for the diarrhea.
By discharge, he'd been afebrile for greater than 48 hours.
)Squamous cell carcinoma -- Initially diagnosed [**2187-6-21**] by excisional bx at [**Hospital **] hospital, CT torso at [**Hospital1 **] showed necrotic mass in right groin.
Pt has had little work-up, but wants to be followed at [**Hospital1 18**].
A CT w/ constrast showed bilateral pleural effusions with consolidation in the right lower lobe, representing a pneumonia, an ill-defined nodular lesion in the medial portion of the left upper lobe measuring 2 cm in diameter, associated with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, multiple ill-defined patchy opacities with possible cavitations in left upper lobe, with underlying bilateral pulmonary edema(these ill-defined opacities can be a part of pneumonia, or pulmonary edema, or can be septic emboli, or metastases), multiple calcified pleural plaques suggesting asbesto exposure, and GB stones.
)Anemia -- Lab results came back with low Fe and TIBC and elevated ferritin, making chronic disease/inflammation anemia the most likely possibility.
This is probably related to his squamous cell carcinoma.
Squamous Cell Cancer of the penis with right inguinal metastasis.
Right groin complex mass measuring approximately 6.8 cm x 4 cm x  7 cm, with echogenic material and septations.
Bilateral density calcified pleural plaques, suggesting asbestos exposure.
Right sided pleural effusion - transudate.
PCI: Right Dominant circulation, severe LMCA and three vessel coronary disease, LMCA had a 60% ostial and 80% distal stenosis.
The LAD had a 99% ostial lesion and had diffuse moderate disease throughout.
The LCX had a 50% ostial lesion and an 80% mid lesion in the AVG LCX.
The RCA had serial ostial, proximal and mid lesions up to 80%.
Stenting of the RCA was peformed with a 3.0 x 33 mm Cypher (mid) and a 3.5 x 23 mm Hepacoat (ostial).
Discharge Condition: Fair  Discharge Instructions: Pleasw return to the emergency department for chest pain, shortness of breath, fever/chills, changes in mental status.
If your weight increases by two pounds, take 40mg of Lasix.
