She had also noted increasing abdominal distension, but without significant pain.
She has been tolerating the Avastin without any significant side effects and last received a dose on Wednesday.
She underwent a CT abdomen that showed SBO with transition point in distal jejunum/proximal ileum.

No scleral icterus.
Pulm: Fine crackles at bases anteriorly.
Derm: No skin lesions seen.
Findings consistent with a small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the distal jejunum/proximal ileum.
New centrilobular and patchy opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Stable soft tissue density in the left hilum, incompletely evaluated and may represent lymphadenopathy.
Stable pneumobilia and mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
Central hernia containing small bowel as well as transverse colon.
Stable bilateral adrenal masses consistent with metastatic disease.
There is suggestion of mild interstitial edema on today's study.
Left lower lobe consolidation is longstanding, probably atelectasis.
Pleural effusion is presumed, small on the left.
No pneumothorax.
There are no perinephric fluid collections.
There is no hydronephrosis.
No renal masses or stones are present.
A Foley balloon is present within a collapsed bladder which is grossly unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of left renal hydronephrosis.
Her NG tube continued to put out large volumes of feculent material during her admission.
Respiratory distress: Ms. [**Known lastname 55865**] developed increasing dyspnea and hypoxemia in the emergency department, and was therefore intubated.
Her respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to increased abdominal distension in addition to possible aspiration pneumonia.
Of note, she required O2 at home thought secondary to pulmonary metastases.
Oliguria The patient's urine output remained poor during her hospitalization, and responded only marginally to volume resuscitation.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction, and measurement of bladder pressures showed no evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome.
Small bowel obstruction 2.
