There has been priorthoracotomy with rib plating identified.
Aside from this, no definite consolidation is seen.
[**2177-1-30**]: Large right pleural effusion, largely predominantly layering, with associated atelectasis, as on the recent OSH CT. N.B.
That study demonstrates several significantly displaced posterolateral right rib fractures and the effusion measures up to 30 [**Doctor Last Name **] in attenuation and may represent an organizing hemothorax, related to trauma.
No pneumothorax is identified on that study.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3123**] was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on the night of [**2177-1-29**] with a right hemothorax and a flail chest from multiple rib fractures.
Rib plating, multiple ribs (5).
Primary repair of diaphragmatic laceration and Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
He was started on a ketamine and midazolam drip for better pain control.
He still remained hypotensive requiring placement of a right internal jugular TLC for continued pressor support.
An echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2).
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
He had a persistent cough which tesselon pearls and guaifensin cough suppressants were started with some improvement.
Chest-tubes: apical anterior and posterior chest tube were removed on [**2177-2-3**] and basilar chest tubes on [**2177-2-4**].
Chest films; he was followed by serial chest film which showed Mild vascular congestion Right pleural effusion is also stable.
Left lower lobe opacity is a combination of atelectasis and probably a large hiatal hernia.
He was started on low-dose beta-blockers sinus rhythm 70-90's without ectopy.
They recommended continue current regular diet with supplements and thin liquids, Meds whole with thin liquids and Monitor  for clinical signs of aspiration and/or PNA.
He voided small frequent amounts.
Post-void residual with > 1 Liter therefore the foley was replaced.
He was volume overloaded and was gently diuresed.
Will require monitoring to ensure hyponatremia remains stable/resolves.
His leukocytosis normalized without fevers.
On [**2177-2-8**] a 5 day course of Cipro was started for a UTI, Ucx showed E. Coli resistent to Cipro and was changed on [**2177-2-10**] to Cefpodoxime Proxetil 100 mg PO/NG Q12H.
Thrombocytopenia with platelet decrease to 76 with quick recovery likely from medication prior to d/c of subcutaneous heparin.
Pain: His pain was difficult to manage.
the acute pain service placed an Intrathecal morphine catheter at L3 on operative day.
He required a ketamine drip while in the ICU and transitioned to PO/IV Dilaudid still with poor pain management.
The Geriatric team was consulted and recommended change Dilaudid to Oxycodone with better pain control.
Multiple large ecchymotic sites from previous falls.
Transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with Coccyx with stage II decubitus 4 cm x 1cm.
No erythema or discharged.
