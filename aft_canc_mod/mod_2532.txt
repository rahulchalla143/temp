Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes.
Sinus tachycardia is present.
ST-T wave changes are slightly more pronounced.
CXR [**5-29**] - IMPRESSION: Post-surgical appearance with findings in the lower right hemithorax raising the possibility of herniated bowel loops and/or other intra-abdominal contents.
There is no definite consolidation.
Minimal inflammatory change in upper abomen likely represent postsurgical change.
no acute intraabdominal process.
[**6-2**] CXR FINDINGS: There is slight worsening to a right lower lobe consolidation.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**6-5**] Video Swallow: FINDINGS: There is slight worsening to a right lower lobe consolidation.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
6/16 Esophagus: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the esophagus and gastric conduit shows no evidence of leak or obstruction.
[**6-7**]  CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement.
The right-sided central access line is in unchanged position, the right-sided opacities and the left-sided pleural effusion have almost completely disappeared.
In the right lung, only a perihilar and a basal area of atelectasis subsist.
SVC venogram demonstrates tip of the catheter adheres to the vessel wall with presence of tight fibrin sheath.
[**6-13**] ECG Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-5-29**] no diagnostic change.
Residual atelectasis and/or pneumonia, the sequale of prior aspiration in the right lower lung region with adjacent small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal pulmonary opacities, most concentrated in the right upper lobe, but also involving both lower lobes, likely representing aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
Mild right lower lobe atelectasis.
Status post esophagectomy with debris in the intrathoracic stomach.
[**6-13**] blood cultures - coagulase negative staphylococcus [**6-13**] sputum cultures - Gram negative rods  [**6-14**] CXR (portable AP) FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-13**], the right pleural effusion and atelectatic change appear to have decreased.
No stricturing noted at the anastomotosis.
Pyloric dilatation allowed free passage of endoscope into the duodenum.
On HD 7 he had a video swallow and barium swallow that showed no esophageal leak and that patient would be okay to eat soft solids as long as he sat upright while eating.
On HD 10 he had explosive diarrhea and c.diff was negative.
He had a hypertensive episode requiring transfer to the TSICU on HD 25.
He experienced bouts of emesis throughout his hospitalization, for which a balloon dilation of the pylorus was performed on HD 26.
On discharge he was in good condition tolerating the tube feeds and frequent soft solid diet, having bowel movements, urinating, and ambulation without difficulty.
