Admission Date:  [**2144-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-9-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: CHF exacerbation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line placment Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 77-year-old male with history of DM Type II, CHF (last echo [**7-/2143**] with EF 20-30%, 1+ MR, 1+ AR, LAH), CAD s/p CABG [**2129**]/[**2132**] (unclear anatomy, not on file here), chronic LE edema, LE superficial ulcers, who presented with worsening dyspnea, increased abdominal girth x 2 days (baseline wt ~ 172 lbs => 176 on last check this week).
He describes progressive dyspnea on exertion x past two months, with cough productive of yellow-white sputum.
His shortness of breath is worse on exertion, now to NYHA class II level (not on rest or ADLs, but on moderate exertion).
No associated chest pain (his past MI prior to revascularization in [**2129**] was without chest pain), but does describe episodes of lightheadness/dizziness (not vertigo) on exertion.
Of note, had episode of unheralded syncope on Monday; no aura or neurologic, cardiac prodrome; did not remember falling to ground, woke up on ground later after undetermined period, no bowel/bladder incontinence, post-ictal confusion, tongue biting.
Recent office visit [**2144-10-20**] with ambulatory O2 sat 93 => 95-96% with exertion, but w/ + dyspnea symptoms requiring him to stop; had increase in girth prompting increase in bumex to 4 mg qd.
Of note, MIBI in [**3-/2143**] with ** reversible inferior defect **; never had LHC since CABG in [**2129**]/[**2132**].
Hypertension 2.

CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**] and [**2132**].
p-MIBI in [**3-/2143**] Partially reversible, moderate-severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the entire inferior wall and the inferior portion of the lateral wall.
This perfusion defect is slightly less severe and shows slight increase in reversibility as compared to [**2142-3-29**].
LV enlargement and global hypokinesis with EF of 21%.
Congestive Heart Failure: ECHO [**2-21**]: Lventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.

Physical Exam: T: 96.5 BP: 118/64 HR: 61 RR: 18 O2sats: 98% RA Gen: NAD HEENT: NC/AT; MMM; OP clear without lesions or exudate; PERRLA ; EOMI NECK: Supple, No LAD, Thyroid smooth and not enlarged, JVP not distended Lungs: CTA bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi or rales Heart: RRR, nl S1 and S2, no murmurs rubs or gallops Abd: Soft, NT, ND, NABS, no masses palpated Ext: No C/C/E; 2+DP/PT pulses bilaterally Skin: Warm and Dry Rectal: Normal rectal tone; brown guaiac negative stool Neuro: A&O x 3; CN II - XII individually tested and intact; strength 5/5 upper and lower extremities; sensation grossly intact in upper and lower extremities; 2+ reflexes in patella   Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2144-11-20**] Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral, inferior and inferoseptal akinesis with severe hypokinesis elsewhere.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is probably at least mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (however aortic valve area difficult to estimate given poor left ventricular stroke volume).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right ventricle now appears mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis.
Significant aortic stenosis is now detected.
EKG - NSR at 100, left axis deviation, 1' AVB, delayed RWP (new), non-specific IVCD/LBBB likely lead placement (had been LBBB on prior EKG, likely lead placement) .
CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST ([**2144-12-3**]): Mosaic pattern of pulmonary perfusion is unchanged from [**2143-12-30**].
There is new bibasilar atelectasis and a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are present, the largest of which measures 8 mm in short axis dimension.
There are extensive coronary artery calcifications.
A subcentimeter calcified nodule is present at the left lung base and there is a subcentimeter ill- defined nodule in the right middle lobe.
Several other nodules seen on the prior study are not seen in the current study, either resolved of subsumed in the atelectasis in the right lung.
Calcification of the right adrenal gland is stable.
Mosaic pulmonary perfusion unchanged since [**2143-12-18**], likely due to small airways obstruction.
New moderate size, nonhemmorhagic, layering, right pleural effusion and basal atelectasis.
Several small pulmonary nodules, unchanged from the prior study, others resolved or hidden in new atelectasis.
Followup non- contrast chest CT is recommended after treatment to confirm stability of these nodules.
Brief Hospital Course: Initial impression: Given slowly progressive nature of progressive exertional dyspnea, the patient's symptoms were felt to be most consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure.
In addition, given his persistently low EF, advanced (class III+) heart failure symptoms, his unheralded syncope was felt to be most likely progressive AS versus malignant ventricular arrhythmia.
Initial management was directed toward lowering his wedge pressure and further afterload reduction for resolution of his systolic heart failure.
In brief, his hospital admission involved unsuccessful diuresis on the general medical floor with bumex and zaroxolyn with nesiritide, with transfer to the coronary care unit for ultrafiltration.
FLOOR COURSE: Initially was restarted on digoxin and anti-hypertensives for afterload reduction in setting of acute decompensated heart failure.
Lower extremity ulcerations initially appeared infected, prompting initiation of oxacillin, which was stopped 2 days into course given normal white count and reassessment of lower extremities (at that point, changes were felt to be more chronic).
Myocardial infarction was ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.
Bumex 4 mg IV (his outpatient dose) was started, with poor diuresis, prompting addition of zaroxolyn for synergy.
He was noted to have paroxysmal episodes of NSVT and AT; given the heart failure, he was started on PO amiodarone for rhythm control.
Renal function continued to decline, with diuretic refractoriness, and he was transferred to the CCU on [**11-26**] for tailored therapy or CVVHF.
Lasix and zaroxolyn trial was attempted without success.
Given concern for conduction delay, tissue doppler imaging echo was obtained, which disclosed a septal-to-posterior wall motion delay od 306 ms; however, biventricular pacing was deferred given his pituitary adenoma (and likely reimaging) and active lower extremity ulcerations.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11-20**] disclosed new aortic stenosis (valve area 1.0, though calculated in setting of low-flow, low-gradient), 1+ MR, global LV hypokinesis, with ejection fraction 21%.
Chest CT was obtained for evaluation of right pleural effusion, and it was felt that by imaging and ultrasound, the right pleural effusion was too small to tap.
Digoxin was increased per renal (who discussed with his primary cardiologist, who felt that his digoxin level should be [**1-19**] for goal effect, per his past history).
Given his low ejection fraction, he was started on coumadin for a goal INR [**2-20**], and should have a repeat INR check within 3 days of discharge.
