Admission Date:  [**2142-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: AMS, left sided brain mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**4-30**]: Left craniotomy for tumor debulking.
History of Present Illness: 71 year old male with recent history of gradually increasing confusion without fevers or dysarthria.
The patient has been disoriented and presented to [**Hospital6 3872**] where he had a Head CT which revealed a 10 X 6 cm left sided mass with 12mm midline shift.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive NSURG care.
History difficult to obtain secondary to receptive aphasia.
Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam but has receptive aphasia and not following commands, normal affect.right sided neglect noted Orientation: Not oriented to person, place, and date.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
This demonstrates thick and irregular enhancing rind with heterogeneous internal signal, predominantly representing complex cystic necrosis with no significant hemorrhage, calcification or restricted diffusion.
There is accompanying large amount of vasogenic edema with mass effect 10.5 mm rightward shift of the normally midline structures, subfalcine herniation with "trapping" of the contralateral lateral ventricle and early left uncal but no downward transtentorial herniation.
This transgresses both the outer and inner table and is associated with focal dural thickening and enhancement of the subjacent dura.
The patient is status post left temporal craniotomy with post-surgical changes noted within the left temporal region including air and small foci of high density likely representing a tiny amount of postoperative blood.
There is surrounding low density within the left temporal lobe, unchanged from the prior study, likely representing residual edema.
Also noted is stable loss of sulcation within the left cerebral hemisphere, unchanged compared to the prior study.
The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right ventricle is mildly dilated, unchanged compared to the prior study.
No extra-axial fluid collections are identified.
Post-surgical changes are noted within the soft tissues of the left temporal region including a subgaleal left temporal seroma and overlying surgical clips.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted within the ethmoid sinuses with a small air-fluid level noted in the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval improvement in left to right midline shift, now measuring only 3.5 mm status post left temporal craniotomy and mass resection with post-surgical changes including pneumocephaly and a small amount of post-surgical blood noted in the resection bed.
Ethmoid and left maxillary sinus disease.
MRI Head [**5-1**](Post-op): FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there has been interval resection of the left temporal lobe enhancing lesion.
There is residual enhancement in the anterior inferior aspect of the operative cavity extending to the left periatrial region.
Findings is concerning for residual neoplasm.
There is an extra-axial collection at the left craniotomy site without significant mass effect.
There is opacification of the paranasal sinuses with fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus.
There is also left mastoid opacification.
There is no evidence for acute ischemia.
IMPRESSION: Post-operative changes in the left temporal lobe with probable residual neoplasm as detailed above.
There is no evidence for acute ischemia.
Mannitol was administered, decadron dose increased, and he was urgently taken to the operating room for a left sided craniotomy for tumor debulking.
He was electively intubated prior to the MRI wand study, and there was concern for his ability to protect his airway in a flat position given his lethargic state.
Post-op MRI was done on [**5-1**], which showed expected residual tumor.
On [**5-7**], the patient experienced a bout of confusion and agitation, when he traumatically removed his foley catheter.
This was reinserted for frank hematuria that resolved.
The urine was clear on [**5-9**] and the patient did not report any pain around the catheter.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Keppra for antiseizure prophylaxsis.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-8**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
