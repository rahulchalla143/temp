85 F h/o HTN, dCHF (EF=55-60%), [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical treatment of mass at splenic flexure discovered on sigmoidoscopy after small LGIB, likely adenoca.
Pt also seen by heme-onc for leukopenia, felt [**3-19**] infection and likely malignancy.
Post-operatively, she was extubated, however, ABG=6.84/193/157, c/w hypercarbic respiratory failure, felt [**3-19**] sedation.
Of note, pt recently hospitalized at OSH [**Date range (1) 56895**] for UTI, PNA, course c/b hypotension, bradycardia thought to be due to dehydration/sepsis.
She also developed pancytopenia which was presumed related to medication related(zosyn/levoflox) vs. myelosuprression from her underlying infection.
Pt was subsequently sent to rehab where she had an episode of bloody BM, readmitted to OSH where simoidoscopy noted circumferential mass, bx was c/w Adenoca as detailed above.

Hospital course  Complicated eldelry woman with a history of underlying hypertension, cognitive impairment and newly diagnosed colonic adenocarcinoma, s/p hemicoloectomy with primary anastamosis on [**3-/2112**].
Her post-op course was complicated initially by hypercarbic respiratory failure attributed to hypoventilation/CO2 narcosis, necessitating a short ICU course where she was successfully extubated and sent to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**].
Since arrival to the floor, there have been problems with her urine output bringing about some isotonic volume boluses resulting in total body overload.
Medicine was consulted for oligouria and found the patient to clinically have significant left-sided heart failure with use of her accessory muscles and hypoxemia (low 90's on 2L).
Upon review of her EKGs, it appears she has also had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation likely accounting in part for her decompensation.
