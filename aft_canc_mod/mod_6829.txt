The patient was in his usual state of health when he began to experience mild abdominal and rectal pain three weeks ago.
When he returned home, he continued to have persistent rectal pain, with a new cough and increasing shortness of breath and left-sided chest pain.
Specifically, his rectal pain was worsened with bowel movements and associated with constipation and LLQ crampy pain, and he noted scant red blood in his stools after bowel movements.
His chest pain was described as sharp and worsened with activity and with coughing, but without nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or radiation to the back or arms.
A rectal exam revealed a new mass, which was biopsied under general anesthesia, results are pending.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed mild diverticulitis.
CXRs cleared over the course of antibiotic therapy, and the patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course.
Heme-onc was consulted, and performed a bone marrow biopsy, which [**Name8 (MD) **] MD sign-out showed "mild blasts on flow cytometry"; however, it was felt that this was likely demargination from steroids, C.diff, and PNA.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f [**Hospital 80861**] transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies for the patient's hypoxia were thought to include pneumonia, PE, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and leukostasis.
He was empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn, and though he had a negative D-dimer and V/Q scan at [**Hospital3 3583**] an ECHO and LENIs were attained and demonstrated no evidence of right heart strain or DVT.
He was also started on hydroxyurea to prevent leukostasis, though the heme/onc service thought that this was unlikely to be the etiology for his hypoxia and CXR infiltrates.
Pulmonary function test were performed which showed mild restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity.
This was attributed to infection and steroid-effect causing massive demargination in the setting of known CMML.
C. diff:  Diagnosed four days after starting antibiotics at [**Hospital3 3583**] and treated with po vancomycin per renal reccs by their consult service because of his renal insufficiency.
Rectal mass:  Patient was found to have a rectal mass that was biopsied by the surgical service under anesthesia (secondary to significant pain) at [**Hospital3 3583**].
The mass was concerning for squamous cell carcinoma per report and the biopsy results are pending at the time of discharge.
It was decided that the anal cancer took priority over the CMML given the danger of obstruction.
Has not previously received chemotherapy for this, but started on hydroxyurea for leukocytosis as described above.
Incidentally, the etiology of the patient's CMML may be related to her history of cyclophosphamide for membranous nephropathy.
