Admission Date:  [**2102-11-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-12-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2040-2-29**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman who presented as an outpatient with left flank pain and a 20-pound weight loss over a 5-month period.
A CT scan at that time revealed a left renal mass with apparent tumor thrombus in the left renal vein.
A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed this finding and also noted that this mass extended into the vena cava.
A CT of the head and lungs, as well as a bone scan, did not demonstrate any obvious metastatic disease; however, there were several lung nodules which were not definitely excluded as representative of metastatic disease.
After discussions with medical oncology and urology attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was determined that the patient would undergo a left radical nephrectomy with excision of the tumor thrombus in the vena cava as well as a perirenal lymph node dissection.
On [**11-24**], the patient went to the operating room and an uncomplicated left radical nephrectomy with a left renal vein tumor thrombectomy as well as a left periaortic lymph node dissection.
The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful with the exception of a transient elevation of her bilirubin thought to be secondary to a transfusion reaction from the 8 units of packed red blood cells that she received during the operative procedure.
Her pain was well controlled, and she was ambulating independently.
Her alkaline phosphatase, however, was slightly increased; again, thought to be secondary to transfusion reaction.
The Pain Service came up with a regimen of a Fentanyl patch with the addition or oral Dilaudid for breakthrough pain as her outpatient regimen.
The patient was discharged on [**12-1**], postoperative seven, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient's pathology report subsequently revealed renal cell carcinoma (a clear-cell type, grade III) demonstrating invasion through the capsule into the perinephric fat with venous invasion; 0/2 perihilar nodes were positive for malignancy; [**3-14**] periaortic nodes were positive for malignancy.
for breakthrough pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney with tumor thrombus into the vena cava, status post left radical nephrectomy and left renal vein thrombectomy.
