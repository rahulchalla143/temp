The pain would come on consistently after dinner and be substernal and feel like burning.
He would then get a "funny" feeling down the lateral aspects of his arms and also start to have some tingling in his gums.
The pain would last for approx 40 minutes and then go away.
He tried both tums and nitro and got no relief.
On [**8-31**] he presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with these complaints and was ruled out by EKGs and enzymes.
He was worked up for atypical chest pain.
He was started on prednisone for inflammation and doxycycline for possible lymes disease (sounds like he had a positive culture).
He was discharged to home when two days ago he had the pain again.
Substernal, radiating to arms, no diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
He had positive Troponin rise, negative CK, and possible new EKG changes with ST depressions.
On ROS he does endorse six months of increasing dyspnea on exertion, fatigue and inability to get very far without needing to sit down.
No fevers or chills or changes in weight.

There is also gyriform hyperdensity with the same differential and a possiblity of a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
with associated moderately extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Large acute infarction with extensive hemorrhagic transformation in the right middle cerebral artery territory.
Small acute infarction in the right anterior cerebral artery territory.
Successful revascularization of the right internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries    Brief Hospital Course: He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**Date range (1) 93609**] with chest pain and diaphoresis which did not respond to SL Nitro x3.
Per the cardiology admission note, he was also "started on prednisone for inflammation and doxycycline for possible lyme disease."
However, he continued to have substernal burning chest pain radiating into his bilateral arms over the past week.
He returned to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where CEs showed CK 164, CK-MB 5.1, and TropT 0.1, and EKG per report showed old q in inferior leads, some 1mm elevations, lateral ST depressions.
He was found to have a dense left hemiplegia and decreased responsiveness.
The patient was found to be awake but with decreased alertness, left facial droop, left hemiparesis, left eye deviation, and dysarthria.
Head CTA and CTP showed complete occlusion of the cervical and intracranial right ICA and of the right MCA, the right ACA is patent, likely supplied by the anterior communicating artery, subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and a large area of matched decreased cerebral blood volume and flow in the right middle cerebral artery territory, consistent with a large acute infarction, no evidence of hemorrhage.
MRI/MRA head showed a large acute infarction with extensive hemorrhagic transformation in the right MCA territory, small acute infarction in the right ACA territory, and successful revascularization of the right ICA and MCA.
Repeat Head CTs showed increased mass effect and right uncal herniation, and he was started on Mannitol.
TTE showed LVEF 40%, no thrombus/mass in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LV, no ASD or PFO.
USG of the legs no evidence of venous thrombosis.
EEG [**2170-9-26**] showed asymmetry with low voltage activity over the right side, and overall diffuse encephalopathy.
He had some fluctuations in his mental status due to infection (see below) and remained significantly abulic.
At times during his stay, he complained of chest pain, but cardiac enzymes were always unremarkable and EKG was unchanged.
After extubation he was found to have persistent high respiratory rate (20-32).
As this was concerning for pulmonary embolism, he underwent two consecutive chest CTA; both revealed a small lesion in the lower segment of the left inferior lobe.
He had a fever [**2170-9-21**] and was diagnosed with a pseudomonas UTI.
His diabetes was managed by [**Last Name (un) **], with lantus, humalog, and oral hypoglycemics.
He had a loose left front tooth, which was extracted on [**2170-9-24**] without complications.
He passed his swallow study but he was waxing and wanning in his mental status and not holding well the PO intake.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Coronary Artery Disease 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Left inferior pulmonary embolism 6.
Urinary tract infection 7. loose tooth status post extraction .
Diabetes 2.
Hypertension 3.
Positive Lyme titer   Discharge Condition: He was abulic, preferring to keep his eyes closed (even when awake), with decreased but appropriate speech output, ability to follow commands with his right side, left neglect, and a dense left hemiparesis.
Your pain was also relieved by nitro, again making us think it was related to your heart.
You did well and only had the recurrence of chest pain once.
After your doctors noted that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] presented fast breathing, and you were found to have pulmonary embolism.
Although you passed the swallow evaluation you had significant fluctuation of your mental status, which required a tube in your stomach, so you can receive your medications and feeds consistently.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital for any new weakness, numbness, tingling, visual changes, loss of consciousness, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fainting, nausea, vomiting or any other conerns.
