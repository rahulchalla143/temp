The history regarding his melanoma and seizures is listed below.
He has had trouble swallowing his pills, and coughing when he drinks.
He has persistent L arm and face weakness that has slowly worsened over time, though he can still walk around by himself (was walking the morning of admission).
He had been having OCD-like symptoms on Keppra, which had been started for further seizure control as PHT had not been controlling the seizures.
At 1:30pm, his wife witnessed a prolonged seizure-like episode lasting 20-25 minutes - with R hand shaking and L leg shaking.
He was taken to [**Hospital6 302**] where a head CT showed some "slightly" increased edema and hemorrhage at the site of a known hemorrhagic met in the R frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was transferred here.
He has been sleepy and not saying much since the event; he has persistent L arm and face weakness.
On ROS, his wife and sister do not think he has had fever; he has had HAs recently but did not think he had HA today; no coughing, no GI/GU complaints, no respiratory complaints except coughing when he eats or drinks sometimes.
Past Medical History: -Melanoma Hx: -- had moles removed few years ago, stage II melanoma, s/p resection with "clean margins" thought cured, no chemo -- presented this year with slight L facial droop, diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, mets to brain discovered -- s/p craniotomy with resection R frontal lesion, still had deeper, contralat lesions -- s/p gamma knife at RIH/Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 39706**] for other lesions -- Hemorrhage in met [**8-27**] had p/w difficulty talking; hospitalized, had PNA and DVTs (wife denies PE, but Dr.[**Name (NI) 23016**] notes detail that he did have PE); s/p filter in each leg (one clotted off) -- Mesenteric mass [**10-19**] with bx consistent with melanoma -- Seizures started [**10-3**] - GTC 3-5 minutes, on PHT; subsequent sz associated with low PHT levels, several hospitalizations at [**Hospital3 15433**] for this; had been started on Keppra -- On decadron since [**11-27**] again after another seizure -- Was taken off Keppra [**11-2**] after obsessive-compulsive sx noted by family, saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] for first time, Lamictal started  Other PMH: -HTN -Anemia -Depression -High cholesterol (recently off meds for this) -kidney stones  Social History: Lives with wife, taking medical leave from work - respiratory therapist at [**Hospital6 302**].
No etoh, no drugs.
Physical Exam: Admission exam: T 99.9  HR 100  BP 119/75  RR 22  100%RA General appearance: lethargic, sweaty, white male HEENT: mildly dry mucus membranes Neck: supple, no bruits Heart: regular rate and rhythm, no obvious murmurs Lungs: diminished to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs Extremities: warm, well-perfused  Mental Status: The patient keeps eyes closed for most of exam, opens eyes spontaneously at end of interview - says "I have to use the bathroom" - voice very soft and slightly hoarse.
Eye movements normal with OCR, but pt had R gaze preference, eyes usually midline to R, no nystagmus.
Facial movements are significant for L facial droop (UMN).
No tremor, could not assess drift due to pt's participation.
Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are brisk and symmetric throughout, with no clonus or crossed adductors; both toes are upgoing.
Pertinent Results: Labs: 144 | 104 | 24 / 158    AGap=13 3.1 | 30  |0.9 \ Ca: 8.7 Mg: 1.5 P: 4.2 Phenytoin: 20.1  19.6 \ 11.4 / 218      / 34.0 \  PT: 14.8  PTT: 20.3  INR: 1.3  Imaging CT [**12-4**]: 3x3.5 cm right frontal metastasis surrounded by vasogenic edema, more extensive when compared with [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] [**11-2**].
Large mass arising from the body of the pancreas with atrophy of the pancreatic tail.
There is an adjacent large lobulated mass, which likely represents consolidative lymphadenopathy.
These findings are most consistent with metastatic melanoma.
A primary pancreatic neoplasm is less likely.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
[**12-6**] - CXR -IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yo man with metastatic melanoma with metastases to brain, presented with likely seizure and was transferred here when OSH scan showed slight increase in edema and hemorrhage right frontal known lesion, and new left insular lesion.
On exam, he was very lethargic, with otherwise worsening of baseline deficits (weakness on L, relative aphasia) which could be persistent postictal state versus mental status changes from increased edema associated with metastasis, versus underlying infection.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:  1. seizure: likely secondary to his metastasis and increasing edema/hemorrhage.
And treated for infection (see below).
Patient remained seizure free thereafter.
2. brain metastasis w/ edema: Given the increase in edema, he was put on a higher dose of decadron.
ID: Patient febrile and had leucocytosis with bandemia on admission so in setting of seizures was started on zosyn.
Elevated amylase, lipase: nl on admit, no abdominal pain, with elevated amylase after radiation, quickly trended down.
acute parotitis with hyperamylesemia following WBXRT.
clinical exam unlikely acute pancreatitis.
