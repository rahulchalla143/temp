ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (per primary oncologist's note, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 410**]): [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old man who was diagnosed with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in [**2175-1-5**] and received 8 cycles of CHOP plus Rituxan.
At the time of this diagnosis, he was also diagnosed with a renal cell carcinoma for which he underwent unilateral left complete nephrectomy and this was thought to be curative therapy.
In late [**2175-7-5**], he again felt febrile and repeat CT of the abdomen revealed new or increased adenopathy in the left internal and external iliac groups, the largest area being 24 mm.
He also had some liver lesions, which were suspicious for metastatic disease (lymphoma versus renal cell carcinoma) and splenomegaly.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent a CT of the torso showing multiple abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum,extending to the left common and external iliac chains to the left inguinal ring, highly concerning for recurrent lymphoma.
There are multiple ill-defined liver lesions, very symptomatic metastatic disease and small volume ascites.
There is a thin band of enhancing soft tissue in the left nephrectomy bed, worrisome for locally recurrent renal cell carcinoma and a cluster of central lobular nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 7 mm in size.
There was also a 4-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule seen.
Biopsy of a left iliac lymph node showed involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
He developed asterixis, negative myoclonus, inattentiveness and somnolence after the second dose of ifosfamide and third dose was delayed by one day.
He was readmitted with febrile neutropenia secondary  to C. difficile colitis on [**2175-9-4**], treated with oral vancomycin  and flagyl, and discharged on [**2175-9-11**].
He was readmitted on [**2175-9-25**] for his second cycle of R+ICE, but found to have c.diff colitis at that time and was discharged to home with po vancomycin.
Prostate cancer - biopsy on [**2174-8-26**] revealed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia - Renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed [**1-/2175**] after routine work-up  including CT scan; s/p nephrectomy (considered curative) .
Other active problems: - Pancytopenia - Findings on CT [**2175-8-14**] concerning for locally recurrent renal  cell carcinoma, recurrent lymphoma (retroperitoneal nodes extending down int/ext iliac chains), lesions in liver (?
Was a motor mechanic but could not tolerate the eczema.
Mother had diabetes and breast cancer, still alive with "lazy blood cancer".
OSH documents describe his mother's "myelodysplastic syndrome, 5q minus syndrome and low-grade lymphoma involving bone marrow as well as monoclonal gammopathy consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35852**]".
Half-sister (by his mother) with diabetes, obesity and poor self-care, is deceased.

No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy that would be concerning for recurrence, with marked interval improvement of previously noted lymphadenopathy in retroperitoneum and left pelvic region as seen on CT from [**2175-8-14**].
Previously noted band of enhancing soft tissue in left nephrectomy bed on examinations from [**2175-8-14**] and [**2175-10-23**] is incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast examination with no gross enlargement.
Cholelithiasis again noted within contracted gallbladder.
No biliary obstruction.
No abnormality identified to explain patient's persistent fevers.
No fluid collections seen.
Diffuse low signal intensity within the liver and spleen is consistent with iron deposition secondary to hemosiderosis.
Massive splenomegaly.
Enhancing linear soft tissue noted within the left nephrectomy bed which is unchanged from the recent CT, and again remains concering for disease recurrence.
Mildly increased size of a left paraaortic lymph node.
Abnormal marrow signal, possibly related to iron deposition but marrow infiltration by lymphoma, post-treatment changes, or marrow reconversion are not excluded.
Slight increase in size of subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes, soft tissue thickening in the left nephrectomy bed, and soft tissue nodules/lymph node in the left paraaortic region,potentially concerning for recurrence of disease.
2.The spleen has increased by 4 cm in its length since [**1-31**], concerning for worsening of patient's lymphoma.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, which is new, but not specific.
No intra-abdominal or pelvic collections.
[**2176-2-13**] Head CT W/O CONTRAST: No acute intracranial process.
No midline shift.
No significant change in appearance of the right adrenal gland with no evidence of high attenuation to suggest spontaneous active adrenal hemorrhage.
Overall no significant interval change in appearance of the abdomen with the previously noted soft tissue thickening in the left nephrectomy bed and left periaortic region stable, though incompletely characterized on this non-contrast examination.
New subtle ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lungs predominantly in the bases.
Although findings are nonspecific, differential diagnosis includes edema, infection, or drug reaction.
Status post splenectomy with a small amount of fluid within the posterior splenectomy bed and mesenteric stranding.
While these findings may represent post-surgical change, and underlying infection is not excluded.
Interval increase in some of mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Stable 3 mm left lower lobe nodule and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity.
Enhancing tissue within the left nephrectomy bed very suspicious for RCC recurrence.
[**2176-3-5**]: Bone Marrow Biopsy: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY PATIENT'S KNOWN DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.
[**2176-3-8**]: Chest Xray: No active disease in the chest.
[**2176-3-4**]: Liver ultrasound: The liver has a normal echotexture without focal hepatic lesions.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
There are multiple small non-obstructing gallstones.
There is no ascites.
Splenic vein thrombus has not propagated; portal vein remains patent.
Subtle diffuse ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs with lower lobe predominance, similar to that seen on [**2176-3-1**].
Findings again nonspecific, with differential including inflammatory or infectious processes.
Multiple tiny lung nodules and peribronchovascular nodular opacities, similar to that seen on [**2176-3-1**].
[**2176-3-13**]: Chest Xray: There is no pneumothorax.
There is no pleural effusion.
Diffuse infectious process, likely viral in origin, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Soft tissue nodular thickening in the left nephrectomy bed, incompletely evaluated due to the lack of IV contrast.
[**2176-3-21**] BAL Cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Numerous pulmonary macrophages, bronchial cells, lymphocytes and benign-appearing squamous cells.
[**2176-3-22**] Portable CXR: Widespread ground-glass opacities are present throughout both lungs with some associated reticular, micronodular, and linear opacities.
Correlation with chest CT of [**2176-3-19**] demonstrates widespread abnormalities which have apparently progressed.
Observed findings are likely due to an evolving infection, either viral or pneumocystis.
Marked interval progression of bilateral ground-glass opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the lung bases with small bilateral pleural effusions concerning for worsening infectious disease process.
Interval decrease in fluid collection within the left upper quadrant with drain in appropriate position.
Other areas of small amount of fluid within the perihepatic space along the right paracolic gutter are now identified.
Mild gallbladder distention, unchanged.
Enhancing nodule within the left nephrectomy surgical bed concerning for recurrence.
Multiple pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, unchanged.
Focal areas of wall thickening involving the cecum and sigmoid colon.
[**2176-3-23**] Portable CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal opacities have further increased in extent and severity.
The distribution and morphology of the opacities would be consistent with diffuse infection, or vascular permeability edema.
Increasing retrocardiac atelectasis, no evidence of pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old male with a history of Type II DM, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, renal cell carcinoma s/p L nephrectomy ([**1-/2175**]), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ([**1-/2175**]) s/p autologous SCT admitted for febrile neutropenia.
Nasopharyngeal swab and culture were negative for viral infection, so the tamiflu was discontinued.
He continued to have fevers to 103 so micafungin was added for fungal coverage while invasive marker of fungal infection were sent.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2-2**] did not show disease recurrence.
There was concern for hepatic candidiasis given increased alk phos but hepatic MRI was negative.
He continued to spike fevers to 103 degrees, with no positive culture data.
PET/CT on [**2-16**] showed a massive, FDG avid spleen (22cm up 4cm since [**2176-1-31**]) and some FDG-avid nodes, concerning for disease recurrence.
He was initially afebrile but again developed fevers on [**2-28**].
CT torso on [**2-29**] showed new subtle ground-glass opacities bilaterally, predominantly in the bases.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage on [**3-21**] and repeat on [**2176-3-24**], both negative for organisms or PCP; bactrim was then discontinued on [**3-24**].
The only culture positive data was from his JP drain fluid, which grew enteroccoccus; ID felt this was more consistent with colonization than infection, but the patient was nonetheless continued on Daptomycin.
Sputum culture on [**3-25**] grew GNRs, likely respiratory flora, but given persistent fevers, ID recommended changing levofloxacin to gentamicin, and zosyn to meropenem.
CXR and CT chest were consistent with progression of the patient's underlying lymphoma, and although he continued to be treated for infectious source, B lymphoma symptoms were also considered as contributing to his fevers.
Ultimately, he could continued to spike fevers with hypotension despite negative cultures.
This together with his fevers and history of recurrent lymphoma presenting with fevers, comfirmed a primary role for lymphoma.
Respiratory distress: As above, the patient had worsening opacities on chest films and CT scans, concerning for infection.
Stat chest x-ray revealed worsening opacities.
On arrival patient was tachypneic and tachycardic, and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
Abdominal pain: The patient complained of the acute onset of abdominal pain on [**3-28**].
CT abd/pel showed small peri-pancreatic fluid accumulations.
Concern was raised regarding whether or not this was a leak secondary to his surgery.
Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine on admission was elevated from baseline creatinine.
This was though to be likely due to dehydration and increased insensible loss.
Cholestasis Transaminitis: Patient developed an elevated alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and GGT following initiation of antibiotic therapy.
There was no sign of hepatitic candidiasis.
He later again had elevated transaminitis and elevated alk phos with a normal bilirubin.
It was felt that his elevated LFTs may be due to his recurrent lymphoma.
After splenectomy on [**2-20**], splenic tissue showed involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
He had a BM biopsy on [**2176-3-5**] which showed diffuse involvement by his known lymphoma.
Post-operative pain was controlled with the a Dilaudid PCA.
Around POD 20-21, he began to complain of left-sided abdominal pain.
CT abdomen/pelvis was done which showed an fluid collection at the splenectomy site with an enhancing rim and there was concern for infection given his recent fevers.
The fluid did have a very elevated amylase level which suggested pancreatic fistula/injury during the surgery.
Febrile neutropenia 2.
Chronic thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly.
Acute renal failure 4.
