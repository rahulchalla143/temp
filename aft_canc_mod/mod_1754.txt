Admission Date:  [**2125-8-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-4-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info 35097**] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Stereotactic brain biopsy   History of Present Illness: HPI: [**Known firstname 501**] [**Known lastname 3646**]-[**Known lastname 35098**] a 44 year-old right-handed woman with a low grade astrocytoma with 1P-19Q deletions involving the left insula, left frontal and temporal brain.
Her neurologic problem began on [**2123-5-20**] when she experienced a sensory seizure in the right upper extremity, with a Jacksonian [**Month (only) **], that led to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
A head CT revealed left fronto-temporal edema and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
While at [**Hospital3 **] she complained of significant right shoulder pain and was found to have a dislocation which was reduced.
Head MRI on [**2123-5-20**] showed a non-enhancing hyperintensity on FLAIR and T2 involving the left insula, left frontal and temporal lobes.
She returns today as a result of increased confusion and word-finding difficulty.
Her paternal grandfather had brain cancer (?type) and died at the age of 60.
Her maternal grandfather had renal cell cancer.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Pertinent Results: Head CT reveals left temporal and insular mass lesion w/ perilesional edema and compression of the left cerebral peduncle.
An MRI on [**2125-8-10**] showed a large new enhancing mass in left medial temporal lobe with surrounding edema adjacent to area of previous FLAIR signal abnormality within left insula.
The mass causes deformity of the ipsilateral mid brain, early uncal herniation, and effacement of the ipsilateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], consistent with progressive neoplastic disease and likely represent malignant transformation of existing glioma.
Given these findings, she was observed in the T-ICU overnight and she was started on mannitol 25 q6 for the edema on MR.
The repeat MRI on [**8-13**] showed unchanged appearance of the left temporal mass with associated mass effect.
She did well overnight, but continued to have word-finding difficulty.
A post-op head CT showed  no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
