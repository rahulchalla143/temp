History of Present Illness:    47yo M with metastatic colon CA (mets to retroperitoneum, liver, mediastinum, supraclavicular area) with recent admission for abd pain where he was found to have cholangitis and underwent ERCP/biliary stent sphincterotomy.
At the time, he was found to have a duodenal stricture for which a duodenal stent was placed on [**2124-12-5**].
The pain continued to increase in severity prompting the patient to seek medical attention.
The pain is ranked a [**10-1**] and is continuous without relief, and feels like pressure.
The abd pain was associated with significant nausea and vomiting.
Colon CA-pt presented as apeendiceal abscess in [**6-25**] and had percutaneous drainage of appendiceal abscess on [**2124-7-22**].
Due to poor resolution of phlegmon with antibiotics and drainage, pt was taken to OR on [**2124-8-24**] for laproscopic right colectomy which revealed a 7x4 cm ulcerating mass in the cecum the pathology of which revealed Stage IIIC adenoCA.
CT scan on [**9-26**] showed increased mediastinal pretracheal and paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymph nodes with multiple small liver densities and a multiple small lung nodules.
Congenital deafness in rt ear   Social History: Pt lives with his homosexual partner [**Name (NI) 892**] and works in the accounts receivable dept at [**Hospital1 18**].
CXR [**2124-12-8**]: "No acute pulmonary process" .
Dilated stomach with contrast, collapsed small bowel distal, consistent with obstruction.
No free air."
Placement of internal and external biliary drain: 1) Partial occlusion of common bile duct stent, complete occlusion of the patient's duodenal stent distally.
2) Internal/external 8 french biliary drainage catheter placed percutaneously, through a peripheral right duct, through the stent within the common bile duct and into the duodenal stent where the pigtail was formed.
HIDA:Non-visualization of the gallbladder after 120 minutes of scanning, consistent with acute cholecystitis .
Percutatneous GB drain: Successful placement of a 6-French percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy tube  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 47yo man with stage IIIc metastatic colon CA diagnosed [**8-26**], s/p resection and course of inrinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin/avastin.
Pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 81955**] [**1-24**] cholangitis s/p sphincterotomy and repeat biliary stenting w/ metal stent placement, course c/b duodenal stricture requiring stent placement who now presents with abd pain, n/v, and evidence of cholestasis, with increased AP and t. bili as well as increased WBC count.
1) Biliary Obstruction- as there was concern for obstruction and potential cholangitis, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics to include ampicillin/gentamycin/flagyl.
IR placed a percutaneous biliary drain, and he was observed overnight in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU to monitor for any instability or signs of ensuing sepsis.
His pain was managed with fentanyl patch and prn morphine IV.
Although the pt had decreased abd pain, he was still consistently having RUQ pain and his transaminases and bilirubin did not rapidly trend down.
He underwent HIDA scan which showed no flow in the gallbladder and on HD3 underwent percutaneous placement of choleostomy, w/ subsequent decrease in pain and appropriate response of liver enzymes/bilirubin.
SBO- in this patient with an acute onset abd pain with tightness, rebound and guarding who had recently undergone a duodenal stent placement the most likely diagnosis was SBO.
Subsequent CT scan showed distal collapse of the duodenum c/w a possible SBO.
During ERCP, noted to have complete occlusion of the duodenal stent, which collapsed following attempted angioplasty.
Pt was maintained w/ gastric decompression via NGT, NPO, and morphine PCA for pain control.
Metastatic colon CA: Pt was previously on irinotecan/5FU/LV and avastin regimen which he started on [**10-18**].
Due to rapid progression of disease pt was not continued on chemotherapy.
Pain - pain well controlled w/ morphine PCA, which was steadily titrated up.
Fentanyl patch was removed [**1-24**] concern that pt did not have appropriate fat stores for volume of distribution.
This will be continued at home hospice, along w/ ativan for management of anxiety and nausea.
5 R hydronephrosis- mild on CT, GU previously evaluated and felt no need for intervention unless elev cr or persistent renal colic.
Octreotide Acetate 10 mg Kit Sig: One Hundred (100) mcg Intramuscular  three times a day: [**Month (only) 116**] choose to start if pt begins to have problems managing secretions.
Disp:*qs kit for one month* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Cholangitis 2) Duodenal obstruction 3) Colon cancer   Discharge Condition: Fair, pain well controlled.
