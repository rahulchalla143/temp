Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 63M with metastatic esophageal cancer who initially presented after falling and went into afib as he was leaving the hospital.
Patient received LP for question of altered mental status, but waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] at baseline despite normal electrolytes and no evidence of brain mets.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: paroxymal atrial fibrillation Metastatic Esophageal Cancer s/p Rads completed [**2-15**], diagnosed in [**7-21**].
Discharge Condition: stable, in sinus, normotensive   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a mechanical fall and developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension and failed electrical cardioverion.
You were treated in the intensive care unit and placed on medication to resolve your abnormal heart rhythm which returned to [**Location 213**] for 24 hours prior to discharge.
You were found to have a small pneumonia and you are to take a course of antibiotics.
You are to take medication to prevent the abnormal heart rhythm and antibiotics to treat the pneumonia.
