Patient code status had been CMO at [**Hospital1 1501**], was noted to be increasingly unresponsive, had increased abdominal girth, and hypoglycemic for 1-2 days.

Pertinent Results: [**2112-7-18**] WBC-10.9 RBC-4.37* HGB-12.1* HCT-37.6* MCV-86 MCH-27.7 MCHC-32.1 RDW-18.8*  [**7-18**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Patchy but extensive new right lung opacity worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration.
Although probably an artifact, repeat radiographs are recommended to exclude the unlikely possibility of free air associated with a curvilinear lucency projecting along the right lower hemithorax.
R post temporal lobe significantly increased hyper intensity on FLAIR concerning for met.
Scattered white matter changes c/w microangiopathic disease  EKG: 1mm ST depressions in antero-lateral leads, otherwise normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo M h/o Hep B & C, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage who presents with lethargy and hypoglycemia from nursing home and [**Hospital **] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for prominent hypernatremia and higher nursing level care  ACTIVE ISSUES: ==================== #Altered Mental Status:  Thought to be multifactorial including electrolyte abnormalities, infection (RML pneumonia), and HCC metastastic disease to the R post temporal lobe.
His pneumonia was treated as below with no improvements of his altered mental status.
# HYPERNATREMIA: Now corrected, with no real change in mental status; was likely hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to dehydration with Na 155 at admission.
His free water deficit was corrected, but no change in his altered mental status.
# RML PNEUMONIA: CXR was concerning for PNA, elevated WBC, and productive cough were concerning for nursing-home acquired pneumonia.
# HYPOGLYCEMIA: likely due to impaired gluconeogenesis and increased tumor burden from his HCC.
# HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA: he has locally advanced neoplasm contributing to his abdominal girth, radiating back pain, and profound bilateral edema.
It may also have a local mass effect with the stomach and lead to early satiety and postprandial discomfort.
Sorafenib may increase the risk of recurrent ICH, and local CyberKnife has limited value.
While hospitalized, radiation oncology recommended no intervention.
