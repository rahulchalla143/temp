Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 125.
Low voltage throughout the tracing.
Non-specific T wave flattening.
The non-specific T wave changes  were also present at that time.
There is no diagnostic interval change other than the change in rhythm.
CXR [**2165-8-28**]: Compared to the prior chest radiograph, there is slightly improved aeration of the right hemithorax with a moderate loculated pleural effusion.
Right perihilar air space opacification may be related to known malignancy, but developing infection or re-expansion edema is possible.
It is uncertain whether an apparent lucency in the re-expanded lung could represent a cavitary process or an area of aerated lung surrounded by fluid.
There is no left-sided pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
TTE [**2165-8-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posterioly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion, measuring from 0.6 centimeters to 2.0 centimeters at greatest dimension.
The effusion appears circumferential, with preferential fluid collection near the right atrium.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology (clips 76 and 77).
Dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness and severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgtitation.
Small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have increased.
Right lower lobe opacities probably reexpansion pulmonary edema are stable.
There is no left pneumothorax.
Hypotension:  He presented with hypotension in the setting of Afib with RVR after pleurex catheter placement.
Initial bedside echo did not reveal significant pericardial effusion but formal echo in the AM revealed a mild to moderate posterior pericardial effusion with evidence of RV diastolic collapse consistent with tamponade.
Cardiology evaluated the patient and felt that he did not have significant LV dysfunction on TTE to fully explain his continued hypotension.
The cardiology team felt that while pericardiocentesis could possibly help his short term hemodynamics, he could have a longstanding effusive-constrictive physiology that may require pericardial window.
Risks and benefits of drainage vs pericardial window were discussed with the patient, who expressed a desire to go home and focus on comfort measures.
His rates responded to IV and po metoprolol although dosing was limited due to hypotension.
It was felt that his tachycardia was driven by hypovolemia and hypotension.
He also had some post-procedure hypoxia that may have contributed to his tachycardia.
His home metoprolol dose was decreased due to hypotension but may be able to be uptitrated as an outpatient if tachycardia remains an issue and BPs are stable.
Hypoxia: He had a new oxygen requirement after his procedure in the setting of Afib with RVR and hypotension.
There was some concern for mild reexpansion pulmonary edema but his oxygen requirement improved prior to discharge.
Low grade fevers: He had a low grade fever on admission and was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime.
These were stopped prior to discharge due to low likelihood for infection.
Pleural effusions: He is s/p pleurex catheter placement and developed the hypotension and tachycardia after the procedure.
7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility:  Discharge Diagnosis: Stage IV lung cancer Pericardial effusion Atrial fibrillation with RVR Hypotension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Following the procedure, you developed very fast heart rates and low blood pressures, requiring admission to the ICU.
We did an ultrasound of your heart that showed fluid around the heart, which may have been contributing to your low blood pressure.
