History of Present Illness: 76 y/o M with PMHx of ACOM aneurysm and SAH in [**2139**] presents to clinic c/o fatigue since middle [**Month (only) 547**].
He also reports some dizziness and intermittent episodes of visual disturbances.
He denies any nausea or vomiting.
MRI of head showed a new large R temporal lobe mass.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pertinent Results: MRA BRAIN: The head MRA demonstrates a small coil pack within the region of anterior communicating artery.
No evidence of recanalization of the aneurysms identified.
A small basilar tip aneurysm is again identified.
No evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
There is displacement of the right middle cerebral artery and elevation of the M1 segment secondary to mass in the temporal pole.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm recanalization.
MRI BRAIN: There is now a new large area of edema identified in the right temporal lobe extending to the basal ganglia region.
There is irregular rim-enhancing mass identified on post-gadolinium images, measuring approximately 6 x 4 cm in the anterior, posterior, and transverse dimensions.
There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with mild midline shift.
There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
No acute infarct is identified.
Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of abnormalities on the ADC to indicate low defect slow diffusion within the region of mass.
[**7-10**] Post op Head CT: Status post resection of the right temporal lobe mass, with continued mass effect and only minimal improvement in leftward midline shift.
Status post right temporal craniotomy and partial tumor resection, with residual nodular enhancement consistent with residual tumor.
New area of slow diffusion within the right temporal lobe, posterior to the resection cavity, consistent with an acute infarction.
Bifrontal subdural fluid, blood and air, causing mild mass effect on the frontal lobes.
Some question about left ankle swelling prompted us to obtain a left lower extremity doppler to rule out a DVT which was negative.
We will have him follow up with them post operatively and when we have a tissue diagnosis.
He was taken to the Operating room on Monday [**7-10**] for resecton of his right temporal mass which was performed without complication.
He was transferred to the PACU in stable condition and remained there overnight for close neurological observation.
Patient will follow up in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] office for a wound check and in brain tumor clinic for treatment of his brain tumor.
