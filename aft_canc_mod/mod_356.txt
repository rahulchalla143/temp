In block B there is an area of round nuclei with cleared cytoplasm, and prominent capillaries, with an oligodendroglial appearance.
There are a few small cysts with Alcian blue staining mucinous material.
There are scattered [**Doctor Last Name **] fibers, and rare eosinophilic granular bodies.
There are no anaplastic features.
EKG [**11-24**]: Sinus rhythm Modest diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of [**2118-11-16**], rate faster, and ST-T wave changes present.
Imaging: MRI Head [**11-18**]: IMPRESSION: Cystic mass with enhancing mural nodule within cerebellum most suggestive of hemangioblastoma.
Differential includes metastasis and astrocytoma.
Head CT [**11-19**]: IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes as described above.
No evidence of midline shift.
Minimal amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
There is a small amount of nodular enhancement along the medial and inferior aspect of the cavity which could represent residual nodular neoplasm.
Possible small focus of acute ischemia in the left inferior cerebellum.
A tiny acute ischemic focus is also seen in the right aspect of the pons.
MRI Head [**11-25**]: IMPRESSION: Status post resection of cerebellar mass with no definite residual nodular enhancement seen when accounting for blood products and vascular enhancement at the surgical site.
Small area of blood products in the right frontal lobe as seen on the recent CT at the site of previously placed ventricular drain.
Small bilateral subdurals which appear postoperative in nature.
No acute infarct seen.
LENI [**11-29**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
CT head [**11-29**]: (Preliminary) No new intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
Slight decrease in small hemorrhages related to prior ventriculostomy cath.
CXR [**11-29**]: (Preliminary) Pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
CXR [**11-30**]:   Brief Hospital Course: 50M electively admitted for resection of his L occipital brain mass.
Had MRI, which showed hemorrhage in the operative bed.
There is solid nodular enhancement along medial/inferior aspect of the postop cavity which could represent residual neoplasm.
Stat head CT done for headache was normal.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation.
POD12/6 ([**11-30**]) Patient has been afebrile for 24hours.
Repeat chest x-ray shows no interval increase in right lower lobe consolidation.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**2-9**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.
Metoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for pro-motility.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**11-22**] days for removal of your staples or sutures and a wound check(this may also be done at your tumor clinic appointment).
