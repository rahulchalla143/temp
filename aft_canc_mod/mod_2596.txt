Admission Date:  [**2154-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-7-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-11-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: "Memory problems"  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: MRI/MRA head & neck EEG Lumbar Puncture CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis EGD colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1191**] is a 71-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who was brought into the ED for worsening memory problems.
The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-23**] with word-finding difficulties and HA and was admitted at that time for a TIA work-up.
EEG and carotid US were unremarkable and MRI/MRA showed evidence of old infarctions and abnormal signal in the clivus thought to be compatible with Paget's Disease.
Since that time, she has had continued word-finding difficulties (episodes of 20-30), some unstable gait (walking like a drunk), without known falls, and difficulty with executive function, namely needing to call her son because she could not turn off the hot water in the bath or turn off the television.
He feels that these symptoms have been present for the past few months but have worsened over the last week or so.
She was recently started on inderal for a diagnosis of migraine headaches and he feels this may be contributing to her poor mental status, though he has noted no improvement with her off this medication over the past 4 days.
She does report a two week history of headaches, which have been improving and not unusual, with no neck stiffness or f/c.
Past Medical History: HTN Dyslipidemia Headaches Shingles in [**2-9**]   Social History: The patient lives alone and is independent of all ADLs.
Family History: -mother with h/o "TIA's"   Physical Exam: ON TRANSFER TO NEUROLOLGY SERVICE [**6-26**] VS: 98.5 BP 108/62 HR 78 RR 18 O2 Sat 95% Gen Lying in bed, NAD Neck: supple, normal ROM, no thyromegaly, no bruit CV: Reg rate, Nl S1 and S2 Lung: + basilar crackles bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender Ext: no edema Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake, alert, oriented to person and "the [**Hospital **] hospital" (when given phonemic introduction Be.., she immediatly names "[**Hospital3 **]"), knows it is [**2154**], but unable to say date or season.
No dysarthria.
Spontaneous writing impaired, but can transcribe a sentence.
No evidence of neglect.
Mild hand for object substitution on testing for apraxia.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
Proprioception decreased in feet bilaterally (?
A tiny subdural hematoma is felt to be less likely.
-------- CXR:IMPRESSION: No evidence of active cardiopulmonary process.
-------- MRI: There is a focus of increased signal T2 in the lateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is some increased signal here on the diffusion-weighted sequence consistent with subacute infarction.
There is possibly another small focus in the right parietooccipital region, but this is indefinite.
There is some increased signal on T2 and FLAIR weighted sequence in the left thalamus, which is new from prior study and might represent an intracurrent event.
There is no definite evidence of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus at the present time.
There is some increased uptake signal here on the diffusion-weighted sequence, but this probably represents T2 shine through.
There is no ADC map for evaluation.
There is no definite evidence of abnormal enhancement.
There are multiple T2 high-signal intensity foci in the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale consistent with microvascular angiopathy.
This could reflect infiltrative or metabolic disorder.
The CT scan of [**6-23**] does not strongly suggest the presence of Paget's disease  [**2154-6-30**] 07:00AM BLOOD CRP-2.67*  Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o woman with a history of HTN and dyslipidemia who presented [**2154-6-23**] with difficulties of executive function and short-term memory/recall difficulties.
She was initially admitted to the medicine service for w/u of these mental status changes.
She was transfered to the neurology stroke service after MRI revealed multiple, bilateral strokes of unclear etiology.
Also of note she had a recent flare of shingles of her right fifth nerve and there was some thought as to whether this was related to that infection.
No clear evidence of infarction.
EEG showed bursts of bifrontal slowing with reversal of theta waves at left frontal region, c/w encephalopathy.
No clear lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were identified.
Etiology of these strokes thought be vasculitis (ESR 31, CRP 2.67) vs cardioembolic vs artery-to-artery embolism vs malignancy.
Lumbar puncture was non diagnostic for vasculitis with cytology and cultures (Lyme, EBV, CMV, VZV and fungal) negative.
Malignancy w/u consisted of CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was significant only for adrenal masses not large enough to suggest adrenal adenomas.
A TTE was nonsuggestive of a cardiac embolic source.
In addition, an admission EKG showed sinus rhythm and not afib.
TTE showed a complex, nonmobile atheroma was seen in the descending thoracic aorta which is an unlikely source of emboli.
Deferred anticoagulation with coumadin at this time given unclear source of any emboli and concern for bleeding risk especially as was on ASA and had significant lower GI bleed.
At discharge her speech had improved significantly as well as her deficits in executive function, short term memory/recall and attention.
GIBleed: while on asa for her stroke, she was found on the bathroom floor in pool of blood mixed with stool and could not obtain a blood pressure.
Her EGD showed only signs of trauma from NGT placement, colonoscopy the following day only showed diverticuli and polyp at 40cm in descending colon which was not removed, but for which she will need follow colonoscopy for polypectomy in the future.
She was transfused 4uPRBC with good result, and her hematocrit stabilized and remained stable throughout her stay and bleeding was likley secondary to divertiuclar bleed.
HTN: Antihypertensives were held given the question of an acute stroke her blood pressures remained stable off antihypertensive without signs of hypertension, and can be restarted as outpatient by PCP if needed.
Bilateral exudative effusions: she was intubated for airway protection b/c of agitation and noted to have bilateral effusions, which was tapped and consistent with an exudative source of unknown source.
The effusions were noted after being aggressively hydrated in setting of GI bleed and then diuresis and were eventually thought to be pseudo-exudative.
Although of note, she has had a positive PPD in the past for which she refused treatment because she felt she had received the BCG vaccine in the [**2099**]'s prior to 3 months she worked in a [**Hospital **] hospital [**Hospital1 **] as a nursing student and as her mother had had TB when she was a child.
AFB was added on the pleural fluid and was negative and induced sputums were sent to rule out active TB, but she did not have further cough with her current cough and respiratory symptoms and was ruled out for active TB.
Later in the admission a urinalysis was suggestive of UTI and patient was given a three day course of levoquin.
She developed a diffuse truncal maculopapular rash thought secondary to levoquin so was switched to a three day course of bactrim.
However, they had concerns from a safety standpoint as patient was unable to turn off a faucet and was unable to come up with safety plans for hypothetical situations.
Therefore, it was thought necessary to send the patient to an acute rehab facility.
