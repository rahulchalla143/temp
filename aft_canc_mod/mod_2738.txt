Subtle interstitial and nodular pattern may represent atypical or miliary type infection given the history of recent chemotherapy and probable immunosuppression  [**4-2**]    RADIOLOGY  Final Report  Slight increase in opacity in the right lower lobe represents increasing atelectasis/consolidation.
Persistent subtle reticulonodular pattern throughout both lung fields.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
[**4-3**] Abdominal MRI  REPORT: The patient has diffuse metastatic disease, with pulmonary, soft tissue, hepatic, renal and bone marrow metastases being seen.
The metastases are causing marked compression of the intrahepatic IVC.
No other vascular occlusion is noted.
CONCLUSION: Extensive metastatic disease.
Markedly compressed, but patent intrahepatic portal vein, particularly the posterior branch of the right portal vein.
Partial thrombosis of left hepatic vein.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course:  Admitted to ICU for sepsis monitoring on MUST protocol for lactate >4.
He never required pressor support or intubation.
Given his localizing symptoms of cough and positive CXR for atypical pneumonia he was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin empirically.
In addition blood, urine, sputum and stool cultures were sent for infectious work-up.
His lactate improved overnight to 4.0 and he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
PNA: imaging seemed consistent with atypical pna with ceftriaxone (which would also cover urinary source as well) and azithromycin.
However, on repeat imaging a consolidation became apparent and patient sputum cultures grew staph aureus.
White count continued to increase into the 30's- likley from bm involvement of tumor (was seen on mri).
2.SOB: Patient continued to complain of some sob and dyspnea, though to be likely from pna and mets, patient was continued on oxygen with close monitoring .
3. metastatic melanoma: very poor prognosis.
Dacarbazine could be source of fever as well (flu-like symptoms seen in [**12-1**]% of cases) and source of elevated LFTs.
Given his poor prognosis and tenous clinical status, code status was readdressed, and patient was made dnr/dni.
Abdominal distention/LE edema/ liver failure- Patient continued to complain of abdominal distenstion and he had a transaminitis, with elevated ldh, alk phos, and t bili.
It was suspected that this was due to his liver mets and perhaps compression/obstruction of biliary ducts and vascular system.
Given his abdominal distension there was a question of ascites.
(originally the possibility of sbp was addressed but patient abdomen was nontender and in the [**Hospital Unit Name **] the team felt it was unlikely to be the cause of his symptoms).
He also had extensive lower extremity edema and there was concern of ivc comprssion.
The ultrasound showed no fluid.
We felt that his elevated lactate may be secondary to his liver mets It was also felt that part of his transaminitis was from dacrabazine.
An MRI was obtained that showed markedly compressed, but patent IVC; markedly compressed, but patent intrahepatic portal vein, particularly the posterior branch of the right portal vein; and probable partial thrombosis of left hepatic vein.
It was felt that compression of vessels and partial thrombus combined with a low albumin was  likely causing patients extensive lower extremity edema.
5. coagulapthy: His inr was 2.4, likely due to poor synthetic function and nutritional deficiency.
Acute renal failure - cr began trending up with decreased urine output, urine lytes and FENA support that he was intravascularly dry and likely third spacing fluid.
In addition, MRI showed renal mets which were likley contributing to her failure.
Neuro: Patient developed diplopia, but refused imaging/ work up as he did not want to know if he had brain mets, csf or brainstem involvement.
