Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old man with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain, as well as prior stroke, who presents with progressive fatigue, depression, and about 1 week of unsteady gait.
His cancer has been treated with seven weeks of weekly carboplatin/Taxol with radiation followed by resection [**2147-3-28**].
He was referred to the ED by his visiting nurse and his wife, who report progressively worsening gait with multiple falls over the last week.
He has additionally had incontinence, thought secondary to inability to get to the bathroom in time.
He has also noted some increased weakness of the right arm and right leg, along with some episodes of right arm jerking at night with left arm extension.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He was initially presented with progressive cough; found to have a spiculated nodule on CXR.
Pathology demonstrated metastatic carcinoma in [**7-17**] lymph nodes.
He developed brain metastases and had Cyberknife radiosurgery to a left medial frontal metastasis on [**2148-3-14**] to 1,800 cGy, and then resection of radiation necrosis by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: (1) Coronary Artery Disease: He is status post ST elevation MI in [**11-15**] with stent to the left circumflex artery at the [**Hospital1 3343**].
(2) Congestive Heart Failure: His last echo in [**1-16**] with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis (EF 50-55%).
(3) Stroke: Small CVAs noted on head CT at [**Hospital1 1774**] in [**11-15**] (4) Deep Venous Thrombosis: This was diagnosed shortly after his hospitalization for MI; he is on Coumadin.
He had a negative bubble echo after old small CVA's noted on head MRI.
He drinks occasional ETOH, but no drugs.
CARDIOVASCULAR: RR, normal rate, no murmurs.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
He has mild psychomotor slowing.
Motor Examination: He does not have a drift.
Coordination examination does not reveal appendicular dysmetria.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation secondary to old inferior MI (inferior Q waves).
No acute ST/T changes.
CXR PA and LAT:  FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest: Right upper lobectomy and radiation changes are unchanged from prior.
The heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
There is no evidence of effusion, infiltrate or pneumothorax.
Underlying lesions poorly assessed.
No new area of edema or evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 75-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, CAD with prior inferior STEMI, CHF, prior stroke, and DVT on coumadin, presented with 1 week of worsening mental status, increased fatigue, and unsteady gait.
While in the hospital he was found to have leptomeningeal spread of his known NSCLC.
ICU Course: Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from OMED after episode of rigors s/p LP.
LP with low glucose, elevated protein, xanthochromia, 45 WBC with poly's.
Started Vanc, ceftriaxone, Acyclovir, and ampicillin for broad coverage for meningitis given elevated BC from [**12-31**] over the course of the day, nuchal rigidity and CSF results.
Hypotensive episode to systolic 69 with dilantin, on levophed for a matter of minutes which resolved.
Pt continued to be somnolent with myoclonic jerks.
CT head with metastasis with hemorrhage cerebellum.
CSF on [**2148-11-8**] returned with malignant cells.
History and evidence consistent with carcinomatous meningitis.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic non small cell lung cancer.
