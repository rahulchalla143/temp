According to his wife, he was ambulatory the day PTA and then was noted to be lethargic and confused on the morning of admission.
Of note, patient was seen in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on [**1-10**] and reported upper respiratory tract symptoms, including a frontal headache, nasal congestion, and erythema around his eyes.
He subsequently developed urinary retention and was started on levofloxacin for UTI and ?sinusitis.
GRAM STAIN: occ Polys, no organisms.
It was concluded that his altered mental status was related to "metabolic encephalopathy" in the setting of UTI vs. sinusitis.
PO intake remained poor and mental status continued to deteriorate.
His wife states that he was ambulating until Monday, and has been lying in the fetal position for the past two days.
Given his persistent and declining mental status, he was transferred to the OMED service for further evaluation and management.
Team was concerned for leptomeningeal spread vs. CNS infection.
He was started on acyclovir empirically for possible viral meningitis and plan was for repeat MRI and LP (to obtain opening pressure and cytology).
Metastatic melanoma with known mets to brain and lungs - He was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2171**] when a right anterior neck lesion was discovered.
He then developed right chest wall pain and a CT of the torso revealed metastatic disease to the lungs and the patient subsequently underwent 26 rounds of IL-2 therapy ending on [**2173-5-11**].
A head MRI in [**6-3**] did not reveal any intracranial masses.
However, on [**2173-10-24**] he developed a headache with continuous occipital and neck pain that progressed to an intermittent bilateral frontal head pain with cough only and associated sensitivity to light.
On [**2173-11-2**], he was taken to an OSH for evaluation and found to have an intracranial lesion on head CT.

Can withdraw to pain and startles easily.

Altered mental status: CSF analysis at OSH demonstrated protein of 75 with [**Hospital1 18**] LP with CSF of 65 concerning for HSV encephalitis.
Leptomeningeal spread of malignancy was also considered, with CSF cytology non-diagnostic and MRI without significant findings.
We decided not to re-LP to perform further studies as the risks outweighed the benefits, his mental status had cleared, and it would unlikely change the treatment plan.
The patient was also found to be hyponatremic to 121 during his admission, which was may have contributed to his altered mental status and he had adrenal insufficiency which could have contributed as well.
EEG was done which did not show evidence of seizure, but did show possible subcortical dysfunction within the right temporal lobe.
Hyponatremia: Patient came in with sodium of 121 and the differential diagnosis included SIADH and adrenal insufficiency.
The etiology of his hyponatremia was likely multifactorial.
He was hyponatremic as well so we treated him with dexamethasone.
Fever: Patient was febrile to 101 at OSH, but was afebrile during his hospital course.
He had negative cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] and had 1/2 bottles of coag neg staph at OSH with follow-up cultures negative.
Altered mental status likely [**2-28**] viral encephalitis 2.
Metastatic melanoma.
You were admitted for altered mental status.
We determined that you were likely not having a seizure.
We believe you may have had a viral infection in your brain or your mental status may have been from adrenal insufficiency.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or go to your local Emergency Department immediately.
