INterval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion and upper zone vascular redistribution consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
CTA ([**12-9**])- Remains a subcentimeter potential filling defect in a segmental branch to the right lower lobe medially.
New, major finding is the interval developement of multifocal areas of angiocentric ground glass attenuation predominantly in the upper lobes and is most probably the cause of the current hypoxia.
Differential includes developing alveolar hemorrhage in the setting of thrombocytopenia and alveolitis.
Number of ovoid hypodense lesions are visualized in the included portion of the superior right lobe of the liver strongly suspicious for mets.
Multifocal sclerotic bony mets in the included axial and extra axial skeleton.
Bilateral LE US ([**12-9**])- No evidence of acute or chronic DVT from the common femoral through to the proximal tibial veins.
No areas of persistent focal slowing and no epileptiform features.
No intraxial lesions were seen.
No significant mass effect or edema.
Right frontal Ommaya in place.
No ST-T wave changes from prior studies.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o female with PMH significant for metastatic breast CA, PE by CTA on [**12-7**], and thrombocytopenia transferred originally admitted after a syncopal episode and later transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia.
She felt her knees buckling and herself falling but cannot remember anything after this.
No urinary incontinence.
Pt had a head CT which was negative for any acute process.
Her symptoms were contributed to progression of her disease.
She described having presyncopal symptoms over the past month.
Pt's hypoxia and increasing DOE were also evaluated.
Pt had a CTA which was significant for interval development of multifocal areas of angiocentric ground glass attenuation predominantly in the upper lobes.
No progression of her PE or further clot was visualized.
The bronch was significant for petechia in the airways.
Lavage revealed some blood tinged fluid but no franc blood.
Upon return to the floor after the bronch, the pt was noted to have increasing respiratory distress.
Pt was noted to be tachypneic at 40-50 breaths per minute and tachycardic at around 110.
She also noted chest pain which had been present since morning.
An ECG was checked but there were no changes.
CXR was obtained and showed an increase in bilateral fluffy infiltrates.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including fungal coverage and stress dose steroids to treat for sepsis given her hypotension and elevated lactate.
Despite fluid boluses, she remained hypotensive and was started on pressors with SBPs back up to the high 90's to low 100's.
Patient became more hypotensive and rapidly became bradycardic to the 30's and died on [**2139-12-11**].
