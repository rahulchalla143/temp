He had mass removed and was tx with chemo and radiation.
He was feeling well until 1 month ago he started to feel dizzy and had head CT that showed left parietal-occipital mass.
Per wife, pt had some residual effects of craniotomy with his word finding, but was overall improving over the last several days.
He was conversing with friends and family with no apparent complaints on Friday and on Saturday he appears to be confused.
He had speech abnormalities "not speaking much", headache, as well as vomiting (non-bilious and non-bloody) and diarrhea.
He has also been seen holding the back of his head and neck, but has not been complaining of neck stiffness specifically.
Head CT was performed with contrast revealing a 8x3mm and 15x8mm hyperintense foci of material in the periphery of the resection bed, may indicate new foci of hemorrhage or redistribution of hemorrhage seen on prior scan, and a 6mm rightward midline shift that was stable, as well as an unremarkable CT abd/pelvis.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended infection w/u with no surgical intervention at this time.
He was continued on acyclovir and started on Dexa 10mg Q 6hrs and keppra 500mg IV Q12mg for seizures ppx.

Status post surgical resection of a mass in the left parieto-occipital lobe with expected post-surgical changes.
There may be slightly more prominent hyperdense material layering along the margin of the surgical cavity but this may represent redistribution of hemorrhagic products.
No definitely  CXRnew areas of hemorrhage.
CXR on admission: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Atypical single cells in a background of abundant   neutrophils and blood, see note.
The cytology slide   demonstrates only rare neutrophils and monocytes.
The   patient has a known history of CNS involvement by metastatic   [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Otherwise, no acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis.
No new acute hemorrhage.
Unchanged region of hypodensity in the left occipital and temporoparietal lobes, with interval evolution of hyperdense foci layering along the posterior margin of the surgical cavity.
This, and the extensive swelling and sulcal effacement in the left occipital lobe, reflect evolving infarction.
Lungs are essentially clear with no evidence of interval development or aspiration.
No change in minimal linear opacities at lung bases , consistent with atelectasis as on the prior radiographs.

# Altered mental status/meningitis: Patient admitted with altered mental status, head CT with contrast with hyperintense intracranial foci at surgical site, suggestive of infection.
Lumbar puncture with Gram-negative rods and cell count and chemistry suggesting bacterial meningitis.
Sources were thought to be recent surgical procedure versus bacteremic seeding.
Prior to gram stain results, he was broadly covered for gram positive and gram negative organisms, listeria, anaerobes and viral organisms.
CSF culture grew out Serratia marcescens, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Keppra is being given per patient's home dose for seizure prophylaxis.
On transfer, patient has word-finding troubles, and is not oriented to time.
These GI symptoms were thought to be secondary to meningitis and increased intracranial pressure.
Further workup was not performed due to symptom abatement.
Before discharge, however, patient began having loose stools.
If diarrhea continues upon discharge, recommend stool studies and C. diff testing.
# Bradycardia: On transfer to the ICU, patient had episodes of bradycardia to the 40s.
EKG showed TWI in V2 otherwised unchanged from prior EKG.
At time of discharge it was thought that this bradycardia was secondary to a central process and not of cardiac etiology.
# Hyperglycemia: patient developed glucose intolerance, requiring sliding scale insulin coverage.
This was believed to be secondary to dexamethasone use.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) powder PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis:  Meningoencephalitis Altered mental status Hyperglycemia  Secondary diagnosis:  Small-cell neuroendocrine tumor (likely [**Location (un) 5668**] cell) s/p craniotomy and resection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
It was an absolute pleasure being involved in your care at the [**Hospital1 18**].
You were admitted to the hospital with fevers, confusion and head and neck pain.
You underwent lumbar puncture (spinal tap) which revealed that you had bacterial meningitis (infection of the spinal fluid).
You were treated with antibiotics and your mental status improved.
