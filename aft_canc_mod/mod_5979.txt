On physical exam, patient had guaiac positive black stool.
ECG reportedly showed paced rhythm, with LAD, RBBB, new ST depressions in V3 and V5, as well as new TWF in V3.
In addition, potassium was elevated at 5.5, creatinine elevated at 1.8 from baseline of 1.5, and INR was 1.3.
Chest X-ray was performed and showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Patient was chest pain free at the time of transfer.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

EXTREMITIES: 2+ DP/PT, no pedal edema GAIT: in bed, awaiting PT to see.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2133-2-20**]): Compared with prior, there has been no significant interval change.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Atherosclerotic calcifications seen throughout the aorta.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus (biopsy) Slightly thickened gastric folds.
The findings do not account for the symptoms   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old woman with significant history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD placement and ventricular tachycardia who presented with acute onset of likely GI bleed with resultant exertionalleft-sided chest pain.
She underwent an endoscopy which didnt show any active signs of bleeding and was dc/ed to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab d/t orthostatic hypotension.
# Gastrointestinal bleed: Ms. [**Known lastname **] experienced a hematocrit drop from baseline of 34 to 24 in setting of guaiac positive dark stool.
Differential diagnosis for upper GI bleed included bleeding ulcer, gastritis, or variceal bleed.
She has history of gastritis on previous EGD and diverticulosis on prior colonoscopy.
On admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on a protonix drip, and GI was consulted who performed EGD on [**2-23**] which demonstrated no acitve site of bleeding and no lesion that may have been responsible for the GIB.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 35325**] 3 units of blood on the first day of admission which resulted in resolution of her chest pain.
# Chest pain: Ms. [**Known lastname **] experienced left-sided chest pain which is similar to her prior anginal symptoms.
There were no discernible EKG changes but these are difficult to interpret in the setting of BiV pacing.
Her MB was flat and troponins were less than baseline (normally elevated secondary to CKD).
Lisinopril however was held at the time of dc due to a Cr bump.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Ms. [**Known lastname 96778**] furosemide and spironolactone were initially held given concern for GI bleed.
# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score of 4.
# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Home lantus and a sliding scale were continued in lieu of her januvia and sulfonyluea.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: The pt developed some orthostatic hypotension just before the time of discharge and her Cr spiked, likely in the setting of being NPO for a long period and getting lisinopril and lasix.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Blood loss from unknown source (likely GI) Chest pain from blood loss  Secondary diagnosis: Coronary artery disease Cardiomyopathy (weak heart muscle) Hypertension Diabetes Chronic kidney disease Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain and dark stools.
Your bleeding stopped after 3 units of blood, and your blood counts remained stable.
Your chest pain was felt to be related to the bleeding, and this improved.
You had mild worsening of your kidney function, which was likely related to dehydration.
