Admission Date:  [**2133-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-5-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cath pulmonary stent  History of Present Illness: 44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy presenting with dyspnea x 2 days.
The patient reports that he has had several weeks of air hunger.
Although he has reported chest pressure to other interviewers, he is currently denying recent chest pain or pressure.
He has not had a cough or hemoptysis.
He denies orthopnea or PND.
No weight gain, though he has had LE edema that comes and goes.
Of note, he has had sweats and weight loss of 25 pounds over the last 6 weeks.
Patient was found to have ST elevations and borderline Q waves in V4-V6 and I and aVL.
Pt also with subtle ST elevations in V2-V3.
The patient underwent CTA, which preliminarily was negative for PE or aortic pathology.
A bedside echo was done, which preliminarily revealed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 40-45%) with hypokinesis of the mid inferospetal and apical septal walls as well as moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The cath was also notable for marked pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 60/27.
Because of the marked pulmonary pressures and clean coronaries, a pulmonary angiogram was done, which was also negative for obvious pulmonary embolism, but subsegmental PE could not be excluded.
In the CCU, the patient feels mildly short of breath and appears in mild respiratory distress.
He is mainly complaining of back pain, which is chronic and from metastatic disease per the patient.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Physical Exam: VS: T=98.2 BP=119/84 HR=110 RR=22 O2 sat=95%5LNC GENERAL: Obese, pale gentleman in mild distress.
Pallor of sclera but anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
Cool extremites, cap refill wnl SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
L4 pathological fracture, with mild-to-moderate loss of vertebral height and 4 mm retropulsion into the central canal.
If the patient presents with neurologic signs and symptoms, MRI lumbar spine can be performed to further assess.
Bilateral adrenal nodules, incompletely assessed in the current study.
Ill-defined right hepatic hypodensity lesion, also incompletely assessed.
No intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy.
New small left pleural effusion.
Interval subtotal LLL and partial RLL atelectasis.
New RML ground-glass opacity concerning for infectious process.
[**2133-2-21**]   Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS IMPRESSION: No evidence of parenchymal metastases.
Differential diagnostic considerations include neoplastic or inflammatory etiologies.
Multiple tiny presumed bilateral acute and subacute embolic infarcts predominantly supratentorially, although a few cerebellar lesions are also seen.
None of these lesions has significant mass effect.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive anteroapical akinesis.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2133-2-19**]   Cytology MEDIASTINAL MASS Most probably benign - consistent with a mixed micro- and macrofollicular lesion of mediastinal thyroid with cystic degeneration.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage given recent IV contrast administration for chest CTA.
Right periventricular hypodensity, likely represents chronic small vessel ischemic change.
Ill-defined low density in the left basal ganglia may also represent chronic small vessel ischemic change, although a small underlying lesion cannot be entirely excluded given history of cancer.
Findings can be further characterized on brain MRI if there is no contraindication.
No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Large pleural based mass extending into the left upper lobe, found to likely represent non-small carcinoma per outside hospital ([**Hospital1 86406**]) biopsy report.
A smaller left posterior apical opacity is concerning for a second mass lesion.
Multifocal RUL ground-glass opacities, non-specific but could represent infection, inflammation, or neoplastic process.
Enlarged, thyroid containing large thyroid nodules extending into the anterior mediastinum, substernally.
Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
[**2133-2-18**]   Cardiology ECHO LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the septum and anterior free wall, and extensive apical akinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration consistent with acute process.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age although is non-diagnostic.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year old gentleman with newly diagnosed lung mass admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung mass.
Intially had ST changes on EKG, underwent cath and found to have clean coronaries but notable for takosutbos cardiomyopathy.
He then underwent pulmonary stent and biopsy of mass by interventional pulmonology.
However, he had to be intubated for respiratory distress and altered mental status.
After which he was noted to be in DIC which was thought to be secondary to his tumor load.
He developed bradycardia then lost his pulse and went into asystole.
