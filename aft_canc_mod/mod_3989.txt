The patient was previously admitted on [**9-27**] to [**Hospital1 **] neurosurgery ICU after falling backwards down 5 steps with LOC found to have bilateral SDH, extensive SAH and intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Found to have subdural hematoma, evacuated and in ED found to have temp to 103.8, started on vanc, ceftriaxone, flagyl, (had completed course of vanco on [**10-28**] for MRSA pneumnia) switched to vanc, ceftaz, flagyl on [**11-1**] after subdural hematoma evac for possible pseudomona.
Urine has been negative, chest x-ray likely failure and cannot rule out pneumonia.
TTE today to rule out endocarditis.
Bandemia and fevers resolved since admit(afebrile since admission.
(since [**10-11**]) No central line preceding or during bactermia.

Also with multiple infarcts.
TECHNIQUE: Axial 5 mm sections of the brain were obtained and compared to the most recent prior non-contrast head CT dated [**2125-10-8**].
This subdural hematoma now demonstrates severe mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere.
There has also been interval development of rightward shift of the midline structures and a prominent amount of subfalcine midline shift.
There has been interval resolution of the hematoma in the inferior left frontal lobe.
The right subdural hematoma is stable in size and there has been evolution of the blood products within it.
There are stable areas of encephalomalacia in the right anterior and middle cerebral artery territories, consistent with chronic infarctions.
The subarachnoid blood in the right cerebral sulci has resolved when compared to the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval increase in the size of a left chronic subdural hematoma with new rightward midline shift and mass effect.
[**2125-11-2**] chest xray: INDICATION: History of pneumonia.
There are increased interstitial markings within the lower lobes which are not significantly changed in the interval and are suggestive of congestive heart failure and pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There has been interval worsening of congestive heart failure and worsening of a confluent left retrocardiac opacity, as well.
There is no evidence of abnormal fluid collections.
There is a mild amount of subcutaneous edema adjacent to the tube insertion site.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of abnormal fluid collections adjacent to PEG site.
[**11-6**] upper extremity ultrasound: INDICATION: History of bacteremia, assess for thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
Assess for left hip pain status-post fall.
There is mild-to-moderate degenerative change in the left hip with joint space narrowing and marginal osteophytes.
Allowing for this, no fracture or dislocation is detected involving the proximal left femur.
