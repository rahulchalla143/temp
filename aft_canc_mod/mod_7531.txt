Admission Date:  [**2105-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Seizure disorder  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral Angiogram with embolization [**2105-2-17**] Right Craniotomy for mass resection [**2105-2-18**] PEG placement on [**2105-2-26**] tracheostomy [**2105-3-5**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 78 year old woman who was recently on the neurosurgery service for 1 year of memory changes and approximately 3 months of short-term memory decline.
She then presented to our  ED from [**Hospital 1319**] rehab for decreased movement of her left upper extremity and concern for seizure activity.
For 3 days, her son noted that she was not moving the left side of her body and that she had a right gaze preference.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Extensive vasogenic edema in the right cerebral hemisphere, and mass effect, unchanged.
No evidence of brain herniation or intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2-13**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG, due to the presence of two isolated right posterior frontal epileptiform discharges, suggesting a focal area of potential epileptogenesis.
In addition, the presence of more focal left temporal slowing suggesting a region of subcortical dysfunction, while the slow background is consistent with a mild encephalopathy, though it could also be seen in a patient with extensive and bilateral subcortical lesions such as can occur with vascular white matter disease.
[**2-18**] MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited post-contrast MRI images obtained for surgical localization of an extra-axial mass consistent with left sphenoid plane meningioma.
[**2-18**] CT head: Right-sided pneumocephalus with a small subdural hemorrhage causing leftward shift of the normally midline structures by 4 mm.
Hypodense appaearance of the right medial temporal lobe and absal ganglia- may relate to edema from recent surgery, tumor or ischemia.
[**2-18**]: MRI Brain: Limited post-contrast MRI images obtained for surgical localization of an extra-axial mass consistent with left sphenoid plane meningioma.
Acute ischemia in the right posterior MCA territory.
[**2105-2-20**] ECHO The TEE probe could not be passed into the esophagus due to mental status, agitation, and marked hypertension in the setting of stroke and recent craniotomy.
Persistent irregularity of the right supraclinoid ICA and proximal MCA.
Increased focal narrowing at the bifurcation of the right supraclinoid ICA which is more narrow compared to preoperative CTA.
Relative narrowing of the distal MCA suggestive of low flow or spasm.
There has been slight increase in midline shift, however, the ventricles remain unchanged in size.
[**2105-2-22**] CT head IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes of right frontal craniotomy, with residual trace extra-axial hemorrhage and evolving right MCA infarct resulting in continued 8 mm leftward shift, subfalcine herniation, and minimally increased crowding of the basal cisterns.
[**3-2**]: Echo No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
Mild mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets.
No evidence for DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old woman who was previously seen by the neurosurgery team for mental status changes and menory issues and was diagnosed with a right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma and she was sent to rehab with plans to reurn for resection on [**2105-2-18**].
She was thought to have seizure activity and left sided weakness at the facility and she was transfered to the ED on [**2-12**] and admitted by the Neuromedicine team.
On [**2-13**] the patient was noted to have left neglect and was hemiparetic in the left upper extremity.
She also had a speech and swallow evalaution which she failed and was made NPO including oral medications.
On [**2-14**] her dilantin level was 15.9 and she was noted to have right frontal seziures.
She underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram on [**2-17**] which revealed severe narrowing of the right ICA & ACA due to tumor compression.
Surgery was without complication.
Post op head CT revealed no hemorrhage.
She continued on decadron 4mg q6hrs and dilantin and keppra for seizure prophylaxsis.
Neuro stroke requested CTA head and neck as well as a HA1C, lipid panel, blood cxs, and TEE.
On [**2-21**] she had a CT showing evolving infarct and mild worsening of her MLS.
Mannitol was started with NA and Osm checks and CT [**2-22**] showed no change in infarct or MLS.
EEG was showing breakthrough seizures on [**2-23**] and Keppra was increased.
By [**2-25**] no further seizures were noted and EEG was discontinued.
On [**2-27**] a family meeting was held and patient was extubated after her PEG placement, but was subsequently reintubated on [**2-28**] when she had difficulty managing her secreations on [**2-28**].
LENIS were negative for DVT  [**3-4**]: Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 39798**] was hypertensive episodes  and received both hydralazine and lisinopril.

You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort.
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????

Bleeding from groin puncture site  *SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) Lie down, keep leg straight and have someone apply firm pressure to area for 10 minutes.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
