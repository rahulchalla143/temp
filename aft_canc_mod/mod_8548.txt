Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Hypovolemia Hypogammaglobulinemia  Secondary Diagnosis End-stage Renal Disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, improved, BP 95/68   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after feeling faint at dialysis yesterday.
It was likely not a cardiac event that made you feel faint, but rather that too much fluid was taken off during dialysis.
You also have no evidence of infection, as your urinalysis and chest xray were normal.
You also had some measurements of low blood pressure while you were hospitalized, which improved with small amounts of intravenous fluids.
The following changes were made to your medications: Please take your Digoxin every 3 days rather than daily, since you were found to have an elevated Digoxin level during your last hospitalization.
