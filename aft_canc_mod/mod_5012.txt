Pt is a poor historian because she is schizo-affective with some mental retardation, but states that her abdominal pain started 5 days PTA and was located all over.
It prevented her from eating anything because it made the pain worse.
She then had an episode of emesis that appeared dark, gastroccult positive.
An NG lavage appeared bilious and cleared after 900cc.
She received a total of 10 liters of fluid in the ED and blood pressure stabilized in the 100s/60s.

HISTORY: 68-year-old female with fever, urinary tract infection, leukocytosis, and hyperdense renal lesions seen on recent CT, now with rising creatinine.
Again demonstrated are bilateral hypodense foci of both kidneys similar to low attenuation lesions seen on recent CT and most compatible with cysts.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or solid renal mass.
Small somewhat atrophic appearing kidneys without hydronephrosis.
Bilateral renal cysts.
A small left pleural effusion persists.
Sinus rhythm.
Partially disrupted previous anastomosis site with surrounding fat necrosis, acute and chronic inflammation, and granulation tissue.
Four lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
Clinical:   Resection of ileocolonic anastamosis.
There are numerous adhesions and areas of apparent fat necrosis.
The specimen is serially sectioned at the site of anastomosis to reveal a large area of surrounding indurated fat measuring up to 10.5 x 7.3 x 6.5 cm.
No other masses or lesions are identified.
The specimen is represented as follows: A = ileal margin, B = colonic margin, C-E = adipose tissue near site of anastomosis, F-G  = ileal and colonic tissue at site of anastomosis, respectively, H = normal appearing ileum, I-R = adipose tissue for lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted to the Medicine and underwent abdominal CT which showed no acute pathology though exam was limited due to lack of contrast but did reveal an ileus.
A suspicion was raised by radiology of an intusussception of the distal small bowel.
The patient however, had an clinical abdominal exam that was increasingly worrisome for peritonitis and a lactate elevation.
A mass was found in the distal ileal and cecal area that was densely adherent to the retroperitoneum with neovasculature over the mass suggestive of a malignant tumor.
In addition, there was frank perforation of the ascenting colon, which was non-obstructed.
Because of the predicted problems with fluid management due to diabetes insipidus as well as the known durability of ileocolic anastomoses the patient was treated by right hemicolectomy with ileocolonic anastomosis.
the patient initially did well and was on a regular diet by day 7, but nonetheless on [**1-6**] there was a fluid collection in her abdomen that was drained.
She was again taken to the operating room on [**1-10**] for resection of ileocolic anastomosis with right upper quadrant phlegmon, drainage of intraperitoneal abscess and formation of ileostomy.
Her ostomy output was initially high; she was later started on Loperamide to slow down output to allow for better absorption of her oral intake.
During her postoperative period she was placed on enteral tube feedings and later underwent a Speech and Swallow evaluation; she was assessed as an aspiration risk and was placed on nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids.
Also inferior to stoma at 6 o'clock position, is small wound from old drain site, 0.5 cm with 1.5 cm depth(much less tunneling).
Placed new pouching system, and connected to bed side drainage.
Patient has large abdominal incisional line with stay sutures, at the distal site is partial-thickness wound 0.5 cm, slightly raised from skin level, bed is pink, and edges attached.
She was hyponatremic during her ICU stay and was felt due to volume depletion; she was given IV fluids and the problem was corrected.
It should be mentioned that she has a history of diabetes insipidus likely secondary to Lithium.
Intravenous fluids were increased as felt likely from hypovolemia related to her increased ostomy output.
Also of note she was previously on Vancomycin and did have elevated levels; the Vanco was stopped; this along with the Lithium and high ostomy output all are felt to be contributing her acute renal failure.
A renal ultrasound was also ordered; no hydronephrosis noted; bilateral renal cysts present.
Her IV fluids were increased and will likely require further adjustment given her history of diabetes insipidus.
Physical therapy was consulted due to her deconditioned status and have recommended acute rehab post hospital stay.
