POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Gastrointestinal cutaneous fistula, desmoid tumor of abdominal wall and desmoplastic reaction throughout her abdomen.
PROCEDURE:  Resection of the abdominal wall desmoid; exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3/1/2 hours), takedown ileostomy, small bowel resection, resection of fistula and end ileostomy.
Drainage of abdominal abscess.
She continued to have an abscess through her abdominal wall on the Vicryl mesh.
The place where the fistula had leaked through the abdominal wall was oversewn and we opened up the abdominal wall to enter an abdominal abscess and also an abscess within the abdomen which was then drained.
This had given some ability to perform an area of fascia which we used finally for closure.
We then turned our attention to the right side and then freed up the subcutaneous tissue and a very vascular abdominal wall with a desmoid which was approximately 13-15 cm long and probably 10 cm wide.
After the adhesions were lysed and we had taken down some of the desmoid and freed up the entire small bowel although not from the desmoid mass, which was in the mesentery actually from the top to the bottom, we had been able to resect the ileostomy and bring it back and see that there were several areas of fistula in the ileostomy which we had 3 in all, including 2 which were chronic and 1 which I suspect we did taking down the ileostomy.
The ileostomy was then grasped with three 3-0 silks but we could not maneuver it into the old ileostomy because it would not reach and so we would close that later and then create a new opening for the ileostomy about 4 inches down the abdomen and this was done by making a cruciate incision in the abdominal wall which had a desmoplastic reaction as everything else she had did.
We then continued with lysis of adhesions until we were certain that we had gotten the ileostomy down to the end and that we could do a new ileostomy and also to try and eliminate as many areas of obstruction with the desmoid as we could.
Two areas of enterotomy, 1 on the right side, and 1 which I am certain was an enterotomy but may have simply been an area where she had an old abscess were then closed with interrupted 4-0 silk and 5-0 Prolene.
We then were able to irrigate the abdomen and place [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain in the lower quadrant so the jejunostomy would Witzel with five or six 4-0 silk sutures and bring it up out through a stab wound of the anterior abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant.
The wound was closed in layers with a #1 Prolene on the old ileostomy site which we closed horizontally with interrupted #1 Prolene.
The wound was then closed in layers with #1 Prolene to the anterior abdominal wall.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was then placed over the fascia, 3-0 Vicryl to the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl with subcuticular closure.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a 36-year-old female with a history of multiple surgeries, external beam radiation and desmoid tumor throughout her retroperitoneum who has long standing bilateral hydronephrosis (right worse than left).
Her genitalia were prepped and draped in a standard sterile manner; the vagina was filled with a whitish discharge which was thoroughly cleaned before the procedure began.
The bladder was fully inspected and no abnormalities were noted.
The stent was in good position and films were taken of the curl in the renal pelvis and in the bladder of the left ureteral stent.
WCD  Date: [**2132-4-21**] Signed by [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 8848**], MD on [**2132-5-2**] Affiliation: [**Hospital1 18**] NEEDS COSIGN  FOLLOWUP HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 36-year-old woman who has had a long history of desmoid tumors.
She was initially diagnosed with this in [**2117**] and has had multiple desmoids removed from her foot and her back.
In [**2121**], she had a desmoid in her abdomen, which was resected.
Interestingly, she has also had Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2117**] as well, which is reported to us as being stage IV.
She was admitted to the hospital in [**Month (only) **] with a desmoid tumor of the abdomen that was causing obstruction.
She had this diverted by colostomy and has had multiple problems since.
She has an enterocutaneous fistula in her abdomen, which has not healed.
She was eventually discharged after many months in the hospital; however, spent about a month at home and then began to  have fevers and chills and was re-admitted on [**2132-4-9**] with probable intra-abdominal infection.
She had  a fifth CT of the abdomen on [**2132-4-10**], which revealed an enterocutaneous fistula in the mid-abdomen.
There was no gas or fluid collection or abscess in the abdomen and pelvis.
There was  a 7 x 3.9 enhancing right anterior abdominal wall mass, which has decreased in size since the prior examination.
She also had a fistulogram on [**2132-4-15**], which reveals the persistent enterocutaneous fistula between the ileum and the skin.
Midway through her hospital course, she had an increase in her fever curve and blood cultures did reveal Enterobacter cloacae and she has been treated with antibiotics.
GENERAL: She is awake, alert, and oriented in no apparent distress.
No JVD, lymphadenopathy, or thyromegaly.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There is a catheter in the fistula as well as an ostomy bag overlying it.
Her abdomen is mildly tender.
Large desmoid tumor of the abdomen.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continues to have problems with the enterocutaneous fistula.
She has had an episode of bacteremia during this hospital course, which has apparently been controlled.
She continues to have fistula output  and persistence of the fistula on the fistulogram and CT. She is  going to go to surgery tomorrow to potentially fix this.
We agree with continuing the tamoxifen and sulindac while she is  dealing with the infectious and enterocutaneous complications of  the tumor and surgery.
She is having a very slow and expected small response to tamoxifen and sulindac, and if she has a stabilization of the response or actual growth, it would be beneficial to start chemotherapy with a doxorubicin-based regimen.
Currently, though, she is not in a position to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy with the ongoing fistula and infectious issues.
With regard to her anemia, she likely has an anemia of chronic disease and would benefit from Procrit.
After she is discharged from the hospital, we will see her in followup for the desmoid tumors and help to manage these long-term.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63870**] MD  eScription document:[**4-/2132**]  cc:[**Hospital1 63871**]   Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 1154**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the surgical service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-4-9**] with the diagnosis of an enterocutaneous fistula.
There was a high suspicion for an intra-abdominal abscess at this time because she was spiking fevers and had abdominal tenderness.
A CT scan on HD 2 showed no evidence for discrete rim-enhancing or gas-containing fluid collection/abscess within the abdomen or pelvis.
On HD 4, she developed a new fistula just above the old one, probably from the same loop.
On HD 7, she had a fistulogram which revealed filling of the previously demonstrated enterocutaneous fistula, retrograde from the location of the ostomy site, consistent with a fistula between the ileum and the enterocutaneous fistula.
On HD 14 Meropenem was added and she had the following operations: Resection of the abdominal wall desmoid; exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3/1/2 hours), takedown ileostomy, small bowel resection, resection of fistula and end ileostomy.
Drainage of abdominal abscess.
On POD 4, she was much less nauseous, however a KUB showed multiple loops of dilated small bowel with air-fluid levels indicating ileus versus obstruction.
She had increased abdominal pain and distension.
On POD 10, she developed acute onset upper abdominal pain and pleuritic chest pain.
A chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe opacity.
A CT of the abdomen demonstrated marked diffuse abdominal inflammatory process with multiple fluid collections is grossly unchanged from [**2132-4-10**], without definite evidence for perforation.
On POD 22, an ultrasound of her abdomen showed a right lower quadrant abdominal wall collection with echogenic fluid and a slightly thick wall.
A trace amount of fluid was aspirated from the abdominal wall fluid collection (this likely represents an organizing hematoma).
On POD 34, she had a renal ultrasound which showed bilateral grade 2 hydronephrosis, which is unchanged when compared to [**2132-5-2**].
It also showed cortical parenchymal loss in the right kidney suggesting chronicity.
Her JP drain culture showed Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas that was pan sensitive.
On POD 43 her J-tube outputs continued to rise with question of possible fistula with JP drain.
On POD 47 a fistulogram was performed which showed a RLQ enterocutaneous fistula that fills the bowel from the distal JP, with a small surrounding abscess.
They were unable to place the right ureteral stent due to stricture.
On POD 49 an abdominal CT scan was done showing no new abscess.
The scan also showed that the desmoid tumor was getting smaller.
On POD 63 she complained of nausea and vomiting.
On POD 65 she developed a fever to 101.9.
As she continued to have fevers and was tachycardic, a septic source was questioned.
On POD 79 she was seen by the oncology service and they recommended continuing tamoxifen, as the desmoid lesion seemed to be regressing on this therapy.
An ultrasound was performed which showed biliary sludge in a non-distended gallbladder.
On POD 98 there was decreased output from her ostomy.
Urine and blood were sent for analysis and culture.
Her Aztreonam was restarted and a CXR was ordered which was negative for infective process.
By POD 118 she was afebrile and doing well.
