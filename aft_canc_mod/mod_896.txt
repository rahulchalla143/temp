Admission Date:  [**2160-4-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-5-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2097-12-31**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 15427**] is a 62-year-old woman who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3105**] for shortness of breath over the last two days.
She is a 62-year-old woman with history of small cell lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was well until one week ago when she began to develop a productive cough streaked with blood.
Over the last two days, she noticed worsening shortness of breath with exertion particularly with stairs.
A chest x-ray showed increased pleural effusion.
The patient denied fever, chest pain, orthopnea (sleeps on one pillow), and peripheral edema.
There was no abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or bloody stool.
At baseline she is able to walk a block but becomes short of breath with inclines.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion on Sotalol, last echocardiogram in 1/00 showed an ejection fraction greater than 55% and normal systolic function; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1/FVC of 68%; atrial septal defect status post repair in [**2155**]; and small cell carcinoma status post radiation and Cisplatin.
A transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2158-11-25**] showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension.
A MIBI in [**2159-11-26**] showed mild partial reversible defect in the vascular portion of the inferior wall.
She was afebrile with blood pressure of 112/90, pulse 84, saturation 91% on 4 liters nasal cannula and 80% on room air.
The chest showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally with wheezing and crackles bibasilarly.
The rate was regular with no murmurs.
The abdomen was soft and nontender with no edema.
There was right bundle branch block, T wave inversions from V2-V3, and ST depressions in V4 and V6 which were old.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In brief, Mrs. [**Known lastname 15427**] is a 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oat cell carcinoma, and congestive heart failure who presented in respiratory distress with one week of productive cough and hemoptysis.
Her presentation was likely consistent with COPD exacerbation secondary to bronchitis; however pulmonary embolism could not be excluded based on her risk factors such as cancer, immobility, and pleuritic pain.
Laboratory workup was also concerning for acute renal failure and hyponatremia.
Cardiovascular:  Electrocardiogram was concerning for anterior subendocardial ischemia; however this was unchanged from previously.
She eventually ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs and as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] we continued Sotalol for her atrial fibrillation despite her COPD exacerbation.
The final [**Location (un) 1131**] on the EKG showed worsening T wave inversions in leads III and aVF.
Upon discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], he felt that her presentation was most likely secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation rather than an acute coronary syndrome.
An outpatient stress test was not recommended because of her clinical presentation.
She was continued on telemetry and there were no further events.
Pulmonary:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation secondary to bronchitis versus pneumonia.
She received empiric treatment of pneumonia given her cough, hemoptysis, and bandemia with Levaquin.
Rule out pulmonary embolus:  The PE test probability for pulmonary embolus was low to moderate given her risk factors.
We could not initiate CT angiogram given her renal failure nor VQ given her effusions.
She was already in part anticoagulated for her atrial fibrillation and she came in with an INR of 4.5.
As for her hemoptysis, this engaged a broad differential including bronchitis, cancer, and pneumonia versus pulmonary embolus.
She had no further episodes of hemoptysis in hospital.
Renal:  Acute renal failure was likely secondary to prerenal versus Motrin.
A FENA was checked and this was 0.1% which concurred with prerenal failure.
Hyponatremia was felt to be secondary to hypovolemia and possibly a combination of syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Cortisol was sent and was falsely elevated due to her already being on steroids.
Infectious disease:  It was unclear where the source of her bandemia originated.
Social:  The patient was seen by physical therapy who felt that she had no acute rehabilitation needs.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation secondary to pneumonia; acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.
