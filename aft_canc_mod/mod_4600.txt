Admission Date:  [**2155-9-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: referred for evaluation of posterior mediastinal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T3-9 Laminectomies Bronchial aspirate, CT-guided biopsy.
man with a significant smoking history and COPD who presented to an OSH with fatigue, 40lb wt loss since [**Month (only) **], weakness, and back pain; he was found to have a large posterior mediastinal mass concerning for malignancy, possibly lymphoma.
Main issues were pain management and respiratory optimization; in addition, he was extremely weak and unable to walk.
The patient's symptoms began as back pain in [**2155-5-8**] when he was diagnosed with compression fractures of his spine after lifting boxes.
Since that time the patient has had diffuse, vague pains in his chest, back and abdomen.
More recently, over the past 3-5 weeks the patient has developed signficant loss of appetite and a 40 lb weight loss.
Past Medical History: COPD, 80 pk/yr smoker Hypercholesterolemia s/p Appendectomy Hernias, s/p multiple repairs with current umbilical hernia Sebaceous cysts Lipomas s/p Arthroscopic knee surgery   Social History: >1ppd x40 yrs Separated from wife 4 months ago after 35 years of marriage.
Family History: Mother with DM and died of colon CA at 64 Father with emphysema   Physical Exam:  VS 98.9 134/66 78 18 96%4L  Gen: Ill appearing man older than stated age.
Mild diffuse tenderness.
CT chest ([**2155-9-3**]): Large heterogeneous posterior mediastinal mass, abutting the carina from its posterior aspect, and involving the aorta and the spine.
It may represent a primary lung or esophageal cancer, or perhaps lymphoma.
Infection cannot be excluded, however, although the bony structures appear intact, arguing again epidural abscess.
Bacterial or tuberculous infection is also possible, the latter perhaps less likely due to the lack of evidence for it elsewhere.
Severe emphysema.
Bibasilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis.
Probable involvement of the esophagus by the mass.
Vague stranding about the mesentery and pancreatic regions.
It does not appear to focus distinctly on the pancreas, but it may be helpful to correlate with pancreatic enzymes.
Multiple lower thoracic and lumbar compression fractures.
CT head ([**2155-9-3**]): No evidence of acute intracranial process .
Chest Xray ([**2155-9-3**]): Widened mediastinum, which is consistent with the history of a mediastinal mass.
Probable bibasilar atelectasis or scarring.
man with history of smoking, COPD with multiple constitutional complaints and large posterior mediatinal mass concerning for malignancy.
# mediastinal mass: highly concerning for malignancy.
There was considerable difficulty obtaining tissue for diagnosis.
The patient had a broncial aspirate which grew strep viridans and oral flora and a CT-guided biopsy that revealed only inflammatory cells.
While awaiting pathologic diagnosis, the patient developed acute neurologic symptoms including a mid-thoracic sensory deficit and lower extremity weakness.
BM biopsy confirmed multiple myeloma with a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma.
He developed steroid-induced hyperglycemia for which he was covered with a regular insulin sliding scale.
The patient was not started on chemo agents due to the above described viridans superinfection.
The patient will likely not be eligible for radiation for [**3-13**] weeks after his neurosurgical intervention.
# Infectious.
The strep viridans from the mediastinal mass initially raised the question as to whether this was an abscess or a neoplasm with a superinfection.
Differential diagnosis included mediastinal abscess and/or vertebral osteomyelitis.
# Spinal cord compression.
The patient developed acute neurologic symptoms secondary to cord compression during the course of his initial evaluation.
He underwent emergent laminectomy of multiple thoracic levels for cord compression.
At the time of discharge, the patient has persistent bilateral lower extremity weakness worse in the proximal distribution with a sensory deficit to the mid thoracic level.
The patient requires a wound check and neurosurgical follow-up as scheduled within 2 weeks.
The patient continues to require a foley catheter due to incontinence.
# Pain management.
The patient had significant pain secondary to the myeloma as well as post-operatively.
He was followed by the Chronic Pain Service.
At one point he received an intrathecal dilaudid injection with some relief; he discussed placement of an intrathecal pump with his family but deferred for now.
At the time of discharge, he was managed with a lidocaine patch, standing MS Contin, standing methadone and dilaudid PO for breakthrough pain.
# Hypercalcemia.
This was most consistent with hypercalcemia of malignancy.
# Anemia of chronic disease.
# Sacral decubitus skin breakdown.
The patient developed sacral skin breakdown after developing incontinence secondary to cord compression.
He requires continued wound care.
# Emphysema.
The patient developed a 2-3L supplemental oxygen requirement thought secondary to baseline lung disease, exacerbated by his posterior mediastinal mass as well as the post-operative state.
# Constipation.
The patient requires an aggressive bowel regimen.
# History of compression fractures.
Secondary to underlying disease.
# Hypercholesterolemia.
