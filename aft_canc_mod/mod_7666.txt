Patient was admitted from  [**Date range (1) 92228**]/12 where bone marrow biopsy showed evidence of MDS (in comparison to prior biopsy which was concerning for erythroleukemia).
She was treated with 2 cycles of decitabine and revlimid (2/20-2/29), and was transfusion dependent throughout admission.
As above, marrow was concerning for acute leukemia, however, there was not enough marrow obtained.
Patient was seen in clinic today and was pancytopenic   Past Medical History: Diabetes Type II Glaucoma with blindness in right eye Obesity Bipolar disorder TAH in the [**2128**] for uterine cancer [**2128**] Left eye with cataract surgery Back operation [**2138**] R knee replacement [**2158**]   Social History: Prior to illness, was living alone, no siblings.
No alcohol or drugs.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
TISSUE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bone marrow biopsy [**4-23**]- Markedly hypercellular marrow with trilineage dysplasia in keeping with persistent involvement by patient's known myelodysplastic syndrome, with  increased pronormoblasts worrisome for an evolving pure erythroleukemia (see note).
Note: Increased abnormal early pronormoblasts are seen comprising approximately 40% of aspirate differential and nearly 60% of core cellularity.
There is background trilineage dysplasia seen.
No increase in CD34-immunoreactive myeloid blasts is seen.
Compared to a prior biopsy (S12-2277W dated [**2160-2-24**]) the current marrow shows a greater proportion of erythroid precursors with an increased relative proportion of early pronormoblasts.
MRI w/contrast [**4-25**]- No acute abnormality.
Mild pachymeningeal enhancement which could represent sequela of recent LP.
Right globe abnormality could represent sequela of prior hemorrhage.
No evidence for acute ischemia or hydrocephalus.
No pleural abnormality or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
EEG [**4-30**]- This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior quadrant.
There is also moderate diffuse background slowing and a slow alpha rhythm.
These findings are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior quadrant and a moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is  etiologically non-specific.
No epileptiform discharges were present.
No evidence of infectious process within the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Interval resolution of previously seen ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo F with h/o bipolar disorder, obesity, DM, right eye blindness, and MDS presenting with worsening pancytopenia.
# MDS, transformed to acute leukemia: s/p 2 cycles decitabine and revlimid (5q- cytogenetics) with evidence of transformation to acute erythroblastic leukemia with 60% erythroblastic core.
7+3 was deferred in the setting of acute delirium (see below).
# Mental status change: Patient had acute change in mental status on [**4-24**].
MRI had no acute abnormalities.
20 min EEG showed no epileptiform discharges or seizure activity, however there was some focality in left lobe, that may have been representative of seizure activity.
Neurology also recommended checking anti-TPO antibody (despite normal TSH/T3) for concern for Hashimoto's encephalopathy that returned normal.
An LP was performed on [**4-30**] and was not consistent with infection.
No malignant cells were seen.
Psych was also consulted and felt that patient was acutely delirious, not depressed or psychotic.
However, patient's lithium and fluphenazine had both been decreased during last admission, so there was concern that these medication changes may have precipitated change in mental status.
# Abdominal pain:  During admission, the patient developed acute abdominal pain.
She was passing gas and without peritoneal signs.
KUB and upright without free air under diaphragm or enlarged loops of bowel concerning for obstruction.
CT abdomen was without acute pathology.
The patient did have chronically elevated AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and normal bilirubin, but no evidence of acute liver pathology.
Pain resolved without intervention.
# Left upper thigh lesion: Crusted, papular non erythematous lesion on left upper thigh noted on [**5-1**].
Patient denied pruritus or pain at site, and was not sure how it developed.
Dermatology consulted and felt that lesion was less likely leukemia cutis, more likely a ruptured cyst or follicle with granulomatous response.
Punch biopsy showed ruptured folliculitis.
# Renal insufficiency: Likely chronic disease, with estimated GFR of 45% during last admission.
# Glaucoma: continued timolol .
# ICU course- Upon arrival to the ICU the pt was persistently delirious unable to communicate to the staff.
