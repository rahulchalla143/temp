Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-3-20**] no diagnostic interval change.
Extensive centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema is better assessed on prior CT, though accounts for the lucency in the upper lungs, primarily in the left paramediastinal region.
There is likely a stable small right pleural effusion.
There is no definite sign of new consolidation.
Chronic interstitial lung disease secondary to emphysema with prominent paraseptal emphysema accounting for left upper lobe lucency.
[**2185-4-14**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation at a rate of 112.
Compared to tracing #1 no diagnostic interval change.
Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3.
[**2185-4-14**] CXR: SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is unchanged severe cardiomegaly.
There has been significant interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary vascular congestion as demonstrated on radiograph one day prior.
Biapical cystic changes more prominent on the left due to emphysema are better demonstrated on prior CT.
There is no focal consolidation to suggest acute pneumonia.
There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
Marked interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary vascular congestion since one day prior.
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
[**2185-4-15**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with septal hypokinesis (LVEF= 45-50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Small (~0.5 cm) echodense structure(s) seen on the aortic side of the aortic valve similar to Lambl's excrescence although somewhat thickened appearance raises suspicion of possible vegetation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, laterally directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Small echodense structure seen on aortic valve in the prior study slightly more prominent in the current study but could be due to differences in image quality.
[**2185-4-15**] CXR: Emphysema is severe, mild pulmonary edema improved since [**4-13**].
Tiny left pleural effusion may be present.
Leftward mediastinal shift longstanding and does not indicate left lower lobe collapse.
[**2185-4-16**] CXR: There is mild progression of consolidation seen in the left lower lobe.
Known extensive bilateral emphysema.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, left slightly greater than right.
[**4-18**] TEE: No evidence of endocarditis.
0.6 x 1.0 cm right lower lobe nodular pulmonary density, which could represent scarring adjacent to the emphysematous bullae, but enlarging pulmonary nodule, potentially suspicious for malignancy, cannot be excluded.
Short interval followup is recommended with dedicated chest CT in three months.
2.7 cm oval hypodense lesion in the left lateral abdominal wall, intramuscular in location, may represent a small abscess or less likely a hypoenhancing mass.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Emphysema, atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right atrial enlargement.
Please correlate with any history of recent Foley catheterization.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3.4 cm and right common iliac artery aneurysm.
[**4-21**] Abd U/S: 3-cm left flank intramuscular fluid collection, which is amenable to ultrasound-guided aspiration.
No evidence of aortoenteric fistula.
Severe emphysema.
Right lower lobe nodule which requires follow-up, as previously advised.
Extensive opacification is again seen at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm and some shift of the mediastinum to that side.
This is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Viewed small right pleural effusion with continued engorgement of pulmonary vessel is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
[**4-26**] Colonoscopy:  Mucosa: Area of erythema in the proximal ascending colon.
[**Month (only) 116**] be [**1-25**] trauma from scope vs. underlying angioectasias.
No mass lesions seen.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the colon (biopsy) No bleeding found.
No mass lesions seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old man with past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure, recent pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia admitted with respiratory distress, bacteremia.
# Bacteremia/Sepsis: Blood cultures drawn on admission grew Enterococcus faecalis.
Sensitivities later revealed pan-sensitive enterococcus, and linezolid was changed to ampicillin.
He did have an episode of tachycardia and hypotension on the floor, which responded to intravenous fluids.
A trans-thoracic echo was performed to evaluate for possible vegetation, which showed an echodense structure on the aortic valve.
To further evaluate, an transesophageal echo was obtained, which showed no endocarditis.
# COPD/Respiratory Distress: On [**4-15**], the patient was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea and a worsening oxygen requirement in the setting of IV fluid administration for hypotension.
It is likely that, in this patient with heart failure and advanced COPD on 2L home O2, he has limited pulmonary reserve so that even mild pulmonary edema result in significant distress.
There was no evidence of pulmonary infection on imaging and urine legionella was negative.
# Lower GI Bleed: On [**4-23**], the patient passed bloody bowel movements.
He underwent CT angiogram of his abdomen, which was negative for aortoenteric fistula.
The patient subsequently underwent colonoscopy which was unrevealing for acute bleed, but erythematous mucosa was biopsied to evaluate for arteriovenous malformation.
His aspirin and warfarin had been held, but were restarted on his day of transfer to rehab, as his hematocrit had been stable with no further bleeds for about a week.
# Hyponatremia:  Variably attributed to SIADH and hyervolemic hyponatremia.
# Atrial Fibrillation: He was in atrial fibrillation with variable rate control.
Weakness/tremor: Believed to be related to recent addition of citalopram.
The patient also takes trazodone, but did not display any other signs of serotonin syndrome such as nausea/vomitting/diarrhea.
Pulmonary hypertension/PE: No formal workup in setting of subacute pulmonary embolus.
PE Likely contributing to right ventricular volume overload and pulmonary hypertension as above.
Patient tolerated systemic anticoagulation until he experienced his GI bleed (see above).
CLL: The patient's WBC count trended down from its baseline level (20-30K) when the patient developed bacteremia (see above).
As his bacteremia was treated, his WBC count rose to a level consistent with his baseline level.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) Nebulizer treatment Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for wheezing/SOB.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 11753**], You came to the hospital for weakness, tremor and fatigue.
You were found to have bacteria in your blood.
You were given antibiotics intravenously and your symptoms improved.
You also had a urinary tract infection that improved with antibiotics.
You had respiratory distress and had to go to the intensive care unit, where your breathing improved with medications to help remove fluid from your body.
You later developed gastrointestinal bleeding and you had an upper endoscopy as well as a colonoscopy.
Your bleeding stopped, and your blood count was subsequently stable.
Please continue to take this through the evening of [**2185-4-30**], to complete a fourteen day course - Started FUROSEMIDE 20 mg tabs, one tab by mouth once daily, to prevent excess fluid from accumulating in your body - Started LIDOCAINE 5% patches, applied once daily to area of rib pain - Started LORAZEPAM 0.5 mg tabs, one tab every eight hours as needed for anxiety - Started DOCUSATE 100 mg tabs, one tab TWICE DAILY for softening your stools - Started SENNA 8.6 mg tabs, one tab TWICE DAILY AS NEEDED for constipation - Increased DILTIAZEM to 30 mg tabs, TWO TABS by mouth every six hours - Discontinued CITALOPRAM, as it may have been exacerbating your tremor - Discontinued chlorthalidone - We had held your aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin) after your bleed, but we have restarted both of these medications today, since your bleeding has stopped.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any fevers, worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, or other new concerning symptoms.
