Multiple thoracic laminotomies.
Multiple lumbar laminotomies.
History of Present Illness: Patient is 50 Male with metastatic melanoma, mets in brain/spine, recent ICH a few weeks ago d/c on [**9-3**], now with worsening back pain uncontrolled on current medications.
His has trouble remembering exact dates and details about his pain as he has had some memory impairment from his recent intracranial hemorrhage.
He currently rates his back pain as a [**2117-8-13**].
He denies pain in his legs but says he has intermittent sensation, particularly in the right leg.
He has underlying fecal and urinary incontinence as baseline, requiring foley and adult brief.
In the ED, his vital signs were 98 120 158/66 18 99% RA, pain was rated as a [**6-12**].
He was given dilaudid 1 mg iv x1 with good pain control.
In [**2-/2113**], he underwent biopsy of a right clavicular lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing a 0.45 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level III melanoma.
In [**6-/2114**], he had biopsy of a left mandible skin lesion revealing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10834**] level III, 0.51 mm thick melanoma with three mitoses per mm2.
On [**2114-7-23**], he underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] with no residual melanoma at the primary site, but one of three lymph nodes showed a microscopic deposit of melanoma.
He underwent modified left neck dissection on [**2114-7-30**] with no melanoma noted in seven additional nodes.
In [**2115-6-4**], he underwent biopsy of a new right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing metastatic melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component and two mitoses per mm2.
It was unclear whether this represented an in-tranist metastasis from his right clavicle melanoma or an epidermatrophic metastasis.
There was no evidence of residual melanoma in the chest or in the sentinel lymph node.
Torso CT in [**9-11**] revealed new small bilateral pulmonary nodules and an abnormal right kidney.
Therapy was held on C1W4, [**1-12**], due to visual problems, fatigue and anorexia.

Skin: no rashes or bruising GU: scrotal swelling, normal rectal tone, stool in vault, guaic neg Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII intact except right CN [**Doctor First Name 81**]- weak shoulder shrug.
Extensive metastatic lesions involving the cervical and the thoracic spine as described above, ribs and the sternum as well as the liver as described above.
Focal lesion along the lateral aspect of the chest wall laterally, can be better assessed on CT. 2.
T11 moderate compression deformity, with moderate epidural component and pre/paravertebral component with severe canal stenosis and severe compression on the cord.
Subtle epidural component at C4 and C5 levels cannot be completely excluded.
Vague non-enhancing T2 hyperintense foci in the cord at C4 and C5 levels- of equivocal significance.
Diffuse metastatic disease involving the visualized vertebrae, the upper sacrum and the iliac bones included on the present study.
Diffuse metastatic disease involving the T11 vertebra with moderate loss of height(counting from S1 upwards), with moderate amount of epidural soft tissue component, with severe canal stenosis and severe degree of compression on the lower thoracic cord.
There is also increased posterior bulging of the T11 vertebral body compared to the [**Month (only) **] study with continued moderate decrease in the height in the anterior and the mid portions.
Moderate L4 compression deformity, with metastatic involvement of a moderate-sized pre-/para-vertebral soft tissue component.
No epidural component or significant canal stenosis at this level.
Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes in the lumbar spine as described above.
Diffuse altered signal intensity related to metastatic involvement.
Air locules in the posterior vertebral muscle as well as posterior subcutaneous tissues are most likely expected postoperative sequelae.
Evidence of thoracic and lumbar laminectomies at multiple levels, with metallic fixation rod extending from T6-S1.
Portions of study are incompletely evaluated due to streak artifact.
Within this limitation, no focal fluid collections are identified.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent compressive atelectasis/consolidation in the correct clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: #Spinal cord compression secondary to metastatic melanoma: Patient presented with worsening back pain.
On admission, his neuro exam was unchanged from previous with right sided weakness and sensory deficit.
His pain was controlled with MS contin 60 mg po BID and dilaudid 1-2 mg iv q1h.
MRI showed new lesion at L4, he got 1 session of radiation therapy on [**2117-9-20**].
In the evening of [**9-20**], patient had new weakness of the left lower extremity with developing sensory deficit.
Spinal MRI showed new spinal cord compression and T11.
He had a complicated SICU stay.
