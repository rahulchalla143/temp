Admission Date:  [**2112-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-2-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-2-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 62 yo M h/o achalasia s/p laparoscopic [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy [**Month (only) **] [**2111**], hyperlipidemia, BPH who presented to the ED with chest pain.
For the past few days he has complained of flu-like symptoms with right sided chest pain and was taking dayquil/nyquil for relief.
He went to work today with persistent chest pain and his daughter was called, who commented that he was very pale with weak pulses and appeared quite ill. She called 911, EMS arrived and provided 325 ASA.
Of note, he recently had an echo for lower extremity edema on [**2112-1-7**] which showed preserved EF of 55% and no wall motion abnormality (normal).
EKG showed ST elevations in I/AVL and V4-V5 with ST depressions in the inferior leads.
He also had a tight diagonal lesion that was angioplastied.
During the procedure he had some hypotension and a HCT was drawn showing a crit of 19.9 from 26.7 prior to cath.
He had one episode of melena during his last admission that resolved, with a HCT of 40 at discharge.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Dyslipidemia 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Achalasia s/p Laparoscopic [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy, Flexible esophagoscopy in [**2111-12-8**] - balloon dilatation in [**2094**] of his esophagus - GERD - dyslipidemia - hyperplastic polyps on colonoscopy five years ago.
- Mother: CVA and [**Name (NI) 11011**] - Father: - Brother: Congenital heart disease Family history is notable for a daughter with achalasia, mother who had myocardial infarction and mother and father who reportedly had blood clots and deep venous thromboses.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds with minor rales at the right base, rhonchi over the left middle lung field.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
[**2-1**]+ bilateral pitting edema to the shin.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe single-vessel CAD.
The LAD had a 99% thrombotic lesion in the mid-vessel segment.
This extended into the ostium of a large D1 branch causing total occlusion of the D1.
The LCX had mild luminal disease throughout.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left-sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 31mmHg.
[**2112-1-31**] Echocardiogram Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function and regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with coronary artery disease involving a proximal lesion in a likely wrap-around left anterior descending coronary artery.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared to the previous study of [**2112-1-7**] (images reviewed), the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and depression in left ventricular systolic ejection fraction are new.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now appreciated; it's presence/absence was not commented upon on the prior study.
Moderate pulmonary edema and central vascular congestion, with moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, compatible with cardiac decompensation, given current STEMI.
Dilated esophagus filled with food products and fluid, compatible with achalasia.
No secondary signs of perforation.
Global decrease in blood density, suggestive of chronic anemia.
No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
Specifically, no retroperitoneal bleed detected.
Bibasilar opacities, worse on the left, with possible new left effusion.
Limited assessment of superior mediastinum due to lordotic positioning.
Probable right humeral diaphysis enchondroma.
When the patient is stable, recommend clinical correlation to exclude any right humeral atypical pain and baseline right humerus radiographs to include the entire lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: 62M hx HLP, achalasia s/p myotomy [**12-11**], BPH, GERD who presented with one day of chest pain found to have STE in the anterolateral leads.
Cath complicated by acute bleeding from unknown source.
# STEMI: risk factors include hypercholesterolemia but otherwise no smoking history, no HTN, no DM, no fhx.
Found with large thrombus burden in the diagonal branch and a tight proximal LAD lesion, no s/p DESx2 to the LAD and angioplasty with clot retrieval of the diagonal.
TTE showed EF 35% with depressed left ventricular systolic function.
He did have some ventricular ectopy and an episode on Vtach lasting about 40 seconds, and was started on metoprolol.
# BLEED: Acute HCT drop from 26.7 in ED to 20 in cath lab.
One episode of melena after his surgery, however his HCT was stable and there were no further episodes of melena or BRBPR.
Due to his drop from 40 to 26.7 over the past 1.5 months, GI bleeding from either his procedure or LGI source is more likely.
CT chest/ abdomen/ pelvis showed no evidence of RT bleed and his hematocrits remained stable despite starting heparin.
# CHF: no hx of CHF, last ECHO [**2112-1-7**] with preserved EF of 55% and no wall motion abnormalities.
TTE showed new depressed left ventricular EF, LVEDP high at end of cath suggestive of poor forward flow.
We monitored his fluid status and diuresed him gently given risk of GI bleed.
# BRONCHITIS: Patient had an elevated WBC count, dyspnea, non-specific CXR findings, had a fever on one night.
Although these findings could be explained by post-MI inflammation and CHF, pneumonia or bronchitis could not be excluded.
# HLD - started atorvastatin 80.
Disp:*75 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation myocardial Infarction Ventricular tachycardia Acute systolic dysfunction Acute blood loss anemia Dyslipidemia GERD Achalsia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after having a heart attack.
If you have chest pain, take Nitroglycerin under your tongue as directed.
If the pain does not go away, call 911.
Since you had a heart attack you should switch your Simvastatin to Atorvastatin 80mg (stronger cholesterol medication).
We changed your omeprazole (prilosec) to pantoprazole because it does not interfere with the clopidogrel.
During your hospitalization you had ventricular tachycardia which can be a life threatening heart rhythm.
You were started on antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia.
This medication requires close monitoring and frequent blood draws.
Medication changes: STOP Simvastatin ADD Aspirin 325mg daily ADD Plavix 75mg daily ADD Atorvastatin 80mg daily ADD Azithromycin 500mg daily ADD Toprol 50mg daily ADD Coumadin 5mg daily (the dosing of this medication may change) ADD Nitroglycerin under your tongue if you need for chest pain ADD Pantroprazole to prevent bleeding  Your heart is weak after the heart attack and you need to watch yourself carefully for signs of fluid retention.
