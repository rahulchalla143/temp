Patient has poor recall of details.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Pertinent Results: CT scan [**2140-2-7**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval left frontal craniotomy.
Pneumocephalus overlies the left frontal and temporal lobes.
The left extra-axial collection persists but is smaller, measuring 11 mm in greatest transverse dimension.
There has been interval resection of the left frontal extra-axial mass.
The hyperdense left frontal lesion persists, with surrounding edema, and demonstrates a new hyperdense focus, consistent with a focus of hemorrhage.
11mm rightward shift of midline structures and left uncal herniation are not significantly changed.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Subcutaneous emphysema is present overlying to the craniotomy site.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain well aerated.
Interval resection of the left extra-axial mass, with expected pneumocephalus and slight decrease in size of the left extra-axial collection.
Enlarging hyperdense focus within the left frontal lesion, which may represent contiguous invagination from the resected extra-axial mass, concerning for additional hemorrhage.
Unchanged left frontal edema, 11-mm rightward shift of midline structures and mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle.
The left-sided convexity subdural hematoma with mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere, is again visualized.
There is also an enhancing mass lesion noted in the left frontal lobe, with significant vasogenic edema, shift of the midline structures to the right side with subfalcine herniation.
Limited post-contrast imaging, significantly limited by motion artifacts, with the left frontal lesion, and significant mass effect and subfalcine herniation, demonstrated for surgical planning, along with moderate left-sided subdural hematoma along the convexity.
If further evaluation, for additional lesions or better assessment is considered necessary, repeat evaluation can be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted after having mental status changes and headaches.
He was found to have a mass with midline shift and a SDH.
However he did have confusion with some details.
There were no complications with the surgery.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
You have dissolvable sutures.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
