Admission Date:  [**2169-1-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-10-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Rapid Afib, Pulmonary Embolus, Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Expired   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 yo F with a past medical history significant for NSCLC s/p resection, in remission for 5 years, and marked COPD, who presents to the ED after experiencing progressive dyspnea over the last several weeks, requiring oxygen therapy around the clock rather than just with exertion.
She was sent for CTA and was found to have a small subsegmental PE and was started on a heparin gtt.
She was given a dose of levofloxacin for ?infectious process given leukocytosis on CBC to 26 and she was initiated on a dilt gtt after two doses of IV dilt did not affect her HR that much.
She also notes swelling in her legs bilaterally and her left arm, as well as a new mass in the left side of her neck which per the patient grew in entirety over the last two weeks.
Of note, she also had knowledge of a breast mass, which had not yet been worked up.
She refuses colon cancer screening.
She is admitted to the MICU for further evaluation of her afib with RVR and dyspnea.
She denies fevers/chills, n/v or nightsweats.
She denies calf tenderness, chest or abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: Status post stage III lung cancer s/p left upper lobe lobectomy, with chemo/rads COPD glaucoma Major depressive disorder Anxiety   Social History: 2 ppd x 40 years, just quit several months ago.
Family History: non-contributory   Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 97.6 BP:146/72 HR: 137 RR: 13 O2sat 99% on 4L NC GEN: cachectic, comfortable, NAD but breathless when talking HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, but right strabismus and left eyelid ptosis, anicteric, MM dry, op without lesions.
NECK: large left sided nontender, nonmobile hard mass just lateral to the thyroid, no jvd, no carotid bruits.
Scattered crackles and +expiratory wheeze with prolonged E:I ratio.
ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: nonpitting 2+ edema in the ext bilaterally, right UE with 1+ nonpitting edema.
Essential tremor present.
Hazy opacity in the right lung base may represent a layering pleural effusion, although pneumonia cannot be excluded; a lateral view is recommended.
Stable emphysematous changes and volume loss on the left related to left upper lobectomy.
Right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism.
No evidence of compression of the SVC.
Moderate-to-severe emphysema with interstitial septal thickening consistent with underlying CHF.
Small left greater than right pleural effusions, with atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
Status post left upper lobectomy with stable left volume loss and post-radiation changes.
Interval development of hypodense mass likely arising from the left lobe of the thyroid.
Multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes as described above.
Soft tissue nodule in the left breast and subcentimeter likely lymph node in the presternal soft tissues.
Given the patient's history of lung cancer, these findings are suspicious for malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo F with a past medical history of NSCLC status-post chemo-radiation and right upper lobectomy admitted with progressive dyspnea in the setting of multiple new masses, new atrial fibrillation with RVR, and subsegmental PE.
# Dyspnea: Etiologies for the patient's dyspnea include atrial fibrillation with RVR with decreased forward flow, progression of COPD, interstitial lung disease secondary to radiation therapy, metastasis and infection.
Although she had a leukocytosis, and possible effusion at the right base, she was afebrile during her inpatient stay.
She does have a very small subsegmental PE, which could have also contributed to dyspnea.
Patient then became suddenly hypoxic with short duration asystole the afternoon of [**2169-1-31**], thought to be secondary to possible mucous plugging.
# Afib with RVR: Unclear if her known small subsegmental PE would actually cause the patient's Afib with RVR.
Other possible causes could be dehydration in the setting of poor PO intake/infection.
Also rapidly growing mass contiguous with the thyroid could be causing a relative thyroiditis, or be producing thyroid hormone itself.
# Pulmonary Embolus: Known small subsegmental PE.
ED confirmed with Oncology that it was okay to start heparin gtt without head imaging as long as initiated without a bolus.
# Neck Mass: Concerning for malignancy.
Patient had a breast mass noted on a mammogram from [**2163**] and has since refused follow up screening.
With poor oral intake, fatigue and weight loss, malignancy was high on the differential.
Associated hoarseness could be secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve compression.
# Anxiety/Depression:  While inpatient was continued on antidepressants and Ativan PRN.
# COPD: This ongoing issue likely contributed to her overall respiratory distress while inpatient.
She was treated with Atrovent and Albuterol was used only minimally secondary to concern for tachycardia.
Patient become increasingly dyspneic during the day of [**2169-1-31**].
At approximately 4pm, physicians were called to the bedside for pulselessness and respiratory arrest thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
Pupils were noted to be unresponsive at that time.
Her family was notified of the acute change and poor prognosis and decided to make her CMO status.
Patient expired on [**2169-1-31**] at 8:15pm secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest.
