Admission Date:  [**2128-3-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-3-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-8-12**]     Sex:  M  Service:  GU Surgery  BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 29-year-old white male first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in late [**Month (only) **] for irritated bladder symptoms which had been developing for several months.
At that time he had been working in the Middle East as a computer consultant, and his thinking was that perhaps he had prostatitis and/or ureteral stone.
Subsequent workup to find the primary source for the cancer included colonoscopy and gastroscopy were negative in addition to body CT, MR of the pelvis indicated involvement of a probable rectal duplicator cyst with the entire posterior bladder and possible rectal wall involvement.
This was completed by [**2128-1-19**], and followed by plan for pelvic exeneration with reconstruction depending on the intraoperative findings.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Surgery for fracture of the right foot in [**2119**], multiple teeth extractions, no other.
In general, patient is a healthy-appearing gentleman of Middle Eastern decent in no acute distress.
Anterior and posterior lymph node chains show no evidence of any tenderness or swelling.
Abdomen is soft and nontender with no evidence of any herniation.
Procedure included pelvic exeneration, appendectomy, radical cystectomy, prostatectomy, creation of colostomy and creation of a diverting urostomy.
Procedures reported to have undergone without complications, however, involvement of the cancer was far more extensive than originally had been thought, and procedure was changed mid course from a potentially curative one to palliative procedure.
On postoperative day five, patient had an appearance of diffuse maculopapular rash across his back.
Based on the distribution of this rash, it appeared to be a contact dermatitis, but nevertheless, a Dermatology consult was requested given the patient's persistent fevers low-grade tachycardia.
On [**2128-3-16**], patient had another spike of fevers to 104.1, and it was decided that his Permacath should indeed be removed.
After consulting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the General Surgery service, this was organized for the following morning and proceeded without complication.
However, fevers did not dissipate with this, and the patient continued to have fevers albeit at lower peaks.
intake was then advanced from sips through clears, ultimate fulls and solids, which he tolerated extremely well.
On postoperative day nine, patient had a final fever peak.
This showed no evidence of any fluid collections, abscesses, or obvious causes for the fever spikes.
