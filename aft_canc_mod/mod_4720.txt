[**2-14**] lovenox injections) Ext: warm, faint DP B, trace edema bilaterally Neuro: a/o, moving all extremities, able to follow commands, no focal deficits.
No pulm edema.
CT([**11-30**]): Probable isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolus in the right lower lobe.
Moderate amount of free air and large amount of ascites in the abdomen.
Large pancreatic mass measuring 4.6 x 4.5 cm, which compresses and nearly occludes the portal vein and the distal splenic vein.
Large left adrenal mass is suspicious for metastatic disease, but the appeareance is nonspecific.
Right upper lobe of the lung consolidation with cavitation.
Small left pleural effusion.
Per Surgical Note/Read: Also with intraabd subphrenic abscess after recent laparotomy.
CXR ([**12-3**]): New small right pleural effusion and unchanged right upper lobe opacity, left basilar opacity and left pleural effusion .
CXR [**2120-12-9**]:  RUL cavitary lesion between 2.5 and 3.0 cm, unchanged in size, however, new four peribronchial consolidations suspicious for progressive infection.
[**2120-12-9**]:  Liver doppler US: Several areas of focal heterogeneity, with echotexture c/w metastatic lesions.
Several hypoechoic focal linear lesions seen throughout liver that likely represent pneumobilia.
Irregular slow flow through portal vein.
[**2120-12-10**]:  Portable CXR showing no significant change.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions present.
Subclavian line in place, no PTX.
A 5.0 x 4.7 cm mass in the pancreatic head, corresponding to the patient's known pancreatic cancer.
There is extension of this into the adjacent duodenum, and extensive hepatic, mesenteric, and left adrenal metastases.
No other foci of air or oral contrast extravasation can be identified.
There is no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
Focal hypodensities within the kidneys which are too small to characterize.
Bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
There are wedge-shaped areas of different attenuation within the liver which may represent focal fatty infiltration or perfusion abnormalities.
Although previous mild edema in the right upper lung has cleared, atelectasis has worsened and now the right middle, right lower and left lower lobes are collapsed.
There is also at least a moderate amount of pleural effusion on both sides of the chest and unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Right upper lobe nodules are noted.
***CULTURES**** [**11-30**] Blood neg X4 [**11-30**] Peritoneal fluid pansens Enterococcus, anaerobic bottle: Bfragilis [**12-2**] Neg VRE Rectal swab [**12-2**] Neg MRSA [**12-6**] Blood neg X4 [**12-6**] Yeast >100K [**12-7**] Perionteal fluid no growth [**12-7**] Urine 10-100K yeast, fungal: yeast not C. albicans, AFB pending [**12-7**] Blood Cx neg X4 [**12-9**] Crypto neg in blood 11/30 Peritoneal fluid: no growth, no fungus, no mycobacteria .
**PATHOLOGY** [**12-11**] peritoneal fluid:  blood and inflammatory cells, cytology negative for malignant cells  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 59-yo Russian speaking man w/ pancreatic CA s/p failed whipple and cisplatin therapy, HTN, DM2 admitted initially to MICU fpr pulmonary embolism and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, s/p IV heparin drip transitioned to lovenox subcutaneously, with SBP being treated with Zosyn.
The pt also demonstrates portal HTN secondary to a  pancreatic mass compressing the portal vein and splenic vein, with evidence of peritoneal mets on abdominal ultrasound.
He is status post 3 paracenteses this admission (first [**2120-11-30**], 2nd [**2120-12-7**], 3rd [**2120-12-11**]) with first growing Enterococcus and Bacteroides fragilis.
The 2nd and 3rd show no growth.
He remained full code until the morning of his death, wherein he desaturated in the setting of volume overload and bilateral pleural effusions.
Infectious Disease:  Thought to have SBP on admission, pt met criteria for sepsis given tachycardia, elevated WBC count, with evidence of SBP on fluid studies.
WBC ct was trending down, pt remained afebrile X 3 days, tolerating po, and was transferred from MICU to medical floor.
Concern for sepsis [**2-14**] to bacterial peritonitis from recent surgical procedure/instrumentation vs. questionable abscess on CT abd according to surgical opinion (again likely [**2-14**] to recent failed surgical attempt at removal off mass, CT showing free air/bubbles/septations/loculated ascites) vs. partial SBO/intermittent SBO causing translocation of enteric organisms across bowel wall.
Other potential sources included the cavitary lesion seen on CXR therefore there was a questions of a possible necrotizing PNA with his b/l pleural effusions (at the time felt to be less likely, most reasonable explanation is old TB infection but cannot r/out reactivation, especially given the new [**Name (NI) 65425**] pt was transfered to isolation room, 3 sputum cx sent, and were much later found to be positive for TB, infection control notified, as were the health care workers exposed).
It was decided, after consultation with Infectious Disease team, to not start ambisome (for fungal necrotizing PNA coverage) because the pt had stable oxygen sats in the setting of no treatment for ?
fungal PNA and we felt he was most likely volume overloaded from repeated fluid boluses on MICU and the medical floor.
He was diuresed for volume overload with IV lasix.
The patient remained on Vanco/Zosyn for broad coverage including coverage of Enterococcus and Bacteroids growing from pleural fluid.
Portal vein compression- The patient had evidence on Abd CT of pancreatic mass nearly occluding portal vein.
It was thought that there was accumulation of ascites secondary to portal HTN/decline liver [**2-14**] portal vein compression.
A Liver Ultrasound completed with dopplers showed slow flow through portal vein, w/ significant ascites.
He underwent his third and final therapeutic/diagnostic tap on [**12-11**] with cytology negative, fluid cx negative, neg for Mycobacteria or fungus as well.
Oliguria, resolved: The patient developed oliguria after transfer to the medical floor from the MICU.
His oliguria was most likely [**2-14**] intravascular volume depletion [**2-14**] prerenal etiology from poor po intake.
Early hepatorenal syndrome vs. cisplatin nephrotoxicity was also considered, and a Renal consult was initiated.
His FENa was <0.05%, consistent with prerenal etiology.
The patient demonstrated low liver function tests, likely secondary to diseased liver without synthetic function at this stage, with his PT increasing slowly over time, Albumin decreasing 1.5->1.2 prior to initiation of albumin.
The pt demonstrated liver mets from his primary pancreatic malignancy.
He had multiple hypoattenuating areas seen on Abd CT, which corresponded to metastatic foci.
Additionally, there are large wedge-shaped areas of difference in attenuation involving portions of the left and right lobes which suggest a perfusion difference or areas of fatty infiltration on Abd CT. .
His oxygen requirement was this likely [**2-14**] to his small pulmonary embolism vs. massive ascites accumulating and pushing up on the diaphragm limiting respiration.
He desatted two times during this admission, most likely secondary to volume overload from repeated fluid boluses, and was given nebs, IV lasix with improvement in respiratory status.
On the morning of his death, the patient desatted to upper 70s, was given nebs, IV lasix, with CXR showing volume overload (and prior RUL cavitary lesion), ABG concerning, thus MICU consult was initiated.
Posthumously, the patient's TB sputum cultures came back positive for Mycobacteria tuberculosis.
His son brought in prior [**Name (NI) 65426**] from 10 years ago, and these demonstrated RUL discrete lesions, likely granulomas, no cavitation.
Pulmonary embolism, small subsegmental PE in RLL.
Pancreatic CA: s/p failed whipple in [**Country 532**] now c/b ?abscess, bacterial peritonitis.
Patient initially seen at [**Hospital1 112**] where dx was made with liver bx, and elevated tumor markers.
The pt was told by the Surgical Service, as well as the primary team that he was a poor surgical candidate.
No role for palliative chemo to decr size of mass compressing the portal vein.
Type II DM: His glucose levels were well controlled with an insulin sliding scale, and fingersticks were checked four times daily.
Constipation, most likely [**2-14**] pain medications.
The pt's pain was controlled on fentanyl and dilaudid, with no pain complaints.
Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis 3.
Metastatic Pancreatic cancer status post failed Whipple procedure, chemotherapy 4.
Oliguria secondary to Prerenal Azotemia 5.
Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Right Upper Lobe Cavitary Lesion 6.
Portal Hypertension secondary to compression of Portal Vein by Tumor 7.
Hypertension 8.
Type II Diabetes Mellitus 9.
Anemia of Chronic Disease 10.
Chronic Pain   Discharge Condition: Expired [**2120-12-12**]..  POST MORTEM the STATE LAB confirmed he was infected with M. Tuberculosis.
