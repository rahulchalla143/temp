[**2153-7-18**]   History of Present Illness: 55- year-old gentleman with a long history of smoking who presented with hemoptysis requiring intervention by bronchoscopic and radiologic therapies.
He was found to have a large right hilar mass extending from the upper lobe into the lower lobe and middle lobe, a bulky mediastinal adenopathy and extension of the tumor up against the esophagus.
On restaging, he was found to have a traumatic response, and therefore, his case was discussed at the thoracic oncology multidisciplinary center for possible salvage surgical resection.
He cleared all of his mediastinal lymph nodes with the chemoradiotherapy and his MRI of the brain and PET scan demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease and traumatic response of the tumor.

Rule out abscess/infectious source status post pneumonectomy.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymphatic node seen in the mediastinum, hilar, or axillary regions.
There are calcifications seen in the coronary arteries.
There is a patchy opacity seen in the left upper lobe anteriorly, that could represent post-radiation change.
There are no other opacities or lung nodules identified in the lung parenchyma.
There is no pericardial effusion seen.
Abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
There are several large masses also seen in the left kidney.
There are abnormally enlarged lymphatic nodes seen in the retroperitoneum, including adjacent to right renal hilum between aorta and IVC, right paraaortic, right retrocrural.
The largest nodes are adjacent to right renal hilum measuring approximately 20 mm in diameter and right retrocrural measuring approximately 15 mm in diameter.
There is no free air and no free fluid in the abdomen.
There is extensive mesenteric peritoneal stranding in the abdomen, that could be due to patient treatment/debilitation, but peritoneal tumor involvement cannot definitively be excluded amd attention on follow-up exam is recommeded.
There is no free fluid and no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymphatic nodes seen.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions in the skeletal structures.
There are deformities, consistent with old fractures seen in the right lateral fifth and sixth ribs, and left fifth and sixth lateral ribs.
Multiple bilateral heterogeneously hypoenhancing renal masses, highly suspicious for metastatic disease to kidneys.
Pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymphatic nodes, suspicious for tumor involvement.
Extensive mesenteric peritoneal stranding, that could be consistent with debilitation, tumor involvement cannot be excluded.
Volume of fluid in the right pneumonectomy space has increased slightly since [**7-22**].
There appears to be an air and fluid collection in the soft tissues of the right chest wall that may have enlarged since [**7-20**], but this area is incompletely imaged on nearly all of these plain radiographs.
Brief Hospital Course: 55M w/ stage 3b Rt lung Ca s/p chemorads now s/p Rt pneumonectomy with omental flap [**2153-7-18**].
Epidural for pain control.
Post-op CXRY significant for left sided pneumothorax, for which a chest tube was placed to suction w/o complication, with resolution of pneumothorax.
Po pain rx changed to dilaludid from percocet.
[**7-24**] CXR: air/fluid collection soft tissues R. chest wall that may have enlarged since [**7-20**] OOB/IS/PT.
Dispo planning for home w/ VNA support [**7-26**]- Monitor fever and symptoms.
PMH: thalassemia minor   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: CAll Dr[**Name (NI) 1816**]/Thoracic Surgery office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**]) for: fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, foul smelling or excessive drainage from incision sites.
Monitor incision sites for reddness, excessive foul smelling drainage as noted above.
Return to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 in 7 days for abdominal staple removal.
