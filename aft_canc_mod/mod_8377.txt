Ms [**Known lastname 71796**] is a 63 yo F with a history of CLL diagnosed in [**2187**], and asthma, who presented with chest pain which started while on the toilet at 11pm the night before [**Date range (1) 41463**].
She characterized her pain as sudden in conset, substernal heaviness [**5-26**], persistently pressing and radiating to her back.
She does not that she occasionally has chest pain w/her asthma but that this was different in that it did not resolve.
At that time she denied n/v or pain radiating to the jaw or arm but did notice some SOB and diaphoresis.
Given the persistent chest pain, the pt presented to ED.
Family had noted that pt had complained of non-specific gastrointestinal complaints over the last week (no fevers) as well as more frequent asthma symptoms this summer w/ some chest discomfort associated w/ these symptoms.
Chest pain was sudden onset, substernal heaviness [**5-26**] that came on at 11pm while at home.
She mentions that she does sometimes get chest pain with her asthma, but this pain was unusual as it didn't go away.
She did have associated diaphoresis, and the pain radiated to her back.
MRI of the chest was perfomred, which was negative for dissection.
However, over the remainder of the night and early morning, she continued to have persistent chest pain and significant EKG changes were noted including T-wave inversions V3-V5 and ST elevations in I and aVR just under 1mm.
On cath, pt was found to have a 60% ulcerated lesion in LAD, 2 drug eluting stents placed.
Pt had nitro drip titrated up and received 160mg of lasix and began actively diuresing at which point chest pain improved.
Bedside echo showed akinesis of nateriorlateral wasll on prelim read.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
No fever source found.
Found to have bilateral pleural effusions, R>L.
On [**2195-12-29**], underwent R thoracentesis with removal of 1.4 liters fluid that was consistent with exudative process.
On [**2196-1-4**], underwent a R thoracoscopy with drainage of pleural effusion and biopsy of 3 pleural nodules.
On [**2196-1-18**], readmitted after developing fever to 103.6F with shortness of breath.
Large L  pleural effusion tapped on [**2196-1-19**] with improvement.
h/o asthma h/o osteopenia .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex; and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and basal inferior free wall.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MR 3D RENDERING W/POST PROCESSING ON INDEPENDENT WS Study Date of [**2198-8-3**] 4:23 AM FINDINGS: MRA OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The thoracic and upper abdominal aorta demonstrates a normal caliber and configuration throught.
There is no evidence of abnormal signal within the aortic lumen throughout.
MRI OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.
No abnormality was detected in the visualized lung fields.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aortic dissection.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2198-8-4**] at 10:48:11 AM Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- anterior and anteroseptal walls, as well as all distal LV segments.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w LAD disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 71796**] is a 63 yo F with a history of CLL diagnosed in [**2187**], and asthma, who presented with chest pain which started at 11pm the night before [**Date range (1) 41463**]; found to have T-wave inversions V3-V5 and ST elevations in I and aVR just under 1mm this AM w/second troponin was 0.21 so was takenn to cath where 2 drug eluting stents were placed in LAD.
# STEMI: Pt had chest pain and found to have elevated tropinin of 0.1 on admission.
Pt initially had improvement of chest pain on nitro, heparin drip and morphine on floor but this AM again had worsening chest pain and new ekg changes were found compared to admission EKG.
Pt went urgently to cath where found to have ~60% stenosis of LAD, 2 drug eluting stents were successfully placed.
Pt's chest pain resolved and clnicial status improved and she was transferred to the floor.
Given risk of thrombus development pt was also started on coumadin w/lovenox bridge.
Home meds were continued Flovent 110mcg inh po bid and Salmeterol 50mcg inh [**Hospital1 **] PRN wheezing as well as albuterol nebs PRN.
Asthma exacerbations over the last month or so may actually have been related to cardiac issues and ischemia.
# Hx of Avascular necrosis bilaterally in ankles: Was on Diclofenac 75mg at home for pain management.
Salmeterol 50 mcg/Dose Disk with Device Sig: One (1) Disk with Device Inhalation Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute systolic Dysfunction ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Asthma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had chest pain and a heart attack and was brought to the cathterization lab.
It was found that your heart was weak  because of the heart attack and you received a diuretic to remove extra fluid.
Your right groin site where the catheterization was done looks very good with only minimal bruising.
Until your heart is stronger, please weigh yourself every morning before breakfast, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Please also watch for swelling in your legs, trouble breathing or trouble lying flat at night.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] can increase the dose if you still have pain at home.
Until your coumadin level is 2.0-3.0, you need to take Lovenox injections to prevent blood clots as well.
Pleaes tell Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any muscle cramps on this medicine.
