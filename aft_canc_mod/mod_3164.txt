Admission Date:  [**2138-12-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2138-12-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-8-9**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 67-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and newly-diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer with left main stem bronchus occlusion by bronchoscopy, is transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further management.
The patient has had several months of chronic cough and increased dyspnea on exertion.
She also has treatment-refractory atrial fibrillation (with difficulty with rate and rhythm control, being evaluated at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital).
A V/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism was done as a workup for atrial fibrillation, and revealed marked decreased ventilation of the left lung.
A follow-up CT of the main stem bronchus with extensive mediastinal extension was discovered.
A bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-13**] revealed a soft tissue endobronchial lesion causing greater than 90% occlusion of the left main stem bronchus as well as extrinsic compression of the carina and extension to the right main stem bronchus.
An initial biopsy revealed results consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
At the time of transfer, the patient has mild dyspnea at rest, significant dyspnea on exertion.
Her atrial fibrillation is rate controlled in the 80s and 90s.
Atrial fibrillation diagnosed two years ago 2.
Non-smell cell lung cancer as above 3.
History of positive PPD, negative acid fast bacilli on bronchoscopy 4.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  Awake, alert, dyspneic, mildly uncomfortable.
Heart:  Regular, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Neck:  Bounding carotid pulse, no jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Bilateral coarse rhonchi and trace expiratory wheezes, decreased breath sounds at left base.
Extremities:  No edema.
A rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and stent placement was performed without complications.
A CT of the chest done prior to this procedure had confirmed the left main stem occlusion extending into the right upper lobe bronchus, and additionally showed a small left pleural effusion, extensive right ground-glass opacities, septal thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread.
The patient was placed on levofloxacin and clindamycin given the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.
After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the Medical service, where she continued to have a substantial oxygen requirement at rest.
It was felt that mucous plugging was partially responsible for this, as her oxygen saturations would improve after she coughed up mucous.
She had two follow-up chest x-rays which were consistent with the prior findings and revealed no interval development of heart failure or pneumonia.
The following day, the patient agreed to undergo ablation of her right atrial flutter focus upon consultation with the Electrophysiology service.
The patient was initially in sinus rhythm following the procedure, but had two instances where she returned to what was felt to be a left atrial flutter rhythm with ventricular rates between 80 and 100.
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin throughout this admission for atrial fibrillation/flutter.
She is to be overlapped with heparin until her INR becomes therapeutic.
She expressed the wish that she be treated at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital by these physicians, so management of her lung cancer was deferred.
The pathology from her bronchoscopy returned consistent with poorly-differentiated large-cell carcinoma.
The culture from her bronchial washings grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had problems with both constipation and nausea this admission.
Her constipation was resolved with a light bowel regimen.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Large-cell lung cancer, status post left bronchial stent, atrial fibrillation/flutter, status post ablation, pneumonia, hypothyroidism  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair to poor  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth three times a day, Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once daily, heparin per protocol, amiodarone 400 mg by mouth three times a day, ipratropium two puffs inhaled four times a day, albuterol two puffs inhaled every six hours as needed, fluticasone 440 mcg inhaled twice a day, salmeterol two puffs inhaled twice a day, clindamycin 300 mg by mouth every six hours for five days, levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 24 hours for five days, levothyroxine 75 mcg by mouth once daily, brimonidine ophthalmic solution, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, Compazine 10 mg by mouth every six hours, Zofran 4 mg intravenously every six hours as needed  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment of her lung cancer.
ADDENDUM Patient was set to leave for [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, howver it was noted on day of discharge she was noted to be veyr short of breath and CXR revealed lobasr collapse c/w stent obstruction.
She was taken to the operating room for repeat rigid bronch that revealed repeat occlusion with tumor.
This was treated with laser treatment but pt continued to have respiratory difficulty.
She was started on a morphine drip to treat her respiratory distress and eventually passed away in her room at the [**Hospital1 18**].
