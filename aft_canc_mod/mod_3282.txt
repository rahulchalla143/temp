Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 74781**] Admission Date: [**2105-10-27**] Discharge Date: [**2106-1-13**] Date of Birth:  [**2105-10-27**] Sex:  F Service:  Neonatology   HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] is a 24-6/7-week gestational age female infant who was admitted to the NICU on [**2105-10-27**], due to concern for prematurity.
Maternal history notable for a 38-year-old, gravida 4, para 3 woman with past obstetrical history notable for uncomplicated pregnancies times 3 at 36-38 weeks gestation.
She was also noted for HSV infection positive in the past, but there were no active lesions at the time of delivery, and she continued on acyclovir suppressive therapy.
She also had anxiety disorder treated with Celexa, and was at the time of pregnancy taking only Ambien.
Prenatal screens were noted as follows:  Blood type A positive, antibody screen negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown.
Uterine tenderness was noted, but there were no antepartum fevers.
Mother received antibiotic therapy on admission for latency and again on the day of delivery for suspected chorioamnionitis.
NEONATAL COURSE:  Infant emerged with inconsistent respiratory effort and bradycardia to 40 beats per minute.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended, no organomegaly, no masses.
Bowel sounds active, anus patent and three-vessel umbilical cord.
Tone decreased in symmetric distribution consistent with gestational age.
IMPRESSION:  A 24-6/7 weeks gestational age infant with respiratory distress, likely secondary to surfactant deficiency, but cannot exclude pneumonia given the intrapartum suspicion of chorioamnionitis.
Responded well to positive pressure ventilation.
RESPIRATORY:  Mild subcostal retractions.
Normal Sl and S2, with a soft systolic murmur of [**1-24**] at the left sternal border with no radiation.
Right-sided buttock hemangioma.
A chest x-ray on admission was     consistent with respiratory distress syndrome, and she     was given 2 doses of surfactant, with subsequent     improvement.
She was transitioned again to CPAP on day of     life 31, where she continued to day of life 50, and on     day of life 50 she was transitioned to nasal cannula     oxygen, and she remained on nasal cannula 13 to 25 mL,     with occasional apnea and bradycardia at the time of     transfer.
Her last apnea and bradycardia episode was     noted on [**2106-1-10**], on day of life 75.
She was initially noted to have     some hemodynamic instability, and concern for an open     persistent ductus arteriosus, and she was treated with     indomethacin treatment with 3 doses.
An echocardiogram     on [**2105-10-29**], on day of life 3, was normal, with     no open duct.
She remained hemodynamically stable until     day of life 16 to 17, when again an acute decompensation     was noted, with mild soft intermittent murmur.
On day of life 16, she was noted to have     increased spells of abdominal distension, and she was     made NPO and serial KUBs were performed, which were     negative for any evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.
She is also     noted to have mild puffiness, and she received one dose     of Lasix on [**1-10**], with some improvement in her     edema.
Her spinal tap was negative on day of     life 3, and she received a 7-day course of antibiotics,     given the concern for maternal chorioamnionitis and     pneumonia on the baby.
She was noted to have increased     spells with abdominal distention on day of life 16, on     [**2105-11-12**], and was started on vancomycin and     gentamicin, with acyclovir added given maternal     HSV colonization and acyclovir treatment.
Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should     be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**], for infants     who meet any of the following four criteria:  (a) born     at less than 32 weeks; (b) born between 32 and 35 weeks     with two of the following: Day care during RSV season,     a smoker in the house, neuromuscular disease,     airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings; (c)     chronic lung disease; or (d) hemodynamically-significant     congential heart disease.
Before     this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's     life, immunization against influenza is recommended for     household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
The     American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial     vaccination of preterm infants at or following discharge     from the hospital, if they are clinically stable and at     least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks of age.
Prematurity at 24-6/7 weeks of gestation.
Respiratory distress syndrome status post surfactant.
