Low inferior and precordial lead T wave amplitude is non-specific and may be within normal limits.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
RUQ ultrasound [**2156-6-13**]: No biliary obstruction, focal liver lesion or portal venous thrombosis.
No focal liver lesions or evidence of cirrhosis on this non-contrast study.
Hepatic hypoattenuation compatible with steatosis or edema.
Normal kidneys, no hydronephrosis.
Left common femoral and superficial femoral partially occlusive DVT and completely occlusive left popliteal venous DVT.
No DVT in the right lower extremity.
PICC placement [**2156-6-17**]: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically-guided double-lumen PICC line placement; the internal length is 35.5 cm with its tip at cavoatrial junction; the line is ready to use.
EGD [**2156-6-25**]: Erythema in the fundus compatible with mild gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: 42 y/o F with history of bipolar disorder, COPD, substance abuse and recent MVC transferred with mental status changes and acute liver and kidney failure in the setting of an overdose.
# Acute liver failure: The etiology of the patient liver failure was likely toxin mediated (given ingestion of >30 grams of Tylenol).
There also may have been a component of ischemic injury.
The patient was treated with NAC and supportive care.
Her transaminases were ALT 11,0000, AST 9000 prior to transfer and trended downward throughout her hospital course, with ALT 43 and AST 15 at the time of discharge.
# Coagulopathy/anticoagulation/DVT: The patient has a left lower extremity DVT.
This was thought to be due to acute liver injury.
The patient was treated with vitamin K, with resolution of her coagulopathy.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient developed acute kidney injury, with creatinine peaking at 9.1 on [**2156-6-17**].
Her urine output eventually increased, and her creatinine fell steadily, reaching 2.2 at the of discharge.
The suspected etiology of the patient's acute kidney injury was acute tubular necrosis due to hypotension and medication toxicity.
# Gastritis/GI bleeding: The patient's nasogastric tube initially had significant coffee-ground emesis.
The patient was not initially scoped and was treated empirically for gastritis with sucralfate and pantoprazole.
Thereafter, the patient's Hct remained stable, although there was a slow drift downward for which the patient underwent EGD and colonoscopy on [**2156-6-25**].
EGD showed mild gastritis.
Colonoscopy showed a polyp as explained below.
# Colon polyp: The patient underwent colonoscopy on [**2156-6-25**] to evaluate for a source of a slow Hct drop.
No biopsies or excisions were done due to the patient's anticoagulation.
# Dyspnea/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient developed dyspnea, which was felt to be multifactorial, related to fluid overload, metabolic acidosis (due to renal failure), and COPD.
# Substance abuse/overdose: Patient denied intentional overdose.
The psychiatry service was consulted and did not feel that the patient was at acute risk for self-harm.
# Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C and IV drug use.
Proventil HFA 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**2-14**] Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute- Acute liver failure, secondary to tylenol toxicity Acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis Acute blood loss anemia Gastritis  Chronic- DVT/PE Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
