HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, who was admitted on [**2118-8-7**] preoperatively for left nephrectomy for a left renal mass found incidentally on arterial study for vascular disease.
No associated symptoms were noted.
No flank or abdominal pain.
No fever or chills.
Patient also has necrotic right fourth finger.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of diaphragmatic hernia.

Subsequent to patient's left nephrectomy, patient was assessed for right arteriovenous steel syndrome, which had resulted in ischemic right hand and a necrotic gangrenous right fourth digit.
