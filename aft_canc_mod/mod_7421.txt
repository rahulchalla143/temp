There is evidence of mild pulmonary venous congestion with atelectatic changes especially at the left base.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour is again seen.
Long segment of abnormal jejunal wall thickening and associated stranding of the mesenteric fat in the left upper quadrant just distal to the jejunojejunostomy.
This is the territory supplied by the vessels which were embolized on [**5-7**], [**2194**] and the appearance of the bowel wall may be secondary to the embolization procedure rather than indicative of the underlying cause of the GI bleeding.
Diffuse anasarca with small amount of free fluid around the left kidney.
Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.
Atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
Chromogranin A       2.8      Ref Range   1.9-15.0 ng/mL    Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo woman with DM2, hx GI ulcers, gastritis, initially admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and GI/jejunal bleed, transferred to the general medical floor when stabilized.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# Jejunal bleed: She was transferred from an OSH ICU for hemodynamic instability related to a GI bleed after having several weeks of melenotic stools.
Prior to transfer, endoscopy had failed to reveal a bleeding source, and a tagged RBC scan demonstrated that it was likely small bowel bleeding source.
Her first IR procedure on [**5-7**] showed a transient bleeding source in the jejunum that had unfortunately vanished prior to intervention.
She was transferred back to the MICU and became hypotensive to SBP=60s with rectal bleeding.
She was intubated for airway support due to clinical instability, and was transferred back to the IR suite.
2 coils were placed for a likely jejunal bleeding source, however the observed bleeding pattern was concerning for a tumor/malignancy.
Conversations with radiology/GI suggested CT enterography to further elucidate the source of her bleed, which showed nonspecific findings s/p embolization procedure.
The source of the GI bleed was thought to be tumor vs. jejuno-jejunal anastamotic ulcer and will be further evaluated as an outpatient with MR [**First Name (Titles) 105453**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Given her GI anatomy, routine iron studies were sent and detected low iron and B12/folate levels (likely secondary to malabsorption), so she was discharged with supplementation.
By the time of discharge, pt had mobilized this extra fluid and had minimal edema.
# Abdominal pain: This was likely related to her GIB as well as baseline chronic pain.
She described it more like a "soreness", much different than her initial left-sided abdominal pain on admission.
Low concern for GI infection given downtrending WBC and normal lactates.
# DM2: Serum glucoses within normal range.
She was continued on an ISS and a diabetic diet.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES .
# Follow-up:  She will follow-up with Gastroenterology for further imaging studies in a few weeks following discharge.
She was instructed to return to the hospital immediately if she has another bleeding or syncopal episode.
Lunesta 3 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
10. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 5 days.
One of the imaging tests revealed that the bleeding site was around one of the connections of bowels created during your gastric bypass surgery.
The Interventional Radiologists stopped the bleeding in this area by "embolizing" 2 blood vessels by placing coils in them.
During the time you had the Foley catheter in, you developed a urinary tract infection that we are treating with antibiotics.
You should be very attentive to any further symptoms you have, including increased abdominal pain, bloody or dark black stools, fevers/nausea/vomiting.
We have made the following changes to your medications: START Bactrim for 3 more days (to treat your urinary tract infection) START folate and cyanocobalamin to help treat your anemia START oxycodone as needed for pain  Followup Instructions: We have scheduled the following appointments for you:  Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Location: [**Hospital3 **] INTERNAL MEDICINE Address: [**Street Address(2) 4472**], [**Apartment Address(1) 4473**], [**Hospital1 **],[**Numeric Identifier 4474**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4475**] Appointment: Tuesday [**2194-5-20**] 3:45pm  Department: DIV.
