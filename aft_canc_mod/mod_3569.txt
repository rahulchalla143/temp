Admission Date:  [**2151-7-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-8-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-1-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Transfer with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Clipping of Right MCA aneurysm Cerebral angiogram   History of Present Illness: 64F was reportedly eating dinner on [**7-15**], c/o HA, then became unresponsive for +/- 5min.
She was sent to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital where a CT showed R MCA hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: Migraine, arthritis, osteoporosis, HTN - no meds last 6mo due to no insurance.
No corneal response bilaterally.
On HD1 she underwent a cerebral angiogram which showed: an approximately 7 x 5 mm aneurysm of the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery with an approximately 2 mm neck and multiple M2 segment branches arising from the aneurysm.
It also showed an approximately 3 mm aneurysm arising from the distal M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery, and a third, approximately 3 mm, aneurysm arising from the proximal M2 segment of the left middle cerebral artery.
On HD2 ([**7-16**]) she underwent a right sided craniotomy for clipping of the right MCA aneurysm without peri-operative complications.
Postoperatively she underwent angiogram #2 and she was found to have an approximately 3 mm moderate focal stenosis of the distal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery just proximal to the clip site.
During the capillary phase of filling, lack of flow was identified within the temporal lobe which was likely due to parenchymal hematoma.
Additionally, there is lack of blood flow seen in the temporoparietal region with extension towards the cortex suggesting temporoparietal infarct.
A CT scan was performed on [**7-16**] and [**7-17**] showing slight interval increase in size of large right frontotemporal intraparenchymal hematoma with slightly more mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, new pneumocephalus underlying the right frontal and temporal lobes, with new preseptal emphysema.
A suspected stroke was seen on the 28th: interval increase in the size of the right frontal- temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with an increase in the mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, and uncal herniation.
Of note, there is a focal area of hypodensity seen in the right internal capsule which was not seen on prior studies.
Neurologically she had a poor exam for the bulk of the stay, with unresponsiveness and only with limited eye opening on repeated noxious stimulation.
Initially she was flaccid with all 4 extremities, later she developed a dense hemisparesis on the L, with internal rotation of the UE on noxious stimulation, and a triple response on the LLE.
She remained in this state thoughout her stay, and on [**8-9**] - close to a month after admission, she was in virtually the same condition, with slight increased arousability, albeit brief.
On [**7-19**] a CT noted increased midlineshift (MLS) and perilesional edema, and there was a question of a rebleed.
She received a PEG/Trach on [**7-23**] due to prolonged need for ventilator support.
Serial CTAs were done on a regular basis to assess for vasospasm on which was demonstrated on [**7-23**] ( mild, non-occlusive ACA's bilateral and L MCA) and she was started on HHH therapy, nimodipine was continued.
Subsequent Angiograms showed mild non-occlusive vasospasm seen involving the anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally, as well as the left middle cerebral artery, verapamil given.
ID treated with Vanco and Ceftaz for 14 days for fevers of unknown origin all cultures were negative.
