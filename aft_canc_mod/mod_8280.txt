CT Head [**2172-3-5**]: There is no hemorrhage, acute large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline structures or mass effect present.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related involutional changes unchanged from prior.
There is a diffuse bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.
There are no fractures present.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 83 year old male with a history of MDS, CVAs, PVD, CHF, colon cancer s/p iliostomy, and recent C. difficile collitis who presents with left leg pain, altered mental status, and findings concerning for RLL pneumonia or other source of infection.
# Overall: Pt with sepsis secondary likely to C. diff colitis and overall decline.
Family requested no central lines or pressors.
# SIRS physiology - Symptoms were initially concerning for infection with tachycardia, elevated lactate, and elevated WBC count though no fever.
The source fo teh infection and sepsis was thought to be his C difficile infection.
The pt was also started on dapto and levoflox for possible HAP .
# Relative Hypotension / dehydration - BP was below patient's baseline.
Given IVF and blood products with some improvement.
# Tachycardia - Possibly due to infection vs. beta-blocker withdrawal vs. dehydration.
# Atrial fibrillation - long-standing.
Coumadin stopped in [**Month (only) 480**] as risk of bleeding felt to outweigh risk of stroke.
# Cough - Possibly due to pneumonia or aspiration.
Likely not CHF exacerbation based on CXR and exam.
# Elevated troponin - likely demand ischemia from tachycardia, continued aspirin 325 mg .
# Leg pain - Likely secondary to significant peripheral edema.
Doubted cellulitis as skin was not warm.
Petechiae may be secondary to low platelet count in recent days.
# Anemia - Chronic, likely secondary to poor production from MDS and possible component of blood loss based on history of bleeding around osteomy site.
No evidence of acute blood loss currently.
# Glaucoma - Cont.
