Admission Date:  [**2128-1-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine-Iodine Containing / Optiray 320  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Admission for MUD allo-SCT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar punctures Central line placement Stem cell transplant  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of high-risk AML who is being admitted today for her matched unrelated allogeneic transplant.
She was seen for follow up on [**2127-12-29**] and as her counts had recovered, she had her left sided PICC removed.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Recurrent C. difficile infection 9.
Hernia repair at time of C-section in [**2114**] with steel mesh placed; patient CANNOT have MRI with abdomen in scanner.
GENERAL: Well-appearing female in no acute distress.
HEENT: PERRL with anicteric sclerae.
NECK: Supple, without adenopathy.
LUNGS: Diffuse expiratory wheezes, no rales or rhonchi HEART: Distant heart sounds, no M/R/G appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft, obese, nontender without HSM or other masses appreciated, although difficult to examine due to body habitus.
No bowel sounds heard but pt reports BM this AM.
EXTREMITIES:  2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally, no C/C/E SKIN: Without rashes or lesions BACK: No pain or CVA tenderness.
PATHOLOGY: [**2128-2-12**] Right Leg Skin Biopsy: Vacuolar interface and mild superficial perivascular dermatitis with epidermal and follicular dyskeratosis.
The finding of follicular dyskeratosis is suggestive of early GVHD.
The concurrent cytospin slides are negative for involvement by an acute leukemia.
[**2128-3-16**] Left Flank Skin Biopsy: The sections show focal/patchy parakeratosis with "squamous cell activation," multifocal dyskeratosis, and mild spongiosis.
There is mild papillary dermal fibrosis with marked endothelial cell activation.
The inflammatory response is paucicellular and comprised of predominantly mononuclear inflammatory cells with rare eosinophils.
Overall, the findings are suggestive of a hypersensitivity type reaction such as to drugs, if compatible with clinical presentation.
Given the histopathological features and the clinical history, graft versus host disease cannot be entirely excluded.
However, the core biopsy has a focus of immature mononuclear cells which are morphologically suspicious for blasts.
Taken together, the findings are highly worrisome for disease relapse.
[**2128-3-22**] Left Ankle Skin Biopsy: The findings of multiple intraepidermal vesicles with foci of reticular degeneration are suggestive of a viral infection, including those in the picornavirus family including [**Location (un) **] virus.
No definitive viral inclusions are observed.
There is minimal dermal inflammation.
While this may be a viral effect, due to the dysmaturation an underlying component of graft versus host disease (with a superimposed viral infection) cannot be excluded.
GVHD may show subepidermal blisters and dysmaturation, however, the degree of intraepidermal vesicles would be unusual for GVHD alone and this finding favors a component of a viral infection.
Special stains (PAS and gram) are negative for fungus and bacteria.
Near-complete resolution of previously noted right lower lobe consolidation with some residual scarring.
Prior cholecystectomy with no focal liver lesion or evidence of biliary obstruction.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Limited study without IV or oral contrast.
Trace left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumonia.
No free air, free fluid, or fluid collection in the intra-abdominal cavity.
Interval development of "[**Doctor First Name 9189**]" mesentery, nonspecific, could be seen in patients with lymphoma, or in the appropriate clinical context, could represent mesenteric panniculitis.
[**2128-2-10**] V/Q Scan: Matched perfusion and ventilation defect in the medial left lung base.
Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
No evidence of infection on this CT scan.
[**2128-2-17**] CT Head w/o con: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
[**2128-2-18**] MRI Head w/o con: Multiple scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity involving predominantly cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the bilateral hemispheres, some of which demonstrate slow diffusion without significant mass effect or hemorrhage.
These may represent changes related to encephalitis, encephalopathy, inflammatory/infectious etiology, subacute infarcts, less likely neoplastic involvement or related to medications used.
Evaluation of these findings is somewhat limited without intravenous contrast.
Thickened bladder wall, though it is not fully distended and therefore not fully evaluated, with bilateral mild pelvocaliectasis which may be mildly increased on the right from the previous ultrasound of [**2128-2-20**].
There are no stones.
Hospital course was complicated by graft failure + GVHD, HHV-6 encephalitis, thrombotic microangiopathy, and numerous electrolyte abnormalities accompanied by acute kidney injury, as well as intense allodynia and pruritus.
She was given a total of 17 liters of fluid overnight as well as 4 units of PRBCs and maximum BP support with 4 pressors maxed out (neo, levo, vasopressin, and epinephrine) and despite these measures her pressures remained in the 60s-80s systolic.
She had increased work of breathing and began to desaturate on non-rebreather.
# AML and MUD allo-SCT graft issues: Patient received an MUD allo SCT on [**2128-1-22**].
She also received weekly checks for CMV VL, B-glucan, galactomannan, and HHV-6 VL after her acute infection.
Around day +68 she was noted to have increased peripheral blasts.
# HHV-6 viral encephalitis: Patient was noted to have altered mental status, and HHV-6 PCR returned at >1,000,000 on [**2-16**] with CSF also positive for HHV-6.
She remained clinically asymptomatic so the foscarnet was not restarted.
# Febrile neutropenia: Hospital course was complicated by febrile neutropenia with temperatures up to 105F.
Due to concern for nephrotoxicity and after being afebrile for a prolonged period of time, her antibiotics were gradually discontinued, with the exception fungal prophylaxis.
She was then noted to  have a VRE UTI and daptomycin was started.
She was afebrile for many days until she spiked once again with new abdominal pain .
# Rash: Patient developed a diffuse erythematous rash after starting daptomycin, which did not resolve following discontinuation.
A biopsy of her left leg on [**2-12**] was suggestive of GVHD so she was started on systemic and topical steroids.
She later developed vesicles on her palms and soles and a biopsy on [**3-22**] was suggestive of GVHD with a superimposed viral infection, likely [**Location (un) **] virus.
However, after DLI her rash acutely worsened and became quite weepy with several areas of skin breakdown and the sensation of an acute burn, suggesting a GVH picture.
Dermatology and neurology were consulted, but did not feel that her symptoms were related to the HHV-6 or GVHD.
# Thrombotic microangiopathy and frank hemolysis: Around the time that the HHV-6 infection was detected, she began to show evidence of hemolytic anemia with low haptoglobin, high direct bili, high LDH, and [**Last Name (un) **].
Considering the anemia, thrombocytopenia, [**Last Name (un) **], and mental status changes, it was felt that TTP-HUS had developed, likely secondary to the HHV-6 infection.
# Hypernatremia/hyperglycemia: Secondary to partial DI and free water deficit.
An osmotic diuresis due to elevated glucose may have also been contributing to this hypernatremia, so aggressive control of glucose was made a priority with the addition of Lantus and an ISS.
# Hypertension: With only metoprolol on board, she developed HTN in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
# Diarrhea: Patient had ongoing diarrhea throughout this admission, though repeated stool cultures including C.diff were all negative.
The diarrhea eventually resolved and the po vancomycin was discontinued.
# Nutrition: Patient struggled with nausea throughout the entire admission and initally had poor PO intake, so she was started on TPN on [**2128-2-1**] which was eventually stopped when she was able to tolerate PO intake.
