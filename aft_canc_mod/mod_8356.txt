The patient developed cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B.
The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in [**2183-7-21**] and underwent a radiofrequency ablation of the nodule in [**2183-9-20**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Otherwise, past medical history is only significant for a gastric polyp and low back pain.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for right inguinal hernia repair and umbilical hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to COMPAZINE (leading to locked jaw).
Mildly icteric sclerae.
No murmurs were heard.
There was an umbilical scar without hernia.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram preoperatively revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 without any ST segment changes.
A chest x-ray was clear without any acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient underwent an ultrasound of the liver on postoperative day one which showed normal arterial and venous phase as well as patent ......... portal vein.
The patient was found to have an elevated total bilirubin on postoperative day three; jumping from 0.8 on postoperative day two.
Because of the elevations in the total bilirubin which peaked at 40.2, on postoperative day four the patient underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the liver which did not show any evidence of acute cellular rejection.
The patient was found to have reperfusion injury.
The patient also underwent a repeat Duplex ultrasound of the liver which showed a patent arterial and venous supply to the liver with normal resistive indices.
The patient also underwent tube cholangiogram which showed good common bile duct anastomosis without any biliary leak and without any evidence of obstruction or stricture.
By then, the patient's total bilirubin was trending downward, and by postoperative day nine the patient's total bilirubin came down to 3.4 with a decrease in the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels as well.
Prior to discharge, the patient experienced intermittent nausea and vomiting.
The patient was changed from 1000 mg twice per day to 500 mg four times per day of CellCept which the patient tolerated better with only mild nausea and no vomiting.
End-stage renal disease due to hepatitis C. 2.
The patient was to have his laboratories drawn every Monday and Thursday morning for complete blood count, Chemistry-10, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and cyclosporin level drawn exactly two hours after a.m. Neoral dose.
