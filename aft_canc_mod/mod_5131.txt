Admission Date:  [**2158-3-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-6-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-3-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Heparin Agents / Motrin / Phenobarbital / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: (1) Planned admission for autologous SCT on BEAM regimen (2) left intraparenchyma bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Autologous stem cell transplant  Left craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma x 2  History of Present Illness: This is a 65-year-old woman with Stage III high grade B cell lymphoma admitted for autologous stem cell transplant on the BEAM regimen.
Her pain is a [**2161-4-13**] and she was able to walk after this occurred.
Additionally, she reports that is having a recurrence of diarrhea.
She was doing fine without recurrence of diarrhea until approximately 2-3 days ago when she started having multiple episodes of diarrhea every day, worse in the morning after eating breakfast and has [**5-14**] episodes of diarrhea in a short period of time.
On review of systems, she complains of a dry cough for over week but reports this has improved steadily and only has this intermittently.
She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or shortness of breath.
The patient is currently off her anticoagulation (has a history of HIT) and admits to persistent bilateral lower extremity edema (L>R) which has improved slightly which has remained.
She is off anticoagulation given her thrombocytopenia and h/o HIT.
She continues to have significant neuropathies in her feet with numbness, and loss of proprioception of the feet while ambulating.
- Bilateral pulmonary emboli and left leg DVT.
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - Hypertension - Osteoarthritis - s/p Tonsillectomy - s/p Cholecystectomy - s/p Removal of a benign tumor from her right lower abdomen - s/p suprarenal IVC filter [**2158-2-10**]: Large thrombus (chronic) involving the infrarenal IVC as well as a thrombosis of the left common iliac vein and left femoral veins.
Past Oncologic History: (Per OMR note, [**2158-3-18**]) Onc history begins in [**10/2157**] when patient began to experience two week history of diarrhea, abdominal distention and discomfort.
Then on [**2157-10-18**], the patient presented to the [**Hospital3 **] emergency room with acute episode of shortness of breath.
She was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CTA and was started on heparin.
Additional symptoms at that time included night sweats and fever but no weight loss.
Evaluation during Mrs.[**Known lastname 69951**] initial admission with CTA showed bilateral proximal large PE's.
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a moderate-size right pleural effusion with enlarged axillary lymph nodes measuring 2.5 cm on the left and 1.5 cm on the right.
There was noted a pericardial mass measuring 2.2 cm x 2.5 cm.
There was also abnormal enhancement and thickening of the omentum of the lower abdomen and pelvis as well as large right inguinal lymph nodes measuring 2.6 cm.
Note was also made of filling defect within the left common femoral artery consistent with DVT of the left lower extremity.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initiated on heparin therapy and underwent a left inguinal lymph node biopsy on [**2157-10-25**], which revealed high-grade large B-cell lymphoma with immunohistochemistry study strongly positive for BCL-2 and CD20.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2157-10-25**] revealed no evidence for lymphoma.
She underwent a PET scan on [**2157-10-28**], which revealed intense uptake within bilateral axillary node, presternal node, pericardial node, bulky mesenteric mass consistent with matted lymphadenopathy along with some right iliac and bilateral inguinal nodes and some uptake within the subcutaneous region around the umbilicus.
She was able to keep on schedule despite admissions for fever and neutropenia.
Her sixth cycle was delayed by one week due to an admission for fever and neutropenia with completion of chemotherapy on [**2158-1-17**].
In [**11-14**], patient was found to have worsening swelling in her left lower extremity and was found to have heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Additionally, she also was found to have staph infection of her finger requiring surgical drainage and antibiotics and a subsequent staph infection of her right toe.
She had a POC placed for venous access but this became clotted and did not function.
This showed significant improvement within the chest with essentially complete resolution of FDG avid lymphadenopathy within the axilla and pericardial region.
There was also significant improvement noted in the size of mesenteric mass with marked decrease degree of FDG uptake, although still with mild-to-moderate uptake noted.
A PET scan at the completion of treatment showed no FDG-avid disease.
Because Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented with stage III high-grade lymphoma with significant adenopathy and aggressive disease, it was felt that autologous stem cell transplant offered the best potential for cure.
This, however, presented with some difficulties due to her history of HIT and the fact that there would be periods of thrombocytopenia during her treatment course.
At the time of the IVC filter placement, there was demonstration of a large thrombus which was chronic in nature involving the infrarenal IVC as well as a thrombosis of the left common iliac vein and left femoral veins.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for high dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization on [**2158-2-16**].
She tolerated this relatively well with some diarrhea, but developed profound pancytopenia as is expected requiring platelet and red cell transfusions.
Her fondaparinux has been on hold since [**2158-2-24**] due to low platelets.
She also required an admission on [**2158-3-1**] due to fever and chills.
No infection source was found and the fevers were felt related to her Neupogen and recovering counts.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old woman with Stage III high grade B cell lymphoma admitted for autologous stem cell transplant on the BEAM regimen.
(1) Stage III High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient was admitted for autologous stem cell transplant with BEAM therapy.
Her course was complicated by recurrent diarrhea for which she was found to be positive C dificle.
In this setting, she was started on PO Vancomycin for possible treatment failure C dificile.
Additionally, while he patient was neutropenic, she began to experience increased abdominal pain described as crampy in nature and worse in the RLQ for which Cefepime/Flagyl were added for possible infectious process.
Her abdominal pain seemed to improve after starting antibiotics, and days prior to her discharge, was significantly improved.
(2) Abdominal Pain: As the patient's counts trended down, she complained of right sided abdominal pain and was started on Cefepime/Flagyl for concern of an infectious process in the setting of treatment failure C dif.
An xray was performed which showed no obstruction or free air, only occasional air fluid levels.
The patients abdominal pain improved significantly after having bowel movements.
The abdominal pain recurred after her fourth evacuation of her SDH.
Abd/pelvic CT was negative for a concerning abdominal process.
(3) C. Difficile Diarrhea: The patient has a history of C. difficile diarrhea for which she completed a two week course of PO Flagyl about 10 days prior to admission.
She had a recurrence of loose stools and was found to be positive again for C. difficile during this hospitalization.
During her autologous transplant, she experienced worsening of her diarrhea for which IV Flagyl was added, in addition to PO vancomycin - with which she was not fully compliant as she did not like the taste.
The diarrhea resolved over a 5 day period with antibiotics and assistance of loperamide.
(4) h/o Pulmonary Embolus and HIT: The patient was diagnosed with heparin induced thrombocytopenia during her inital workup and presentation at [**Hospital6 2561**].
On admission, her fondaparinox had been stopped because of low platelets.
Her platelets had a small drop after the initiation of famotidine treatment and this medication was discontinued the day prior to her discharge.
(5) Lower Extremity Edema, L>R: The patient has a history of chronic lower extremity edema thought to be secondary to the lower extremity DVTs found when she was initially diagnosed with lymphoma.
She has a left common femoral DVT which explains her left > right lower extremity edema.
The patient's lower extremity edema was stable.
(6) Back Pain: History and physical exam were most consistent with a muscle strain.
A xray of the lumbar spine was negative for compression fractures or other obvious etiology to explain her disease.
An MRI did show slight disc protrusions at L2/3 and L3/4 but no evidence of neural impingement.
Patient reports difficulty with proprioception and occasional falls at home when ambulating.
(8) Left ICH/SDH: Patient fell and hit her head just prior to d/c home (with plt count of 18), suffered left parieto-occipital IPH and SDH.
Patient was confused and mildly disoriented post-fall (on [**4-12**]), but on [**4-13**] on way to CT scanner pt acutely decompensated and became non-responsive/only withdrawing to pain, and her CT showed increased size of bleed.
The follow-up CT at this time showed decreased mass effect and midline shift.
On the morning of [**2158-4-18**], patient developed acute change in mental status, with progression from disorientation to unresponsiveness in the setting of hypertension fever, and hypoxia;   Repeat head CT x 2 was done on [**2158-4-18**], and showed no acute changes post her neurosurgery.
An LP was done which showed [**5-17**] WBC w/ lymphocyte predominance.
She had an EEG done on [**2158-4-18**] which showed spike waves in left frontal and temporal region c/w her prior bleeding.
MRI on [**2158-4-19**] showed left hemisphere swelling, but no acute ischemic changes.
She had worsening RLE and RUE hemiparesis and was much less verbally interactive.
She was transferred back to BMT service on [**4-29**] but a repeat CT scan on [**2158-5-1**] showed increasing size of the SDH and shift.
She was kept on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Her course was further complicated by ongoing agitation and fever of unkown origin.
She have fever spikes daily to 101-103, with no source of infection identified.
Thought to be possible aspiration event, but her respiratory status was not compromised and she continued to spike fevers despite treatment.
Agitation: she would have parocysms of extreme dysphoria, with loud moaning and crying.
She was uptitrated on Keppra and downtitrated on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxys.
this also would help ally psychiatry's fears of keppra causing some of her aggitation.
All narcotics were held to prevent further mental status depression.
(9) Transaminitis: The patient developed transaminitis in the setting of abdominal pain, delirium, and expressive aphasia.
It was difficult to ascertain the cause of this transaminitis and if it was related to her abdominal pain.
Her fluconazole and acyclovir were held as these were possible sources of her transaminitis.
(10) Thrush: The patient developed thrush and was started on fluconazole.
(13) Respiratory Distress: Desatted to mid-80s on room air and became tachypneic to 40/min.
Chest Xray was consistent with volume overload and basilar atelectasis vs aspiration.
Repeat CXR with new infiltrate.
(14) Zoster: Rash on back that was confirmed by DFA to be VZV.
Medications on Admission: - B-Complex with Vitamin C 1 tab PO daily - Atenolol 100 mg PO daily - Oxycodone 5 mg PO Q6H PRN pain - Potassium chloride 20mEq PO daily - Tylenol PRN back pain - Ativan PRN insomnia  Discharge Medications: 1.
