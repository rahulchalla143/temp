Infectious Disease:  The patient was afebrile throughout the period covered by this dictation, and cefepime and acyclovir were discontinued on [**2154-12-30**].
Per Infectious Disease recommendations, repeat MRI of the spleen was obtained, which showed no change in size or number of splenic lesions.
As these lesions are thought to be candidal in origin, the Infectious Disease team recommended an additional six weeks of AmBisome therapy starting from [**2154-12-30**], when ANC counts reached greater than 1000.
For fever workup due to temperature spike on [**2154-12-26**], viral cultures from nasal washings returned negative for RSV and influenza virus.
It was not known what caused the fever spike at that time.
Neurology:  Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2154-11-17**] for intracranial hemorrhage to the right frontal and mid-brain area.
The patient's neurologic findings and mental status cleared considerably from the time of admission, however, at the time of discharge, she was still with right-sided third cranial nerve palsy as well as some gait imbalance on the left.
As the MRI indicated an inflammation of the third cranial nerve on the right, which was also seen on previous MRI, a lumbar puncture was performed [**2155-1-1**] to rule out leukemic infiltration into the CNS.
If leukemic involvement of CNS is discovered, this will alter future chemotherapy regimens, and possibly include intrathecal chemotherapy.
Preliminary reports from the lumbar puncture indicate no infectious process.
They recommended a rehabilitation facility for continued high-level balance activities and increased safety awareness and increase in function.
Given the fluctuation of her mental status and judgment, it was still felt that her medical decision-making was impaired, and reconsideration of change in guardianship status was not felt necessary at this time.
As her mental status continues to improve and her thoughts and judgment are more consistent, a re-evaluation of whether the patient is competent to make medical decisions for herself should be addressed.
At this time, her medical decisions are entirely responsible by her sister, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1743**] [**Known lastname **], who is her court-appointed guardian and can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 45102**].

Right cranial nerve III palsy 5.
Oral thrush 9.
