Admission Date:  [**2144-6-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-6-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-6-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3021**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
History of Present Illness: Pt is a 43yo Spanish-speaking woman with poorly differentiated stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma, who presents with abdominal distension as well as recurrent epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, after a recent admission for similar symptoms.
She was recently admitted with epigastric abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting, which were thought to be related to her malignancy and possible intermittent SBO.
Since discharge, however, she has continued to feel poorly, particularly with epigastric abdominal swelling and pain.
She describes her epigastric abdominal pain this time as different from that on her prior hospitalization.
Her pain is severe across the upper abdomen including both upper quadrants, with radiation to the upper back bilaterally.
Today her pain became more severe, with associated nausea and non-bloody bilious emesis, as well as progressive weakness and dehydration.
She also developed headache and diarrhea, but denies any hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.
In the ED, she was afebrile with stable VS. Labs appeared hemoconcentrated with WBC 13.2 (91.8% PMNs), Hgb 11.3 / Hct 36.3, Plt 336, as well as elevated Alk Phos 130 and Lipase 478.
CT prelim: "Diffuse mild enteritis and moderate ascites.
This is all likely secondary to her advanced metastatic gastric cancer.
No stones or hydronephrosis.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Had several years of abdominal complaints and was under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33559**] at [**Hospital3 9947**].
It appears that the first was nondiagnostic and on the second [**2143-7-30**], biopsy of a large, fungating, ulcerated mass in the gastric body which precluded advancing the endoscope.
On [**7-22**], she underwent a CT which showed an infiltrating tumor of the gastric body and antrum with peritoneal, omental and mesenteric metastatic disease; note was made of soft tissue near the terminal ileum.
The pathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring features staining positive with cytokeratin AE1/3; there was extensive granulation and ulceration.
She required admission from [**2143-8-1**] to [**2143-8-8**] for N/V, epigastric pain radiating to the back and down flanks and inability to tolerate PO; a port-o-cath was placed.
A total weight loss of 30 lbs compared to [**2142**] was noted.
She established care at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1313**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Hematology and Medical Oncology of [**Hospital1 2177**] and was started on FOLFOX on [**2143-8-8**] for metastatic gastric cancer to the peritoneum.
Cycle 2 of FOLFOX was complicated by coffee ground emesis for which she was admitted from [**2143-8-28**] to [**2143-9-2**] during which time she received supportive care.
[**2143-10-1**] a repeat CT scan showed persistent gastric wall thickening with peritoneal carcinomatosis and a left adnexal complex lesion, mostly cystic which was enlarged from prior study.
Her weight improved and there was no further bleeding.
A CT [**2144-2-5**] showed stable stomach wall thickening, omental thickening and nodularity, interval growth of a right adnexal lesion, predominantly cystic and a left adnexal lesion decreased in size.

IMAGING: [**2144-6-7**] KUB: IMPRESSION:  There is slight prominence of loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant with multiple air-fluid levels noted elsewhere.
As a result, these findings may be representative of obstruction versus ileus.
No obstruction.
Soft tissue lesion within the antrum of the stomach, possibly extending into the duodenal bulb, is consistent with known gastric adenocarcinoma.
Moderate amount of intermediate dense fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
Slightly hyperenhancement of the peritoneum is concerning for an underlying infectious/inflammatory process.
Soft tissue enhancing lesion within the right adnexa is concerning for metastatic disease.
Redemonstration of gastric mass compatible with adenocarcinoma and moderate ascites with peritoneal enhancement, likely reflecting peritoneal carcinomatosis.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Bilateral adnexal lesions, with a solid mass in the right adnexa concerning for metastasis, and a complex left ovarian cystic lesion.
Possible area of abnormal enhancement within the region of the terminal ileum, which is stable from the prior study, and may represent a neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious process.
Findings may be better assessed with a dedicated CT enterography exam with oral contrast.
There are low inspiratory volumes.
Minimal patchy opacity at the right base is noted.
Lungs are otherwise grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.

Likely due to metastatic gastric cancer +/- ascites/SBP.
No obstruction seen on CT.  Paracentesis [**2144-6-12**] took off 500cc; ascites with many WBCs (though mostly lymphocytes and macrophages).
If her symptoms recur, plan for G-J tube for venting and nutrition, respectively.
Continued ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis given WBCs in ascites and abdominal pain; changed to cefpodoxime at hospital discharge.

Medications on Admission: - omeprazole 40 mg PO once a day - alum-mag hydroxide-simeth 200-200-20mg/5mL, 15-30MLs PO QID PRN abdominal pain - simethicone 80 mg PO QID PRN abdominal pain - Xeloda (capecitabine) 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: 1. omeprazole 40 mg PO BID.
Metastatic gastric (stomach) cancer.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (infection of the fluid in the abdomen).
CT of the abdomen did not show a blockage, but did show extensive metastatic stomach cancer, which is likely the cause of your symptoms.
Paracentesis (drainage of fluid from the abdominal cavity) was done and although no bacteria grew in culture, the white blood cells in the fluid could reflect an infection.
If the nausea and vomiting recur, you may need a feeding tube placed.
