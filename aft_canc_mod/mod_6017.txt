The location and the appearance of the mass are suggestive of a glioma or less likely a lymphoma.
Additionally, there is enhancement seen in the left frontal sulci as well as in the basal cisterns and internal auditory canals indicative of leptomeningeal spread of the neoplasm.
There is mass effect on the anterior horns of both lateral ventricles.
A prominent flow voids are identified adjacent to the inferior aspect of the neoplasm indicative of hypertrophic blood vessels or draining veins.
IMPRESSION: Large bifrontal neoplasm extending through the corpus callosum likely a primary neoplasm such as glioma or lymphoma.
Leptomeningeal extension of the neoplasm is identified through the basal ganglia and internal auditory canal.
CT Torso [**2152-6-24**]: FINDINGS: CHEST: There are no pathologically enlarged thoracic lymph nodes.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is mild dilatation of the esophagus.
Lung windows demonstrate no nodules or masses.
The central airways are patent, without endobronchial lesions.
There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
There is an umbilical hernia containing fat and small bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no free fluid.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
Bone windows demonstrate a lytic lesion in the posterior left iliac bone with a thick sclerotic border.
No other focal lesions are identified.
There are minimal degenerative changes of the spine.
No evidence of mass in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Umbilical hernia containing fat and small bowel.
Nonaggressive-appearing lesion within the posterior left iliac bone, unlikely to represent a metastatic lesion.
Mild esophageal dilatation.
There is persistent mass effect on the bilateral frontal horns.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or evidence of uncal or transtentorial herniation.
There is no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved without evidence of infarction.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: Extensive hypodense lesion in the bilateral frontal lobes with slight interval increase in the diameter of the lateral ventricles.
Brain, -16, stereotactic biopsy (E): White matter with reactive gliosis and rare atypical cells.
Brain, -20, stereotactic biopsy (F): White matter with reactive gliosis and rare atypical cells.
Note:  The tumor displays hypercellularity, vascular proliferation, necrosis, and mitotic figures.
Smear diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] is: "White matter with reactive gliosis and rare atypical cells".
Smear diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] is: "Reactive gliosis with scattered atypical cells".
Part 11 is additionally labeled "-20", and is entirely submitted in cassette F.  CT Head without contrast post-op [**2152-6-26**]: FINDINGS: There is a new left frontal burr hole for stereotactic biopsy.
There is a small focus of new hemorrhage along the biopsy path in the left frontal lobe (2:18).
Extensive vasogenic edema is again seen in association with the known mass involving both frontal lobes and the genu of corpus callosum, with unchanged mass effect on the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.
Mild rightward shift of the anterior falx is stable.
There is a large mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus and a possible polyp in the left nasal cavity, as before.
IMPRESSION: Small amount of blood along the left frontal biopsy path.
No change in mass effect from the bifrontal mass.
Again demonstrated is a heterogeneous mass located within bilateral frontal lobes, and crossing the corpus callosum, compatible with biopsy proven glioblastoma multiforme.
This mass measures grossly 6.5 cm x 4.6 cm, with central areas of susceptibility, particularly within the left frontal region, likely reflecting intratumoral hemorrhagic products from recent biopsy.
There is associated significant vasogenic edema of bilateral frontal lobes.
Significant mass effect on the adjacent frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and a rightward shift of normally midline structures by approximately 7 mm are not significantly changed.
Abnormal enhancement is also evident within the basal cisterns and in the region of the thalamus/tectal junction.
These findings suggest subarachnoid spread of tumor with a differential diagnosis of infection, if clinically appropriate.
There is no infarct, without evidence of diffusion-weighted abnormality.
Mucus-retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus with mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses is noted.
Large butterfly glioma in the frontal lobes, compatible with known glioblastoma multiforme, with associated significant mass effect and vasogenic edema, unchanged.
Post-biopsy changes, including a small amount of intratumoral hemorrhage.
Abnormal enhancement of the left lateral ventricular ependymal surface, in the basal cisterns, and in the thalamo-tectal junction.
However, a concomitant infection could have a similar appearance and needs clinical correlation .
An MRI of the spine is recommended to assess for leptomeningeal involvement of the spinal axis.
A dedicated MRA or CTA is recommended to assess for vascular patency.
CT head ([**2152-6-30**])  FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a large bifrontal mass, compatible with biopsy-proven GBM, with significant mass effect on the adjacent frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and rightward shift of midline by approximately 7 mm.
Surrounding low attenuation in bilateral frontal lobes is compatible with vasogenic edema, with a track of high density in the left frontal lobe compatible with post-biopsy hemorrhagic tract.
The size of the ventricular system is stable, without evidence of new hydrocephalus.
There are no other foci of intracranial hemorrhage.
No major vascular territorial infarction is identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Osseous structures reveal biopsy burr hole in the left frontal bone.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in large bifrontal mass, compatible with biopsy-proven GBM, and associated significant mass effect on the adjacent lateral ventricles and rightward shift of midline.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks after he was found to have a very large bifrontal brain mass.
He had been given 1 dose of steroids at the outside hospital but they were not continued here in anticipation of a steriotactic brain biopsy.
The patient had a CT torso that did not show evidence of metastatic disease.
A stat head CT showed increased edema in the frontal region.
On [**2152-6-26**], the patient had a steriotactic brain biopsy.
The pathology revealed that the mass was a glioblastoma WHO Grade IV.
Post-operatively the CT scan showed a new small hemorrhage at the surgical bed.
In the afternoon of [**2152-6-29**] (after radiation planning appointment), he was found to have significant aniscoria (right greater than left) and sixth cranial nerve palsy.
Given his marked neurological decline, palliative care was again urgently consulted to assist with appropriate planning.
He had poor attention and poor comprehension of his disease.

You were found to have a brain tumor.
You are being discharged on steroids because of the swelling in your brain.
You are also being discharged on [**Last Name (LF) 13401**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] anti-seizure medication, as you may be more prone to seizures now that you have a brain tumor.
You are being discharged on Bactrim to prevent infection now that you are getting radiation and chemotherapy.
YOU ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR FALLING WITH YOUR BRAIN TUMOR AND CONFUSION.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You are being sent home on steroid medications, so make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
