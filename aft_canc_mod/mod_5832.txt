Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Stable right chest tube with no pneumothorax and clear lungs.
Sludge in the gallbladder, but otherwise no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o F with hx of HTN, COPD, and new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer who presents with delerium, ARF and hypotension.
# Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension, thought to be either secondary to sepsis versus poor PO intake in the weeks prior to admission.
The patient was initally placed on Levophed and broad spectrum antibiotics, and she remained stable with these interventions.
However, throughout this admission, she became progressively more hypotensive despite Levophed, fluid boluses, and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Given the patient's prior wishes of minimally invasive procedures, and her poor prognosis, further pressors were not added, and the patient expired on [**2127-7-18**].
# ARF: The patient has a history of CKD stage IV with baseline creatinine around 1.8.
Renal was consulted, and the patient was found to have muddy brown casts in her U/A, consistent with ATN.
She was placed back on Levophed in an attempt to increase UOP; however, this had minimal effect.
Psychiatry was consulted, and her mental status gradually improved over this admission.
# Ovarian Cancer: She was recently diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer.
She was seen by heme/onc on this admission, who deferred chemotherapy in the setting of infection and altered mental status.
