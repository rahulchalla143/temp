According to her son, the patient was watching TV this evening around midnight when he noted a left facial droop, robotic speech and left sided weakness.
However, when he attempted to get her up at around 4AM, he noted that she continued to have difficulty ambulating and her speech was again slurred.
She denies any recent illness and infact, she was out walking briskly the day prior.
She has no headache, neck pain, changes in vision, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
She denied difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
She reports no focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the patient denied recent fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain/palpitations, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Past Medical History: - Squamous Cell Cancer (Right neck, 4.5cm, never further evaluated per patient preference, diagnosed [**2107**]) - Invasive ductal carcinoma in R breast, diagnosed in [**2107**], work up as above - Incidental RML nodule 5cm in size, no further work up - HL - Asthma   Social History: Lives with Son, used to smoke.
Head and Neck: no cranial abnormailites, no scleral icterus noted, mmm, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally Cardiac: distant, regular rate and rhythm, No murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
There was no evidence of apraxia, there was slight neglect of the left side of the cookie theft image.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
III, IV, VI: EOMI with 6 beats nystagmus on right gaze.
Left pronator drift.
A/Ox3, MOYB intact, Language intact, impaired calculation, no apraxia or neglect.
Reflexes: [**Hospital1 **]/Tri/Patella L > R, but no spread.
The findings suggest an acute embolus within the distal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, associated with a small infarct within the anterior right frontal lobe and a much broader area of tissue at risk encompassing just under 50% of the right middle cerebral artery territory.
Multifocal atherosclerosis as detailed.
3.4 cm right submandibular space mass, which may represent a pathologic lymph node.
There is associated asymmetric thickening of the tongue base on the right and the findings are concerning for an oropharyngeal tumor such as squamous cell carcinoma with an adjacent metastatic node.
Biapical scarring with what may represent nodular consolidation within the visualized lung apices, which should be correlated with a dedicated chest CT.  Perfusion findings were appropriately identified by the on-call radiology resident and communicated to the clinical service at the time of study, and the additional findings of the right neck mass were discussed with the managing neurology service, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 656**], at the time of dictation at 10:30 hours on [**2112-5-16**].
Acute/subacute right middle cerebral artery distribution infarct involving portions of the corona radiata, likely secondary to occlusion of small penetrating arteries.
Equivocal area of subacute infarct within the left centrum semiovale.
The acute changes are superimposed upon sequelae of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old hemorrhagic lacunar infarct within the right lentiform nucleus.
ECHO: [**5-17**]  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of embolism identified.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality  CXR: [**5-18**]: No focal consolidation (preliminary)  CT head [**5-18**]: Evolution of known infarction, no evidence of hemorrhage (preliminary)   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo right handed woman with a history untreated squamous cell malignancy in the right neck as well as invasive R breast ductal carcinoma since [**2107**], RML lung nodule (none of these were evaluated per patient preference), who presented with sudden onset of left sided facial droop as well as dysarthia and unsteadiness when standing.
On initial examination, she was noted to have minimal left neglect and left facial droop and mild UMN L hemiparesis with extiction to DSS on LEFT.
CT Perfusion showed occlusion of the M2 but her symptoms were already improving (speech and attention were nearly normal at evaluation).
MRI of brain revealed acute/subacute right middle cerebral artery distribution infarct involving portions of the corona radiata as well as equivocal area of subacute infarct within the left centrum semiovale superimposed of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old hemorrhagic lacunar infarct within the right lentiform nucleus.
ECHO showed no evidence for source of thrombus or PFO/ASD.
Unfortunately, her L sided hemiparesis progressed to exam as listed above.
CT head was repeated on [**5-18**] to assess for hemorrhagic transformation and showed evolution of the known infarct without any evidence of hemorrhage.
She had a 2L NC requirement, CXR showed no focal consolidation or acute process.
No evidence of CHF.
Oxygen requirement was thought likely due to longstanding COPD and atelectasis.
For pain control patient was started on standing tylenol with moderate to good relief and lidocaine patches for b/l knee pain.
She was stared on Lovenox for secondary stroke prevention in setting of known malignancy.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheezing.
Secondary: Hyperlipidemia, Breast Cancer, Right neck squamous cancer (neither cancer is staged due to patient preference)   Discharge Condition: Neurological exam notable for: A/Ox3, MOYB intact, Language intact, impaired calculation, no apraxia or neglect.
Reflexes: [**Hospital1 **]/Tri/Patella L > R, but no spread.
You had a blood vessel occlusion on the right side of your brain, that caused weakness and difficulty with some parts of your thinking because of that.
It was felt that your stroke was due to both, atherosclerotic disease as well as hypercoagulability due to your breast and head and neck cancer (for which you have refused further evaluations and treatment).
