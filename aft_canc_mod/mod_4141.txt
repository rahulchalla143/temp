Admission Date:  [**2124-7-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-6-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 20147**] Chief Complaint: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy with biopsies   History of Present Illness: 83yoF with history of melanoma s/p resection [**2122**], chronic afib s/p cardioversion, who presented for bronchoscopy and transbronchial node aspiration of left upper lobe nodule who was transferred to the MICU for rapid afib and flash pulmonary edema.
Briefly, the patient had melanoma of her left upper back in the past, and as a part of the staging workup, underwent a PET-CT [**7-/2122**] which showed a 1.8 x 1.6cm nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung.
Repeat PET-CT [**12/2123**], which showed 1.8 x 3.5 cm left upper lobe lung lesion without positive lymph nodes, as well as a 0.5-cm non-avid RUL pulmonary nodule and no other mets.
In [**2124-3-7**] she developed hemoptysis and was CXR showed an increasing mass vs PNA.
Repeat CT/PET demonstrated increased size FDG avid LUL consolidation with bronchiectasis - atelectasis and post-treatment change vs malignancy.
She also had a new FDG avid T2 vertebral body adjacent to the lesion, most likely radiation changes but possibility of malignancy was unable to be excluded.
She presented today, [**7-13**], for an EBUS with biopsy of the lesion and BAL washings.
She reports she did not take any of her home medications today despite being advised to take some of her medications, as she was nervous it would interfere with the procedure.
The patient became hypoxic following her EBUS and was found to be in rapid afib and acute pulmonary edema in the PACU.
She became hypoxic to 97% on 6L FM, and was found to be in afib in the 120's-140's with stable BP's.
During thse course of these interventions, she was 92% on 2L NC, then reported increased dyspnea and was 95% on 3L NC, 98% on NRB, and experienced persistent dyspnea and was then placed on Bipap with PO2 99%, and was transferred to the MICU.
Per the patient, she has been experiencing increasing dyspnea on exertion for the past 5 days as well as increased lower extremity edema.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient denied dyspnea, chest pain, light headedness, palpitations, or other symptoms but was very anxious that her face mask was leaking out oxygen and repeated stated that she felt more comfortable on bipap.
She was briefly re-started on bipap then switched back to NRB in less than 1 hour and denied further dyspnea or other symptoms.
She reports feeling much improved from previously and states only that she continues to have her cough productive of blood tinged sputum.

There is now marked cardiac enlargement on this portable chest examination.
The cardiac configuration is rather typical for left ventricular as well as left atrial enlargement with very prominent extensive mitral ring calcifications within the heart shadow.
Thoracic aorta moderately widened as before with calcium deposits in the wall, seen at the level of the arch.
The pulmonary vasculature is markedly congested with distended vessel and perivascular haze.
No pneumothorax is seen.
The patient has now developed increasing cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion with beginning pulmonary edema.
Echo: [**2124-7-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
BAL: [**2124-7-14**] POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, Consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.

Hypoxia: Likely due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of AFib with RVR; DDx included post-obstructive PNA or aspiration of blood in the setting of chronic low grade hemoptysis.
She was diuresed with IV and po Bumex with significant improvement of her respiratory status.
Of note, the patient had reported increasing dyspnea on exertion for the past several weeks as well as increasing lower extremity edema after her home Bumex dose was decreased from 2mg po daily M-F to 2mg po M/W/F for a gout flare.
She likely requires her original dose of Bumex to prevent progressive volume overload, and this likely contributed to precipitating her rapid afib the day of admission.
She was briefly on Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for PNA but these were discontinued after no evidence of infection after 48 hours.
AFib with RVR: The patient had gone into afib with RVR in the setting of not taking any of her home medications, including Metoprolol, Bumex, and Spironolactone the morning of her EBUS.
She was discharged on dabigatran 75 mg po BID for anticoagulation.
UTI:  The patient had a UA sent which showed a Citrobacter UTI which was treated with Levofloxacin x 5 days.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient's creatinine increased to 1.7 in the setting of UTI, fluid restriction and diuretic administration.
Her pain had resolved at the time of transfer to the floor.
LUL nodule: Briefly, as part of melanoma staging she had PET/CT [**7-/2122**] showing LUL nodule.
FNA at [**Hospital1 2025**] of the nodule showed adenoca, but not a surgical candidate, so underwent RFA 10/[**2122**].
Repeat PET/CT [**12/2123**] showed LUL lesion without positive LN's and non-avid RUL pulm nodule, no other mets.
In [**3-/2124**], developed hemoptysis with CXR showing increasing mass, and repeat PET/CT showed increased size of LUL nodule with bronchiectasis - atelectasis and post-treatment change vs malignancy.
Also had a new FDG avid T2 vertebral body adjacent to the lesion, most likely radiation changes but possibility of malignancy was unable to be excluded.
She underwent EBUS [**2124-7-13**] for Bx of the lesion and BAL washings.
The BAL washings were positive for adenoca, and a LN Bx was also positive.
6. ipratropium bromide 0.03 % Spray, Non-Aerosol Sig: [**2-6**] sprays Nasal three times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Miralax 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
