She underwent metastatic workup which demonstrated mild avidity within the lesion but no FDG uptake elsewhere.
An MRI of the brain showed no evidence of metastasis.
A short-term follow-up CT scan showed no change within the lesion.
Therefore, due to the patient's poor pulmonary function, we elected to do a segmentectomy versus a right lower lobectomy should it end up being a lung cancer.
