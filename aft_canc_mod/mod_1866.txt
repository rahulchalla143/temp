Plan: 1. chest pain--presented to OSH with his anginal equivalent, pain resolved there with asa/morphine/ntg/metoprolol.
Has remained pain-free since.
Concern for ACS - probable angina/demand ischemia, exacerbated by his anemia/bleeding, & CHF exacerbation.
Ruling in with positive CK & troponin.
- follow serial EKGs, monitor for any recurrence of angina - cycle enzymes, telemetry - continue aspirin, low-dose metoprolol (monitor closely on BB as this could mask GI bleed), stating (increase to high-dose statin); no anticoagulation given GIB -cardiology planning to follow up  2. guiac positive stool + Hct drop--serial Hcts - pt with known varices, ulcers, & watermelon stomach for which he has had argon treatments.
Concern for any of these etiologies; however, given his NSTEMI & CHF, would not do EGD at this time, and instead manage medically.
- transfuse to hct>30s; lasix prn w/ transfusion - serial hct Q6hrs; IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]; 2 large bore IVs - gently correct coagulopathy - got vitamin K in ED, hold coumadin - would not reverse INR given his hypercoagulable state; this was discussed with GI, hem/omc, & cardiology -no NG lavage done d/t known varices and elevated INR - GI following; plan for EGD when medically stable  3.
CHF - pt with probable CHF, on lasix as outpt.
Clinically in decompensated CHF - likely due to medication non-complicance and dietary indiscretions on his recent vacation.
WBC 103K with immature cells on smear - pt with known CML, on hydrea as outpt.
6. hypothyroidism - cont synthroid  The patient continued to deteriorate while in the ICU.
Medications on Admission: ALLERGIES: The patient denies any drug allergies but states he has had some arm itching at sites of MORPHINE INJECTION.
