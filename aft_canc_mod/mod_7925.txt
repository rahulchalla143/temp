Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2110-5-20**] Segment V liver mass resection, intraoperative ultrasound.
History of Present Illness: 70-year-old mathematics professor who recently presented with right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort and an ultrasound demonstrated a 6.6-cm solid smoothly marginated ovoid mass in the inferior anterior right lobe of the liver.
CT scan of the abdomen and chest on [**2110-4-30**] demonstrated the hepatocellular carcinoma at the inferior margin of liver measuring 6.6 cm in diameter with a bilobed configuration with a small amount of fat density posteriorly.
There is a small amount of mixed density fluid around the mass in the inferior right liver, probably subcapsular hematoma secondary to the core biopsy.
No free fluid was demonstrated.
CT scan of chest demonstrated biapical lung scarring and punctate calcifications in both apices but no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
A bone scan demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease.
She was now brought to the operating room on [**2110-5-20**] for segmental Segment V resection of the liver mass with intraoperative ultrasound.
