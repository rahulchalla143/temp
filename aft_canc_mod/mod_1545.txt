The patient was last admitted to [**Hospital6 1708**] in [**2182-1-29**], where an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed questionable scar rupture or Dieulafoy's lesion causing the patient's gastrointestinal bleed.
During this admission to [**Hospital1 188**], the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed no active bleeding ulcers and they recommended increasing the patient's dose of Protonix.
There was no evidence of any acute bleeding going on and it was felt that the patient would continue to have some mild melanotic stools given the history of gastrointestinal bleed.
Chest x-ray showed patchy opacities in both the right mid and left lung zones.
Since there was no prior chest x-ray for comparison, it was not known if these were new or old, however, it was felt that there was no need for any antibiotics at this time.
The patient defervesced on his own without any intervention.

History of Dieulafoy's lesion.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, followed at [**Last Name (un) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Stress test at [**Hospital6 1708**] in [**2180-3-29**], showed no perfusion defects.
History of BCG vaccine and positive PPD in the past.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother had a history of diabetes mellitus as well as congestive heart failure.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - mucous membranes moist.
There was no jugular venous distention.
There were no bruits.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles were appreciated.
The heart revealed regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla, no rubs or gallops were appreciated.
Extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally and 2+ pulses bilaterally.
No clubbing or cyanosis.

diet well without any nausea or vomiting.
Endocrine - The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus.
Pulmonary - Given the patient's patchy pulmonary opacities in the left mid lung and right base, a chest CT was done.
Chest CT showed nonspecific ground glass opacities in the left upper lobe in the perihilar region.
The differential included early or resolving infectious process, asymmetric pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration event.
Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.
Calcified pulmonary granulomas and splenic and hepatic granulomas likely representing previous granulomatous infection and enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
Given these findings on chest CT, it was felt that another PPD should be planted.
Since the patient was eventually readmitted after discharge, PPD was found to be 3.0 centimeters positive for induration.
After discussion with infectious disease service, it was felt that given the patient's history of positive PPD in the past and lack of current symptoms including fever, chills, hemoptysis, that no treatment would be warranted given his advanced age and increased risk from INH toxicity.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of PPD positive.
Chest CT with calcified granulomas.
