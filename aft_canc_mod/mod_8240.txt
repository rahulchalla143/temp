[**2128-8-2**]  KUB: SUPINE FRONTAL AND FRONTAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: There is no pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.
Note is made of numerous air- and fluid-filled loops of large and small bowel, with scattered air-fluid levels seen on the decubitus view.
Note is made of a small amount of subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
[**2128-8-3**] PCXR:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-20**], there are lower lung volumes with continued evidence of chronic pulmonary disease and atelectasis at the base on the left.
Dilatation of gas-filled loops of large and small bowel are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of adynamic ileus.
[**2128-8-6**] PCXR:  FINDINGS: Since chest radiograph from [**2128-8-3**], there are no significant relevant interval changes.
The right upper lobe cystic spaces with surrounding consolidation are unchanged since the prior radiograph.
Bilateral mild pleural effusions are stable.
No new opacities in the lungs.
Some mild atelectasis is seen in  bilateral lung bases.
No acute intracranial pathologic process.
Hyperdense extra-axial lesion in the anterior falx, unchanged since [**2121**] and likely represents a meningioma.
Right frontal chronic subdural collection likely representing hygroma, unchanged since most recent study on [**2127-12-29**].
Bilateral opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right, which could represent infectious process such as aspiration pneumonia.
Ectasia of the aorta and bilateral external iliac arteries along with the left internal iliac artery.
Increased size of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy when compared to prior scans.
On [**2128-7-30**], the patient underwent ventral and bilateral inguinal herniorraphy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, and dilaudid for pain control.
Abdomen continued to be soft and non-distended.
Patient was transferred to ICU for further evaluation and monitoring, CT of Head, Chest, Abd, and Pelvis were ordered which were largely unremarkable for acute process, and blood cultures and urine cultures were sent which did not show any growth.
Neuro: The patient received IV dilaudid, PO oxycodone and tylenol with good effect and adequate pain control.
By POD 3 patient was requiring only Tylenol for pain control.
Patient was put on CIWA scale for prevention of Delerium Tremens.
Patient was tremulous during first week of stay but without delerium, muscle regidity, hyper-reflexivity, hallucinations, or focal neurologic deficit.
However, on the evening of POD 6 patient became agitated and required ativan.
On the morning on POD 7 patient became delirious, disoriented, and was rapidly assessed without further focal neurologic deficit.
Head CT did not reveal any acute abnormalities.
After a 2 day stay, patient returned to the floor with minimal tremor and ataxia.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Foley catheter was required during ICU stay on POD 7 and 8 for urine output monitoring and was discontinued on POD 9 while on floor and voided without issue.
However, patient began to have abdominal distension and was not passing flatus, but without accompanied nausea and vomiting.
On POD 5 patient required NGT to alleviate symptoms of functional small bowel obstruction with great relief.
NGT put out several liters of fluid over the subsequent 2 days and electrolytes were routinely monitored and repleted.
Due to excessive gastric output, potassium needed to be aggressively repleted over several days.
NGT was removed on POD 7 without further abdominal pain or distension.
Abdomen remained soft and nontender throughout the rest of stay.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
He remained afebrile and without leukocystosis.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
