Per family now noticed slurred speech and vague motor difficulties.
On ROS patient reports new onset of hand tremor bilaterally.
Has h/o gait disturbance [**3-11**] peripheral neuropathy at baseline.
In ED, repeat head ct showed no bleed but incidental mass likely meningioma.
Language: no speech abnormalities noted, easily understandable, with good comprehension and repetition.
Neuro: nl strength b/l, intentional tremor, mild dysmetria on finger to nose bilaterally.
No acute intracranial pathology including no intracranial hemorrhage.
Well-defined relatively hyperdense extra-axial mass seen within the frontal interhemispheric fissure measuring up to 18 mm in greatest dimension.
The appearance of this mass is most consistent with a meningioma.
White matter changes consistent with small vessel disease and multiple old lacunar infarcts.
ECG Study Date of [**2146-6-8**]  2:41:08 PM Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia Consider left ventricular hypertrophy Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes No previous tracing available for comparison .
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-6-9**] 1:21 AM Probable meningioma along the anterior falx.
There is a second small meningioma in the left posterior fossa abutting the sigmoid sinus.
Small vessel ischemic sequela.
No acute infarction.
ECG Study Date of [**2146-6-9**]  8:26:22 AM [**Month (only) 116**] be sinus tachycardia but consider also atrial tachycardia Borderline left axis deviation - is nonspecific Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of the same date, ventricular response more regular .
[**6-11**] renal us: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Mild scarring of the kidneys bilaterally, otherwise normal-appearing parenchyma .
No evidence of ileus.
No bowel obstruction.
No fluid collections or abscesses.
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the abdomen and pelvis.
Thickened loops of bowel as described above consistent with the given history of colitis.
Progression of wall thickening of bowel loops is seen to involve the distal ileum as well.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with htn, seizure d/o, who presented with speech difficulty/new bilateral hand tremors and C. diff colitis.
In brief, he had a MICU stay for hematemesis and ARF with rising WBC.
He abdomen continued to be distended and he continued to have copious diarrhea.
It was determined that his C.diff infection was so severe he would require colectomy but his family did not want to put the patient through surgery.
The patient was maintained on morphine for pain control.
WBC count began to rise day after admission, with low grade fevers, and increase abdominal distension.
Pt had a CT abd scan which showed thickened loops of bowel consistent with the given history of colitis.
Pt had decrease PO intake and was encouraged to drink more fluids and was aggressively hydrated.
He was transferred to the ICU for hematemesis and ARF and in the unit his white count continued to rise and he continued to have signs of colitis.
His studies lacked signs of ileus, though he was noted to have distention and trouble with tube feeds so he was kept NPO and followed by GI.
He had daily KUB to monitor for toxic megacolon.
# Hematemesis: New onset coffee-ground emesis with likely aspiration of contents.
# Aspiration pneumonia: New LL lobe infiltrate with likley aspiration noted.
Already on broad coverage with zosyn, but concern that patient may be becoming septic with hypothermia and increased wbc count, given this the patient was kept on zosyn and vancomycin was added.
# Dysarthria: Unclear duration of speech difficulty per history.
Possibly due to underlying delirium secondary to new Cdiff infection.
Unlikely to be TIA or stroke given negative head imaging post fall and no other focal neurological deficits, absence of signs concerning neighboring brainstem dysfunction.
Extra-axial mass not in location to be contributing to speech difficulty as not in Broca's area and no evidence of mass effect on brain parenchyma region involved in facial, tongue motor function.
Cannot exclude toxic-metabolic etiologies given underlying infection and renal failure.
# Intention tremor: Also of unknown duration.
No electrolye abnormalities.
He has family hx of essential tremors and is currently on beta blocker for heart disease.
# Intracranial mass: Found incidentally on head imaging upon admission.
Neurosurgery eval pt on admission and no intervention was recommended, with suggested followup in 3 month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] and a repeat MRI head at that time.
# Seizure d/o: Does not seem to be cause of fall as it appears to be mechanical with lack of post-ictal state and no loss of consciousness.
Prior to transfer out of the ICU his gabapentin was held given his renal failure.
# ARF: Baseline Cr 1.2 and increased to 1.8 on day 2 of hospital course.
Most likely in the setting of infection and diarrhea.
He was aggressively hydrated, but given his diarrhea, his renal failure continued to worsen.
