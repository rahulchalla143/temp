Admission Date:  [**2106-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-2-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-5-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, ARF, LE purpura  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation Central line placement Arterial line placement Bronchoscopy CVVH   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59 yo woman with h/o HCV (last VL 22 million)and B-cell lymphoma who presented from [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for further workup of bloody diarrhea, abdominal distension, and BLE purpura.
She states that her symptoms did not improve, so she presented to an [**Hospital **] Care center on [**1-20**] and was started on Tamiflu for presumed influenza.
She then developed periorbital edema and discontinued this medication.
This was followed by the onset of arthritic pains, abdominal pain and distention, and then nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea with clots.
At [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, she developed ARF with a creatinine peak of 2.4, which improved with aggressive hydration.
She also developed anemia with a Hct decrease from 46 to 38.
Yesterday, she developed a purpuric rash on her lower extremities, so she was started on IV Solumedrol for a presumed vasculitis.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was reporting worsening shortness of breath and increasing abdominal distension.
At approximately 7 am, she had a short run of VTach in the 250s that the converted into AFib with RVR.
She complained of chest pain, so an EKG was obtained, which demonstrated AFib with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 89844**]/T wave changes.
Given her bradycardia and hypoxia, she was transferred to the MICU for further management.
In the MICU, the patient states that she continues to have diffuse abdominal pain.
She also has 4/10 chest pain that is non-radiating and is associated with SOB.
In addition, she endorses a 30 lb weight gain, productive cough, abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, chills (-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

PATHOLOGY: [**2106-2-1**] Skin Biopsy, right leg: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with thrombi containing deposits consistent with cryoglobulinemia.
There is fibrinogen staining in some vessels and in perivascular areas consistent with vasculitis.
The staining of the luminal material is consistent with cryoglobulinemia.
................................................................ IMAGING/PROCEDURES: [**2106-1-31**] CXR: The heart is mildly enlarged.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
There are small right greater than left.
There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss/infiltrate, and pulmonary vascular re-distribution.
There is right-sided PICC line with tip at the cavoatrial junction.
[**2106-2-1**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of an acute pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchspasm, etc.).
No evidence of intussusception or other acute bowel pathology.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Splenomegaly, which may be related to the patient's lymphoma or HCV-related liver disease.
[**2106-2-5**] Bronchoscopy: General impression: Area of narrowing in ETT3-4 cm above end - no secretions and no obvious external compression.
[**2106-2-6**] CXR: After the initial development of pulmonary edema between [**1-31**] and 14th, heart size and mediastinal vascular engorgement have returned to [**Location 213**] and yet severe pulmonary abnormalities remain.
What looks like a combination of lung nodules, large and small and diffuse interstitial abnormality was present on [**2-4**], and all of it has improved.
I suspect the residual is due to areas of pulmonary hemorrhage and conceivably disseminated infection.
Right internal jugular line ends in the low SVC and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
No pneumothorax.
No acute intracranial process.
Extensive paranasal mucosal opacification with associated bony sclerosis indicative of a chronic component.
Bibasilar consolidations, increased from the prior examination concerning for infection.
Diffuse ground glass opacities, likely pulmonary edema.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Multiple nonobstructing renal stones bilaterally.
Bibasilar consolidations, increased from the prior examination concerning for infection.
Diffuse ground glass opacities, likely pulmonary edema.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Multiple nonobstructing renal stones bilaterally.
[**2106-2-22**] Abdominal X-ray: Non-diagnositc abdominal radiograph.
[**2106-2-24**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**2-23**], there is little change.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place and diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.
The appearance is consistent with severe pneumonia with vascular congestion and possibly ARDS.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo woman with h/o HCV and B-cell lymphoma who presented to an OSH with increasing abdominal distension, shortness of breath, and bloody diarrhea.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for increasing hypoxia, hypotension, and a junctional bradycardia.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient desaturated to high 80?????
?s constellation of findings and history are consistent with cryglobulinemia, manifesting with particularly active pulmonary vasculitis, which is an uncommon but documented phenomenon.
She was diagnosed with cryoglobulinemia by serum test as well as skin biopsy and was treated with solumedrol, underwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis and received 1 dose of rituxan per rheumatology and heme/onc recs.
Her oxygenation did not improve, which raised concern for an alternate or secondary process.
Pulmonary edema was felt to be a possible contributor so the patient was gently diuresed on a lasix drip with minimal improvement.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2-5**] which showed diffusely inflamed collapsible airways without any blood visualized.
Micro data was notable for yeast on sputum and BAL, as well as a positive influenza A assay.
She was also empirically started on antibiotics (first broadly w/ vanco and cefepime, then narrowed to levofloxacin) to treat a possible superimposed ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia.
Despite treatment for the influenza, pneumonia, and cryoglobulinemia, she continued to have worsening respiratory status.
# Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis: Patient with a history of cryoglobulinemia, previously treated with rituximab.
# Purpura: The patient developed a lower extremity rash that appears to be consistent with purpura.
Dermatology was consulted and performed a biopsy which showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and Ig deposition consistent with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
# ARF/Azotemia: Initially attributed to possible pre-renal picture given low urine Na and FeUrea of 17%.
Urine output improved with fluid rehydration, but then dropped again and azotemia was then attributed to steroids and later acyclovir.
She was started on CVVH when urine output dropped (though BUN, creatinine normal) and respiratory distress increased.
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets noted to be declining.
Cytopenia attributed to drugs, vasculitis, acute illness, and marrow suppression.
# Abdominal pain/distension: Patient was noted to have abdominal distension and increased NG tube drainage.
CT abdomen negative for obstruction.
# AFib with RVR: Throughout the hospitalization she had numerous episodes of AFib with RVR requiring boluses of IV metoprolol.
# Hepatitis C: Patient with known history of HCV, viral load 43.7 million.
She was treated with 1 dose of rituximab per heme/onc and rheumatology, with hepatology's support that therapy would not worsen viral hepatitis.
# B-Cell lymphoma: Hematology/oncology was consulted and felt there was not indication for acute intervention.
# Funguria: Patient with multiple urine cultures with fungus.
