Pt reports [**3-5**] month history of fatigue and night sweats.
Also over the last few months he has had progressively worsening cough and dyspnea on exertion.
Also few episodes of hemoptysis.
Two weeks ago he was started on antibiotics after outpatient visit for cough and was told that he had pneumonia.
He felt that he never recovered from this episode and cough worsened during the last 3 days prior to OSH admission.
One day prior to OSH admission he had severe cough and dyspnea while driving that forced him to stop his car.
He has never had chest pain with any of this.
+ weight loss with start of treatement for RCC.
Past Medical History: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: His left renal mass was diagnosed during workup for hypertension in [**2193-3-3**].
The patient was taken off study in [**10/2194**] because of disease progression.
-Zometa therapy, terminated because of a significant increase in his creatinine.
-Nexavar begun in [**2-/2195**] and promptly terminated because of severe gastrointestinal side effects (e.g.
-[**Year (4 digits) **] begun in [**11/2195**] because of disease progression.
PERRLA, anicteric sclera, no erythema or discharge.
O/P clear NECK: supple CHEST: diminished breath sounds L and R bases and lateral fields CV: reg rate, nl S1/S2, no M/R/G ABD: nl bowel sounds, soft, NT/ND, no masses or HSM, L flank scar.
some voluntary guarding EXT: pink, warm, good distal pulses no edema NEURO: A&O x3, gait WNL SKIN: no petechia, purpura, no rashes, lesions   Pertinent Results: Summary of OSH results: Bronchoscopy [**8-14**]: mas almost completely occluding RML takeoff and subsegemental takeoff of RLL.
Highly vascular, fragile, bleeding mass was not obvious for risk of heavy bleeding.
[**8-11**] CXR: R pleural effusion, L pleural effusion, hilar lymphadenopathy, no congestion [**8-11**] CT: no PE; RmL consolidation with pronounced RML atelectasis that appears almost complete, extensive pleural and parenchymal lesions.
Pathological fracture at T12; several liver lesions CBC on [**8-11**] - WBC 3.1 H/H 10.4/23; plts 493; Cr 0.7 LFTs nl; tB 0.3;   Brief Hospital Course: Respiratory Failure/Post-Obstructive PNA:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] OMED on [**8-14**].
Bronchoscopy showed obstructive renal cell carcinoma metastastic endobronchial lesions in RML, medial basilar RLL, and LLL.
HE had photodynamic therapy on [**8-19**] and subsequently developed post-procedure respiratory distress requiring intubation on [**8-22**].
Subsequently, he became volume overloaded, requiring diuresis.
His HCT drifted down to 20, and received 2 units PRBCs on [**8-26**] and [**8-28**]; anemia presumed due to bleeding metastases.
Repeat bronchoscopy on [**8-31**] showed persistent RML obstruction and RML pneumonia.
He returned to the MICU temporarily after having pulled out his endotracheal tube, but respiratory distress again resolved with re-placement of the endotracheal tube.
# Renal cell carcinoma: Metastatic as previously described.
# Prophylaxis: Received heparin SC and PPI while in house.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1)  Rectal DAILY:PRN as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: 1) Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma 2) Post-obstructive pneumonia 3) Respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy and PEG   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath.
You received photodynamic therapy to treat the renal cell cancer that spread to your lungs.
