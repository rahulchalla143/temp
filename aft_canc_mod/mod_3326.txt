Admission Date:  [**2120-3-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Allopurinol And Derivatives / Vancomycin / Ciprofloxacin / Augmentin / Azithromycin / Linezolid / Cefepime / Iodine / Meropenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Febrile neutropenia and meropenem desensitization     Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cycle 13 of decitabine   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome with acceleration to AML s/p clofarabine induction therapy with prolonged remission then recurrence, s/p 12 cycles of decitabine, presenting with febrile neutropenia for meropenem desensitization in the ICU.
The patient was recently discharged on [**2119-3-11**] after his 12th cycle of decitabine, with hospitalization complicated by mild tumor lysis.
He did not have any symptoms prior to taking his temperature, and states that he normally measures his temperature twice a day, per instructions from his oncologist.
Of note, the patient has extensive antibiotic allergies and he is being followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2602**] [**Name (STitle) 2603**] of Allergy/Immunology who has made a number of recommendations.
In [**2119-10-4**], he underwent a successful meropenem sensitization after developing a drug-induced hypersensitivity rash while on Cefepime.
The patient does not endorse any localizing signs or symptoms.
CXR shows an infiltrate in the posterior RLL, seen best in the lateral view.
BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**].
Since that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow cellularity.
Cytogenetics showed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 and he was treated on [**2118-9-19**] with his first cycle of decitabine.
He has completed 12 cycles of decitabine, with the 8th cycle complicated by pneumonitis and deterioration of lung function, requiring home oxygen use.

A new focal consolidation is seen within the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Probable trace pleural effusion on the right is present.
There are no acute osseous findings.
Near complete resolution of previously demonstrated left upper lobe consolidation with residual biopsy scar.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 59M with hx of MDS with transformation to AML s/p clofarabine and decitabine chemotherapy and multiple antibiotic allergies, now admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia for meropenem desensitization.
Febrile neutropenia and antibiotics hypersensitivity.
ANC of 64 on admission, s/p recent decitabine infusion, with fever to 101.4.
Afebrile on admission.
No localizing signs of infection, but patient is at high risk for infection and cannot mount a proper immune response.
CXR shows a developing RLL consolidation, concerning for pneumonia (seen best on lateral film).
He also has a portacath and has been exposed to health-care associated pathogens recently, so he needs covererage for GPs but cannot receive Vancomycin due to allergy.
Unfortunately, the patient developed a sensitivity reaction to meropenem (see below).
In the two days following the administration of tigecycline, the patient had worsening erythema and edema in his upper extremities.
It was unclear, according to Allergy, whether this was a continuation of his established reaction to meropenem or a new reaction to tigecycline.
There has been conjecture about patient allergy perhaps being to diluent or preservative in IV antibiotics, since he denies ever having a reaction to oral medications.
He remained afebrile since [**3-17**] when the oral levofloxacin was started (D1 = [**3-17**]) and tapering of prednisone to 10 mg was started on [**3-18**] per Allergy recommendation given his clinical improvement.
Given that patient had not spiked a fever since [**3-17**] and his hypersensitivity appeared worsened, levofloxacin was discontinued (total 4 day course) and prednisone was uptitrated to 20 mg daily on [**3-21**].
Meropenem desensitization: The patient had undergone a successful desensitization to Meropenem previously, when a decitabine cycle was complicated by a COPD exacerbation.
Cefepime is not tolerated well by the patient and he requires Pseudomonal coverage for febrile neutropenia.
Patient has multiple allergies across all classes of antibiotics.
B-blocker was held to prevent blunting of allergic response.
On the evening of [**2120-3-14**], the patient began to experience fever and erythema on his back.
The erythema and pruritus spread to his arms and legs over the course of the evening.
See above for the remaining of his neutropenia and associated antibiotics hypersensitivity.
MDS --> AML with chronic anemia/thrombocytopenia.
Acute kidney injury: Initially, his creatinine was 1.2, which is slightly elevated above his baseline.
It was thought to be pre-renal since he was on no new medication.
His UA was neg and there was no evidence of active sediment.
Multifocal lung opacities and COPD/emphysema: This was thought to be the major limiting factor to his functional status.
It was noted that the past LUL biopsy did not appear to be infectious etiology and past bronchial washings were negative for malignancy on cytology.
Because of his symptomatic SOB from Hct < 30, he got frequent blood transfusion.
See above for the pnuemonia and antibiotics.

You were admitted for neutropenic fever (fever in the setting of low white blood cell count) which was thought to be the result of a pneumonia.
Because of the extensive antibiotics allergies that you had in the past, you required desensitization to the antibiotics of choice.
You underwent this process initially with meropenem and developed allergic reaction.
Subsequently, tigecycline was tried, but you continued to have significant skin reaction.
You did not have a fever since [**2120-3-17**].
Please note the following changes in your medications: - Please START diphenhydramine 25 mg (Benadryl) tab, 1 tab, by mouth, every 6 hours as needed for itching skin.
