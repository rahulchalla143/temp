He did note that she had some urinary incontinence after getting back to bed.
Patient states that she felt as if she was about to have diarrhea, however, husband reports that she had a formed stool.
She reports feeling clammy and complained of worsening headache, as well as thirst and abdominal cramping.
ECG revealed new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response @ ~140 beats per minute, as well as an incomplete RBBB and inferolateral STD.
Preliminary read of CTA/CT abdomen and pelvis showed no pulmonary embolism or acute process in the chest, but possible very early diverticulitis involving the mid-to-distal descending colon, as well as evidence of chronic inflammatory bowel disease involving the right hemi-colon.
In light of these findings, as well as two episodes of foul-smelling diarrhea in the ED, the patient was started on metronidazole.

There is mild fatty atrophy of the pancreas, which is otherwise normal in appearance.
There is a small 2.2 cm duodenal diverticulum.
There is moderate colonic wall thickening involving the cecum, ascending colon, and proximal portion of the transverse colon, with evidence of submucosal fat deposition, findings that can be seen in the setting of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, (3B:109-128).
There is no pericolonic vascular injection or fat stranding adjacent to the thickened segment of bowel to suggest acute inflammation.
There is extensive diverticulosis, predominantly involving the sigmoid colon but also seen scattered throughout the descending colon.
There is minimal fat stranding along the mid to distal descending colon (3B:128), likely secondary to early colitis versus diverticulitis.
There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.
No pathologically enlarged abdominal lymph nodes are seen.
There is a small fat containing umbilical hernia.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are seen.
BONE WINDOW:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
Mild fat stranding adjacent to the mid-to-distal descending colon, likely secondary to early colitis, less likely diverticulitis.
Colonic wall thickening and submucosal fat deposition along the cecum, ascending colon, and proximal transverse colon, suggestive of chronic colitis.
There is no pericolonic fat stranding or vascular injection along this bowel distribution to suggest active disease.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Large right hepatic lobe simple cyst with additional scattered tiny hepatic hypodensities, also likely simple cyst but too small to characterize.
Small duodenal diverticulum.
Minimal gallbladder sludge versus tiny stones.
CT HEAD [**8-16**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with age-related involutional change.There is focal hypodensity in the corona radiata bilaterally( left > right) which could represent small vessel ischemic disease but consider MRI for further evaluation .
Minimal calcifications are seen of the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries and left vertebral artery.
Scattered mucus retention cysts are seen throughout both maxillary sinuses.
No acute intracranial process.
Scattered bilateral maxillary sinus mucus retention cysts.
There is focal hypodensity in the corona radiata bilaterally , left greater than right which could represent small vessel ischemic disease but consider MRI for further evaluation .

She had no memory of the events surrounding the syncopal episodes, but her husband found her on the ground twice on the morning of admission.
Given that she complained of lightheadedness, as well as her history of decreased PO intake and nausea since receiving chemo on [**8-13**], it was thought to be that both hypovolemia as well as new afib contributed to these episodes.
Patient was volume resuscitated and monitored on telemetry.
Had no further events during the hospitalization.
She received a total of 8 L during this hospitalization with good recovery of her blood pressure.
The Echocardiogram revealed nl EF (55-60%) with mod [**Last Name (un) **] and mild LAE, no LV motion abnormality.
SHe was kept in telemetry and had no subsequent atrial fibrillation during this admission.
She was able to ambulate without any orthostatic signs.
The original syncope was attributed to significant nausea and decreased PO intake from the chemotherapy.
# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with a leukocytosis with left-shift; read of CT abdomen, in conjunction with crampy abdominal pain, was suggestive of possible acute on chronic colitis.
She had two episodes of diarrhea in the ED, but this was in the context of taking prophylactic colace and senna.
However, given evidence of new onset abdominal pain with white count, inflammatory findings on CT scan, patient was covered empirically for GI flora with cipro/flagyl.
She was instructed to increase fiber intake (within limits of what is allowed of chemo and risk of neutropenia) and to optimize regularity of bowel movement.
# Headache: Ms. [**Known lastname **] also complained of significant headache.
Head CT on admission revealed no evidence of bleed.
ALthough, she has very little recollection of what occurred in the bathroom, it appears that she was found with her head on the bathroom scale.
