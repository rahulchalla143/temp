Admission Date:  [**2133-6-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-8-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Spinal fusion, lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 59 yom with Asthma, CHF, Depression initially presented to [**Location (un) **] ER [**2133-6-29**] with severe back pain.
And complained of back pain since that time.
CT T-spine at [**Location (un) **] ER revealed linear fracture of T9 body and underlying ankylosing spondylitis.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 **] c/o back pain given IV Morphine and transferred to TSICU.
T spine concerning for ankylosing spondylitis, also T9 fx.
However this did not happen due to logistic reasons and per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] change to hard collar for 6 weeks.
Patient continued to have signs of delirium and psychosis so consulted by Neurology and psychiatry.
Neuro assessement decreased mental status most likely confusion consistent with metabolic encephalopathy and recommended repeat CT head (negative for ICH), avoid narcotics, and CIWA scale.
ICU course complicated by delirium and psychosis including pulling out NG tube and disorientation.
Psych consult recommendations: On alprazolam at home and may also have signs of benzo withdrawl.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, mucous membranes dry.
No abnormal movements noted.
FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture.
There is extensive degenerative change at multiple levels with large anterior osteophytes some of which are bridging.
The soft tissues of the neck appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative change without evidence of fracture.
FINDINGS: There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, shifted normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
A 1.7 cm x 2.3 cm cystic structure posterior to the right cerebellum could represent an arachnoid cyst.
No fractures are seen and there are no air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Likely arachnoid cyst in the posterior fossa on the right.
T9 fracture with distracted fracture fragments with small amount of fluid/blood in between the distracted fragments.
Unclear if there is extension of the fracture line into the posterior elements- correlate with outside CT scan (not available to us at this time).
Small amount of prevertebral soft tissue swelling likely due to hematoma/anterior longitudinal ligamentous injury.
Increased signal intensity in the posterior spinal soft tissues from T9- T12, unclear if this represents ligamentous injury.
[**7-15**] MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is mild ventricular and focal prominence suggestive of mild degree of involutional change.
There are no signal or enhancement abnormalities within the brain parenchyma.
There is no hydrocephalus.
The fluid in the mastoid air cells bilaterally persist.
Minimal mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus is noted.
No signal or enhancement abnormalities in the brain parenchyma.
Vertical spinal fusion rods are again noted.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 931**]-type fixation construct posteriorly with no significant overall change in the position of the fixation rods and laminar hooks; no cross-piece is identified.
There is no evidence of interval hardware complication or change in alignment, and no new fracture is seen.
While there he was treated with benzodiazepines for presumed alcohol withdrawal and had a persistent delirium.
With all of these, there were no signs of either structural abnormalities or signs of infection.
He was followed by both neurology and psychiatry who felt this was consistent with post surgical delirium vs. EtOH changes.
Additionally EEG showed no significant abnormality.
Approximately 2 weeks postop, the wound had mild drainage from the surgical wound.
Though thought to be secondary to a seroma but was treated empirically with cephalexin for 10 days based on orthopedics recommendations.
# HTN - Clonidine stopped.
# Pneumonia: found to have a pneumonia on CXR and sputum cultures showed Klebsiella.
# Sinusitis- Treated with clindamycin for 10 days.
# anemia - MCV 98, B12, folate normal.
# Thrombocytosis: Resolved, thought to be initially due to infection/ acute stress.
# FEN - Per speech and swallow, not at risk for aspiration.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cervical fracture Pneumonia Delirium   Discharge Condition: improved mental status.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a cervical and thoracic fracture.
You had a spinal fusion.
Please take all medications as hospital if you you have fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, change in mental status or other concerning symptoms.
