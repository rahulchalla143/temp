A/P: 78 yo M with MMP presents s/p fall at NH and change in mental status.
Tachypnea - Patient became acutely tachypneic and hypoxic upon transfer to the floor.
He most likely experienced an aspiration event related to post-tussive emesis.
Other etiologies include pneumonia versus fluid overload versus pulmonary embolus.
The patient stabilized with suction and a short period on 100% NRB.
His oxygen saturation has been stable on 2L nasal cannula after this acute event.
Concern for bacteremia given change in mental status, tachypnea, slightly elevated lactic acid and degree of fever.
UTI/infection related vs hypoxia vs ICH s/p fall vs. hypercarbia vs. CASHD vs metabolic.
Not hypercarbic by venous pCO2, no metabolic derarrangements indicated by labs.
Elevated cardiac markers - concern for ischemia given h/o CASHD; LBBB on EKG; hemodynamically stable - Repeat enzymes x 2 - Continue ASA, statin, B-blocker per home regimen .
Concern for lytic lesions in T5 vertebral body.
- Neurosurg following - Myelogram tomorrow, will coordinate with hemodialysis - Check UPEP, SPEP, PSA - bone scan as an outpatient .
CKD - on hemodialysis, last treatment yesterday - Renal consult --> no need for urgent HD - Hemodialysis in AM - okay to have myelogram tomorrow .
# Biliary duct dilation s/p stent placement, abdominal exam benign - LFTs, pancreatic enzymes elevated - Add flagyl to cover for cholecystitis given clinical status - CT or U/S of abdomen as indicated for further evaluation .
Anemia - unknown baseline, but stable for now .

Large left pleural effusion with associated opacity presumed atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Mild L1 compression fracture of unknown chronicity.
1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body 3.
Large left pleural effusion and tiny right pleural effusion.
C-Spine ([**2139-9-22**]): Extensive degenerative changes with severe spinal cord compression at multiple levels as described above, presumed secondary to degenerative changes.
There is no definite evidence for fracture.
There is marked dilatation of the common bile duct measuring approximately 2.3 cm and a high density lesion measuring 2.5 cm at the pancreatic head, which may represent an impacted stone.
There is a biliary drain within the pancreatic head and extending into the duodenum.
Small bilateral simple fluid attenuation frontal subdural collections representing hygromas or chronic subdural hematomas.
No acute hemorrhage is identified.
4 cm right cerebellopontine angle cystic structure, likely an arachnoid cyst.
Choledocholithiasis causing massive CHD and CBD dilatation, without intrahepatic duct dilatation.
Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from the major papilla.
Echo ([**2139-9-24**]): Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to fibrosis and akinesis of the anterior septum, and akinesis of the anterior free wall and apex.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He had a positive UA and cultures later grew serratia and VRE.
On [**9-23**], patient was dialyzed and post-dialysis had a blood pressure of 50/P with tachycardia to 140's.
The patient was transferred to ICU secondary to hypotension and T 104.8.
Antibiotics included vancomycin, zosyn, and gentamycin.
Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from major papilla.
In the ICU, he was transiently on pressors for hypotension - on [**9-24**] dose of levophed was weaned down and off by [**9-25**].
Sepsis was improved and gentamycin was maintained as sole antibiotic therapy.
Follow-up blood cultures dran [**9-25**] remained negative for bacterial growth.
- Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from the major papilla.
- LFTs prior to the procedure were elevated [**9-22**] to ALT 79; AST 417 and fell to normal levels following ERCP.
Amylase levels rose slightly in the days following, suggesting mild post-ERCP pancreatitis.
Urine grew VRE and serratia [**9-23**] as noted previously.
Mental status.
Cord compression: CT spine showed severe spinal cord compression at the C3-4 through C6-7 levels and 1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body.
Concern for metastatic prostate cancer was raised.
In addition, spinal stenosis and cord compression were noted from C5 to C7.
He was asymptomatic for cord compression at these levels.
AV fistulogram [**9-29**] revealed aneurysm and impatent AV fistula, and attempted re-thrombectomy by IR was also unsuccessful.
[**Location (un) 5503**] will also arrange for further AV fistula surgery.
Dialysis administered erythropoietin.
Due to elevated blood pressures (160s/80s), the dose was increased to 5 mg daily.
