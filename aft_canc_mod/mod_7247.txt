Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD - [**4-5**] (twice) duodenal stent placement - [**4-5**]  History of Present Illness: 55M with HIV on HAART as well as widely metastatic pancreatic cancer (diagnosed early [**2203**]), previously on gemcitabine last chemotherapy [**2202-3-9**], transferred directly from [**Country 4754**] by air ambulance after a complicated course in [**Country 4754**].
The patient received 3 weeks of chemotherapy and then opted to travel to [**Country 4754**] and [**Location (un) **] for a final vacation.
His disease progressed extraordinarily rapidly in [**Country 4754**], and patient presented to [**Hospital 105679**] hospital w/ intractable vomiting, lethargy and ARF, found to have SBO from new duodenal lesion and new liver and brain mets.
[**Location (un) 105679**] in [**Country 4754**] was going to attempt to stent duodenal obstruction, but patient's symptoms reportedly improved slightly.
Pt had a prolonged flight from [**Country 4754**].
Pt states has had a BM today, and has been passing gas.
The patient comes accompanied with no CDs of images from [**Country 4754**], thus was sent for CT abd/pelvis in ED.

[**2203-2-11**] CTA of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3.3 cm pancreatic head mass, highly worrisome for pancreatic adenocarcinoma invading the adjacent duodenal wall and obstructing the common bile duct without adjacent major vascular involvement and multiple rim enhancing round hypodensities in both lobes of the liver, the largest 15 mm across, suggesting metastatic involvement, intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, multiple nearby retroperitoneal lymph nodes noted, 19 mm left adrenal nodule, likely adenoma, likely bone islands, no concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified.
He underwent ERCP on [**2203-2-12**], which revealed a narrowing consistent with external compression seen at the junction of the duodenal bulb and D2 with severe post-obstructive dilation of the common bile duct measuring 20 mm secondary to a singular, irregular stricture of malignant appearance that was 3 cm long seen at the distal common bile duct.
The brushings were positive for malignant cells consistent with an adenocarcinoma.
Social History: Patient has a supportive partner.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Examination: afebrile 99  115/70  92% 3L General: Alert, oriented, cachectic HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM extremely dry, temporal wasting Neck: supple, JVP flat Lungs: Crackles scattered b/l CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, moderately distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, hepatomegaly GU: foely in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Discharge Physical Exam: Vitals:  98.4  120/60  86  22  94% 2L General:  alert, oriented, cachectic HEENT:  NC, AT, MMM, OP clear, temporal wasting, mild epistaxis related to nasal cannula Neck:  supple, no LAD CV:  RRR, nl S1 S2, no MRG Resp:  bilateral basilar rales, no wheezes or ronchi Abd:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, no rebound or guarding Ext:  warm, well-perfused, no cyanosis clubbing or edema.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2203-4-2**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
No signs of small-bowel obstruction are seen.
Known pancreatic carcinoma with interval increase in the size of liver metastasis.
New ascites.
New omental stranding is seen.
This might be secondary to third spacing; still, omental involvement (peritoneal diseaes) cannot be excluded.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities are seen in the visualized lung fields might represent infectious or inflammatory process.
Bilateral enlargement of the kidneys that appear swollen with no obvious cause (though the exam is limited).
Bilateral small-moderate pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis, hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collections.
Nonspecific, slightly elevated resistive indices may relate to medical renal disease.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
No evidence of metastatic disease, although exam was somewhat limited due to the lack of contrast.
Small right centrum semiovale cavernoma.
Mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is a bilateral air space process with layering pleural effusions.
These findings together favor moderate pulmonary edema with bibasilar compressive atelectasis rather than diffuse pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
Calcific density contiguous to the greater tuberosity of the right humerus may be related to remote trauma or the presence of calcific tendinitis.
LE ultrasound ([**4-3**]): FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging was performed of bilateral common femoral, right superficial femoral, right popliteal, right peroneal, and right posterior tibial veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
KUB ([**4-5**]): SINGLE SUPINE FRONTAL ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPH: The left lateral abdomen is excluded from the study.
There is no evidence of nasogastric tube in either the visualized distal esophagus or the stomach.
The stomach is mildly gas-distended.
- Esophagitis - Retained fluids in stomach - Friability, erythema and congestion in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum compatible with obstruction - Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - Protonix 40mg IV BID.
EGD with advanced endoscopy ([**4-5**]): Impression: - Limited exam of esophagus and stomach were unremarkable - Erythema and congestion of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the first and second part of the duodenum with near complete obstruction of the duodenal lumen.
- Fluoroscopy also revealed a previously placed metal biliary stent.
- A 450 cm JAG wire was passed through the narrowed duodenal segment into the third part of the duodenum under fluoroscopic vision.
- A WallFlex TM Duodenal 22mmX120mm (LOT: [**Numeric Identifier 105709**], REF: 6503) metal stent was placed successfully over the guide wire  under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance.
Brief Hospital Course: ========================== BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY ========================== 55M with HIV on HAART as well as widely metastatic pancreatic cancer (diagnosed early [**2203**]), previously on gemcitabine last chemotherapy [**2202-3-9**], transferred directly from [**Country 4754**] by air ambulance after a complicated course in [**Country 4754**].
Patient to have multi-disciplinary approach to palliative care and eventual return to home.
========================== ACTIVE ISSUES ========================== # ARF / Anion Gap alkalosis: BUN 158, Cr 9.0, from baseline 1.0.
Unlikely to be post-renal secondary at this point since draining urine with foley, although patient stated that foley was difficult and required urology [**3-17**] prostate enlargement.
Likely combination of intrinsic renal disease secondary to ATN and hypotension at OSH with pre-renal etiology in setting of prolonged course of nausea and vomiting, profound volume depletion.
Patient presented with an anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to GI acid losses and contraction alkalosis.
Although the patient had elevated calcium and phosphorus, and was at risk for precipiation, binders were initially of little use as the patient was NPO.
As volume status normalized, urine lytes and consistent hypokalemia despite renal failure raised concern for type 1 RTA.
The Renal team recommended using potassium supplementation to avoid hypokalemia given persistent renal wasting.
# Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Discussed patient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16095**] on evening of admission.
# SBO/GOO:  Patient presented with intractable nausea and vomiting, which was thought related to small bowel obstruction and also potentially from cerebral edema.
Seemed as if prior obstruction had resolved given BM and flatus, however there continued to be concern for functional ileus or obstruction due to peritoneal carcinomatosis.
EGD performed [**4-5**] for possible GI bleeding revealed 95% obstruction of duodenum, the likely cause of these symptoms.
He had multiple guaiac positive and melanotic stools over the next several days with persistently negative NG lavage.
EGD revealed no source of bleeding and his Hct remained stable following transition.
However, the location of his tumor adjacent to the duodenum put him at high risk for future bleeding due to erosion into the vasculature of the small bowel.
# GPC bacteremia / ?
PNA: Patient treated for sepsis at OSH for CXR suggestive of L lung base consolidation.
CXR [**4-3**] showed no consolidation.
# CAD: Tropinemia most likely secondary to cardiac demand (ischemia, as evidenced by TWI on EKG) in background of ARF.
Patient had no LAD disease on prior cardiac cath.
Unlikely to be ACS as having no typical anginal symptoms.
Continued ASA and Plavix through [**4-3**], then discontinued for several days given concern for GI bleeding.
Most likely from marrow suppression in setting of malignant disease, anemia of chronic disease.
Despite concern for GI bleeding, the patient had good response to transfusion without further Hct drop.
Truvada on hold given renal failure, Kaletra on hold given risk of resistance.
# Sacral pressure ulcer:  From long-term hospitalization.
# RLE edema:  b/l LE edema, R>L, concerning for DVT given long hospitalization.
RLE ultrasound negative for DVT.
Edema likely due to ATN and prolonged bedrest.
# Persistent leukocytosis:  WBC as high as 48 during admission.
[**Month (only) 116**] be partially due to use of dexamethasone, however this remained elevated throughout admission regardless of antibiotic use.

You were initially admitted to our ICU given your fever, low blood pressure, and acute kidney injury.
The testing done in [**Country 4754**] and at this facility determined that you had experienced worsening of your pancreatic cancer, with new metastases in the liver.
You had recently completed a course of chemotherapy, but given your kidney injury and infection, it was not possible to continue this treatment.
Our Renal team saw you and did not recommend dialysis for your kidney failure.
During your stay, you were treated with antibiotics for infection, IV fluids and bowel decompression for your bowel obstruction, and pain and nausea medications.
- metoprolol to control your heartrate - ondansetron and olanzapine as needed to help with nausea - docusate and senna to help with constipation - aluminum hydroxide to prevent your phosphate from getting too high - pantoprazole to lower the acid in your stomach and prevent bleeds - lorazepam as needed to help with anxiety - potassium chloride to prevent low potassium levels - pentamidine once a month to prevent lung infections - oxycodone as needed for pain  You should NOT take your HIV meds for the time being.
