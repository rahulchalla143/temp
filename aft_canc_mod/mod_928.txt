Admission Date:  [**2117-11-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: Worsening headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2117-11-9**]: Left craniotomy with hematoma evacuation  History of Present Illness: This is a pleasant, Russian 49 y/o female who is well known to the Neurosurgery service.
She first presented to us on [**2117-10-28**] after sustaining a fall down [**2-25**] steps, the date of admission, which resulted in a left subdural hematoma and was discharged from the neurosurgery service on [**2117-10-30**].
She then returned to the ER on [**2117-11-4**] with worsening headache and new right lower extremity weakness.
She was admitted to our service and was given mannitol and her extremity weakness resolved and she was discharged home on [**2117-11-5**] with an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] again on [**2117-11-10**].
On the date of this admission ([**2117-11-7**]), she had been experiencing worsening headaches and the right lower extremity weakness had returned.
Past Medical History: Grade I parasagital meningioma s/p subtotal resection and IMRT radiation; now with recurrence and on protocol drug, hysterectomy for fibroids, gastritis, hiatal hernia   Social History: Lives with boyfriend.
Family History: Mother died at 44 of stomach cancer, father died at 68 of a heart attack.
She has no brothers or sisters   Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: O: T: 98.0  BP: 114/73   HR: 69   R 18     O2Sats 99% RA  Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD, sleepy as pt just received narcotics for headache.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No motor or sensory deficit.
No dysphasia   Pertinent Results: CT Head w/o contrast obtained at the OSH shows a stable appearance of L SDH with MLS.
Known Meningioma is also noted.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2117-11-7**]: Redemonstration of left subdural hematoma, which is stable in size from one day prior, without evidence for new hemorrhage.
However, there is progressively increased mass effect over multiple prior studies, with now up to 9 mm rightward midline shift, and clear enlargement of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], compatible with trapping.
There is slight effacement of the left aspect of the suprasellar cistern.
Known extra-axial mass at the vertex, compatible with known residual meningioma.
Prior right craniotomy, with underlying encephalomalacia noted.
Left subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline shift of approximately 11 mm towards the right.
CT head [**11-9**] Expected post-surgical changes after left frontoparietal craniectomy.
Slightly increased shift of normally-midline structures to the right, with entrapped right lateral ventricular temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], as before.
Persistent left-sided subdural hematoma with a transverse dimension of 9.3 mm, with significant mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere and the left lateral ventricle and rightward shift of the midline structures by approximately 1.3 cm, not significantly changed from prior.
Increase in the previously noted left frontal subdural fluid collection, which measures 7.6 mm compared to the prior of 0.6 mm, with decrease in attenuation.
Mass effect is also noted on the upper midbrain structures along with a component of cerebral edema.
Two dense areas noted in the left vertex, one parafalcine and one along the convexity, likely representing meningiomas, not significantly changed, however, inadequately assessed on the present study.
Left temporal extra-axial fluid collection with increased density (series 2, image 7) is more conspicuous than prior.
[**2117-11-14**] EEG This video EEG telemetry captured a normal waking background but nearly continuous delta frequency slowing over the left hemisphere which improved over the course of the day's recording.
These findings suggest the presence of significant cortical and subcortical dysfunction over the left side although with gradual  improvement over the course of the day.
There appeared to be a right central breach rhythm, as could be seen after a skull defect.
No obvious acute infarction.
Left-sided extra-axial fluid collection with blood products and overlying soft tissue fluid collection with blood products, with shift of the midline structures to the right side by 1 cm and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, not significantly changed from the recent study of CT head of [**2117-11-14**], attention on close followup as clinically indicated.
Known multiple meningiomas in the brain at the vertex, with the left parasagittal lesion, seen to extend into the superior sagittal sinus as before.
While there is no significant change in size compared to the recent study of [**2117-11-8**], the left parasagittal meningioma has increased compared to the study of [**2110**].
Accurate assessment being limited due to the technical differences.
Residual subdural collection is again identified, without acute hemorrhagic component.
Mass effect upon the left cerebral hemisphere is stable, with persistent rightward shift of midline structures by 8 mm.
Trapping of the right lateral ventricle is slightly decreased.
No new parenchymal edema, no evidence of territorial infarction.
She was admitted to the SICU, administered mannitol 50 g IV x 1 then 25 g IV Q6 hours with frequent electrolyte monitoring.
Repeat CT head imaging was performed on [**2117-11-7**] showing redemonstration of a left subdural hematoma, which was stable in size from prior, without evidence for new hemorrhage.
However, there was progressively increased mass effect over multiple prior studies, with up to 9 mm rightward midline shift and clear enlargement of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], compatible with trapping.
For this reason, operative intervention was planned and on [**2117-11-9**] she underwent left craniotomy with subdural hematoma evacuation.
Post -op CT showed less midline shift and expected post-op changes.
On [**11-11**], the patient had a repeat CT head which showed evidence of improving midline shift and her neurologic exam seemed to be steadily improving; the patient was more responsive and alert, following commands for favorably.
On [**11-14**], patient became aphasic, suspected seizure activity and Keppra increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
EEG showed R central and temporal activity consistent with seizure activity and Keppra was increased to 1250 [**Hospital1 **].
There was no infarct.
He felt that the edema was due to tumor invading the sagittal sinus.
** During this hospitalization it was found that the patient had an incidental pulmonary nodule.

Medications that may be prescribed include: o       Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).
o       An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You have been prescribed Keppra for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
