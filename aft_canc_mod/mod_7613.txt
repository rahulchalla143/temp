She had chest pain [**7-13**] and given, ASA, morphine 2mg IV x2, no EKG changes, and first set of enzymes pending.
On further questioning she denied diarrhea, epigastric pain, increased frequency of urination, pain with urination, hematuria, changes in vision, headache, increased SOB on exertion (baseline for last few months SOB after 1 flight of stairs), PND, orthopnea, CP prior to today, jaw pain, arm pain.
Past Medical History: -breast cancer s/p wide excision, radiation, and current endocrine therapy with tamoxifen -diabetes -hypertension -lumbar spinal stenosis Past oncologic history: Stage I (T1cN0M0) Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, diagnosed in [**2136**], ER +, PR -, HER2Neu -, LVI -, grade III.
Wide excision with sentinel lymph node procedure.
Exemestane held due to musculoskeletal side effects, and the patient subsequently taken off study and placed briefly on Arimidex.
Arimidex was later discontinued due to intolerable hot flashes.
She has one sister who died last yr of respiratory illness.
The only diseases that run in the family are diabetes and hypertension.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
JVP=difficult to access given recent placement of central line and body habitus LUNGS: CTAB, somewhat decreased breath sounds bilaterally diffusely ABDOMEN: NABS.
Soft, mild tenderness in lower abd EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Microbiology: [**5-3**] urinalysis - positive, no urine culture sent [**5-4**] urinalysis positive, urine culture > 100K e coli Urine culture [**5-4**]:     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-5-6**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Blood culture [**5-3**]:                       **FINAL REPORT [**2140-5-7**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2140-5-7**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Imaging: [**5-3**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process .
Plate-like subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base is new.
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Pleural effusion is minimal, on the left, if any.
[**5-5**] Chest x-ray: There are lower lung volumes but no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Currently, on tamoxifen, presenting with urosepsis and continued fevers, shortness of breath.
Moderate plaque is present within the thoracic aorta.
No filling defects identified within the pulmonary arteries, however, this study was not optimized to evaluate this finding.
Bibasilar atelectasis and trace left pleural effusion demonstrated.
No axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy per CT size criteria.
1.4 cm hypoattenuating lesion within the left lobe of the liver is most consistent with a cyst.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The spleen and abdominal large and small bowel appear within normal limits.
The kidneys are heterogeneous bilaterally involving the cortices with a large region in the right upper pole and significant region in the left mid pole consistent with significant pyelonephritis.
The abdominal aorta and iliac branches demonstrate moderate calcified atherosclerotic plaque without aneurysmal dilatation.
No free fluid or free air within the abdomen.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS: A 4.5 x 3.8 cm presumed exophytic fibroid is demonstrated within the left adnexa as depicted on pelvic ultrasound from [**2140-3-2**].
A new 2.1 cm fluid collection is noted within the right adnexa, possibly representing an adnexal cyst.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Bilateral severe pyelonephritis.
No adjacent perirenal fluid collections identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
Fluid attenuation lesion within the right adnexa measuring 2.1 cm, not seen on prior pelvic ultrasound.
Finding may reflect an adnexal cystic lesion and recommend correlation with pelvic ultrasound on a non-urgent basis in this postmenapausal female.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old woman with history of DM, HTN, breast cancer (in past, currently on tamoxifen) who presented with sepsis due to E Coli UTI and E Coli bacteremia and DKA.
Sepsis due to E Coli UTI/E Coli bacteremia/pyelonephritis: Patient presented with fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, positive urinalysis, urine culture with e coli, with subsequent blood cultures growing gram negative rods, consistent with urosepsis.
When urine and blood cultures grew out pan sensitive e coli, vancomycin was discontinued and she was maintained on levofloxacin alone.
With these measures, her tachycardia, leukocytosis and elevated lactate resolved.
Patient continued to have low grade fevers and complained of right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Therefore a CT abdomen was obtained that demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis, no discreet fluid collection.
Of note, pt did still have low grade temps at night to 100.1 prior to discharge, no localizing symptoms, felt to be due to resolving pyelonephritis.
Pt had no further abdominal pain at time of discharge.
Pt was asked to monitor her temperature at home.
Hyperglycemia/DKA/Diabetes:  Patient presented hyperglycemic, with anion gap acidosis, glucose and ketones in urine, consistent with DKA.
She was treated initially with IV fluids and insulin drip, with closure of anion gap, resolution of her hyperglycemia.
HgbA1c was elevated at 8.7.
# Shortness of breath:  Patient noted some episodes of shortness of breath, initially had some wheezing on exam, chest x-ray with some evidence of mild volume overload.
Given continued symptoms, obtained a CT torso to rule out pulmonary embolism that was negative for any clot.
Her complaints of SOB had resolved at discharge and pt was satting upper 90s on room air.
Acute renal failure:  Creatinine on admission was up to 1.4 up from baseline of 0.8-1.1 on admission.
CT of the abdomen had shown no hydronephrosis, but +pyelonephritis.
Pts ARF was felt to be most likely due to pyelonephritis vs mild ATN from CT dye.
Pt was given fluid challenge with 2 L NS.
Both were resumed once BP normalized, but HCTZ was again held in the setting of worsening renal function.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every 2 to 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: E coli urosepsis Pyelonephritis Diabetic ketoacidosis Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with urinary tract infection/sepsis, and treated with antibiotics with improvement in your symptoms.
You had some kidney failure, likely due to the kidney infection.
Please contact physician if develop fevers/chills, shortness of breath, fingerstick over 400 or less than 60, or any other questions or concerns.
