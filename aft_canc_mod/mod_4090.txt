Admission Date:  [**2190-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-9-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: GYN  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: vulvar infection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p radical vulvectomy with groin lymph node dissection s/p left groin debridements x 2   History of Present Illness: 61 yo female who presented with a vulvar lesion on [**2190-7-15**].
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] performed a biopsy, which revealed high-grade atypia most suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma.
She was admitted [**7-20**] with a complaint of lower extremity erythema and swelling consistent with cellulitis.
This was following imaging studies including an MRI on [**2190-7-23**] that revealed highly suspicious necrotic lymph nodes along bilateral pelvic nodal chain along with a two-cm mass with papillary surface projecting into the bladder lumen from the right bladder wall highly suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma.
On [**2190-7-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] performed cystoscopy and she was found to have a two-cm superficial papillary bladder tumor lateral to the right ureteral orifice, which was biopsied and consistent with papillary urothelial carcinoma, low-grade.
The endometrial curettage showed no evidence of malignancy.
A left vulvar biopsy, however, revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated.
On [**2190-7-30**], the patient underwent radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin lymphadenectomy with 3/6 right groin nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma ans 12 of 13 lymph nodes in the left groin were positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with extensive extracapsular extension and obliteration of nodal architecture.
On [**2190-8-11**], the patient with taken back to the OR for a nonhealing left groin wound and underwent debridement and placement of a vacuum dressing.
The left groin excision revealed squamous cell carcinoma as well along with acute and chronic inflammation.
Wound culture from that procedure revealed mixed bacterial types.
The dressing was removed on [**8-27**] and the wound has been on wet to dry dressings since.
A large amount of lymph fluid drains from this, with increased pitting edema in her left lower extremity greater than the right.
The rest of her incision remains clean dry and intact.
Vulvar carcinoma: a CXR on [**8-11**] showed some hilar fullness, so a CT scan was done and showed pulmonary nodules c/w metastatic disease.
A repeat CT on [**8-28**] showed increased number and size of pulmonary nodules.
After discussion with the pt and her family, it was decided not to pursue further treatment for this (including further debridement or debulking, or palliative chemotherapy).
ID: pt has persistent low grade fevers throughout her hospitalization, all cultures (blood, urine, deep tissue, PPD and fungal/myco) have been negative.
It is not clear if this is merely tumor fever or if there is a superimposed infection despite different antibiotic regimens for more of her postoperative course, including Unasyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Hypercalcemia: The patient also developed hypercalcemia twice this admission.
Heme: Anemia: likely due to chronic infection.
Pain control: pt complained of increased pain toward the end of her hospitalization, but adequate control was obtained with MS contin 100 mg PO q12hrs, with morphine IR 15-30mg PO q4-6hrs.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Morphine Sulfate 15 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
