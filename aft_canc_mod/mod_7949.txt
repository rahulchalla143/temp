significant for malignant bladder cancer s/p elective radical cystectomy/ileal conduit on [**4-25**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, and new mass-like lesion obstructing proximal orifice of left upper lobe, who is transferred from [**Location (un) 28318**], [**State 1727**] for IP evaluation of lung lesion.
He had multiple resections of his tumor, but continued to suffer from gross hematuria.
In preparation for radical cystectomy, patient had an extensive metastatic evaluation, including chest CT, that revealed no metastatic disease outside of the bladder.
On [**4-25**], patient went for radical cystectomy; he initially did well but then developed increased 02 requirements over the next few days and eventually required reintubation.
A repeat CXR showed evidence of collapse of the left upper lobe, and a repeat CT scan confirmed collapse and question of a mass (The prior CT images were reviewed and in retrospect it appeared as though there was an upper lobe hilar mass i [**2140-3-1**] as well).
Washings were taken but biopsy was not done due to bleeding.
During hospitalization, patient also had fascial dehiscence and evisceration that required emergent return to the OR.
Patient is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Interventional Pulmonology evaluation of bronchial mass.
Family History: Significant for cardiac disease.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam: VS: 100.1, HR: 141, BP: 108/64, SPO2 94% on FIO2 70% GENERAL:  Intubated, comfortable, responds to commands CHEST:  Clear anteriorly CARDIAC:  Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no MRG ABDOMEN: Abdominal wound with sutures in place, no drainage, tissue is pink, urostomy bag in place, no bowel sounds EXTREMITIES:  2+ edema in all four extremities, pneumoboots in place NEURO:  Responds to commands, sedated, looks comfortable .
HEENT: no oral lesions or ulcers Skin: diffuse symmetric erythematous macular coalescing rash over buttocks, groin, medial aspect of upper extremities BL Cardiovascular: S1/S2, RRR, no MRG Respiratory / Chest: L>R ronchi with transmitted breath sounds Abdominal: distension improved, non-tender, bandage over surgical retention sutures.
Midline surgical incision without drainage.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2140-5-9**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2140-5-1**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Imaging: CXR [**2140-4-28**]:  Followup of the patient with bladder cancer after radical prostatectomy and new bronchial mass.
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
There is a large left hilar mass with left upper lobe atelectasis.
There is a curvilinear lucency surrounding the aortic arch most likely representing the Luftsichel sign associated with left upper lobe atelectasis.
Right lung demonstrates a right lower lobe opacity, partially characterized on that study and may represent infectious process or partial atelectasis.
The partial imaging of the upper abdomen shows bilateral ureteral stents.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Status post radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with no evidence of leak.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis does not communicate with contrast-filled ileal conduit.
Cystic liver lesion in segment II with adjacent fatty sparing.
Soft tissue lesion narrowing the left main and left upper lobe bronchus with left upper lobe atelectasis; incompletely imaged.
Cholelithiasis; no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Incidental intramuscular lipoma between the internal and external left oblique muscle.
There are several mediastinal lymph nodes, some of them more than 1 cm in diameter.
Although they may represent reactive findings, but they also can be enlarged due to neoplastic involvement giving the large mass in the left hilus, that appears to be located at the level of left main pulmonary artery, where it enters the lungs.
The exact dimension of the mass is difficult to estimate given the lack of contrast, but approximate estimation would be 2.5 x 4 cm.
The density of the mass is heterogeneous, with areas of 14 and 27 Hounsfield units.
There are extensive areas with interlobular septal thickening, consistent with volume overload.
There are also posterior segment of left upper lobe, left lower lobe and right lower lobe opacities which might represent infectious process.
Postobstructive nature of left upper lobe posterior segment abnormalities is likely given the previously documented left upper lobe partial atelectasis.
There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.
The imaged portion of the abdomen re-demonstrates low density of the liver, 2:50, it should be better assessed with ultrasound.
The specimen contains mostly necrotic tumor in a background of abundant fibrino-inflammatory exudate.
A poorly-differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma is favored, although metastasis from a bladder primary cannot be entirely excluded.
significant for bladder cancer s/p radical cystectomy on [**4-25**] at Penobscot [**Hospital **] Hospital, unable to extubate following the proceedure and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for management, found to have left upper lobe collapse, and new bronchial mass he was treated with XRT x2 weaned off of the ventilator and returned to Penobscot [**Hospital **] Hospital per patient and family request.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Related to left upper lobe collapse in setting of bronchial mass.
He was successfully weaned off of the ventillator [**5-9**] he was weaned from non-rebreather to 4LNC which was his oxygen requirement at the time of transfer.
# Ventilator associated Pneumonia: He had a low grade temperature and was started on ventilator associated pneumonia [**5-6**] with vancomycin and zosyn.
# Drug rash: [**5-7**] patient developed confluent erythematous rash over trunk and groin, no mucousal lesions to suggest TEN/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] syndrome.
Zosyn discontinued as presumed cause of rash he was treated with hydrocortisone cream and the rash improved moderately.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 2.0 prior to transfer and trended up to 3.5.
Renal was consulted and believed acute insufficency was related to ATN.
# BRONCHIAL TUMOR: Broncheoscopy performed for left upper lobe collapse returned tissue consistent with non-small cell lung cancer however pathology was unable to exclude metastatic disease from bladder.
Patient put out well through his ileal conduit, and pain at incision site gradually improved, although required treatment with IV Fentanyl as needed.
# RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with unknown baseline creatinine.
His creatinine at OSH reached 3.8 in the setting of obstruction from ureteral stents.
Patient's creatinine initially trended down during admission, but had acute worsening on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Obstruction and ileal conduit leak were ruled out with imaging.
Renal was consulted, who examined his urine sediment and determined the etiology to be likely ATN.
# HYPERNATREMIA: Developed hypernatremia during ICU admission, replaced free water deficit with D5W, with good response of serum sodium values.
# HYPERTENSION:  Anti-hypertensives were discontinued in setting of sedation and acute illness.
# TACHYCARDIA:  Upon admission, patient had episodes of afib with RVR.
DuoNeb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: Three (3) mL Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure .
Pulmonary edema Ventilator associated pneumonia Non-small cell lung cancer bladder cancer COPD Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname 56711**],  As you know, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after your bladder surgery for evaluation of respiratory failure.
We took biopsies which suggested that you have a form of lung cancer in your left lung.
Your heart rate increased and you developed an arrythmia called atrial fibrillation.
You developed a rash on your chest and legs which is related to a medication, Zosyn, the medication was stopped and your rash is improving, you should inform your healthcare providers that this medication caused an allergic reaction.
