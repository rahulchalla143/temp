He presents for preoperative liver transplant.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, status post TIPS, sent home from the [**Hospital1 18**] 2 days prior for possible liver transplant.
Last admission on [**2115-1-25**], for lethargy and nausea and low grade encephalopathy, for which he was treated aggressively with lactulose and Rifaximin.
Since discharge from the hospital 2 days ago he has noted an increase in ascites and a slight increase in shortness of breath, and increased leg edema.
No abdominal pain.
Denies fever, chills, headache, dizziness, chest pain, phlegm, or indigestion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, encephalopathy [**2114-8-9**], varices with banding, anemia secondary to end stage liver disease, left hydrothorax status post thoracentesis, radiology evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, CAD, status post MI in [**2099**], hypertension, had a catheter angioplasty in [**2099**].
The patient was alert and oriented in no acute distress.
Mildly anxious with his wife present.
[**Name2 (NI) 4459**]: PERLA, EOMs intact with positive scleral icterus.
No JVD, 2+ carotids, no bruits, no lymphadenopathy.
No murmur, regurgitation or gallop.
Extremities: Trace edema and mild jaundice.
Onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails.
Abdomen with faint erythematous rash.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He was maintained in the ICU for a total of 5 days, during which time he was extubated from the vent, and seemed to tolerate this without difficulty.
A duplex ultrasound of the liver on postoperative day 1 demonstrated multiple predominantly echogenic lesions in the liver, most likely hemangiomas, likely hematoma adjacent to the left lobe of the transplanted liver, patency of the portal vein, its major tributaries, the major hepatic veins, the major hepatic artery and its major branches.
Of note a chest x-ray was done while in the ICU that demonstrated left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis and linear atelectasis with scarring in the left mid lung zone.
Postoperative day 1 a repeat chest x-ray demonstrated increased size of bilateral pleural effusion.
He demonstrated coarse breath sounds at the bases, right greater than the left.
He exhibited mild acidosis and an elevated potassium of 5.6.
This demonstrated no evidence of renal calculi or hydronephrosis, solid renal mass, or renal calculus within either kidneys.
There was no perirenal fluid collections identified.
After further review it was felt that the etiology of the acute renal failure was unknown, and it was less likely to be due to FK toxicity.
IV bicarbonate was administered for hyponatremia and acidosis.
On hospital day 5, a bedside speech and swallow evaluation was requested for patient complaints of difficulty swallowing with coughing after thin liquids after extubation the previous day.
He denied that any food or liquid was getting stuck in his throat.
Mild amounts of aspiration were noted without recognition by the patient.
A left pleural effusion was identified.
There was no appreciable rightward shift of the mediastinum.
A small right pleural effusion was identified.
He did complain of a non productive cough, and he appeared tachypneic at times with a heart rate in the range of 60 to 80's, normal sinus rhythm.
Pleural fluid demonstrated no malignant cells.
Pleural culture was sent and this demonstrated no organisms and no growth.
A repeat pleuro path was done on [**3-3**] for complaints of shortness of breath, a chest x-ray that demonstrated a large effusion, 1300 cc were removed.
A culture was sent and this demonstrated no growth.
He remained on humidified face tent for his hoarse voice.
A repeat chest x- ray demonstrated no pneumothorax, but there remained a moderate amount of pleural fluid on the left, which was partially loculated apically and laterally.
There was some decrease in pleural effusion following the thoracentesis.
A repeat chest x-ray on [**3-4**] again demonstrated increased pleural effusion with large left pleural effusion.
Interventional pulmonary recommended a Pleurx catheter placement, although they recognized that the patient had had a Pleurx catheter in the past that resulted in protein wasting and decreased nutritional status.
The suspicion was that this was consistent with hepato hydrothorax and that it would hopefully improve with time after a liver transplant stabilization of function.
He did have 2 further video swallows, one on [**3-5**] that demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability compared to [**2115-2-26**], but continued aspiration with thin liquids due to impaired vocal cord closure was noted.
Of note, the patient had received an ENT evaluation with notation of the right vocal cord paresis felt to be likely secondary to extubation.
A repeat video swallow on [**3-12**] demonstrated significantly improved oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability with no evidence of aspiration.
His diet was advanced to ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
Recommendations also included small bites with swallowing twice with a chin tuck, alternating between 1 bite and 1 sip of nectar thick liquid, as well as the patient remaining seated upright for 30 minutes after meals.
Physical therapy followed the patient throughout this hospital course for chest PT and overall strength conditioning to improve overall endurance and maximize function.
Given persistent lower extremity edema, pitting edema of 2+ up to the knees despite IV Lasix to 120 mg t.i.d., Diamox was initiated at 250 mg p.o.
Conclusion demonstrate patent hepatic portal veins and inferior vena cava.
There was patent hepatic artery with good systolic upstroke.
No peri transplant fluid collections were noted.
He did receive 1 bag of platelets and a HIT antibody was sent off.
daily in the form of 10 ml     of liquid Bactrim.
End stage liver disease secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis.
Vocal cord paresis, aspiration risk.
Glucose intolerance.
Recurrent left pleural effusion hydrothorax.
Renal insufficiency related to Prograf.
