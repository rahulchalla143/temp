Past Medical History: Past onc history: -Biclonal multiple myeloma: history of IgA and IgG multiple myeloma, who was originally treated with thalidomide and Decadron before moving to an autologous stem-cell transplant in 10/[**2189**].
He has been doing well since transplant, with his main complaint being some peripheral neuropathy in both his upper and lower extremities that began while on thalidomide.
In [**3-/2192**], IgG was noted to be mildly increased, but no therapy was recommended at that time.
IgG is again slightly elevated from previously today and SPEP/IFE were sent.

No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
No evidence of aortic dissection or central/segmental pulmonary embolism 2.
No focal fluid collections or abscess.
Soft tissue thickening and stranding within the lower anterior neck adjacent to tracheostomy site suggesting underlying cellulitis with possible early phlegmon.
Slight bowing of the posterior membrane involving the distal trachea and the left mainstem bronchus likely related to underlying tracheobrochomalacia.
Stable appearance to slightly dilated fluid-filled esophagus suggestive of underlying dysmotility.
CT CHEST ([**11-15**]): As compared to the previous examination from [**2193-11-10**], there is a newly occurred bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent atelectasis and newly appeared middle lobe opacities suggestive of either infection or pneumonia.
No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis or epidural abscess.
No evidence of cauda equina compression or distal spinal cord compression near the conus.
Degenerative changes as seen previously with severe left foraminal narrowing at L4-5 secondary to disc protrusion and scoliosis with deformity of the exiting left L4 nerve root.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 M with h/o MM s/p transplant, recent prolonged hospitalization for ruptured aortic aneurysm presentes with neck cellulitis at site of prior trach.
Blood cultures were positive for Pneumococcus.
By [**11-13**], erythema and tenderness was essentially resolved.
** He will complete a seven day course from date of discharge of levoquin + flagyl for pneumococcal cellulitis and bacteremia in the setting of aspiration.
PNEUMOCOCCAL BACTEREMIA: Blood cultures from [**11-10**] grew pneumococcus in [**5-3**] bottles.
Shortly afterwards, he was found to have tachycardia with HR in the 130s, desating to the 80s on room air, with O2 sat up to low 90s on NRB.
EKG showed sinus tach.
CXR showed right basilar consolidation and right pleural effusion.
There, a CT-scan showed b/l pleural effusions and R middle lobe consolidation consistant with possible aspiration PNA.
Over the evening of [**11-15**], the patient became hypotensive (SBP 70's) and diaphoretic.
Given humoral immunodeficiency from multiple myeloma in the setting of active infection, IVIG was given on [**11-16**].
CHEST PAIN: On [**11-18**], he complained of some right-sided chest pain with arm motion, unlike anything he had with aortic dissection.
A chest x-ray showed no evidence of effusion and resolving pneumonia under the area of tenderness.
This pain was felt to be musculoskelital.
He was evaluated by Cardiac surgery who said there were no signs or symptoms that would be concerning for an aortic aneurysm problem, but that a [**Name (NI) 55037**] would be necessary to rule it out.
BACK PAIN : Developed back pain on morning of [**11-13**].
Exam revealed tenderness in left pelvic bone.
MRI on [**11-13**] showed no abscess, and chonic narrowing of the L4 root foramin.
His hip pain resolved over a few days and he was without pain on discharge.
HYPONATREMIA: He had hypovolemic hyponatremia in the ED that resolved overnight with 4 L IVF.
LEFT SHOULDER PAIN: He had pain on admission that appeared musculoskeletal by exam, with tenderness over L trapezius muscle.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Pain improved with resolving cellulitis.
Evidence of worsening anemia.
IgG was found to be elevated but not as high as in the past.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: CELLULITIS PNEUMOCOCCAL BACTEREMIA ASPIRATION PNEUMONITIS BACK PAIN HYPONATREMIA LEFT SHOULDER PAIN ELEVATED INR MULTIPLE MYELOMA HYPERTENSION   Discharge Condition: Stable, cellulitis resolved, pain free.
You also had Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria in your blood, that may have been related to this cellulitis.
You had a transient episode of shortness of breath that was likely related to stomach acid going into the lung.
