ROS positive for cough productive of green phlegm, and chronic chest pain, abdominal (suprapubic), and rectal pain, which are all unchanged.
Past Medical History: 1. prostate ca s/p XRT [**2119**] 2. bladder ca, papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade (dx in  [**2133-3-20**]), nonmetastatic (negative cystoscopy [**8-24**])  -most recent cystoscopy and bladder resection in [**2138-7-20**] 3. lumbar fracture L5 -- w/multiple steroid injections, previously on chronic opioid therapy 4.
COPD on [**1-22**] L of home O2 (PFTs [**12-27**]: FVC 89% predicted, FEV1 82% predicted and FEV1/FVC 93% predicted) 5.
PUD with GIB in [**2120**] 6. hx of rheumatic fever 7. hx of CVA 8. s/p appendectomy 9. s/p lap chole in [**2122**] 10. chronic LE edema 11. tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacer [**39**].

15. stage III chronic kidney disease 16.
Melanoma, s/p removal  Social History: Patient is currently at [**Hospital 169**] Center with the help of a caretaker, [**Name (NI) 3065**].
COR: Irregularly irregular rhythm.
LUNGS: Diffuse rhonchi and coarse upper airway sounds.
Normoactive bowel sounds and non-tender, without rebound or guarding.
GU: Foley catheter in place, urethral meatus without ulceration.
Pertinent Results: CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS [**2139-2-3**]: Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright position using frontal AP and left lateral projection.
Moderate cardiac enlargement and elongation of generally widened thoracic aorta as before.
Already on examination of [**1-24**], the patient had bilateral plate atelectasis but no conclusive evidence for pleural effusions.
On [**2-2**], the portable single view examination demonstrated an increased density on the left base obscuring the diaphragmatic contour and suggesting the presence of an increased atelectasis.
Today's AP and lateral chest views again demonstrate the presence of a diffuse density in the left base, most likely representing atelectasis or pneumonic infiltrate.
On the lateral view, one can identify an increased density along a major fissure supporting the assumption that pleural effusion has developed.
The patient's respiratory effort appears limited as the diaphragmatic contours are relatively high and the basal lung vasculature is markedly crowded.
Most likely diagnosis is increasing CHF probably with superimposed left basal atelectasis or infection.
No pneumothorax is present.
Renal ultrasound [**2139-2-2**] IMPRESSION: Mild right pelvicaliectasis and extrarenal pelvis similar to the CT from [**2139-1-25**], but slightly more prominent compared to the US from [**2139-1-2**].
FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There is trace penetration of thin liquids, but no gross aspiration.
IMPRESSION: Trace penetration of thin liquids with no evidence of aspiration.
**FINAL REPORT [**2139-2-5**]**    Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2139-2-5**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2139-2-3**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital **] HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: we found an infiltrate on CXR and fever to 102 F. He had several hospitalizations for the same diagnosis and was treated during last admission with vancomycin and zosyn x 12 days.
There was concern for ongoing aspiration.
However on a bedside and video swallow examination there was no clear evidence of aspiration.
The patient was treated with IV vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia and PICC line placed in interventional radiology on [**2-6**].
This is because of very frequent admissions back to back during the last several months without improvement in the quality of life and the presence of several advanced diseases including recurrent bladder cancer, advanced CKD and COPD, dementia and parkinsons that limit life expectancy (see below).
ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: His baseline creatinine is about 2.3.
BLADDER AND PROSTATE CANCER: Has had ongoing hematuria which cleared to dark yellow urine upon discharge.
C DIFF COLITIS: He had no active diarrhea and his treatment dose of oral vancomycin was continued while on other antibiotics but should be tapered by 1 dose per day on a weekly basis (3 week taper) following his completion of vanc/cefepime on [**2-12**].
However, during this admission, he developed progressive abdominal distention and tympany.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: We continued amiodarone and beta blocker.
Coumadin was previously discontinued because of bleeding complications (the most recent being transfusion dependent severe hematuria with resulting R kidney obstruction likely from hematoma and blood clots).
DELIRIUM/DEMENTIA: with waxing and weaning mental status  HEALTH CARE PROXY/GOALS OF CARE: We had several discussions with his [**Month/Year (2) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 96246**] (Phone: [**0-0-**] Cell: [**0-0-**] as he was his HCP) regarding goal of care and hospice.
Both strongly agreed regarding hospice care, comfort measures and no rehospitalizations.
