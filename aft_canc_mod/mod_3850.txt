The patient's imaging was most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma; however, pathology of the bile duct was nondiagnostic on the first biopsy and the second biopsy had shown dysplasia and likely carcinoma.
She did report some mild right-sided abdominal pain at the site of her percutaneous drains.
ERCP-induced pancreatitis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  She was alert and oriented times three, in no acute distress.
There was no jaundice.
Lungs:  Crackles at the left base.
Extremities:  There was 1+ pitting edema.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient with presumed cholangiocarcinoma and history of cholangitis being treated with antibiotics for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] in her bile.
The patient reports no fevers since discharge.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient had reported no respiratory distress on admission; however, on the day of intended discharge on [**2134-3-31**], the patient developed sudden onset of acute shortness of breath while showering prior to discharge.
The patient's oxygen saturations dropped and the patient was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolus.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for thrombectomy and required intubation for severe respiratory distress.
At that time, it was found that the right pulmonary artery was occluded in the superior portion as well as the inferior portion.
CARDIAC:  On the morning of [**2134-3-31**], the patient had a massive pulmonary embolus with resulting cardiogenic shock.
However, on the morning of [**2134-4-1**], it became evident that the patient not only had shock liver but acute renal failure in the setting of decreased blood pressures on the prior day.
They were aware of the heart failure and subsequent shock liver and acute renal failure.
The approximate cause of death was cardiac arrest due to pulmonary embolism in the setting of cholangiocarcinoma.
