Admission Date:  [**2149-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-5-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-8-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: radiofrequency ablation hypertension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: radiofrequency ablation [**2149-5-7**]  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is a pleasant 80yoF with a history of carcinoid s/p ilial resection and now radio-frequency ablation of a known liver metastasis, depression, OSA, hypothyroidism, breast cancer s/p resection/radiation, who is admitted to the ICU following her liver met RFA with hypertension to the 240s/160s and hypoxia.
Her presentation began with chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomitting in the early in the early [**2137**] for which she was frequently hospitalized.
Following surgery, the patient had almost complete resolution of her symptoms.
However, she continued to have mild diarrhea in the form of one to two episodes a day and this frequency slowly increased over the years.
She developed sweating and flushing.
An abdominal CT in [**9-/2148**] showed a 2cm solitary liver lesion suspicious for a met, and it enhanced on an octreotide scan in [**10/2148**] that otherwise showed no other metastatic burden.
Biopsy around that time showed metastatic carcinoid.
She did have a hospitalization for hypertensive urgency and thereafter began octreotide depot injections.
Due to incomplete control over her symptoms over the following months, she was referred for selective management of the liver mass with RFA.
Post-procedure, she was noted to have increasingly labile blood pressures with a peak of 240/160.
She developed a new oxygen requirement, saturating in the low nineties on 4LNC.
She has no lingering pain from her procedure.
No headaches or confusion.
Denying current chest pain or pressure, no shortness of breath.
No hematuria, dysuria.
- Carcinoid as above - Early stage breast cancer noted on screening mammogram treated with resection and radiation.
Pathology confirmed Stage I grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma with papillary features but without angiolymphatic invasion.
Reexcision for close margins showed no evidence of residual cancer.
[**2137-12-21**] CT showed a 1.2 cm partially solid nodule in the right lower lobe, stable compared to CT [**2147-6-7**].
CT [**2148-2-26**] showed a 6 mm right lower lobe nodule diminished in size and c/w with inflammation.
- Arthritis/DJD - Asthma - History of O2 desaturation (to 87%) with activity.
- Sleep apnea.
- Hypothyroidism since the age of 36.
- Sjogren's disease - unspecified "[**Last Name **] problem" followed by cardiology - hemochromatosis carrier .
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 8071**] is an 80 year old woman who neuroendocrine tumor of the ileum with positive lymph nodes found on laparotomy in [**2140**] after a prolonged course of abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.
Following surgery her symptoms improved but she continued to have mild diarrhea.
Concurrent with slowly progressive diarrhea, the patient also reports flushing and sweating which increased significantly over the past few years.
CT [**2148-9-25**] showed a new 2 cm solitary liver enhancing lesion suspicious for metastasis (CT [**2-13**] to r/o aortic aneurysm normal by report).
Octreotide scan at the time demonstrated only the hepatic lesion and biopsy of the liver lesion [**2148-10-8**], demonstrated metastatic carcinoid.
In fall [**2147**] she also had a hypertensive urgency requiring hospitalization.
We found her Chromogranin A to be elevated at 17 (normal 1.5 to 15) and started her on short acting octreotide and increased her long acting octreotide to 40mg qmonth as of [**2149-3-21**].
Admission on [**2141-1-12**], for which the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy with laparotomy and resection of 60 cm of her ileum in the setting of recurrent partial small bowel obstruction.
In the mid to terminal ileum, there were two areas of carcinomatous involvement of the small intestine extending into the bowel from the mesentery.
There was a 3-cm diameter node within the small intestinal mesentery.
There were smaller firm shotty lymph nodes along the superior mesenteric artery, but it was not clear that these were involved with carcinoma.
Because of the possibility that this represented carcinoid, gross resection of all tumor was performed by performing a resection of the small intestine and the associated mesentery removing approximately 50 to 60 cm of the ileum.
Pathology from the above laparotomy confirmed carcinoid tumor in the ileum.
The proximal and distal resected margins were negative for tumor, [**4-12**] lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoid tumor.
Biopsies were obtained including a biopsy of the rectosigmoid [**Year (4 digits) 499**] that was consistent with a hyperplastic polyp.
On [**2147-2-13**], the patient underwent a biopsy of a hep positive right lower lobe lesion under CT guidance.
This revealed mild airflow limitation on [**Year (4 digits) 11149**] with no significant improvement post bronchodilator administration.
There was moderate impairment in diffusion capacity.
On [**2148-10-9**], the patient underwent a left liver fine needle aspirate that was notable for tumor cells consistent with carcinoid tumor.
On [**2148-10-23**], the patient underwent an octreotide scan that was notable for a small focus of increased tracer uptake in the anterior aspect of the left liver lobe.
No other abnormal foci were seen in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
- Bladder surgery.
- Cholecystectomy.
- TAH-BSO.
- Lumbar disc repair laminectomy.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: crackles appreciated at the bases but no wheezes auscultated CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 3/6 SEM at the right second ICS without radiation.

No immediate post-procedural complications.
Unchanged persistent moderate-to-severe right-sided hydronephrosis seen on prior exams with delayed enhancement of the right kidney related to the underlying obstruction.
No interval change to two additional small hypoattenuating subcentimeter hepatic lesions within segment VII and segment VII/VIII dating back to [**9-25**] [**2147**] CT exam.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 8071**] is an 80yoF with carcinoid, depression, OSA, breast cancer history, asthma, hypothyroidism who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] following RFA of a hepatic carcinoid met due to hypertension and hypoxia.
# HYPERTENSION: Labile blood pressue with significant hypertension is common in carcinoid- the so-called "carcinoid crisis" that can be precipitated by palpation, anesthesia, chemotherapy, or occur spontaneously.
Her hypertension is most likely caused by release of a host of neuroendocrine vasoactive mediators released from these tumors, through possible mechanical stimulation during RFA or through the anesthesia induction process.
# METASTATIC CARCINOID:  Now status post radio frequency ablation of the hepatic met for symptoms despite octreotide.
# HYPOXIA: Developed decreased sats prior to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, though improved to the mid-90s on 3L prior to discharge.
She does have a baseline oxygen requirement with activity and a poorly-described diagnosis of chronic lung disease.
# CONFUSION: She has poor short term memory and is at times has poor attention.
She received a CT head on [**2149-5-8**] which was negative for acute hemorrhage.
Her additional medical problems were treated with her home medications without complication.
