developed SOB on excertion several days ago, but was concerned when he noticed hematemasis yesterday.
He presented to clinic but had an acute decompensation going up stairs with extreme SOB and was sent to ED.
It is associated with mild substernal chest pain, but denies radiation.
The pain persisted and he returned to the [**Location (un) 86**] area.
An MRI revealed abnormal bone marrow signal, but no space-occupying lesion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40508**] performed a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, which revealed a hypercellular marrow for the age.
There was evidence of trilineage dysplasia.
Increased numbers of monocytes with a left-shifted hematopoiesis.
Megakaryocytes were present but with atypical forms.
On CT scan, he was noted to have an enlarged spleen.
His pain in his low back has continued.
ECG demonstrated NSR with a LBBB, (no old for comparison).
He had a CXR with bilateral opacities c/w PNA vs. CHF.
ROS: He notes progressive pain in both lower extremities.
He denies any fevers or night sweats.
HTN Gout CAD - s/p CABG in [**2161**] s/p appendectomy [**2162**]  Social History: He has a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking, stopped approximately 15 years ago.
Family History: There is no family history of any underlying hematological disorders.
Physical Exam: 96.6  149/63  69   94% O2 Sats on 4L NC Gen: A 71-year-old man in no acute distress, oriented x3 HEENT: Clear OP, MMM, Sclerae is anicteric, no oral lesions.
No gingival hypertrophy NECK: Supple, No JVD, No cervical, supraclavicular, or occipital adenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**]; Well-healed midline sternotomy scar LUNGS: Decreased BS and scattered ronchi LLL and RLL with LML bronchial breath sounds, No W/R/C, No egophany ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No ascites, no inguinal lymph  adenopathy, no testicular masses.
2+ DP pulses BL; Trace ankle edema.
Gait assessment deferred PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant  Pertinent Results: CXR [**11-25**]: COMPARISONS:  There are no prior studies available for comparison.
There are multiple median sternotomy wires at the midline and multiple small clips overlying the left heart border and midline.
Bilateral patchy opacities with sparing of the apices and prominent pulmonary vessels favor pulmonary edema.
However, there is a rounded area of lucency seen in the right middle lobe area that could represent underlying cavitary pneumonia.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
The patchy opacities obscure the left costophrenic angle and a left pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded.
IMPRESSION:  Given underlying cardiac history, CHF is favored.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded on this examination.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 71M with MDS referred from clinic with exertional dyspnea, hypoxia to the 80s, found to have PNA vs. CHF on CXR.
Hypoxia:  On CXR, there was a question of pulmonary edema given rapid interval improvement, however he clinically did not have signs of CHF.
Thus, his hypoxia was thought to be secondary to community acquired pneumonia.
Induced sputum culture grew gram negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs.
