No change versus prior.
[**2105-6-11**] SMALL BOWEL ENTEROSCOPY: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a localized pattern, suggestive of Barrett's Esophagus was found.
One polyp in the body was ulcerated with stigmata of recent bleeding.
A single pedunculated polyp with stigmata of recent bleeding was found in the proximal bulb.
There was no blood seen to mid jejunum.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 94500**] is an 83 year-old male with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with INR 1.9, CAD on ASA, DM type 2, with prior GI bleeding without a clear source identified, admitted to the ICU with a 1-day history of maroon stools with Hct drop.
1) GI bleed: As noted above, an NG lavage performed in the ED was negative for blood, but limited by lack of bilious return.
GI was consulted, and a push enteroscopy was performed on [**2105-6-11**], remarkable for Barrett's esophagus, and polyps in the antrum and stomach body, one of which was ulcerated with stigmata of recent bleeding.
A duodenal polyp was also seen prolapsing through the pylorus, also with stigmata of recent bleeding.
It is likely that the ulcerated polyps accounted for his GI bleeding, although the presentation with maroon-colored stools and BRBPR with lack of hemodynamic instability is somewhat unusual.
2) CAD: His EKG in the ED was at baseline, and he was ruled out with serial cardiac biomarkers.
3) Atrial fibrillation: As noted above, Coumadin was held at the time of admission.
He remained in atrial fibrillation, with occasional rapid ventricular response to the 110s.
4) DM type 2: He was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale in the ICU for glycemic control.
5) Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: His creatinine on admission was 1.5, up from a baseline of 1.2 in 04/[**2104**].
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged home in stable condition.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your PCP or return to the hospital if you develop recurrent bleeding from your rectum, or if you develop shortness of breath, or chest pain.
If you have difficulties with filling the prescription, then you can take Omeprazole twice daily.
