Patient was just discharged 5 days prior with the pain being moderately controlled with PO dilaudid and fentanyl patch.
He has been more sleepy since starting his pain meds.
Three days ago, patient had serous drainage from back incision site evaluated by Radiation Oncology.
No signs of infection and basic dressings were recommended.
Oncologic History: Initial presentation prior to tissue diagnosis of core needle biopsy of back lesion on [**4-8**] showed poorly differentited squamous lung cancer in setting of LLL necrotic lung mass.
Had 6 weeks of jaw pain and 6 months history of back mass initially thought to be sebaceous cyst.
Started to develop constitutional symptoms of night sweats and weight loss complicated by jaw pain since mid [**3-24**].
However there is no definitive evidence of squamous or glandular differentiation.
This immunophenotype confirms the epithelial nature of this tumor (i.e., carcinoma) and excludes malignant melanoma.
Given the histologic appearance and immunophenotype, this could represent metastatic carcinoma of lung origin.

CXR [**2192-4-28**] COMPARISON: Most recent chest radiograph on [**2192-4-21**].
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Interval worsening of left pleural effusion, now moderate to large, which is associated with atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
RESULTS OF PLEURAL FLUID TO BE FOLLOWED UP BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 69 year old male with metastatic poorly differentiated squamous lung ca with multiple mets, s/p XRT painful R temporal jaw met, s/p bronch with argon laser coagulation [**4-23**] for hemopytsis, starting carboplatin/taxol C1D1 [**4-25**], s/p theraputic thoracentesis for probable malignant effusion.
# Large left plerual effusion - Probably from maligant etiology, had theraputic thoracentesis done by interventional radiology.
There was no evidence of empyema.
This appears to be the primary cause of increased O2 requirement.
# Poorly differentiated metastatic squamous lung cancer - He has metastasis to the adrenals, brain and soft tissue (jaw & back).
Carboplatin/taxol C1D1 [**4-25**] complicated by mild nausea.
Patient was initially begun on neupogen given anticipated high risk of severe neutropenia but held after 2-3 days when WBC was greater than 80,000.
# Jaw pain - Secondary to Metastatic R temporal leison - from poorly differentiated squamous lung ca s/p local XRT.
No new neurologic symptoms.
# Resolved hemoptysis - s/p bronch with argon laser coagulation [**4-23**] .
# Hyperkalemia - patient asymptomatic and refused kayexalte.
Cortisol levels high, no sign of adrenal insuffiency.
# Depression - Patient evaluated by psych, placed on citalopram.
Patient became hyponatremic and switched to mitrazipine .
# s/p fall - no head trauma, no neurologic symptoms, negative head CT .
No ASA since large necrotic lung mass and scant hemoptysis.
# Anemia: Normocytic, stable, likely of chronic disease in setting of malignancy.

Disp:*QS ML(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: s/p theraputic left thoracentesis for probable malignant effusion Poorly differentiated metastatic squamous lung cancer Resolved hemoptysis secondary to lung necrosis Hyperkalemia Depression .
Secondary: hyperlipidemia coronary artery disease anemia s/p fall with no significant head trauma while inpatient   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for pain control and coughing blood.
You developed a large leftsided lung plerual effusion of probable malignant etiology and had a thoracentesis on [**5-1**] which helped to reduce your new oxygen requirement.
Please contact your oncologist of your shortness of [**Month/Year (2) 1440**] worsens as this could from a reaccumulation of your plerual effusion or if you become conspitated or your pain control is inadequate.
