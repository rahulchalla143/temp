HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 56 year old female who is diagnosed with a gastric mass by computerized tomography scan that was performed on [**2151-2-18**].
This mass was highly suspicious for an infiltrative neoplasm of the fundus and body of the stomach/linitis plastica.
Endoscopy was then performed, which revealed a gastric mass involving the gastric cardia, fundus and body and entering into the distal esophagus just above the esophagogastric junction.
Biopsies were performed and this demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a component of signet ring cells.
She presents to the [**Hospital6 649**] for resection of her stomach and placement of a feeding jejunostomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Polycystic kidney disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Lower mandible resection for malocclusion at age 18.
There were no immediate postoperative complications.
Her pain was well controlled with an epidural, and the patient had an nasogastric tube that was placed to continuous level of suction.
An upper gastrointestinal series was performed, which demonstrated a patent gastrointestinal tract with no leakage.
The patient had some episodes of vomiting that evening.
Because of the upper gastrointestinal results from earlier that day, it was believed that her nausea and vomiting was due to postoperative ileus.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27538**] would also stop by to see the patient and wrote that he would follow up with the final pathology results and have the patient follow up as an outpatient following her discharge for further evaluation or adjuvant chemoradiation.
The patient continues to have nausea and vomiting and progressively is having increasing abdominal pain and on [**2151-3-26**], the patient began to appear ill.  A small bowel perforation was suspected, and a Foley catheter was placed, intravenous fluids were initiated, broad spectrum antibiotics were started and the patient was planned to go to the Operating Room for exploration.
In the Operating Room, it was found that there was a kink distal to the gastrojejunostomy which resulted in perforation of the gastrojejunostomy.
Following the operation, the patient appeared to develop a septic picture.
The patient was continued with volume resuscitation, serial arterial blood gases were obtained, and a chest x-ray was performed.
Later that evening, the patient developed respiratory distress with tachypnea and shallow breathing and shortness of breath.
Aggressive fluid resuscitation was required for a hypotensive episode.
She was started on Levophed and given albumin to help with her low blood pressure.
She also developed a reaction to heparin, with decrease in platelet count down to 49 from 93.
She became positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
A repeat abdominal computerized tomography scan showed persistent dilated loops of small bowel that was performed on [**2151-4-4**].
There was no apparent perforation.
At this time, blood cultures that were taken on [**4-3**], returned with gram positive cocci and pairs in chains.
There was a small lacunar infarct that was visualized on head computerized tomography scan.
The patient had some slight left-sided weakness, but it was felt that this left-sided weakness was her baseline.
It was felt that her mental status was mostly secondary to metabolic encephalopathy.
A follow up computerized tomography scan was performed, which found an abdominal abscess that was anterior to the rectum.
She was sent to Interventional Radiology for drainage of the rectal abscess in a prone position.
During this procedure she had desaturations with a slow recovery.
Because she started to have increasing oxygen requirements it was best that she be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for intubation and further management.
There were no further events in the Intensive Care Unit and she was finally extubated on [**2151-4-18**].
Her pelvic abscess also revealed Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and her Linezolid and Fluconazole were continued.
Neurologically the patient began to improve in terms of her mental status.
A bedside swallowing evaluation was performed, and the patient did not demonstrate any aspiration potential.
The Neurology Service felt positive about her neurologic prognosis.
4 hours prn for bladder spasms.
