Admission Date: [**2147-1-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2147-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-4-7**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old female with a history of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21344**] Lindau disease and metastatic renal cell carcinoma being admitted for cycle one, week one high dose IL2 therapy.
Her oncologic history began in [**2130**], when she was diagnosed with bilateral renal masses consistent with renal cell carcinoma and underwent bilateral partial nephrectomy.
She did well until [**2139-9-9**], when disease progression was noted in her right kidney and a liver lesion was noted.
Needle biopsy of the liver lesion confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
She underwent resection of an isolated thyroid met in [**2141-12-9**], and had radiofrequency ablation of renal masses in [**2142**], [**2143**], and [**2144**].
Recent scans revealed progression of disease in her liver and an enlarging mass in her left kidney.
She was planned for high dose IL2, but developed pyelonephritis/urosepsis and was hospitalized from [**2146-12-14**], through [**2146-12-19**], for intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics.
Recent urosepsis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General reveals a well appearing middle age female in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
The neck is supple, no jugular venous distention.
Lymph nodes - No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, positive bowel sounds, rounded, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.
During this week, she received thirteen of fourteen doses with dose number four held related to hypotension and hypoxia.
Side effects initially included chills improved with Demerol and nausea improved with Ativan.
She developed an erythematous pruritic skin rash treated with topical lotion, as well as diarrhea improved with Lomotil.
On treatment day number five, she developed mild dyspnea on exertion with oxygen saturation in the high 90s in room air and examination consistent with small pleural effusions with dullness at bilateral bases without crackles.
She received dose number thirteen of IL2 at approximately 3:00 p.m. and three hours later became hypotensive requiring the initiation of Dopamine.
She developed crackles on her pulmonary examination and was subjectively short of breath and 20 mg of intravenous Lasix was given.
She developed mild chest pain and underwent electrocardiogram revealing probable supraventricular tachycardia.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she was fluid resuscitated and cultured to rule out infection as a source of her hypotension.
She was maintained on  Dopamine and Neo- Synephrine for blood pressure support.
She initially remained in supraventricular tachycardia but ruled out for myocardial infarction by CK and troponin.
There was mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Laboratory abnormalities during this week included creatinine rise to 2.6, improved to 2.1 on the day of discharge; hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 3.8, improved to 1.7 on the day of discharge; metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate low at 16, improved to 25 on the day of discharge; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase with peak alkaline phosphatase [**Location (un) 1131**] of 383 on the day of discharge.
She had no transaminitis during her hospitalization.
She developed mild INR elevation on [**2147-1-7**], improved the next day to 1.1 after Vitamin K administration, and she had no evidence of myocarditis based on enzymes or echocardiogram.
She was mildly anemic with a hemoglobin of 12.1 and hematocrit of 35.1 without need for packed red blood cell transfusion.
She was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count low of 27,000 on the day prior to discharge which had improved to 36,000 on the day of discharge.
She had no evidence of bleeding throughout her hospitalization.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to notify us for persistent fever, chills or fluid retention.
nausea, anxiety or for    sleep.
</DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS> Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post high dose IL2 therapy complicated by hypotension and hypoxia.
