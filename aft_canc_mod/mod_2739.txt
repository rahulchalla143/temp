Admission Date:  [**2156-4-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-5-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**] Chief Complaint: Elevated intracranial pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VP shunt   History of Present Illness: This is a 46 y/o M with h/o metastatic melanoma s/p C&D, radiation and on [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] study of DTIC plus or minus sorafenib who was admitted electively for a VPS placement ([**2156-4-20**]).
Procedure went well without complications.
About 48 hours later, patient decompensated and the CT scan showed multiple areas of hemorrahge thorughout the brain.
After Family meeting with Hem onc, neurosurgery and Neurology it was decided that given his youth they will press ahead with radiation if his clinical status and CT scans were stable.
It was felt to be a result of peak edema from his bleed on [**4-21**].
[**5-5**] Resection of inguinal mass that showed evidence of melanoma and positive lymph nodes and extracapillary extention.
Bronchoscopy with biopsy + for metastatic melanoma on lung nodules.
[**8-4**]: Started Chemotherapy with clinical trial C1 DTIC +/- SORAFENIB [**1-/2156**]: visual disturbances.
MRI right occipital small lesion.
cytology confirmed presence of malignant cell.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Melanoma as above Left shoulder surgery Arthoscopic surgery on left knee  Social History: From past d/c summary: "He has a bachelor's degree.
HEENT: No JVD, no lymphadenopathy, scalp wound covered- clean PEERLA CV: RRR, s1-s2 normal, tachycardic.
Surgical wound clean Extremities: No peripheral edema, distal pulses strong bilaterally.
Face symmetric, no dysarthria.
While this subarachnoid hemorrhage likely relates to that procedure, hemorrhage related to underlying leptomeningeal disease in this melanoma patient cannot be entirely excluded.
[**2156-4-22**] CT head: IMPRESSION:  Interval development of several parenchymal hemorrhages compared to two days previous.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage unchanged.
There is interval development of mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
[**4-23**], [**4-24**], [**4-26**], [**4-27**], [**5-1**] CT head Scans: No significant interval change.
The lungs demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of aspiration or evolving pneumonia.
[**2156-4-28**] ECHO: Mild left ventricular cavity enlargement with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
No evidence of stones, gallbladder wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**4-24**], [**4-25**], [**4-26**], [**4-30**], [**5-1**], [**5-2**], [**5-4**] CXR: evidence of atalectasis, no consolidations.
No CT evidence of osseous or epidural metastatic disease.
Please refer to the follow-up lumbar spine MRI for evaluation of intrathecal disease.
L5/S1: Degenerative disk disease and endplate changes, with disk bulge, endplate and facet joint osteophytes resulting in neural foraminal stenosis and possible exiting nerve root impingement.
Possible free fluid in the pelvis.
Diffuse thickening of the cauda equina from L1 through S1 levels which enhances following gadolinium administration and is highly suggestive of metastatic disease involving the entire cauda equina.
There is also thickening of the nerve roots individually seen within the thecal sac.
Degenerative changes seen at L5-S1 level with small central disc protrusion and moderate stenosis of the foramina.
Large degenerative Schmorl's node involving the superior endplate of L1.
Correlation with gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine would be recommended.
The findings are consistent with diffuse metastatic disease most likely from metastatic melanoma involving the cauda equina.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 61665**] was admitted [**2156-4-11**] for elective placement of VP shunt to relieve elevated intracranial pressure caused by metastatic melanoma and it's treatment.
Following placement of the shunt, he developed multiple areas of intracranial hemorrhage with resulting elevation of his intracranial pressure.
Given concern for possible shunt infection he was treated empirically with vancomycin.
He was intubated for airway protection, and his antibiotic coverage broadened with flagyl as he was thought to be septic, with possible aspiration pneumonia.
Throughout this he was pan-cultured multiple times, with no clear source of infection identified.
He did have sparse growth of coag + staph on one sputum culture, but no other positive cultures.
He was no longer moving his lower extremities, with no reflexes, and no withdrawal to pain.
He also had diminished rectal tone.
This showed extensive tumor involvement of his entire cauda equina.
The case was discussed with neuro-oncology, oncology, neuro, and it was felt that there was no possible treatment.
He started having increased work of brathing, chest x ray show a new left lower lobe consolidation that was concerning for aspiration.
