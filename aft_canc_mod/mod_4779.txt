[**2137-11-23**] 9:05 am SPUTUM     Site: EXPECTORATED       ACID FAST CULTURE X 3 TIMES.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-11-25**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2137-11-24**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
Multifocal coalescent ground-glass nodules, predominating upper lobes but also present in left lower lobe, raise question of metastatic involvement.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Massive conglomerate aortocaval mass with central areas of necrosis, which compresses the IVC, right common and external iliac veins, and likely also right proximal ureter.
Extensive mediastinal, hilar, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and iliac lymphadenopathy and massive splenomegaly.
Overall picture suggestive of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease.
Mildly prominent common bile duct.
Diffuse gallbladder mural edema, likely related to systemic disease, unlikely due to cholecystitis.
Multiple left renal lesions are incompletely evaluated, including a 12-mm interpolar left renal lesion (3, 301), which could be further characterized by ultrasound.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Although there is no CT evidence of large intracranial mass, MRI with gadolinium is superior in evaluation of such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated.
[**11-15**] LENI- No evidence of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
[**11-15**] EKG: ST at 108 bpm, no other acute changes  [**11-18**] Trans thoracic Echo- The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, with resolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on CT [**2137-11-15**].
Nonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminate lesion seen on CT scan [**2137-11-15**], due to limited visualization.
[**12-3**] CXR: The heart size remains normal and no typical configurational abnormalities is seen.
No pneumothorax is seen.
In particular the basal bilateral densities strongly suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions as seen on [**2137-11-21**], have now practically cleared completely, as both lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free with the patient in upright position.
These consist of lateral located hazy parenchymal densities close to the pleural space at the level of the third and fourth rib.
On the left side these parenchymal densities are also in peripheral location but somewhat higher up and overlying the second and third ribs including the corresponding interspace.
In comparison with the preceding single view examination, it is possible that these parenchymal densities have progressed slightly and thus, further followup chest examinations in this patient with history of lymphoma is recommended.
Widespread peripheral consolidations which are new or increasing.
These are not entirely specific, but the striking peripheral character of consolidations is very suggestive of an inflammator etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia, either of which could be associated with a drug reaction.
New mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertain significance.
Extrinsic compression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this study is a possible, though somewhat unusual, possibility.
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
MR (if feasible) would be more sensitive than CT for detection of metastatic lesions.
No acute intracranial process.
The abnormalities demonstrated on prior chest radiograph and chest CT appears to be grossly unchanged except for may be minimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe and right upper superficial area as well as interval development of minimal amount of pleural effusion on the right.
The finding continues to be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broad including eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, drug reaction, and less likely infection.
PATHOLOGY: [**11-17**] Bone marrow biopsy- MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, MOST CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.
[**11-17**] R axillary lymph node biopsy- DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL LYMPHOMA, HIGH GRADE.
[**11-17**] Immunophenotyping Flow Cytometry: Immunophenotypic finding consistent with involvement by a kappa-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

# Lymphoma- Patient was initially admitted to the medical floor for expedited evaluation of presumed lymhoproliferative disorder in the setting of CTA which showed bulky lymphadenopathy and aortocaval large conglomerate mass with compression of IVC and right common iliac vein.
Initial labs in the ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO3 of 15 and a lactate of 7.9.
He was started on allopurinol and IVF due to concern for TLS.
A heme-onc consult was called and an axillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c/w aggressive lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Patient was noted to have increased work of breathing with ABG showing worsening acidosis 7.32/19/111 and lactate of 11.4.
A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern for worsening lactic acidosis, patient was transferred to the ICU.
Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs. infection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for pneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below).
He received [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were monitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on admission.
He received rasburicase for persistently elevated uric acid and new renal failure (creatinine 1.3 from 1.0) with improvement of his symptoms.
He became fluid overloaded and was diuresed with lasix.
He was called out to the floor where he received a round of RCHOP with good effect and no subsequent tumor lysis.
He had some mucositis which was managed with pain medications and mouth care.
# Pneumonia- Patient had chest CT with ground-glass parenchymal opacity, suggestive of pneumonia.
Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia, but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic and appeared well.
# Rash- Patient developed an erythematous papular eruption on his back as well as a well demarcated erythematous plaque on his lower L back.
Triamcinolone was applied topically to the plaque with gradual improvement.
His weight increased 10 lbs over several days secondary to fluid retention.
Headache: Patient complained of mild intermittent R retro-orbital pain without associated visual changes, diploplia, or floaters.
Was seen by opthalmology who attributed his eye symptoms to dry eyes.
CT head w/ and w/o contrast was negative for bleeds and metastatic disease.
# Shingles- Patient complained of continued post herpetic neuralgia related to his shingles episode six months earlier.
His pain was managed with lidocaine patches and oxycodone/oxycontin.

You had a CT scan of your chest, lymph node and bone marrow biopsies which showed that you have diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
You were also diagnosed with a pneumonia for which you were treated with antibiotics.
Please also weigh yourself daily and call Dr.[**Name (NI) 14047**] office if your weight increases.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - START taking filgrastim (injections) as directed for your blood counts - START taking fluconazole for prevention of infection - START taking acyclovir for prevention of infection - START taking ranitidine for your stomach - START taking oxycontin for your pain; please take colace and senna as needed while taking this medication to prevent constipation; do not drive while taking oxycontin as it is sedating - START taking lasix for the fluid in your legs - START taking potassium as directed while taking lasix - you may use gelclair as needed for mucositis pain in your mouth  You make continue taking your other medications as you were previously.
