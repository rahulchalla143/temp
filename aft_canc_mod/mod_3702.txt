Admission Date:  [**2112-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-5-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Patient had a repeat bronchoscopy on [**2112-7-11**], performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], to observe the patency of the stent previously placed in his left mainstem bronchus for invasive esophageal cancer.
Report stated that the stent was approximately 50% obstructed by tumor/granulation tissue, and showed proximal migration of the stent into the trachea, jailing the right mainstem bronchus.
No significant change was noted from previuos bronchoscopy on [**2112-6-20**].
Removal of the stent was not recommended due to tumor ingrowth, and balloon dilation of the stent would be considered if the patient continued to have problems with airway obstruction.
History of Present Illness: 78M w/ esophageal CA (s/p resection and stent placement), prostate CA, and GERD presenting from an OSH after admission for respiratory failure.
He was in his USOH until [**7-7**] when he became acutely dyspneic.
He failed extubation twice between [**7-7**] -> [**7-10**] because of secretions but was extubated successfully prior to transfer on [**7-10**].
At [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent repeat broncoscopy showing a proximal migration of his stent w/ near-complete obstruction of the R mainstem bronchus.
No intervention was attempted given the fact that there little change from his previous bronch in [**6-16**] and significant tumor ingrowth over the stent.
Past Medical History: - Esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy [**4-12**] with recurrence [**2110**], currently undergoing chemotherapy - s/p left mainstem bronchus stenting [**2-17**] [**2-12**] tumor invasion, complicated by cardiogenic shock, bronch in [**6-16**] revealed some proximal stent migration and nonobstructive (50-60% of lumen) tumor growth at the distal end of the stent - Prostate CA s/p XRT (dx ~10 years ago), currently on Casodex and Zoladex - Throat cancer in [**2096**] s/p radiation and surgery - GERD   Social History: The patient [**Doctor Last Name **] with family ( wife and grand-daughter).
Family History: Patient had a brother who died of esophageal cancer at age 65.

[**7-10**] UPRIGHT AP CHEST: A left central catheter has been placed via the subclavian approach, with the tip overlying the left side of the superior mediastinum and aorta.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There is a left pleural effusion, moderate and left lower lobe atelectasis.
There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
Left effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**7-13**] Chest CT.
Progression of mediastinal metastatic disease, including lymphadenopathy and mediastinal and left hilar mass.
Progression of narrowing of left segmental bronchi distal to left mainstem bronchial stent.
Mixed interval behavior of pulmonary metastases, with individual nodules appearing stable to equivocally increased, but with increased left upper lobe opacity, possibly suggestive of lymphangitic spread of tumor.
[**7-13**] ECG Sinus rhythm with ventricular and atrial premature beats.
No significant change compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-7-10**]   Brief Hospital Course: At [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent repeat broncoscopy showing a proximal migration of his stent w/ near-complete obstruction of the R mainstem bronchus.
No intervention was attempted given the fact that there little change from his previous bronch in [**6-16**] and significant tumor ingrowth over the stent.
He developed tachycardia up to 150's on [**7-13**], unclear whether sinus or not.
He was completely asymptomatic, without chest pain or hypotension.
His metoprolol was increased to 37.5mg PO tid, and he did not have any further runs of VT on [**7-15**].
The patient's breathing and cough continued to be a problem, and were both relieved with nebulizers, saline mask, mucinex, guafenesin with codeine.
