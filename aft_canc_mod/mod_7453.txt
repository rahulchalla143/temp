He initially attributed discomfort to GI upset, but increasingly aware of fatigue and Dyspnea on exertion with minor activities such as walking to his mailbox since [**Month (only) **].
While at Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 24862**] office he experienced chest heaviness, associated with diaphoresis and presyncopal symptoms.
The office EKG was noted for new T wave inversions V3-V6.
He reports being pain free since admission.

The patient had a vasovagal reaction with hypotension and bradycardia during attempts to advance the 5 French JL4 catheter into the proximal brachiocephalic artery through a tortuous loop.
Dopamine 10 mcg/kg/min was required to get the systolic blood pressure back to 120 mm Hg, but this was accompanied by tachycardia and chest pain.
The dopamine was weaned off, with stable SBP but continued chest pain and tachycardia.
Metoprolol 2.5 mg IV was given with improvement of heart rate int the 90s and gradual improvement of his chest pain (after a brief period of IV TNG infusion).
The LAD was heavily calcified throughout with an ostial 60% stenosis, a calcified mid vessel complex bifurcation lesion involving D1 with 90% in left anterior descending and 80% in first diagonal branch.
There was moderate to severe diffuse disease in branching first diagonal with occlusion of a medial distal pole.
The left circumflex had focal heavy calcification with a tortuous moderate high OM1 and a mid AV groove circumflex stenosis of 60% after OM2.
The distal AV groove circumflex had a subtotal vs. total occlusion after the tortuous LPL2.
The OM2 was totally occluded and filled late by left-to-left collaterals.
The RCA had proximal severe disease with proximal to mid vessel occlusion, seen both while on dopamine and subsequently (arguing against vasopressor induced spasm).
[**2188-12-17**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis 40-59%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
[**2188-12-24**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
