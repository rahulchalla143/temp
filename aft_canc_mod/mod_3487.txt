He presented in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year with 9-10 month history of dysphagia and hematemesis.
Work-up at that time revealed a distal esophageal tumor.
Biopsy and staging work-up diagnosed it to be stage IIA esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Reports that, since the chemotherapy, he has not been tolerating his tubefeeds and has been having nausea and vomitting, at times reddish-brown.
In the ED, patient was found to be guaiac positive, and patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation given concern of GI bleed as hematocrit was found to be 23 on presentation.

---------- ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2115-8-29**] 9:23 AM Gas-distended loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels in upper abdomen possibly secondary to partial high small bowel obstruction but previously administered contrast via jejunostomy tube has all proceeded into the colon.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old male with coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and stage IIA esophageal tumor currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy, now with nausea and vomiting and GI bleed.
Given a history of coronary artery disease and hematocrit of 23, patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells, responding appropriately to a hematocrit of 41.
NG lavage and endoscopy was deferred as tube could not be passed and history of esophageal cancer with concern of exacerbating hematemesis.
Nausea/vomiting:  Intractable nausea and vomiting was thought to be initiating event for hematemesis leading to present hospitalization, and was thought to be due to a combination of chemotherapy and possible distal obstruction.
Radiographic studies were implemented to evaluate for distal obstruction leading to vomiting, and it was noted that J-tube placed during last admission was in place and operational.
Complete patency of distal small bowel was unclear as small bowel follow through revealed contrast distally to colon, however, there was still radiographic evidence for partial obstruction distal to placement of J tube.
Nonetheless, following transfer from ICU and adequate control of nausea and vomiting, tube feeds were reinitiated without complication.
Patient only complained of mild abdominal discomfort and mild nausea, but had no vomiting.
Thoracic surgery was initially consulted with the concern that hematemesis was due to esophageal cancer.
However, hematemesis resolved following control of vomiting, and radiation therapy was continued during this hospitalization with good effect.
At the time of discharge, patient was tolerating tube feeds at goal and was adequately anticoagulated with no signs or symptoms of GI bleed or nausea/vomiting.
Reglan 5 mg PO Q6H PRN   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 5065**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal Cancer Partial Small bowel obstruction Upper gastrointestinal bleed   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: 1) Continue taking your medications as directed with the following changes: - Coumadin 2.5mg at bedtime - Atenolol 12.5mg once a day - Lansoprazole 30mg oral suspension twice a day - - - (Break open capsule and mix in water and give through Jtube if not able to take pills by mouth) - Synthroid 100mcg once a day - Simvastatin 10mg once a day  __(Nausea medications)__ - Dolasetron 100mg once a day (for nausea) - Metoclopramide 10mg every 6hours (for nausea) - Promethazine 25mg every 6 hours as needed for nausea  - Colace 100mg (10cc) twice a day (as needed for constipation) - Bisacodyl 10mg by Jtube/orally/rectally once a day (as needed for constipation)  Take medications by mouth if tolerated.
2) Patient's last admission was due to hematemesis secondary to vomiting from overaggressive tube feeds.
2) If nausea does not resolve, stop tube feeds for an hour to 24 hours until nausea resolves.
