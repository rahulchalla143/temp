Repeat CT showed enlarged mass encasing hepatic artery and SMA.

He then underwent exploratory laparotomy where no perforation was identified and a feeding G-J tube and [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 53961**] [**Doctor Last Name **] drain were placed.
Post-operatively the patient remained intubated for low O2 saturations and was admitted to the SICU.
He was empiracally treated with Levofloxacin/Flagyl and his pain was well-controlled.
His O2 sats were intermittantly low in the 80s-90s on nasal cannula, consistent with his severe COPD.
