Admission Date:  [**2175-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-7-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Fentanyl / Flagyl / Cefepime / Valium / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: fevers, night sweats, increasing abdominal girth  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Selective splenic artery embolization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 34 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with an uncomplicated PMH who is transferred from OSH on [**8-20**] for massive splenomegally and suspicion of splenic hemorrhage in the setting of pancytopenia.
Patient states that for the past 5-6 weeks, he has been having symptoms of intermittent night sweat with subjective fevers.
He also notes early satiety, decreased appetite associated with a loss of approximately 20lbs over the past 4 months.
He has noted some subjective sense of increased abdominal girth associated with some mild LUQ tenderness.
That evening, he presented experienced lightheadedness, increased abdominal pain, and near syncope.
He was further evaluated with a CT Abd showing massive splenomegaly with question of masses, ascites with possible hemorrhage in the pelvis, and several small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] due to concern for acute leukemia vs. other myeloproliferative process.
He was evaluated by surgery and subsequently transferred to the TSICU for close monitoring due to concern for possible splenic rupture.
Family History: No history of hematologic malignancies.
HEENT:  + icteric sclerae (much improved from prior), no thrush, mucous membranes moist.
Lungs: CTA bilaterally CV: RRR, no m/r/g Abd:  abdomen  massively distended, but less so than before.
They reviewed his bone marrow bx results from [**Hospital3 **] and felt his diagnosis was consistent with Hairy Cell leukemia.
He tolerated the procedure well although had some post-procedure pain which was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.
Throughout his hospitalization, he had intermittent abdominal pain which occasionally worsened in severity.
At that time he had an abd CT which ruled out an intraperitoneal bleed.
He had a total of 3 abdominal CT scans while he was on the BMT service all of which demonstrated lessening intraperitoneal fluid and either stable or less splenomegaly.
(Of note, one CT demonstrated possible clot in one of his iliac veins, and so he had negative lower extremity dopplers at that time.)
In terms of his leukemia, his pancytopenia improved after the cladribine, and he required little to no transfusion support by the end of his hospitalization.
He had numerous negative blood and urine cultures.
He did have some greenish nasal d/c and sinus pressure, and a sinus CT demonstrated minimal mucosal thickening.
He developed a blackish lesion below his nostrils which was positive for HSV, and so he was treated with a 7-day course of acyclovir.
He was placed on a number of different courses of antibiotics while he was here, including vancomycin (which he had due to an erythematous PICC site - PICC was later pulled, cx tip was neg), cefepime (for neutropenic fevers), and flagyl (he developed an erythematous macular eruption over his entire torso after one dose of flagyl, which was immediately discontinued).
It was also felt that his fevers could have been due to either his disease or his chemo, and so he was given Prednisone 20 mg po bid.
Neuro:  The night of [**8-28**], his PCA was switched from Dilaudid to Fentanyl and he became delirious.
He had an abdominal and head CT at that time (given his massively splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia) which ruled out bleeds in his abdominen and head.
A week prior to d/c, he developed an area of numbness over his right lateral thigh.
He had no other neurological deficits.
He was evaluated by Neurology, who felt that it was likely a superficial nerve injury.
Initially it was more cholestatic-appearing, with an elevated direct and indirect bilirubin (his bilirubin peaked at 23.)
The source of this was unclear and he had a negative [**Name (NI) 5283**] u/s for any biliary ductal dilatation.
He had a positive EBV IgG but negative EBV IgM, and a negative monospot.
They felt it was likely secondary to drug-induced liver injury although they were also worried about hepatic infiltration from his malignancy, and he underwent an ultrasound guided liver biopsy.
This revealed: Moderate hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis.
No bile duct proliferation or damage is seen, Focal mild portal mononuclear cell inflammation, with minimal lobular inflammation and rare apoptotic hepatocytes, no evidence of involvement by lymphoproliferative neoplasm, no viral cytopathic changes or granulomas are seen, and no features of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease seen.
Essentially it was a bland biopsy felt by Hepatology to be c/w drug-induced injury.
Pulmonary:  He required O2 by nasal cannula initially, with no evidence on pneumonia on CXR.
This was felt to be due to atelectasis [**1-2**] his massive splenomegaly, and eventually resolved with incentive spirometry.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] (if during office hours) or the page operator (at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**], ask for the Bone Marrow Transplant Physician on [**Name9 (PRE) **]) if you develop a fever >100.5, productive cough, nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or weakness.
