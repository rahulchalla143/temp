He was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer in [**2153-10-11**] and has received cyberknife for brain lesions, carboplatin, pemetrexed, and PF-[**Telephone/Fax (3) 74902**] as part of a clinical trial.
He discontinued this trial [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on [**2155-8-6**] because of clinical (worsening dyspena) and radiolographic evidence of cancer progression.
He underwent right thoracentesis on [**2155-8-1**] with removal of 800cc of cloudy yellow fluid found to be a malignant effusion.
He had some improvement in his dyspnea as a response but notes worsening over the past few days, even after starting home O2 (2-4L) on [**2155-8-7**].
He also notes having subjective fevers and chills and a nonproductive cough since starting Alimta.
He had a CXR and a chest CTA that was neg for PE but concerning for worsened pleural effusions bilaterally, lymphangetic spread of tumor, and a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
He became increasingly dyspneic and hypoxic in the ED, satting 87% on ra, and was placed on a NRB (satting in the 90s and then bipap with significant improvement.
He has no complaints.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
variant 1) nonsmall cell lung cancer  diagnosed in [**2153-10-11**], with known metastases to brain and liver 2.
Recurrence of thrombosis with portal vein thrombosis in [**2155-1-12**] and SVC syndrome.
Now on low molecular weight heparin.
Radiation necrosis of the right frontal lobe lesion in [**Month (only) 359**] [**2153**], status post surgical resection.
Status post 9 cycles of PF-[**Telephone/Fax (3) 74902**] mg [**Hospital1 **] as part of clinical trial DFHCC 06-068.
Started in [**2154-11-29**] (attained partial response) and had RECIST-based progression in [**2155-6-5**].
Family History: Mother had arthritis, osteoporosis, and aortic insufficiency.
Father had COPD, bronchitis, enlarged prostate, and malaria.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 97.9 128/60 97 28 100% on bipap General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: decreased bs on left, scattered rhonchi, wheezing at LUL CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no lesions, no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, slightly increased in size since the prior study.
Increase in encasement of the right-sided airways by soft tissue density, likely representing tumor, with areas of increased consolidation in the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia, although increased tumor burden cannot be excluded.
Diffuse bronchovascular and septal thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Stable diffuse bony metastases and hepatic metastases.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2155-8-13**]: IMPRESSION: Relatively stable radiographic examination with slight accentuation of the interstitial markings most notably on the right.
There is suspected mild volume overload on the background of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
At least partially loculated left pleural effusion again re-demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer admitted with dyspnea 1 week following right sided thoracentesis for pleural effusion, found to have reaccumulated pleural effusion on x-ray.
Dyspnea was most likely due to fluid reaccumulation and progression of cancer, however vanc/zosyn was started for a 7 day course for possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
Pt will likely need pleurex catheter on the right if fluid reaccumulates again.
He was to follow up with IP within 1 week for evaluation for pleurodesis and to see his oncologist on [**2155-8-28**].
# Non-small cell lung cancer: has known metastases to brain and liver, recent drainage of a malignant right pleural effusion, ?worsening lymphangitic spread on chest CT, and initiation of new chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the setting of progression.
Unfortunately, his disease has progressed despite chemotherapy and his prognosis is quite poor with only weeks to live.
# Right upper extremity DVT: Has been on lovenox at home.
# Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: stable, no active issues.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleeplessness.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 2-4 Puffs Inhalation Q4H PRN () as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] oxygen company  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Pleural effusion 2) NSCLC 3) Community acquired pneumonia .
Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.
Your symptoms were thought to be related to worsening of your lung cancer as well as a pneumonia.
Both of these interventions improved your symptoms and your fevers resolved.
Please return to the emergency room if you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, high fevers, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
