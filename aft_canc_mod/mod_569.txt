No primary disease seen.
Mild atelectasis/CHF.
[**12-2**]-Head CT- no acute hemorrhage.
There is more edema in the right cerebral white matter, in the region of the previous enhancing lesions, perhaps related to cytotoxic effects from the chemotherapy.
The enhancing periventricular CNS lymphoma lesions have resolved.
As seen on the CT of [**12-2**], there is minimal linear blood breakdown products along the biopsy tract.
Despite the increase in T2 hyperintense vasogenic edema, the amount of mass effect is similar to the prior study.
There is no evidence of an infarct on the diffusion-weighted images.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old HIV negative man who presented with mental status changes and was found on head MRI to have a right parietal/occipital biopsy-confirmed.
His course was complicated by an ileus, hypoxia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, as well and a small GI bleed.
Right Parietal/Occipital Mass/Mental status changes: Outpatient workup for mental status changes included a normal head CT, a normal carotid U/S, and an unchanged ECG.
Head MRI on [**2195-11-24**] showed a T2 signal abnormality and associated enhancement within the white matter and brain stem.
Lumbar puncture on [**11-25**] showed white blood cells but no malignant cells on cytology.
A few days after admission, his neuro exam showed increased disorientation and appearance of left-sided neglect indicative of progression of disease.
Additionally, pt was so agitated at times and pulling at things that he had to have a 1:1 sitter.
A staging torso CT w/contrast on [**11-25**] was negative for masses or lymphadenopathy.
Post op, pt had increased confusion and disorientation with low grade temperatures.
It is a possibly that pt had a seizure and was post-ictal.
MRI that day showed that periventricular CNS lymphoma lesions have resolved and increased edema in that area.
Presumably, the methotrexate seemed to have worked well.
Colonic Ileus: Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 14668**] had abdominal distention and discomfort, constipation, and vomited once on [**12-1**] and once [**12-2**].
This abdominal distention and discomfort was despite taking Colace, senna, and lactulose.
Colonic ileus slowly resolved over the next few days.
GI Bleed: NGT had Gastroccult positive material.
Hypoxia: On [**2195-12-2**], the patient was unable to oxygenate >90% on room air and developed a requirement for 3L per NC.
Chest X-ray was suggestive of pulmonary edema; however, the patient's atelectasis and low lung volumes secondary to colonic ileus were contributing to decreased oxygenation.
At the time, his cardiac function/echo data was not available and he had a known history of abnormal ECG, atrial fibrillation, and patent foramen ovale.
He had no prior episodes of CHF in past history.
CTA on [**2195-12-2**] was negative for PE and showed atelectasis.
Differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, low lung volumes secondary to an expanding abdomen, and infection.
Infection was quite low on the differential given that pt has no evidence of infection, no cough, or fever.
However, there was a question of pt aspirating fecalith material from NGT.
Pt was able to be on room air within a few days without any major intervention.
Urine lytes showed low Urine sodium and high Osms, suggesting that pt was intravascularly depleted.
Possibilities included post-op fever, infection with GI source, ileus amongst others.
Vancomycin was discontinued s/p LP in ICU on [**2195-12-3**] that showed no signs of meningeal infection or involvement.
Zosyn was discontinued on [**2195-12-6**] as pt was afebrile and there was no source of infection.
Pt was afebrile since then.
ROMI: On [**2195-11-30**], the patient had HTN urgency w/strain pattern on ECG and ST depressions <1mm in the anterolateral leads.
He had known abnormal baseline ECG with poor R wave progression and TWA leads III & AVF suggesting underlying CAD.
His hypertensive urgency was thought related to pain due to developing ileus.
On the floor before pt was transferred to the MICU, pt had hypertensive urgencies and then was on hydralazine q6 hours.
After pt came back to the floor, his BP started to slowly rise without medication.
Additionally, pt's neuro oncologist did not want pt to be on coumadin and the levels could fluctuate secondary to methotrexate infusion.
