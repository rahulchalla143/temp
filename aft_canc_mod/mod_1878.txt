= = = = = = ================================================================  Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 y/o lady with h/o NSCLC (large cell with neuroendocrine features) with liver involvement and carcinoid syndrome, who presented with diarrhea, flushing, palpitations, vomiting and lethargy in the setting of infection as well as carcinoid syndrome due to not injecting Octreotide at home.
she was treated for C. diff colitis and yeast UTI.
Carcinoid syndrome: Patient was admitted with severe carcinoid symptoms but without blood pressure lability.
At the time of discharge, she had no more diarrhea, flushing, palpitations, vomiting or lethargy.
The patient's watery stools did not completely resolve with Octreotide.
Though C. diff toxin was negative x3, there was a high index of suspicion due to fevers and leukocytosis, so C. diff PCR was sent which was positive.
Altered Mental Status / Seizure: multifactorial in etiology.
On the third day of admission, the patient complained of chest pain (see below) and she received Morphine & Ativan.
She became progressively lethargic.
She developed tonic-clonic movements of both arms concerning for seizure and therafter became more lethargic consistent with post-ictal state.
Patient loaded with keppra and started on keppra 750mg IV BID for seizure prophylaxis.
She did have an elevation in WBC; concern for meningitis prompted antibiotic coverage with empiric vancomycin, cefepime, ampicillin, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis coverage.
MRI head was negative for any signs of encephalitis as well as any brain mets.
EEG was performed and overall was consistent with toxic-metabolic encephalopathy but there was some localized temporal activity so per Neurology she was kept on Keppra.
After that, she remained alert and oriented x3 for the rest of admission and had no further seizure activity.
This decompensation was likely a result of her underlying illness with superimposed infections (C. diff, UTI) as well as sedating medications.
Tachycardia/Chest pain: Most likely due to carcinoid syndrome.
During the hospital stay she had an episode of left sided chest pain , which she described as different from previous.
No significant EKG changes on admission and pain familiar to pt from the past when she had episodes of tachycardia related to the carcinoid syndrome.
CK was elevated but CKmb and trop remained flat.
Cardiology was consulted and they did not think that there was any evidence of ischemia based on the EKGs and cardiac enzymes an further evaluation was not recommended.
CXR and physical exam reveal no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Acute renal failure: Prerenal state, resolved.
In the setting of diarrhea and vomiting, this was most likely from prerenal state.
Could be due to octreotide.
However, she had a low insulin requirement so insulin was not continued.
She had no polydipsia/polyuria/polyphagia.
LUE Swelling: no DVT.
She has LUE swelling noted near the site of the PICC line so there was concern for a DVT or a superficial vein thrombosis.
She demonstrated understanding about her disease but does not want to make any decisions about code status while her son is still in [**Name (NI) 651**].

You were found to have a gastrointestinal infection, for which you are being treated with antibiotics.
In addition, you have a urinary tract infection.
In addition to these infections, your symptoms are also likely due to your underlying cancer and not being able to take the Octreotide injections that were prescribed.
We treated you with this medication and your symptoms are much improved.
