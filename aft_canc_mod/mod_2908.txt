HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 72-year-old nondiabetic white male status post cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis, occluded right internal carotid artery, status post left carotid endarterectomy, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, pyelonephritis, was found to have a pulsatile abdominal mass on routine physical exam in early [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
Ultrasound showed a 6 x 6.6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm and a left renal mass.
CT scan showed that patient was not a candidate for endovascular repair because of short infrarenal neck.
Occlusion of the left external iliac artery was also seen.
Arteriogram showed a large infrarenal aneurysm extending to the bifurcation, but not into the iliac arteries.
Tight stenosis at the origin of the right profunda was seen.
Left external iliac artery occlusion was seen.
No new onset of claudication.
Status post cerebrovascular accident with residual left arm paralysis.
Cerebrovascular disease, right internal artery occlusion; status post left carotid endarterectomy.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  Baseline creatinine equals 1.8.
Pyelonephritis in [**2139-1-10**].
Left upper lobe kidney mass seen on CT scan in [**2139-1-10**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Extremities: Feet are equally warm, no ischemic changes, no lesions.
Urinalysis negative.
Chest x-ray on [**2139-2-20**] showed no acute pulmonary disease.
No acute ischemic changes.
Stress test on [**2138-5-27**] showed a fixed inferior wall defect with an ejection fraction of 54%.
Persantine thallium study done on [**2139-2-13**] showed normal perfusion with stress and ejection fraction of 53%.
At the end of surgery, the patient had equally warm feet with dopplerable pedal pulses.
However, patient showed respiratory distress in the PACU and required reintubation.
Patient's creatinine became elevated from its baseline of 1.9 up to 3.0 on [**2139-4-9**].
Patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] in the office on [**5-21**] at 10 am for further planning regarding treatment of his likely left renal carcinoma by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Radiology.
