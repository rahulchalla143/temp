HISTORY:  [**Known lastname 10733**] is originally a 560 gram product of a 28 week gestation born to a 41 year old primigravida mother whose pregnancy was complicated by chronic hypertension, oligohydramnios, and notation of IUGR at 25 weeks.
The mother was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] four days prior to delivery and the infant had at that time indications of decelerations and decreased diastolic flow.
Delivery was via cesarean section because of absent diastolic flow and abnormalities of fetal heart monitoring.
HEENT had a bilateral red reflex with nares that were patent and a palate intact.
Skin was without lesions.
The lungs were coarse breath sounds with fair aeration bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm without murmur noted.
The genitalia had a small phallus with chordae; also with hypospadias.
There was a testae in the right inguinal canal.
Due to increasing desaturations and drifts, the patient was started on caffeine on [**3-28**] and remains so as of today.
On [**4-6**], a chest x-ray was obtained due to lack of progress in being able to wean the ventilator.
That chest x-ray showed hazy lung fields with poor expansion likely from distention from below and the baby required a glycerine due to what appeared to be some buildup of stool.
There has never been any murmur and the patient has never had any signs or symptoms of a PDA.
ENDOCRINE:  Due to both intrauterine growth restriction, initial hypotension and hypoglycemia, in addition to small phallus, Endocrine was consulted.
On [**3-10**], there was a question of a mild hydronephrosis but a repeat examination on [**3-11**] due to concern about adequate windows showed that that examination actually was normal.
GENITOURINARY:  There was a question of small phallus which apparently is within the range of normal and hypospadias which Urology is consulted for and will follow-up as an outpatient.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was noted to have hyperbilirubinemia and was started on double phototherapy for a level that was approximately 4.0.
The patient developed metabolic acidosis secondary to presumed kidney losses on day of life 14; this was on [**3-23**], and bicitra was started but was only required temporarily until day of life 20 or approximately six days later, at which time Bicitra has been discontinued.
The patient developed guaiac positive stools on [**4-3**], this was day of life 25.
At that time, the patient did receive a rule out sepsis as well as a KUB and a thorough physical examination.
The patient has had some trace heme positive stools both the night of the 24th and 25th as well as the [**4-6**], however, nursing staff has reported that Mother's milk appears to have some blood in it and we will be asking mother when she visits this evening whether or not she may have some irritation or if she has noticed any bleeding that is mixed with the breast milk.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient did get a rule out sepsis on day of life one due hypoglycemia, hypotension and respiratory distress.
The patient has not had a hearing screen to date and has not had any ophthalmologic examinations.
Respiratory distress syndrome, now evolving chronic lung disease.
Apnea of prematurity.
