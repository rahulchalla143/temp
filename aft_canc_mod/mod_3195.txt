She was found to be in PEA on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and received atropine and epi w/ return of a perfusing rhythm.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was noted to have a 20pt HCT drop w/out obvious source of bleeding other than weakly guaiac positive stools.
ECHO after transfer to the unit showed new wall motion abnormalities whereas a cath in [**2188**] had been normal.
She developed severe CHF and required lasix gtt but had been auto-diuresing prior to call-out and her respiratory status has improved significantly w/ diuresis.
Her pressors were slowly weaned and she was eventually started on an ace-i and bb secondary to her new dx of CHF and low EF.
She was originally started on vanco/zosyn when she developed hypotension [**2-18**] concerns of sepsis but these were d/c'ed after her BP improved and all her cultures remained negative.
Total abdominal hysterectomy for menorrhagia 9.
S/p benign breast mass excisionx 2   Social History: Denied any tobacco, alcohol, or intravenous drug abuse.
Family History: The patient's father's side has had multiple MIs and coronary artery disease.
No FH cancers.
Physical Exam: Overweight woman lying in bed in NAD, raspy voice, - rashes HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, MMM, O/P clear Neck: - LAD Lungs: CTA b/l CV: RRR, S1/S2 intact, 2/6 SEM at the USB Abd: S/NT/ND, +BS Ext: B/L knee surgical sites C/D/I w/out sign of infection, + LE edema Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact, AAO x3  Pertinent Results: [**2189-11-16**] 07:00PM   CK(CPK)-49 [**2189-11-16**] 07:00PM   CK-MB-2 [**2189-11-16**] 01:28PM   CK(CPK)-36 [**2189-11-16**] 01:28PM   CK-MB-2 cTropnT-0.03*  TTE [**2189-11-20**] The left atrium is dilated.
The  left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejectoion fraction 30 percent)  secondeary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall,  and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no  ventricular septal defect.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve  chordae.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Stable soft tissue mass in the left pelvis, which may represent a duplication cyst, enlarged lymph node, or left ovary/mass as stated on the previous examinations.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Ultrasound R upper extremity [**2189-11-26**] IMPRESSION: No DVT.
Thrombus within the distal right cephalic vein.
There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
No ascites is seen.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
No evidence of ascites.
There is post surgical air within the soft tissues.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 66 y/o f with CMML, AVR, DM2, HTN admitted for bilateral total knee replacements who developed shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure on post-op day 1 .
Was evaluated extensively and pan scanned but no etiology of bleeding found.
A STAT echo on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] showed a possible new wall motion abnormality (after being coded) but no effusion, no evidence of tamponade, no changes in AVR, and an EF of 35-40% Repeat echo [**11-25**] showed persistant EF of 35%.
Cardiology was consulted and they felt that her decreased LV systolic dysfunction was post-arrest given her clean coronaries in [**2188**] in cath for pre-op for her AVR.
Hct drop -- No clear source.
An NG lavage was negative though she was trace guaiac positive (though no melena/hematochezia).
However, later that night, she developed increased work of breathing and was unable to clear her secretions so pt was reintubated.
Extubated [**11-30**] after a prolonged wean and difficulty getting off the vent.
She was thought to have difficult extubation due to volume overload and improved once she was diuresed with a lasix gtt.
New wall motion abnormalities following cardiac arrest on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Had chest pain [**11-24**] with unchanged ECG.
Pain worse with palpation, c/w musculoskeletal injury.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended lasix 40 mg PO QD for fluid overload.
Knees - Pt received her bilateral knee replacement for her DJD and was followed by ortho throughout her course.
she did well with PT and her wound remained c/d/i.
Stage 2-3 ulcer R heel - Patient developed ulcer from CPM machine as part of her rehab for her s/p TKR, which remained uninfected.
