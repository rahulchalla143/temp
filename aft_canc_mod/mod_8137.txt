No focal consolidation is noted.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
No acute osseous findings are seen.
IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy opacities in both lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.
#CT ABD/PELVIS [**2185-1-21**] STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.
FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: In the visualized portion of the chest, calcified atherosclerotic disease is seen involving the aortic valve and coronary arteries.
A small pericardial effusion is also seen (2; 4).
Bilateral simple pleural effusions are seen, moderate on the right and small on the left, with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
Small hiatal hernia is present.
The kidneys show no evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi.
The small and large intestine show no signs of obstruction.
Oral contrast has progressed just into the proximal right colon.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free air.
Small amount of free fluid is seen around the liver (2; 33).
Diffuse anasarca is seen.
There is no pericolonic fat stranding but again trace free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
Diffuse anasarca is present.
There is loss of intervertebral disc height at L3-L4 with vacuum phenomenon within the intervertebral disc.
There are no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Diffuse anasarca with trace ascites and bilateral small to moderate sized pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No definite evidence of colitis.
Apparent wall thickening of the proximal right colon is likely due to underdistention and mixing with oral contrast.
No pericolonic stranding is present.
#CXR [**2185-1-23**] HISTORY: 80-year-old woman with new vomiting, evaluate for aspiration.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-21**], 2:11 a.m.:  Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement are new and although heart size is normal and pleural effusions are small if any, the interstitial abnormality in the lungs is most likely mild edema.
#CXR [**2185-1-27**] (prelim): no acute process.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year-old female with chronic anemia, prior MRSA UTI, and recent admission for RLL pneumonia admitted to MICU [**2185-1-21**] with [**Last Name (un) **], hypotension, leukocytosis/bandemia in context of recent nausea, poor PO intake, diarrhea, UTI.
Initially also received vancomycin PO given concern for colitis based on symptoms and finding of bowel wall thickening on CT abdomen/pelvis on preliminary read; symptoms resolved, C. difficile toxin was negative, and final read changed to no evidence of colitis.
Creatinine (baseline 0.6) improved from 4.0 to 3.0 with fluid resuscitation; etiology suspected to be ATN and component of prerenal azotemia.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] persistent agitation/delirium, psychiatry was consulted and recommend haloperidol 0.5mg PO Q4-6HR PRN agitation and 0.5mg PO HS.
Patient was afebrile, off fluids and hemodynamically stable on transfer to the floor.
Her foley was discontinued, and a repeat UA was obtained, which was negative except for trace leukocytes and an additional urine culture was sent.
Acute Kidney Injury.
The presented initially with a Cr of 4.0, very [**Known lastname **] UOP and urinary sediment that was consistent with ATN.
The etiology of the ATN was thought to be secondary to hypotension (sepsis, ongoing diarrhea, decreased PO intake) as well as nephrotoxic tubular injury (Vancomycin level of 40 in rehab).
The patient had been experiencing 2-3 days of non-bloody diarrhea during the initial onset of her symptoms in rehab.
Etiology thought to represent mixture of personality style, background of dementia with superimposed delirium in setting of hypotension and sepsis.
