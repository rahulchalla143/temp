The patient originally presented to an outside hospital on [**4-4**], complaining of progressive shortness of breath over the previous few days in the setting of several months or progressive fatigue and a 14 pound weight loss.
She was found to be 91% on room air with a large left pleural effusion.
She underwent thoracentesis on [**4-4**] with 800 cc of bloody fluid removed.
She then had a chest CT scan which showed multiple pleural based nodules with a large left pleural effusion and numerous bony lytic lesions.
She also had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed additional bony lesions.
Two days post thoracentesis the patient again developed respiratory distress with evidence of reaccumulation of her pleural effusion.
She underwent repeat thoracentesis with 100 cc of bloody exudative fluid removed.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with a large left sided pleural exudative effusion concerning for a malignancy.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for elective VATS and pleurodesis.
The patient was visualized to have a gross tumor.
She underwent a biopsy of her left anterior chest wall which was sent for pathological analysis and showed an undifferentiated carcinoma.
Her immediate postoperative course was complicated by tachypnea and hypoxia following administration of 2 mg of morphine.
She remained stable until the evening following the procedure when she was noted to be somnolent with decreased responsiveness, responding only to painful stimuli.
The patient's blood gas was consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Her respiratory status improved quickly following intubation and was thought to be presumably due to narcosis following benzodiazepine exposure.
A repeat chest x-ray did show reaccumulation of her pleural effusions.
On [**4-14**], the patient complained of increasing subjective dyspnea although her saturations remained stable and she had no evidence of hypoxia or hypercarbia on her blood gases.
Chest x-ray did show interval increases in her pleural effusions.
The subsequent blood gases showed no abnormality.
MALIGNANT PLEURAL EFFUSIONS:  The patient was admitted from the outside hospital with malignant pleural effusions.
This was consistent with an undifferentiated carcinoma.
Stains were negative for either lymphoma or mesothelioma but the original primary tumor was unable to be further clarified.
The patient was evaluated by the Oncology Service and was thought to have a malignant tumor from either her lung with metastases, or perhaps from another primary spot.
Should her mental status deteriorate, it is recommended that a head CT scan be obtained to look for central nervous system metastases, in which case she might benefit from palliative steroids.
HYPERCALCEMIA:  The patient is admitted with elevated calcium, presumably due to her primary malignancy.
Her calcium normalized after this and it is recommended that her serum calcium levels be monitored and she be observed for any evidence of hypocalcemia.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient initially was hypotensive following intubation with respiratory failure presumably due to narcotic administration.
Etiology of her hypertension was thought to be due to hypovolemia and over diuresis.
There was no evidence of any cardiac, septic, pulmonary, or adrenal contribution to her hypotension.
She was afebrile and demonstrated no evidence of hypotension.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA;  The patient with increased edema in her left arm and also minimal erythema.
Her arm was carefully monitored with plans to start antibiotics should she develop any evidence of cellulitis.
In addition, she may require her intravenous to be changed in the next few days to minimize any risk of infection.
However, in the setting of her pleural effusions and respiratory distress, the decision was made to monitor her sodium for now.
Unfortunately, there were technical difficulty in placing feeding tubes.
