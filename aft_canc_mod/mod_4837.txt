No drainable fluid collection.
Apparent diffuse gastric fold thickening, which may represent gastritis given the recent history of upper GI bleed.
Ascending and proximal transverse colonic thickening, which is nonspecific.
Diffuse mesenteric stranding and small pelvic free fluid.
No liver abscess identified.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
--------- Culture data: [**5-3**], [**5-4**] and [**5-5**]: Bile and blood culures : Lactobacillus and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Multiple Blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 85826**] are No growth .
OSH blood cultures from [**Hospital1 **] showed gram positive rods in [**2-5**] bottles and [**3-5**] growing yeast.
The final cultures showed LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES, [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) [**Female First Name (un) **].
# Upper GI bleed: The patient was initially started on an octreotide and PPI drip due hematemesis.
The patient had no further episodes of hematemesis.
This was performed on [**5-8**] and showed Esophagitis and healed ulcer at GE junction, Gastritis and marked thickening of stomach folds and Duodenitis.
He was continued on the protonix [**Hospital1 **]  # Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure which resolved with fluid resusitation and blood products.
# Biliary abscess: The patient has a known right upper quadrant abscess and difficulty taking in PO food.
Surgery consulted on the patient and recommended a repeat CT scan which showed no definite evidence of gallbladder-to-colon fistula.
He was subsequently found on percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography to have a fistula between the common bile duct and the right colon.
He also has had partial gastric outlet obstruction, presumably related to the inflammatory phlegmon in the right upper quadrant and PUD.
At the time of surgery, he was found to have extensive adhesions and absence of planes in the right upper quadrant.
The cholecystostomy tube was in what appeared to be some remnant of gallbladder tissue although frozen section demonstrated no gallbladder in the initial specimen but additional tissue was taken from what was thought to be the gallbladder fossa.
The right colon and hepatic flexure were densely involved in this inflammatory phlegmon in the right upper quadrant.
The stomach was markedly enlarged and thickened consistent with the outlet obstruction.
TPN was stopped on POD 6, and the patient was tolerating regular diet without Nausea or vomiting.
He regained bowel function and was ambulating without difficulty.
It also remains for the workup of the renal mass seen on CTs during the hospitalization.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Bacteremia/Fungemia biliary colonic fistula cholangitis Renal mass DMII   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Continue to empty drains and record ouptuts.
