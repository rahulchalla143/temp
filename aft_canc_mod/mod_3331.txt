Reason for MICU admission: severe septic shock and multiple organ failure.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation.
History of Present Illness: 58F with metastatic colon cancer, recent admission for N/V/abd pain with subsequent establishment of hospice, presenting to ED with confusion x few days day and shortness of breath.
She had sudden onset of shortness of breath today, no chest pain; persistent but unchanged abdominal pain.
No recent diarrhea, constipation, N/V.
Bilateral coarse breath sounds.
Lab abnls included lactate 10, severe metabolic acidosis (bicarb 8, pH 7.24), WBCs 18.8 with 17% bands, elevated coags with low plts, ARF, hyperkalemia to 7.4, transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia.
Difficulty laying flat (dyspneic but not de-satting).
Denies pain or discomfort.
Past Medical History: Metastatic colon cancer (brain/liver) -[**2109-5-14**], colonoscopy due to anemia w/ fungating, friable and infiltration mass (mets), at ascending colon w/ partial obs: adenocarcinoma.
-[**2109-5-23**], CCT, ACT: multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, 7 mm.
Scattering smaller ones concern for mets; metastatic foci within the liver also.
4.5 x 5 cm left hepatic lobe mets, 4.5 x 2.9 cm & 4 cm x 3 cm right hepatic lobe mets -[**6-10**] right palliative hemicolectomy -[**2109-7-17**] FOLFOX started -[**2109-8-28**] Avastin added -[**2110-1-1**] Oxaloplatin held due to neuropathy HTN baseline Cr 0.9-1.2 celiac disease OA - spine, right wrist peripheral neuropathy from chemotherapy recurrent vaginal abscesses Asthma Uterine fibroids Iron deficiency anemia s/p transfusion during hospitalization in [**11-12**] VIN lactose intolerance hyponatremia hypoalbuminemia with LE edema Pul HTN anterior wall abdominal hernia postmenopausal bleeding s/p negative endometrial bx's   Social History: Never smoked, never drank.
Family History: Mother and father with CAD and CVA, sister with DM2.
HEENT: Sclera mildly icteric, MM slightly dry Neck: supple, JVD difficult to appreciate, no LAD appreciated.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, distant beneath breath sounds.
no apparently rebound tenderness or guarding.
No clear ascites.
Ext: cool extrems on pressors, no clubbing, cyanosis.
Images: CXR: increased R sided pleural effusion.
Diffuse pulmonary nodules consistent with known metastatic disease.
slightly wide QRS (~100), QTc 470, no peaked T waves.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion  CT Torso: 1.
Limited study without contrast with significant progression of innumerable pulmonary and hepatic metastases with massive enlargement of the liver causing volume loss in the right lower lobe secondary to elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
Moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites with anasarca.
No significant pleural effusion noted.
Chest Xray: There is an endotracheal tube, right-sided central venous catheter, and feeding tube which are unchanged in position.
Diffuse opacities throughout both lungs consistent with patient's extensive pulmonary metastases.
Superimposed consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 58F with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with septic shock and severe metabolic acidosis, ARF, hyperkalemia.
# Hypotension/Septic shock/MODS.
Patient presented with septic shock, Leukocytosis/Bandemia and severe metabolic acidosis and multiple organ dysfunction including pulmonary, cardiac, heme, hepatic, renal failure.
While source of infection was identified patient was covered broadly with Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl, and Vancomycin.
# Metabolic/lactic acidosis.
With severe systemic hypoperfusion and hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
Lactate trended down during hospitalization and acidosis stabilized with stabilization of blood pressure and antibiotic treatment.
No known offending meds.
Hyperkalemia without ECG changes.
Bicarb gtt started and DC'd with resolution of metabolic acidosis.
Patient with increased INR and decreased platelets during admission.
Likely DIC given severity of infection however Fibrinogen stable.
Patient had no active signs of bleeding.
# Transaminitis.
# Hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Evidence of pneumonia on right.
Respiratory distress reportedly acute onset; would be at high risk for PE given malignancy, however given patient's clinical status this was deferred.
# ECG changes.
No clear elevation in JVD, not tachycardic, and sources other than tamponade more likely playing a role in hypotension.
TTE was negative for pericardial effusion.
On [**2-6**] EKG was performed for hyperkalemia which should 1mm ST Elevation in V1-V2 and ST Depression laterally.
Repeat ECG with resolution in the height of ST elevation in V1-V2.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic colon cancer with lethal multiple organ failure.
