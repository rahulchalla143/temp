Admission Date:  [**2164-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16115**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy and altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left internal jugular central line placement  History of Present Illness:  75-year-old male with history of stage IV NSCLC with metastases to his brain and liver s/p craniotomy on gemcitabine/carboplatin, brought in from [**Hospital3 **] for lethargy.
He was noticed to have increasing lethargy today, only able to open his eyes and not speaking at all.
He was previously admitted in mid-[**Month (only) 216**] after an outpatient CT scan of his chest showed a large right lung abscess and a small pulmonary embolism.
Bronchoscopy was performed but no drainage of the abscess was attempted due to perceived high risk of seeding, and he was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics for likely post-obstruction pneumonia complicated by an empyema in the hopes they would keep the infection at bay.
He was discharged on linezolid, cefepime, and metronidazole due to a questionable drug rash from vancomycin.
Cardiology was consulted for tachycardia of multifactorial etiology and he continues on metoprol for rate control.
Gemcitabine/carboplatin was started during this hospitalization with the understanding that he is a borderline candidate, complicated by fatigue, mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, currently C1D20.
Central access was obtained due to difficult access and just in case he gets sicker.
CXR was repeated and showed worsening effusion and consolidation in LLL, with a cavitary mass in upper lung, as well as the known right lung findings.
Though there was some volume overload, he was only given 1L NS.
RUQ was tender on exam with ultrasound with only hepatic masses, no cholecystitis.
CT torso w/contrast was not performed secondary to his renal failure (creatinine of 2.8 from baseline 1.2-1.4)  On arrival to the MICU, he is barely responsive, opening his eyes slowly after awakening from sleep.
Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer in [**2164**] with mets to brain  s/p... ---Status post brain tumor resection from a left temporal tumor on [**2164-6-14**]; ---Status post 2400cGy stereotatic radiotherapy to right frontal and to resection cavity, completed on [**2164-7-13**].
Increased bronchial compression and invasion by right hilar adenopathy, nearly occluding right main bronchus contributing to increased right lung atelectasis and post-obstruction pneumonia.
Increase right pleural effusion.=   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with stage IV NSLC s/p craniotomy and initiation of systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine/carboplatin with recent hospitalization for empyema treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, returning with altered mental status and acute kidney injury.
# Altered mental status/sepsis: thought to represent a recrudescence of his pulmonary infection that could not be optimally treated with drainage.
Since he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, it seems less likely that other sources of infection would be causing this new clinical state (i.e.
It is more likely that these antibiotics are not penetrating his empyema and his new leukocytosis with a small bandemia may be a reaction to this.
He does fulfill SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, tachycardia, and mild hypothermia so we can classify this as sepsis, given our presumed pulmonary source (BPs stable).
Unclear at this time what might be contributing to an elevated lactate, but should consider bowel ischemia in addition to impaired breakdown of lactate due to declining liver function.
Neurosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] about his new SDH and they believed that this was age-appropriate and likely not contributing to this picture.
Uremia should also be considered in his altered mental status.
TSH slightly elevated with borderline low free T4, but CT chest showed worsening lung parenchyma and the decision was made to hold off on further treatments until palliative care and transition to hospice was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Oncology team on transfer.
# Acute kidney injury with anion gap metabolic acidosis: Creatinine has been on the rise, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] records, with last creatinine of 2.2 on the day prior to admission.
AG of 18 on admission due to elevated lactate of 7.2.
Renal failure alone can contribute to the AG metabolic acidosis, so fixing the underlying process will be most helpful here, though the etiology of the lactatemia is unclear.
Based on his declining mental status and poor PO intake, the etiology is most likely pre-renal, especially given the time course and persistent increase over the past few days.
Obstruction ruled out by abdominal ultrasound.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, persistent from prior hospitalization, presumed to be multifactorial from known malignancy, small PE, hypovolemia, and possible infection.
# Small pulmonary embolism:  Not on full anticoagulation due to hemoptysis and risk of bleeding.
Given high risk of recurrent thromboembolic disease, he was continued on prophylaxis.
# Metastatic NSCLC s/p craniotomy and liver involvement:  His adenocarcinoma is quite advanced and chemotherapy was only recently started after left temporal tumor resection and radiation therapy.
His transaminitis and ascites is likely secondary to his hepatic metastases.
Antibiotics were stopped, and symptoms were controlled as needed with intravenous medications.
