History of Present Illness: HPI: 71 y/o female with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation, CAD, St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve replacement, and sclerosing cholangitis admitted from OSH for an ERCP.
At the time of admission to [**Hospital6 28728**] Center, the pt was noted to be very lethargic and mildly confused.
A TEE was done that did not show any vegitations so the gentamycin was discontinued at that time.
An abdominal US at this time was negative for cholycystitis but showed cirrhosis and mild ascities.
There was a question of an intraparenchymal stone on the US.
Pt is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to receive an ERCP to evaluate for strictures given her history of sclerosis cholangitis and positive bacteremia.
No CP or palpiations.
No abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Has not noted any blood in her stools.
H/O paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- This was found when pt went to OSH for elective laminectomy on [**2128-8-24**].
It is unclear if pt has had episodes of atrial fibrillation since her cardioversion.
Depression 6.
H/O acute mitral valve staph aureus endocarditis in the setting of a line sepsis during [**8-/2128**] hospital course.
Pt had a large associated pericardial effusion.
Pt also had posterior annular abscess s/p debridement and patch.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia in [**9-/2128**] 8.
H/O acute renal failure requiring CVVH in 10/[**2127**].
S/P pacemaker palcement for bradycardia and AV block on [**2128-10-28**] 10.
H/O GI bleed secondary to an AVM and/or portal hypertensive gastropathy as seen on EGD and colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in 01/[**2128**].
H/O multiple spinal compression fractures 14.
H/O hepatic encephalopathy 15.
Old left frontal watershed infarct- Likely secondary to hypotension.
Anicteric sclera.
No lesions in the oropharynx.
No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Loud mechanic S2 click that is loudest at the apex.
No carotid bruits.
2) Hypoechoic lesion in segment 2 of the liver is unchanged when compared to the prior study and is concerning.
This could represent cavernous transformation of the portal vein secondary to thrombosis.
5) Edematous gallbladder most likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course: On [**2-17**], patient developed severe diarrhea and leukocytosis.
The pt did not have any symptoms of lightheadedness or abdominal pain.
CT abdomen consistent with colitis.
Notably, she has a recent history of positive blood cultures ([**2-7**]) at an OSH ([**Location (un) 1121**]) for enterococcus bacteremia.
Her hematocrit was followed serially and eventually stabilized, at which point Coumadin was restarted in setting of heparin induced thrombocytopenia and [**Hospital3 9642**] mitral valve replacement.
Liver ultrasound revealed likely intraductal stone and stable hypoechoic lesion.
Due to her history of St. Jude's valve, atrial fibrillation, and also a history of HIT, decision was made to start renally dosed Lepirudin while coumadin was held and INR was reversed.
Lepirudin was chosen over argatroban because of her underlying liver disease.
Lepirudin was re-started 6 hr post-ERCP after discussing the risk of post-procedure bleed and valve thrombosis with the ERCP fellow and a hematology fellow.
Patient was started on ampicillin since the admission and will complete a 14 day course for enteroccal bacteremia.
The source of infection was thought to be from the intraductal stone.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt with 4/4 blood clutures from OSH growing enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin.
TEE at OSH was negative for vegetation.
Abdominal US did not show any cholangitis or cholecystitis.
At this time, pt is afebrile and WBC count was normal at OSH this morning.
As stated above, the source of infection was thought to be from the intraductal stone.
She remained afebrile and WBC remained within normal limit.
Diarrhea diminished over stay, was given oral Vancomycin emperically for C Diff, toxin A neg X 4, Toxin B sent, pending on [**3-4**] - will continue oral vanco emperically until this negative.
[**Name (NI) 31150**] Pt has a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia .
Loperamide HCl 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.

Seek medical attention for fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bleeding from the procedure site, or any other concerning sympoms.
Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4465**], MD Where: LM [**Hospital Unit Name 22399**] Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1983**] Date/Time:[**2129-4-22**] 10:00  You have a mass in your liver that needs close follow-up.
Please see him to further discuss possible evaluation and management of this condition.
