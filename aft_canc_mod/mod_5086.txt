Tunneled hemodialysis line placement [**2163-1-17**]  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid LAD in [**2159**]), sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI, COPD (on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from [**Hospital3 **] in setting of acute pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, oliguric [**Last Name (un) **], and critical left main disease.
She had recently been discharged after treatment of pneumonia (unknown antibiotic course), and while at home in days after discharge, developed progressive dyspnea and possible fever.
She denied sputum production or cough.
She was started on Zpack, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation, and given IV lasix 20mg tid for pulmonary edema.
Lasix was discontinued and renal consult was obtained, who recommended stopping lasix, giving IVF for pre-renal azotemia, and changing levofloxacin to ampicillin.
She was also found to have an enterococcus UTI and started on unasyn.
Both agreed that leukocytosis was likely reactive, but to treat pneumonia and UTI, and to follow-up with outpatient records.
Patient does have chronic leukocytosis and thrombocytosis noted during prior admission to [**Hospital1 **] as well.
Per heme/onc consultation at that time, pattern appeared less likely to be MDS, more likely to be reactive, possibly related to iron deficiency as well.
Patient was initiated on HD 4 days prior to transfer, received third run of HD today, during which she developed acute left-sided chest pain, [**8-31**], not radiating.
She developed severe respiratory distress, was intubated, had then noted to have new inferiorlateral ST depressions on her EKG (I and aVL and V6) then goes to cath lab where they find 90% LM, 70% RCA, but no interventions were performed.

LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior free wall, and lateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Renal Ultrasound [**2163-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
No complications.
Patient to remain on aspirin and clopidogrel indefinitely, without interruption.
No complications.
Left occipital lobe loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation could be related an acute on chronic infarct.
Chronic infarction identified in the left parietooccipital region with extensive area of encephalomalacia, associated chronic microvascular ischemic disease is present.
Punctate areas of restricted diffusion are noted in the subcortical white matter on the right frontal lobe, left frontal convexity and right prefrontal region, likely consistent with small thromboembolic ischemic changes.
There is narrowing of the left internal carotid siphon and distal vascular branches, likely consistent with atherosclerotic disease as described above.
Mucosal thickening is noted on the left maxillary sinus with air-fluid levels, possibly consistent with ongoing inflammatory process.
Interventional [**2163-1-17**] IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a temporary hemodialysis catheter for a 23 cm tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
Continued opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with atelectasis and small effusion.
Cannot rule out more severe stenosis due to calcification.
Left ICA no stenosis.
On Discharge: 140  98  50 ----------------< 106 4.8  30  4.2  Ca: 8.8 Mg: 2.6 P: 7.4 &#8710;  WBC-17.4 Hb-8.7 Hct-25.7 Plt-540 PT: 26.1  PTT: 150  INR: 2.5    Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid LAD in [**2159**]), sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI, COPD (on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from OSH in setting of acute pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, oliguric [**Last Name (un) **], and critical left main disease.
Initial EKG at OSH showed severe STE in I and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in lateral leads.
Patient still endorses chest pain when asked.
CT surgery consultation believed patient was too high risk to take for CABG, due to multiple comorbidities.
# Respiratory Distress.
Patient was initially intubated at OSH for respiratory distress, thought to be secondary to pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
Patient was previously hospitalized a week prior to this current presentation for pneumonia (unclear course), discharged, and repeat CXR on admission looks like worsened pneumonia/CHF.
Patient was diuresed at OSH, but developed acute on chronic renal failure.
Renal consultation team thought was pre-renal azotemia, so patient was given IVF, and may have redeveloped pulmonary edema.
At baseline, patient has severe COPD on 2L oxygen at home.
Fentanyl/versed was used for sedation, as patient is allergic to propofol.
# Altered Mental Status:  As sedation was turned off to prepare patient for extubation, it was noted that she had prolonged AMS and was not able to follow commands and did not have intact gag reflex.
CT head was obtained that showed question of ischemic injury in watershed zone between left MCA/PCA territories.
A MRI brain was obtained that showed no such infarction, but small areas of acute ischemia in the left frontal lobe.
Neurology recommended obtaining a carotid duplex for further evaluation of the acute ischemia.
Although patient had R ICA stenosis, intervention was felt to be too high risk, and risks would likely outweigh benefits.
# CKD:  Patient has solitary kidney, CKD Stage III.
OSH work-up revealed that patient may have renal artery stenosis as evidenced by atrophic kidney (however, this could just be from CKD)and elevated renin and aldosterone.
Upon calling OSH for speciation/sensitivity, it was found that enterococcus only sensitive to vancomycin, so patient has finished a 14 day course on [**2163-1-22**].
# Leukocytosis: Patient had leukocytosis at OSH up to 30.
Patient is also noted to have chronic leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, as noted in discharge summary in [**2159**].
At that time, heme/onc consultation also thought findings were reactive and not associated with hematologic malignancy.
Hematology/oncology team felt that this could be a smoldering myeloproliferative disease with overlying component of infection.
JAK 2 returned positive, and there was a likely presumptive diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis vs other myeloproliferative disorders.
Although this could be reactive, should assess other possible sources and hematologic disorder.
Jak2 mutation looking for myeloproliferative diseases was positive.
# Vasculopathy:  Patient is s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI.

You were transferred to our cardiology ICU as you were having a heart attack.
There were no complications.
You were noted to have a complicated urinary tract infection.
You have completed the entire course of antibiotics for this urinary tract infection.
You were also noted to have high white blood cell count and high platelet count, which is concerning for a myeloproliferative disorder.
You also had a test that was positive for a JAK2 mutation, which is often found in myeloproliferative disorders.
