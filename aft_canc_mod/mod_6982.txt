HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old white female with a long history of pulmonary issues who is well known to the [**Hospital6 256**] and i a patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108610**] who was admitted on [**6-5**] for weaning off her ventilator.
Pulmonary:  The patient has a long history of severe lung disease.
She has a history of Hodgkin's disease and is status post CHOP and radiation therapy complicated by histoplasmosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and she is status post left pneumonectomy for Aspergillus.
Her baseline PACO2 is in the 80s, and a renal compensation brings her bicarbonate in the range of 40-50.
She had a tracheostomy revision on [**2131-7-2**], and was found to have a posterior tracheal ulcer which was a very early TE fistula.
Cardiac:  The patient has a history of biventricular congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy and is known to have an ejection fraction close to 20%.
Her left-sided heart failure is thought to be secondary to tachycardia inducing cardiomyopathy, and her right heart failure is thought to be secondary to cor pulmonale.
Her resting pulse ranges anywhere between 100-120s and is sinus tachycardia, and based on previous experience, it has shown that any decrease or increase from this resting heart rate, can send her into respiratory distress and cause decompensation.
In addition, she is on a regimen of Lasix, Metolazone, and Aldactone to help control her volume status.
She remains at her baseline goal weight between 150-120 lbs on this diuresis regimen, and she does not appear to have any respiratory distress.
She has a history of constipation and sometimes develops hyperkalemia from her inability to excrete her potassium to her GI tract.
In addition, with her large diuresis, she also is known to drop her potassium level significantly in the range of 2.4-2.5.
The patient also has a baseline metabolic alkalosis as mentioned early on with bicarbs of 40-50 to compensate for her severely impaired and decreased ventilation.
She has a significant amount of large dead space and a VD/VT ratio of 0.8.
She had been on Percocet for pain experienced from her tracheostomy site.
Infectious disease:  Given the patient's significant pulmonary history, she was taking inhaled Tobramycin for pseudomonas prophylaxis.
She does have a history of chronic leukocytosis from [**12-7**], but no specific signs of infection from her baseline was noted.
On [**9-6**], she was found to have 15 bands on her CBC, and she was found to have a positive urinalysis, and she was started on Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
In addition on [**9-6**], she grew coag-negative staph from her PICC line and was started on Vancomycin because it was sensitive to that.
Psychiatry:  The patient has a history of anxiety attacks with complicated respiratory failure.
It was thought that the anxiety was a large component of this failure.
She was relying on multiple pain medications which had been discontinued due to her constipation and other problems.
