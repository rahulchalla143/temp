In [**8-1**] CXR showed a new pleural density.
In [**Month (only) 359**] a new effusion was present and a diagnostic and theraputic thoracentesis and pleurodesis was performed which showed non small cell lung cancer.
Urinary tract infections.

Shortness of Breath resulting in hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to worsening nonsmall cell lung CA, increased pleural effusion, and possible post-obstructive PNA.
Patient is not tolerating CPAP due to discomfort and expresses the wish to remain comfortable.
In addition, as she has a reaccumulating malignant effusion, there is little likelihood that her respiratory status could be reversed.
