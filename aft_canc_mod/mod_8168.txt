Admission Date:  [**2149-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-12-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of internal jugular central venous catheter Endotrachal intubation  History of Present Illness: 71 male with h/o renal transplant ([**2131**]), HTN, prostate ca (s/p brachytherapy), invasive anal squamous cell ca (s/p one round chemo with cytarabine/5FU, which was c/b pre-renal ARF, pansensitive E.coli UTI tx with cipro, requiring admission in [**5-13**]), who was found by his friends on the morning of admission lying down, disheveled, and weak.
His initial labs revealed an elevated WBC to 15k, HCT 27, Creat 3.8, and lactate 6.6.
His only complaints on presentation were of generally not feeling well, and pain in his right knee since stopping his allopurinol.
Also, on further questions on admission, pt reported increasing rectal bleeding.
Past Medical History: Renal failure s/p cadaveric renal xplant in [**2131**]; cause of renal failure not known Anal carcinoma- Dx w/cc of stool leakage-->colonoscopy [**2-10**] w/+Bx recurrent gout hypertension history of episodic ventricular tachycardia with AICD as well as atrial fibrillation with pacer prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy anemia of chronic disease Iliac artery aneurysm  Social History: SH: Works as administrator at [**Location (un) 111142**]courthouse.
Also with prominent swelling of globe bilaterally on lateral sides.
OP clear, poor dentition, no sinus tenderness.
NECK- supple, RIJ in place, flat JVP CV- RRR, soft II/VI systolic murmur along LLSB, soft S1, S2 CHEST- Clear anteriorlly, no wheezes ABD- flat, soft, pos BS, NT, kidney palpable RLQ without tenderness EXT- no C/C/E.
No palpable knee effusions.
CN intact, no focal findings.
No asterixis; mild tremor noted at rest.
CT abdomen: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are new moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
There is a nasogastric tube in place.
There is diffuse ascites and anasarca.
There is a large amount of high attenuation fluid in the abdomen, most notably surrounding the right common iliac aneurysm, which extends superiorly to the level of the renal fascia.
These findings are consistent with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage suspected from leaking iliac artery aneurysm.
The kidneys are atrophic with a calcification in the right kidney.
Left renal lesions appear unchanged.
A partially calcified left common iliac aneurysm measures approximately 5.0 x 4.3 cm on today's study and demonstrates a more ovoid configuration than on the prior study.
There is a right pelvic renal transplant with gas in the collecting system, most likely secondary to reflux from the urinary bladder.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder, which contains gas.
There is a mass-like density adjacent to the rectum and gas that extends along the right perirectal/perianal margin.
No suspicious osseous lesions.
Large retroperitoneal hemorrhage suspected to originate from leaking right iliac artery aneurysm.
Diffuse ascites and anasarca.
New bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 male with h/o renal transplant ([**2131**]), HTN, prostate ca (s/p brachytherapy), invasive anal squamous cell ca (s/p one round chemo with cytarabine / 5FU), who recently was called out from the ICU after treatment of urosepsis was found to be acutely altered mental status this evening.
His initial rhythm was unclear, but appeared to be his baseline wide complex, tachy.
There were no vital sign abnormalities noted by the team.
No fever spikes.
Labs on transfer to the MICU were significant for a severe acidemia (pH 6.94), low bicarb (14), elevated lactic acid (14), large hematocrit drop from the AM (32->22), stable WBC (10K), stable LFTs.
His CXR revealed small L effusion, no PTX, ET tube 2cm from carina, no infiltrate.
His hospital course preceeding this acute event included an admission to the MICU 6 days ago for hypotension, dehydrated, and urosepsis.
He was called out the floor, where his antibiotics were tapered to ampicillin; his stress dose steroids were tapered to his home prednisone dose; surgery followed regarding his rectal bleeding / ca, and recommended continued outpatient follow up.
He had issues with urinary retention.
He had been feeling well until the acute event.
Once in the MICU, he continued to be hypotensive, requiring multiple vasopressors.
His abdominal exam was notable for increasing distension, and eventually he was stable enough for a CT abdomen / pelvis.
This demonstrated a large retroperitoneal bleed, suspicious for a ruptured right iliac artery aneurysm.
Vascular surgery was called who reviewed the films and could only offer a large scale operation, and the likelihood of stopping the bleed was low.
At this point his health care proxy was called, and filled in on the details of his situation and abdominal bleed.
She made the decision that he would not want to o through such a large surgery, given his battle with cancer and other co-morbidities.
