Mr. [**Known lastname 61106**] presents with Large ICH in right temporal parietal region with MLS and IVH.
He is currently on hold for his therapies for metestatic renal cell carcinoma secondary to an intracranial abscess that was recently evacuated [**7-8**].

Pertinent Results:    [**Month/Day/Year 706**]  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2188-8-17**] 9:15 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for bleed  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man with pt with recent hx of TBI/ craniotomy with 2nd hx of infected surgical site, recent declininng ms to only painful stimuli REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HISTORY: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post surgery, XRT, postoperative scalp infection with declining mental status.
No prior comparison exams are available.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  FINDINGS: There is a large mixed density intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe at the site of prior surgery displaying hematocrit levels.
Additionally, there is interventricular extension of hemorrhage tracking down into the fourth ventricle and a mild-to- moderate sized right subdural likely acute on chronic hematoma measuring approximately 6 mm from the inner table with blood noted to track along the tentorium.
Moderate amount of dilatation of the left ventricular system is noted.
Subcutaneous air and a large subgaleal mixed density hematoma is present adjacent to the craniotomy site.
There is approximately 11 mm of leftward subfalcine herniation as well as mass effect noted on the brainstem with slight effacement of the ambient cistern consistent with mild uncal herniation.
Paranasal sinuses display mild amount of thickening within the left maxillary sinus but are otherwise unremarkable.
Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent mass effect causing prominent leftward subfalcine herniation and mild uncal herniation.
Intraventricular extension of hemorrhage with moderate left-sided hydrocephalus.
Acute on chronic right subdural hematoma over the right cerebrum and new acute subdural hematoma along the falx and tentorium.
Large mixed density subgaleal hematoma and subcutaneous air adjacent to craniotomy site.
Findings are most consistent with hemorrhagic conversion of patient's known metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
CT revealed massive IPH with MLS.
