Compared to the MRI from [**2164-4-30**] and the CT from [**2164-4-20**], the bilateral extra-axial subdural fluid collections have increased and the ventricular size has decreased, suggesting mild overshunting.
Hypodense vasogenic edema at the left peritrigonal and temporoparietal region is unchanged from prior studies based on the previous MRI likely due to radiation necrosis.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, or herniation.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Slight interval increase of extra-axial, bilateral fluid subdural collections and decrease of the ventricular size, suggesting mild overshunting.
Moderate to severe centrilobular emphysema.
No acute cardiothoracic process.
Heterogeneous right testicle with evidence of vascular compromise, suggesting ischemia, which may be due to swelling.
Mild septations in a right hydrocele may represent developing pyocele.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 70 y/o male h/o VP shunt, AVM, SIADH and thrombocytopenia, presenting with fever and AMS, [**1-21**] SIRS, admitted for urosepsis with stable hemodynamics.
On the medical floor, he was found to have orchitis of the R testicle, which was treated with cipro and doxycycline given U-Cx sensitivities.
# Epididymitis, orchitis, hydrocele: [**5-25**], at 0445 pt was being cleaned and nurses noted TTP in scrotal area despite pt denying pain in area.
Pt was denying any type of pain, but would move hands towards groin when being examined.
Scrotal US showed e/o florid epidiymitis that is vascular; hydrocele with minimal septations suggestive of possible pyocele; testis with decreased vascularity with no flow in diastole suggestive of decreased venous outflow; heterogenous testis likely [**1-19**] ischemia.
Urology c/s deemed no surgical intervention necessary and was not concerned for torsion, and recommended abx for 2 weeks (see below).
He was initially covered with vanc given enterococcus in blood that was resistant to cipro, but transitioned to doxycycline on [**5-27**] and has been afebrile thus far.
Patient had a previous urine culture with pseudomonas sensitive to quinolones, but had been treated with nitrofurantoin to which it was resistant; he was covered during his MICU stay with cipro for sensitive pseudomonas; his U-Cx also grew out Enterococcus which was cipro resistant; doxycycline was added on [**5-27**].
# Hyponatremia: Currently stable and improving.
We cont fluid restrict to 1500cc's and his Na remained stable at about 130 most of his stay, but increased to 135 on the day of discharge.
# AMS: Likely due to urosepsis.
DDx included long-term effects of L temporal radiation necrosis, or possible "overshunting" observed on head CT compared with CT from [**2-27**].
# Left temporal Brain Lesion: During previous admission, he had extensive w/u which believed the lesion to be radiation necrosis.
He did have a positive beta-glucan and concerning lung imaging, and thus is being treated for PCP on atovaquone being tapered down and prednisone.
# PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**]: thought to be cause of pt's hypoxia, CXR findings, and elevated beta-glucan during previous admission.
# chronic constipation: has been a longstanding problem for the pt in previous admissions.
-- Complete antibiotic courses with Ciprofloxacin and Doxycycline for Pseudomonas and Enterococcus UTI/epididymitis/orchitis.
-- Check electrolytes in [**1-20**] days to trend hyponatremia   Medications on Admission: Medications (per [**4-30**] discharge summary):  1. levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
5. senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Sepsis secondary to Urinary tract infection Epididymitis Orchitis  Secondary diagnoses: Left arteriovenous malformation History of seizures Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted because you had a fever, and you were found to have a urinary tract infection, epididymitis, and orchitis (an infection of the testicles).
