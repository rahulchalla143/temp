Microscopic dissection.
The patient had been hospitalized in [**2128-4-29**] after a loss of consciousness.
The patient was worked up at that time including a set of imaging studies revealing a mass consistent with an intracranial tumor.
The patient was diagnosed with a left-sided inferior frontal lesion measuring approximately 4 cm in size.
It most likely represents a skull-based meningioma with indentation of the inferior frontal lobe.
The patient currently denies any symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or seizures.
He had one episode of numbness to the leg prior to admission that subsequently resolved.

There is a thin extra-axial fluid collection.
No definite residual enhancement is seen in the surgical bed.
Restricted diffusion is seen at the margins of the resection bed, possibly related to the surgery or blood products.
No other abnormally enhancing masses or fluid collections are identified.
There is edema causing rightward midline shift and extending along the corpus callosum.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen of the sphenoid, ethmoid, and left maxillary sinus.
There is no evidence of acute infarct.
Angiography was performed on [**8-3**] with the hope for possible embolization of the lesion prior to resection of the intracranial mass.
On brain angiography, no opportunity for embolization was present due to the the anatomical features of the head mass.
The angiography was used for diagnostic purposes.
The angiography was uncomplicated and no groin hematoma developed.
He remained neurologically intact, with no focal deficits.
CT examination showed no evidence of acute intracranial bleed post-op.
MRI occurring post-op showed no evidence of residual tumor.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
