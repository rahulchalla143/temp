Admission Date:  [**2134-3-9**]       Discharge Date: [**2134-6-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2134-3-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  NEONATOLOGY HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 10733**] [**Known lastname 39084**] delivered at 28 and 2/7 weeks gestation, weighing 560 grams and was admitted to the Intensive Care Nursery for management of prematurity and respiratory distress.
The pregnancy was complicated by chronic hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy induced hypertension, intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios.
Amniocentesis [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] four days prior to delivery for monitoring.
The fetus was noted to have decreased diastolic flow and decelerations.
Delivery by cesarean section secondary to development of absent diastolic flow and nonreassuring fetal heart pattern.
The infant required bulb suctioning, stimulation and brief positive pressure ventilation with bag and mask after delivery with good response.
Skin was without lesions.
The abdomen was within normal limits, soft, no hepatomegaly, no masses.
Genitalia remarkable for a small phallus with chordae.
Infant with hypospadias with a urethral opening approximately half way down the caudal side of the phallus.
Respiratory - The infant was intubated on admission for respiratory distress and received a total of one dose of Surfactant for mild respiratory distress syndrome.
He was maintained on low ventilator support until day of life 30 when he developed Klebsiella pneumoniae requiring a change to high frequency oscillator ventilation with a mean airway pressure of 14 and delta P of 22 in 30-50% oxygen.
He has mild subcostal retractions at rest.
The infant was treated with caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity from day of life 22 to day of life 62.
Last spontaneous apnea and bradycardia on [**2134-5-15**], had a bradycardia associated with feeds on [**2134-6-1**].
Cardiovascular - The infant was hypotensive on admission treated with a Dopamine infusion.
The infant was weaned off Dopamine on day of life four and has been hemodynamically stable since without evidence of patent ductus arteriosus or murmur.
He was treated with three 2 cc/kg D10 boluses on day of life one for low whole blood glucose.
Human milk fortifier and ProMod was discontinued and Progestanil powder added to breast milk on day of life 22 secondary to guaiac positive stools.
The feeds were stopped on day of life 30 secondary to illness associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Caloric density was increased gradually to 30 calories per ounce with ProMod, this time using human milk fortifier without any further problems.
With increase to 32 calories per ounce on day of life 62 for poor growth.
Nutritional laboratories have been followed and was noted to have an elevated alkaline phosphatase to 1547 on day of life 20 with a calcium of 9.8 and phosphorus of 4.5.
Infectious disease - The infant was treated with Ampicillin and Gentamicin for seven days following delivery for presumed infection due to respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, hypotension and low white blood count.
The infant was treated for ten days with Cefotaxime and Gentamicin for Klebsiella pneumoniae from day of life 30 through 39.
Endocrine - Pediatric endocrinology was consulted due to intrauterine growth restriction, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and small phallus.
They felt that there was no further endocrine workup needed and follow-up is not needed.
Abdominal ultrasound initially was normal except for mild bilateral hydronephrosis which resolved on follow-up ultrasound.
Ophthalmology - Eyes examined on [**2134-5-26**], revealing immaturity of the retinal vessels but no retinopathy of prematurity as of yet.
A follow-up examination on [**2134-6-9**] showed mature vessels.
Dermatology - The infant was seen by dermatology from [**Hospital3 1810**] for a proliferative ulcerated hemangioma on the upper lip, left side.
Car travel with car bed due to "failed results" with car seat position screening where he experienced desaturation at the end of a 90 minute testing period.
c.  Urology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]     d.  Ophthalmology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6955**]     e.  Early Intervention, Infant Follow-Up, and VNA  State Newborn Screening status - Multiple State Newborn Screens have been sent due to prematurity and weight and all have been normal.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
Chronic lung disease.
