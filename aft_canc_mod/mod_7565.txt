[**Name (NI) **] was unaware that his father was having hematuria until yesterday when his urine was noted to be dark red.
He has also had hemoptysis for a number of months but worsening in the past 1-2 weeks with tablespoon of hemoptysis nearly every time he coughs.
The cough is associated with right sided chest pain in the front and back.
Labs are significant for worsening thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology.
Currently, he denies any pain but feels very tired.

Other small metastatic lesions appear unchanged.
[**3-13**] CT head: One right and two left frontal hemorrhagic lesions with surrounding edema, concerning for metastasis.
These lesions were seen in the MRI of [**2192-3-12**], but new since the CT of [**2192-2-3**].
No new hemorrhage.
No midline shift.
Prominent bilateral extra-axial spaces, likely subdural hygromas.
[**3-13**] CXR: PRELIM Consolidation in the lingular segment of the left lung, is consistent with known diagnosis of lung cancer.
No new pulmonary pathology identified.
[**3-15**] MRI Brain- IMPRESSION: Previously noted enhancing lesions in the brain on the MRI of [**2182-3-12**] again identified for WAND study for surgical planning.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus.
No change in the size of the lesion seen since the previous study.
Stable appearance of left frontal hemorrhagic metastasis and left parieto-occipital encephalomalacia from prior resection.
Left upper lobe consolidation has improved.
This pattern is consistent with an obstructive pneumonia consistent with known lingular mass.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**3-21**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo M with NSCLC with brain mets s/p parietal/occipital crani for tumor resection on [**2192-2-3**], relatively new bilateral frontal hemorrhagic mets scheduled for neurosurgical resection next week now s/p WB XRT with progressive weakness now with hematuria x 1 week, worsening thrombocytopenia.
The patient had a Head CT which was consistent with multiple known hemorrhagic metastases in bifrontal lobes.
There was no new intracranial hemorrhage.
On [**3-16**], POD #2 the patient continued to have a production productive cough/hemoptysis.
A CXR was performed in the afternoon which was consistent with left upper lobe consolidation which had improved.
The pattern was consistent with an obstructive pneumonia consistent with known lingular mass.
There was no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The platlets were 67 and the patient was transfused with 1 pack of platlets and post transfusion platlet count was 136.
The patient continued have hemoptysis although this was improved.
There was no drainage, erythema or edema.
HIT markedly positive no heparin.
[**Date range (1) 19033**] The patient remained neurologically stable but physically continued to become weaker and have increased pain throughout his body.
