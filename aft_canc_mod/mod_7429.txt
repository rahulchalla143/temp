There has been interval development of bilateral patchy opacities, involving at least the bilateral lung bases and left upper lobe, which could represent infectious process, although worsening of patient's malignancy is also a possibility and not excluded.
Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace effusion and/or pleural thickening.
No pneumothorax is seen.
The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities, as above, may relate to multifocal pneumonia although worsening of patient's known malignancy/ metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
[**2107-11-30**] - CXR: Bilateral opacities most notable in the right base and left upper lung are markedly improved which reveals the previously seen left upper, mid and lower lung masses as well as possible right basilar masses corresponding to the patient's known lymphoma.
Residual bibasilar opacities as well as left perihilar opacities could reflect residual edema, atelectasis, or infectious process.
There is no pneumothorax.
Improvement in pulmonary edema with residual bibasilar opacification which could reflect residual edema, atelectasis or infectious process.
Unchanged left upper, mid and lower lung masses with possible right basilar mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M with large cell lymphoma treated with chemotherapy most recently on [**11-10**], COPD, and afib on coumadin admitted with fever to 103, cough with yellow sputum, and generalized weakness and somnolence.
MULTIFOCAL LEGIONELLA PNEUMONIA C/B SEPTIC SHOCK: He was started empirically on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: He has permanent AF, but the RVR was likely related to acute illness.
Subsequently, his digoxin was stopped due to asymptomatic bradycardia and dig effect on EKG.
He was not restarted on the atenolol, with his PCP's approval, due to fluctuating renal function.
LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA: Completed 6th cycle of Rituxan, Gemzar, and Oxaliplatinum on [**11-10**] with limited results and PET showing increased activity in the lung and abdomen.
The present plan is for R-CHOP to begin in [**Month (only) 1096**] under the care of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**Location (un) 2274**] oncology, although the plan may change given his recent infection.
This was discontinued prior to discharge due to orthostatic hypotension.
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA: The patient has known OSA and is supposed to be on CPAP at home, but he is non-compliant.
Both were felt adequate coverage for the legionella, and the writer called in the prescription for the remaining 4 days to be covered with moxifloxacin instead.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Your pneumonia improved on antibiotics, and you will need to finish taking the course at home.
You also had some confusion while you were here, and this got better once you were less ill.  You had some trouble with urination, and this also got better as you healed, and you were on a medication that may have helped.
**Please call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any trouble urinating, and he can start the medication again.
Continue your other medications without changes.
