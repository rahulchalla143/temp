diffuse pattern over R middle lobe CT head: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, major vascular territorial infarction, or fracture.
Regional soft tissues demonstrate no significant abnormality.
CT C-spine: No acute fracture.
Minimal grade 1 anterolisthesis of T1 over T2.
Large left upper lobe consolidation concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
No mass is identified in the expected course of the phrenic nerve.
Centrilobular opacities in right lower lobe, which may be due to infectious small airways disease or aspiration.
Trace left pleural effusion.
No evidence of subpulmonic pleural effusion.
Small low-attenuation lesion in upper pole portion of left kidney and low attenuation lesion in the thyroid gland left lobe, both incompletely evaluated on this study.
There is no evidence of paradoxical motion.
IMPRESSION:  Sluggish left hemidiaphragm but no evidence for diaphragmatic paralysis.
ECHO [**2198-6-26**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated RV cavity with moderate pulmonary hypertension (?
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2198-6-25**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Failure - Differential included PNA (CAP vs. nosocomial vs. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Less likely possibilities included PE and CHF.
A CXR in the ED showed diffuse L lung opacity.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was underwent a bronchoscopy which showed: no inflammation, minimal secretions, and a partially obstructing lesion, likely a foreign body, which looked exactly like a piece of [**Last Name (LF) 59138**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report.
A BAL was performed and the initial read showed gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods.
Sputum culture returned positive for acinitobacter baumanni which was sensitive to bactrim and imipenum.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed on [**6-26**] which showed continuing obstruction.
A femoral line was placed, then removed once patient had a L PICC line placed.
Patient was extubated on [**6-29**] without difficulty.
Patient appeared somewhat tremulous on [**7-1**] and although she says that she is normally shaky at baseline, Albuterol was changed to PRN and patient was started on serovent.
Imipenim was restarted and Bactrim and imipenem were continued for a 14 day course and prednisone was started for possible COPD exacerbation and tapered.
#Altered MS - Differential diagnosis included hypoxia insetting fo respiratory distress, infection (given HIV status, unknown CD4 count, not on HAART or prophylaxis), seizure (possibly secondary to infection), toxic/metabolic, and less likely, CVA.
A CT scan was obtained in the ED which was negative for masses or bleeding with preserved grey-white matter differentiation.
Seroquel was discontinued for it's sedating effects and possible contribution to her mental status.
#Neck pain: Patient had plain films of the cervical spine to rule-out possible fracture, but while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] complained of diffuse posterior cervical neck pain on palpation.
The neck collar was removed and patient denied any further neck pain.
Given her somewhat questionable mental status, repeat flexion and extension films were obtained and showed some minimal instability at at C2/3 and C3/4, of indeterminate acuity.
#Cardiac - Patient had some chest pain on [**6-30**].
Patient also became somewhat intermittently tachycardiac during her stay in the ICU.
Patient remained hypertensive with SBP in the 160-170's.
#HIV - Patient is not on HAART or any prophylaxis.
#Hyperlipidemia - Atorvastatin was continued at outpatient dose.
#Schizoaffective D/O - Depakote Sprinkles and seroquel were both discontinued secondary to concerns they may be contributing to patient altered mental status.
After patient's mental status improved, her seroquel was restarted and is being tapered up to her previous dose.
Patient was cleared for a ground solid diet with nectar-thick liquids.
On the day of discharge she was tolerating a regular diabetic diet without any signs or symptoms of aspiration.
I spoke directly with patient's nurse practioner about the kidney lesion and thyroid lesion and recommended follow up with urology and endocrine for further evaluation.
Albuterol-Ipratropium 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-29**] Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB/wheezing.
