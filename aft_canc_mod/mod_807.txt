Admission Date:  [**2106-2-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-2-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2053-4-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year old, right handed man with a history of a left carotid body tumor, status post resection, and a history of resection.
He presented with a day long history of change in mental status, including some confusion, increased sleepiness, possibly left sided headache, as well as some word finding difficulties.
There is no history of any urinary incontinence, tongue biting or convulsions that were witnessed at the home.
He was brought to the Emergency Room for evaluation of his change in mental status.
While in the Emergency Room, he was complaining initially of headache and then began to have a witnessed seizure while in the Emergency Room.
Left carotid body tumor at the bifurcation of the internal and external carotid, measuring four by four by 4.8 cms.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has no children.
He also had a mother who died of lung cancer, as well as a sister who died of lung cancer.
Generally, he was pleasant and interactive, in no acute distress.
No carotid bruits appreciated.
Cardiovascular examination:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There was no apraxia, neglect or grasp.
There was no nystagmus.
He had a slight right facial droop.
Palate was elevated symmetrically.
Motor examination:  He had normal tone and bulk with no tremors or fasciculations.
There was mild pronation with the right upper extremity but no drift.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 52 year old man who presents with acute change in mental status times one day; a low grade temperature of 99.9, as well as a witnessed initially focal later generalized tonic/clonic seizure in the Emergency Room.
He was then taken for a head CT which showed a hypodensity within the left anterior frontal lobe but no evidence of hemorrhage or shift.
He was then given more Ativan and sent for a magnetic resonance scan of the head, which again showed an abnormality in the left medial anterior temporal lobe.
The study was very limited by motion artifact; however, on P2 images, he had a hyperintensity in the same left anterior temporal area, which did not enhance with contrast.
The location and appearance of the initial magnetic resonance scan was concerning for possible HSV encephalitis, especially in the setting of low grade fevers, seizures and change in mental status.
The patient initially continued to have some confusion and agitation.
However, the patient did not have any evidence of withdraw except for continued mild low grade temperatures.
He had multiple cultures sent which showed evidence of a urinary tract infection.
He had a lumbar puncture in the Emergency Room, which was traumatic with tube one which had 16 white cells and 13,800 red cells which were 86% polys.
He was also seen by neurology/oncology, who felt that the appearance of the lesion on magnetic resonance scan was more consistent with a low grade glioma or astrocytoma than with an infectious process.
The patient's mental status continued to improve and he was sent home with plans to follow-up for MR spectroscopy to further evaluate this left anterior temporal lobe abnormality after discharge.
The patient was told to check his Dilantin trough in one to two weeks and was given a prescription for this purpose.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Left anterior temporal lobe abnormality, most likely consistent with glioma.
