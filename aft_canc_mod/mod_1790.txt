While in clinic, she complained of acute onset RUQ abdominal pain towards the end of transfusion.
While on transit in the ambulance, she had an episode of nonbillous nonbloody emesis.
She also endorses 3 weeks of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with white sputum, fatigue, fevers and chills and anorexia.
In the ED, labs were concerning for new abnormal LFTs with a predominantly cholestatic picture and CXR showed BL pleural effusion R>L, and large R lung infiltrate (with near white out) concerning for pneumonia.
USS abdomen showed ascites, gallstones without e/o acute cholecystitis.
liver lesions, but no e/o pancreatitis.
CT chest showed BL pleural effusions, R lung infiltrate.
Also remarkable for worsening BL LE edema.
Past Medical History: # Back pain with multilevel osseous metastatic disease in the thoracic and lumbar spine # HTN # Hypercholesterolemia # Left hip fracture [**2144**], s/p hemiarthroplasty.
MEDICATIONS Furosemide 20mg daily Quinapril 20mg daily Prochloperazine 10mg prn TID nausea  Social History: She does not smoke or drink.
Is able to ambulate although back pain worse when [**Last Name (un) 27797**] or walking.
SKIN: warm, well perfused HEENT: scleral icterus.
JVP +10, no LAD, MMM, OP without erythema or exudate LUNGS: Dull to percussion in the lower 1/3rd.
No bronchial breath sounds.
CARDIAC: tachycardic S1, S2, no rubs or gallops ABD: Distended but soft, with fluid wave, mildly tender in RUQ but [**Doctor Last Name **] negative.
No signs of surgical abdomen.
HSM: no organomegaly EXTR: LE's with 2+ pitting edema up past knees bilaterally, LUE with lymphedema, no evidence of cellulitis  Pertinent Results: Basic admission labs:  [**2155-3-7**] 09:30AM   WBC-0.9* RBC-3.15* HGB-8.3* HCT-24.7* MCV-79* MCH-26.5* MCHC-33.8 RDW-18.1* [**2155-3-7**] 07:26PM   GRAN CT-750* [**2155-3-7**] 07:26PM   NEUTS-66 BANDS-0 LYMPHS-34 MONOS-0 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2155-3-7**] 07:26PM   GLUCOSE-122* UREA N-32* CREAT-1.2* SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-3.2* CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-15  LFTs:  CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
Markedly distorted internal anatomy due to severe vertebral column changes and loss of anterior abdominal wall muscles, which limits accurate evaluation of some of the visceral organs such as pancreatic head and uncinate process which was not well seen.
Gallbladder wall edema, generalized anasarca and ascites.
Bilateral pleural effusions loculated on the right with right lower lobe opacity which could reflect post-obstructive pneumonia with a component of atelectasis.
Extensive osseous metastases with further loss of vertebral body height as described above.
Bilateral common femoral vein thrombosis  [**2155-3-10**] CXR AP chest compared to [**3-7**] through [**2158-3-10**]:19 a.m.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema in the left lung has increased, moderate left pleural effusion stable, right lung airless due in large part to large right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 27798**] is a 81 year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer including pulmonary metastases who presents with RUQ pain, abnormal LFTs, and shortness of breath.
# Shortness of breath: Patient was tachypneic to 40, ABG showed large A-a gradient.
Likely contribution from tumor burden in lungs, pleural effusions, pneumonia, volume overload.
She may also have had one or multiple pulmonary emboli given DVTs seen on CT, lower extremity edema, and chest pain.
Lower extremity Dopplers confirmed DVTs.
Late in the evening on [**3-9**] she developed respiratory distress and was placed on NRB and was satting at 88%.
It was determined that given her underlying cancer thoracentesis would be ineffective and likely would damage the lung further.
# Elevated LFTs and RUQ pain:  The cause of this was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 1194**] may have been an episode of biliary colic with transient obstruction causing t bili and alk phos bump.
Elevated GGT confirmed a likely biliary source, and fractionation of bilirubin demonstrated an elevated conjugated fraction, likely from the biliary pathology, as well as an elevated unconjugated fraction, which may have had contributions from both the liver issues and her recent transfusion.
Haptoglobin and reticulocyte count did not indicate evidence of hemolysis.
There was gallbladder wall inflammation on CT but no cholecystitis by US.
She stated that she would not want surgical evaluation or consideration of percutaneous drainage.
The pain did not recur, and her alk phos and t bili trended down.
# Metastatic breast cancer: s/p CMF cycle 2.
Likely few further chemotherapeutic options.
# ACCESS: PIV .
