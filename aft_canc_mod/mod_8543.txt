Drainage of pelvic abscess, Left upper quadrant colostomy, placement of pain pump   History of Present Illness:     Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a  61 year-old  female with a history of diverticulitis who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and chills.
She was diagnosed with diverticulitis on CT abdomen/pelvis here at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-8-4**] after presenting to clinic with complaints of left lower abdominal pain.
Her symptoms had resolved at this time, but she has experienced recurrent abdominal pain since her initial diagnosis, on occasion treated with Maalox with minimal relief.
She was recently started on Augmentin by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] she reports taking, with no change in her symptoms.
She had been scheduled for a colonoscopy today and began taking the Go-Lytely prep lastnight, but while taking it became nauseous and had multiple episodes of non-bloody, clear emesis.
She denies accompanying shortness of breath, chest pain, diaphoresis, hematemesis, hematochezia or melena.
She additionally denies any sick contacts, consumption of poorly prepared food or recent travel.
A CXR was unremarkable and a CT abdomen and pelvis showed persistent and worsened diverticulitis with no abscess or perforation.
Because of persistent hypotension in the 80s systolic, despite 4 L of NS, she was admitted to the ICU for further management.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: HTN Diverticulosis: Found on colonoscopy in [**2169**] with subsequent diverticulitis since [**2172-7-12**] Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the right breast ([**2168**]): s/p breast conserving therapy with wide excision and adjuvant Tamoxifen therapy .
Family History: Family History: Daughter with breast cancer at age 34  Physical Exam: PE Vitals: T- 95.5, BP - 100/55, HR - 86, RR - 24, O2 - 96% 2L General: Awake, alert, in mild discomfort, worsened with examination of abdomen HEENT: NC/AT; PERRLA, EOMI; OP clear, nonerythematous with dry mucous membranes Neck: Supple, no LAD Chest/CV: S1, S2 nl, no m/r/g appreciated, RRR Lungs: Bilateral, dry inspiratory crackles, R>L Abd: Mild distention, soft, tender to palpation of the LLQ with some involuntary guarding, but no rebounding, + BS in all 4 quadrants Rectal: Yellowish-brown stool, guaiac negative Ext: No c/c/e Neuro: Grossly intact Skin: No rashes .
Inflammation with colonic wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding involving the distal descending and sigmoid colon consistent with persistant diverticulitis.
The degree of wall thickening, surrounding fat stranding, involvement of adjacent small bowel loops and length the colon involved has increased since the previous exam, consistent with worsening disease.
No definite microperforation or abscess identified at this time.
Again given the persistence of the inflammation in this region, followup sigmoid/colonoscopy or CT scan is recommended after appropriate treatment and resolution of symptoms in order ensure resolution and exclude underlying mass.
Fibroid uterus.
There are no pleural effusions.
No free air is identified under the diaphragms.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small (0.3 cm) pericardial effusion.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Mildly thickened endometrium at 5.7mm.
Reccommend further clinical evaluation and biopsy.
Fibroid uterus.
female with PMHx of HTN, diverticulitis and DCIS who presented with a persistent LLQ pain, fever and hypotension in the setting of worsening diverticulitis.
# Sepsis: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU sepsis with leukocytosis, fever, and hypotension managed with fluid administration (approximately 8 liters).
# Diverticulitis: Ongoing since [**Month (only) 205**], despite antibiotics, though patient did not take full course of Flagyl and Ciprofloxacin and has also not been able to tolerate Augmentin.
Vancomycin was discontinued and ampicillin was later begun for enterococcal coverage.
Surgery was consulted and recommended surgery after 5-7 days after resolution of acute inflammation.
On hospital day 9, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a Hartmanns resection of sigmoid colon with drainage of pelvic abscess and placement of left upper quadrant colostomy and was as a pain pump performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Of note, a large multiloculated pelvic abscess was drained.
She had an estimated blood loss of 700ml.
Her pain was managed post-operatively with her pain pump and a PCA (very little was needed) and was gradually transitioned to oral pain medications.
# Ostomy- Ms. [**Known lastname **] was seen by the ostomy nursing service for education about ostomy care.
Dyspnea-  Following fluid resuscitation, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had episodes of dyspnea which responded to furosemide administration with good diuresis.
She was saturating well without dyspnea prior to discharge.
# Hypertension- Ms. [**Known lastname 99884**] hypertension post-operatively was managed with metoprolol.
[**Last Name (STitle) 9006**] for further management of her hypertension.
, # DCIS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] stopped taking tamoxifen because of side effects.
She was advised to see her breast surgeon for further management.
# Vaginal bleeding- On post-operative day 6, Ms. [**Known lastname **] reported a small amount of vaginal spotting.
Gynecology was consulted and a transvaginal ultrasound was obtained which revealed a fibroid uterus and a 5.7 mm endometrium  The bleeding was thought likely due to the subcutaneous heparin administered post-operatively for DVT prophylaxis.
The bleeding was thought to be unlikely from her fibroid, since this is stable in size since last year.
GYN recommended no immediate intervention but rather an outpatient endometrial bopsy given a slightly thickened endometrium  (>4 mm for a post-menopausal patient).
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Diverticulitis Sepsis s/p Hartmann's resection of sigmoid colon with drainage of pelvic abscess and left upper quadrant colostomy Vaginal Bleeding  Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for diverticulitis and were found to have low blood pressure likely due to your infection.
You were started on antibiotics and had surgical removal of part of your colon as well as drainage of an abscess in your pelvis and placement of a colostomy.
You were seen by the gynecology service because of some vaginal bleeding.
Also, there was mild thickening of the lining of your uterus (endometrium).
The vaginal bleeding may be due to a medication you received (herparin) that thins your blood.
However, given that you do have mild thickening of your endometrium, you should have an endometrial biopsy to check for endometrial cancer.
You will have some abdominal pain associated with your surgery.
However, you should call your doctor or return to the hospital for: * Worsening of your abdominal pain * Nausea or vomiting * Fever, chills * Change in color or increased pain at your ostomy site * Increased pain, redness or drainage from your incision site * Any other symptoms that concern .
