CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small amount of pericardial fluid is again seen.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Again demonstrated is a right upper lobe mass and associated consolidation, encasing the right mainstem bronchus, right main pulmonary artery and right-sided pulmonary veins.
There is an associated moderate- sized pleural effusion, with fluid tracking medially and into the fissure on occasion.
Mild centrilobular emphysema is present.
Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal a rounded hypodensity within the mid pole of the left kidney, incompletely characterized.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a stable compression fracture of the upper thoracic spine.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
There is generalized edema within the subcutaneous tissues, compatible with anasarca.
There is a slightly sclerotic right third rib, similar in appearance to recent PET-CT.
No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right, unchanged.
Mildly narrowed SVC, with prominent collaterals.
U/S: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
Narrowing of the right subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet is likely not as contributory.
Although there is a significant conglomerate of tumor, hilar adenopathy, and consolidated lung that extends from the right hilum into the right apex obliterating the right upper, markedly compressing the right middle, and narrowing the right lower lobe bronchi (all of which unchanged in the short interval), the SVC distends normally and the stenosis described seems confined to the distal right brachiocephalic vein.
The small right effusion is changed in distribution but not in size and there is no pericardial effusion.
No suspicious lesions are identified in the spine.
IMPRESSION: Suspected stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein immediately superior to the left brachiocephalic confluence, due to the indwelling catheter, less likely tumor compression as the SVC itself distends normally.
IR guided venogram: 1) venograms demonstrated patent bilateral internal jugular and brachiocephalic veins.
2) Small filling defects in the superior vena cava (catheter- related clot/fibrin sheath).
No evidence of SVC stenosis.
CXR [**7-4**]: There is no change in the known right upper lobe consolidation and atelectasis.
There is interval increase in the right pleural effusion, current to moderate.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are no dilated loops of bowel.
There is no supine evidence for free intraperitoneal air or pneumatosis.
Brief Hospital Course: # Small cell lung cancer T2N2MO(Stage IIIA), diagnosed [**2138**], s/p surgery, chemo w/ cisplatin & etoposide, & radiation.
# Upper extremity edema: The patient was admitted for upper extremity and facial swelling concerning for SVC syndrome.
CT venogram was initially concerning for extrensic compression of the SVC by her tumor but thrombus around the dialysis catheter could not be ruled.
To evaluate her blood vessels and the dialysis catheter, IR performed a venogram which showed no significant abnormalities, no stensosis, no thrombus and no extrensic compression.
# Shortness of breath: On admission, her shortness of breath was at baseline.
She was started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for hospital acquired post obstructive pneumonia.
Review of her CT indicated that she had severe right upper lobe and lower lobe collapse secondary to bronchus compression.
They took the patient for stenting of her right main stem bronchus and a second thoracentesis.
She developed respiratory failure and required reintubation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Due to her lung cancer and bronchus obstruction, the most likely etiology is post-obstructive PNA.
# Bowel ischemia: During her stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she developed bowel ischemia and had a substantial metabolic acidosis with a high lactate.
She had a severe systemic inflammatory response.
She had but she was eventually made CMO due to her poor overall prognosis.
