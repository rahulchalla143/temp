Admission Date:  [**2130-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-12-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Admitted for first cycle of chemotherapy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right basilic PICC placement   History of Present Illness: 71 yo M h/o hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, follicular lymphoma admitted for first cycle of ICE chemotherapy.
The patient had a  left-sided neck adenopathy biopsied in [**5-/2122**], which revealed lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] classical Hodgkin's disease with flow cytometry noted for monoclonal B cells which were CD5 positive, raising the possibility of CLL.
This was felt likely due to persistence of germinal centers and he was treated for stage IA lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] Hodgkin's disease with radiation therapy with a total dose of 3060 centigrade of modified mantle field with three fractions of left neck cone down completed in 09/[**2121**].
CT on [**2127-1-20**] revealed a left pleural mass with biopsy consistent with relapsed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
As he had not received initial chemotherapy, he was treated with ABVD X 6 cycles with complications of neutropenia, necessitating the use of Neupogen, rapid atrial fibrillation, and bleomycin toxicity along with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Recurrent adenopathy noted in [**6-/2128**] with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] size that was followed over time with a slowly increasing adenopathy.
Excisional biopsy of right neck adenopathy done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] on [**2129-3-28**] revealed a follicular lymphoma grade 2.
PET after 2 cycles with marked improvement.
PET scan after 4 cycles with no FDG avidity.
A PET scan on [**2130-1-27**] revealed no FDG-avid disease.
Follow up PET scan on [**2130-5-16**] showed new FDG avid lymphadenopathy in the left infrarenal paraaortic and iliac regions, with the largest paraaortic node measuring 30X16 mm and the SUVmax of 20.4, representing recurrent lymphoma.
There was no other new focal FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
The patient is now admitted to BMT for his first cycle of ICE   Past Medical History: Hodgkin's lymphoma-- dx [**5-/2122**]; tx ABVD x 6 c/b neutropenia, afib w/ RVR, bleomycin pulmonary toxicity, PCP PNA [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] follicular lymphoma-- dx [**6-/2128**]; tx rituxan, doxil, cytoxan x 6 PAF Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Nephrolithiasis Retinal detachment [**6-/2129**] Peripheral neuropathy Psoriasis GERD Vasectomy   Social History: He lives at home with his wife.
Family History: No family history of malignancy.
HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: CTA, BS BL, No W/R/C ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
There is no edema around the incision site.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2130-6-4**] CXR -  As compared to the previous radiograph [**2130-5-31**], there is a mild increase in both cardiac dimensions and caliber of the intrapulmonary vessels.
These could suggest mild fluid overload.
There is no focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71yo Male with lymphoma admitted for ICE, with susequent post-chemo course complicated by AFib and volume overload.
AFib w/ RVR - The patient required trasnfer from the floor to the ICU on the afternoon of [**6-4**] when he developed AFib with RVR 130 - 140's in the setting of volume overload; he received diltiazem 20 mg IV x 2 with improved HR to the 110-120's, however he became hypotensive reportedly to a systolic in the 80's -90's.
On the morning of [**2130-6-6**] he became acutely tachycardic to the 140's -150's, was given IV dilt 10mg with improvement in HR to the 120's-130's, asymptomatic with BP stable throughout.
Follicular lymphoma The patient rec'd ICE therapy at the beginning of this admission.
Lymphoma s/p first cycle of ICE 2.
Atrial Fibrillation 3.
Fluid overload .
Hypertension 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
Peripheral neuropathy 9.
During hospitalization you developed a low grade fever which was treated with antibiotics and fluids.
You developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm) and were found to be overloaded with fluid from your chemotherapy and fever treatment.
Both the atrial fibrillation and fluid overload required IV medications so you were transferred to the ICU.
Please return or call your primary oncologist if you develop a fever > 1004, chills, night sweats or begin to feel unwell.
You should also return or call your oncologist if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough.
