CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-10-20**] 10:12 PM IMPRESSION: Several large ring-enhancing lesions in the cerebellum.
In the setting of advanced metastatic colon cancer, as this patient is known to have, these probably represent colon cancer metastases.

There is also generalized interstitial abnormality which may represent lymphatic tumor invasion.
Small left pleural effusion is present.
No pneumothorax.
Substantial progression of disease with interval increase in size and number of pulmonary lesions and more extensive metastatic involvement of the liver.
New, small left pleural effusion.
