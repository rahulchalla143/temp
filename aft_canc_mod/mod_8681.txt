History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53 year old female with a history of right sided CVA and seizures who has also cardiac compromise from mitral regurgitation who presents to [**Hospital1 827**] after MRI at an outside facility showed a large bifrontal lesion.
The patient had complained about episodes of weakness for the last 6 months.
A workup including MRI was suggested by neurology and the patient was found to have a very large bifrontal meningioma arising from the falx.

Brief Hospital Course: 52 year-old female who has been followed by a neurologist initially presented with episodes of weakness for the last 6 months.
Out side MRI obtained by her neurologist showed bifrontal meningioma then referred to go to ED for neusurgical evaluation.The patient underwent a full work up including a CTA, MRV, and a 4 vessel angiogram which showed dense vascular supply to this lesion from both ethmoidal arteries, right sided anterior falcian artery arising from the ophthalmic artery, a supply from the R ECA and multiple sources of dural supply.
The patient underwent preoperative angiographic embolization and was taken electively to the operating room for bifrontal meningioma resection, pericranial allograft flap and duraplasty under general anesthesia without intraoperaive complications.
The estimated blood loss during the procedure was 1000 ml.
Patient transferred to Neuro ICU for immediate postoperative period for hemodymamic and neurologic monitoring.
She was seen by cardiology for endocarditis in the past who recommened keeping HCT greater than 25.
Her affect appeared to exhibit symptoms of being "frontal" animated and impulsive.
She was seen by PT/OT she was found to have some gait instability and impulsive behavior they recommended acute rehab.
Please call for seizures, fever greater than 101.5, excessive nausea and vomiting, or any questions or acute change in neurologic status  Followup Instructions: discharge to rehab facility.
