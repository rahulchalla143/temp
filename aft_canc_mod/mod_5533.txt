Admission Date:  [**2187-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-11-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-11-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13252**] Chief Complaint: prolonged seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EEG  History of Present Illness: 59yo woman with recently diagnosed renal cell cancer with brain metastases diagnosed by MRI [**11-14**], presented with a prolonged seizure at home.
When she arrived at [**Hospital1 **] (5AM) she was not following commands, and rhythmic eye-blinking was noted, with R eye deviation; she received 6mg total ativan, with some effect (and was following commands again), and given 1gm PHT load.
Past Medical History: renal cell cancer diagnosed in [**8-26**] with a left renal mass, presented with LE swelling.
Now s/p L nephrectomy and adrenalectomy [**9-26**], pathology showing renal cell.
CHF with EF 40-55% mitral valve regurgitation HTN anemia related to folate and iron defic factor [**Last Name (STitle) **] deficiency  Social History: Lives with husband and son, HS education; formerly worked at [**Male First Name (un) 28447**] club/sales, quit tob 30 yrs ago, formerly smoked <1pd x 10 yrs, former etoh, no drugs, no toxic exposures  Family History: son with sz d/o, father d. lung ca with mets to brain; mother d. stroke, sister with cervical ca, brother with cad   Physical Exam: Examination on admission: Afeb HR 120  BP 144/97  RR 20  99%RA General appearance: thin white female HEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx Neck: supple Heart: regular Lungs: clear ant only Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs Extremities: warm, well-perfused  Mental Status: The patient has her eyes open, blinking spontaneously (not rhythmically at this point), staring straight, but can track on command and follow commands to squeeze hand wiggle toes, close eyes; no speech heard  Cranial Nerves: Blinks to threat bilat, optic discs are normal in appearance, eye movements are normal with tracking and with OCR (both vertical and horizontal), no nystagmus.
Sensorimotor: Pt w/d vigorously all 4 ext to stim, squeezes hands and wiggles toes, but did not raise legs off bed.
Imaging: CXR: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Redemonstration of numerous pulmonary lesions consistent with the patient's known metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Head CT [**11-26**]: There is a 14 mm ovoid hyperdense focus in the left frontal lobe, consistent with hemorrhage at the site of the patient's known metastatic lesion.
There is also a significant increase in hypodensity in the surrounding left frontal lobe consistent with edema.
This edema is compressing the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is slight shift of normally midline structures to the right, as shown by subfalcine herniation.
No new areas of hemorrhage are identified.
There is no hydrocephalus.
MRI Head [**11-26**]: The metastasis in the superior left frontal lobe is again demonstrated.
There is more anterior extension of edema as well.
There is now a second punctate lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema, as discussed by the radiology residents with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42460**] on [**11-27**].
The other small areas of FLAIR hyperintensity present on the current study were present previously and no underlying enhancing lesions are seen, most consistent with small vessel disease.
There is new mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] from the left frontal metastasis and edema.
The cerebellar edema does not affect the fourth ventricle.
There is a second punctate enhancing lesion in the left cerebellum with surrounding edema, new since10/25 and most consistent with a second metastasis.
A left frontal lesion appears to have enlarged from approximately 12 to approximately 16 mm since [**11-14**] and there is slightly more surrounding edema with new mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
EEG [**11-27**]: ABNORMALITY #1: Sharp and slow wave complexes over the left anterior quadrant occurred during wakefulness with a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking state due to the periodic sharp and slow wave complexes in the left anterior quadrant occuring at a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz.
No seizures were recorded.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 58yo woman with RCC with metastases to the brain, who presented with a prolonged seizure likely to be focal motor partial status.
The seizure focus was felt to be her L frontal lobe lesion, which was consistent with her symptoms and EEG findings.
She was given 6mg ativan and 1gm dilantin in the ED with resolution of her symptoms.
An EEG showed L frontal spikes occuring approximately every 5 seconds.
She slowly improved over the course of the next several days, with persistent non-fluent aphasia with preserved repetition.
She was continued on dilantin with keppra added for more long term seizure prophylaxis (goal to wean pt of Dilantin and titrate up Keppra on an outpatient basis).
She had an MRI by cyberknife protocol on [**11-26**], which showed a new cerebellar lesion in addition to her frontal lesion.
On [**11-28**], the patient was seen at the radiation planning center for Cyberknife planning regarding the cerebellar lesion and the lesion was radiated on [**11-29**].
was monitored overnight with no clinical evidence of increased edema or mass effect [**2-22**] radiation.
On discharge her exam was significant for a mild non-fluent aphasia as above and mild R sided UMN pattern weakness and R NLF flattening.
