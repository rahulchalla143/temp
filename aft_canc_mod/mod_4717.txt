Admission Date:  [**2146-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-12-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-6-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Morphine / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: increased air hunger   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Video Assisted thoracoscopy with wedge resection from left lung  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old female who is transferred to the MICU following intubation yesterday for decreased oxygen saturations on Post op day 3 for VATS and wedge resection.
In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year, she noticed the sudden onset of right sided pleuritic chest pain, a nonproductive cough and shortness of breath, and presented to the ED where a CXR was obtained that was consistent with PNA.
She then completed a course of levofloxacin but about a month later, she continued to have shortness of breath and cough.
For this reason, a CT was obtained that showed subsegmental pulmonary emboli and other nodules.
The same CT scan of the chest revealed that in the upper right abdomen, there was a large right lower pole renal mass with renal vein invasion.
There was also some paraaortic lymphadenopathy.
Regarding the CT scan, the location of most of these pulmonary nodular infiltrates was peripheral and less accessible to bronchoscopy.
Frozen section unfortunately disclosed what appeared to be an infiltrative poorly differentiated carcinoma with evidence of lymphangitic tumor involvement and the tumor emboli in the vessels.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then sent out to the floor where she developed progressive hypoxemia despite nebulizers, diuresis and nonrebreather.
Chest CT that day revealed worsening lung opactities.
ROS: The patient denies any previous history of hematuria or urinary tract infection.
She reports some weight loss, which is 5 pounds in the last week and about 20 pounds over the last 6 months.
Family History: Negative for malignancies.
There are no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, + distended + Bowel sounds.
EKG: NSR with PVC, NL axis, RBBB, Twave inversion V1, III, no ST segment changes.
Subsegmental pulmonary emboli are not significantly changed from [**12-13**].
Marked progression of consolidative and interstitial changes of the right lung.
These findings may be infectious in nature, and edema and neoplastic change are also within the differential diagnosis.
Post-surgical changes in the lingula, with a small left anterior pneumothorax.
There is also a small amount of air in the left major fissure.
Coronary artery calcifications.
CXR [**12-20**]: Interstitial edema has improved, more markedly in the left lung than the right partially obscuring multifocal nodules and mass like areas of consolidation.
Small right pleural effusion persists.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small cavity in the right mid lung is presumed at the site of wedge resection.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened with probably no stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of osseous metastatic lesions.
Focus of increased tracer uptake within the neck, likely representing degenerative change.
Increased tracer activity noted within the left hip and both ankles, consistent with the patient's history of prior trauma and surgery within these regions.
[**12-14**] LENI: No right or left lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with new finding of renal mass and lung nodules, who was admitted for shortness of breath, found to have pulmonary emboli, and who required intubation post VATS for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
On transfer to the MICU service we treated her with aggressive fluid hydration for decreased urine output, keeping her CVP in the 20's, given her preload dependance due to right heart failure.
She developed a metabolic acidosis which corrected with hydration.
Hypoxia thought to be secondary to PE and lymphangitic carcinoma and possibly infection.
PFTs consistent with restrictive lung disease and decreased diffusion capacity, likely secondary to PEs and carcinoma.
- continue current vent settings as her hypoxemia will not be resolved as the cancer is irreversible.
# Onc: squamous cell cancer, either renal or pulmonary primary.
This cancer is widely metastic and patient is too sick to tolerate therapy.
# PE: patient with subsegmental PEs.
- discontinue cefepime as patient has h/o amox allergy - start levoflox and continue flagyl for 7 day course (day 1 = [**12-19**]) .
# Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease - guiac stools - will check iron studies - transfuse for large HCT drop, or goal HCT > 21 .
# diabetes: on metformin and avandia at home - SSI for now with QID FS .
# HTN: Managed at home on norvasc, benicar and HCTZ.
Here was briefly hypotensive, likely secondary to propofol - discontinue current agents for now as she's normotensive but recently on pressors.
# hypothyroidism: on levoxyl at home - continue levoyxl .
- follow lytes and replete Metabolic Acidosis/Acidemic pH: stable Etiology: Non Gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis secondary to fluid rescusitation (high Chloride load), renal failure (given poor urine output) - follow up chemistries and blood gases, continue LR prn for resucitation for more appropriate buffer .
# prophylaxis: on coumadin, bowel regimen, PPI .
# communication: husband, supposed to come in tomorrow [**12-21**] .
Social work consulted- informative and supportive to family during family meeting.
