Admission Date:  [**2104-7-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-8-6**]   Service:  TRAUMA  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old woman who presented initially to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2104-7-17**] with right sided costovertebral and chest pain status post fall.
Chest x-ray revealed multiple rib fractures, but without evidence of a pneumothorax.
While at home she experienced an episode of acute shortness of breath.
She gives a history of increased frequency of falls.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, bronchitis.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies use or abuse of tobacco or alcohol.
Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the right base.
There is a right chest tube without any evidence of air leak.
She has a lower midline scar from a previous surgical incision.
Her extremities are warm and without evidence of edema.
RADIOLOGY:  Dedicated films of the ribs revealed right rib fractures of 8, 9, 10 and 11 and a potential fracture of ribs 7 and 8.
Chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax after chest tube placement.
Follow up x-rays revealed no persistent pneumothorax.
During her hospitalization she was given an extubation trial on hospital day number one, which she failed becoming tachypneic and unable to breath several minutes after the extubation.
She had frequent bronchospastic episodes where she was unable to pass air.
Generally these episodes resulted in the need for increased sedation and increased reliance on mechanical ventilation.
Efforts included direct laryngoscopy using a Bougie and fiberoptic intubation.
Neurological:  Mrs.[**Known lastname 101004**] pain was initially treated with rib blocks and ultimately treated with an epidural catheter.
The epidural catheter was eventually discontinued when she became hypotensive.
During this hospitalization she was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Management of her volume status and cardiac status necessitated the need for a pulmonary artery catheter.
Placement of the pulmonary catheter revealed pulmonary hypertension.
This pulmonary hypertension was felt to be complicating her pulmonary status.
She was also placed on Carafate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
Infectious disease:  Sputum cultures during this hospitalization grew out Enterobacter and coag positive staph.
On admission her creatinine was 1.4 and exhibiting some degree of baseline renal dysfunction.
Additionally, complicating Mrs.[**Known lastname 101004**] picture was an initial CT scan of her abdomen obtained in the Emergency Department revealed bilateral renal masses.
It was felt that these were most consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
A long discussion with the family concerning her pulmonary status, her acute renal failure and the presence of metastatic disease to decide her further course.
At this point her pulmonary status, renal status and the possible evidence of metastatic disease were brought to the family.
