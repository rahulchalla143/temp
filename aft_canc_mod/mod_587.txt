The patients blood pressure was found to be slightly low as well in the range of 90-110/40-60.
Past Medical History: # Metastatic Breast CA: Infiltrating ductal breast cancer (Stage II) diagnosed in [**11-3**] -- s.p Right mastectomy for a 3.7cm breast tumor which was grade III, pT2, zero of five lymph nodes and ER negative, PR negative, and Her2/neu negative.
--Admitted [**4-4**] with HA found to have brain metastases, XRT started completed [**2152-5-9**] on dexamethasone taper --[**5-4**] CTA showing large mass within the left lower lobe abutting the pleura with central cavitation, most consistent with metastases # CAD s/p CABG and remote history of angioplasty.
--CABG in [**2143-1-28**]((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, jump SVG-RI-OM occluded) --cardiac cath on [**2149-8-18**] for her increasing angina and positive stress test.
They were unable to put a stent in her SVG graft, LIMA patent # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Congestive heart failure --Admission [**4-3**] with acute pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
She was found to have an EF in the 30% range on echo; echo [**5-3**] EF 50%, Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction, PCWP >18 # DM Type II (last Hgb A1c 6.2 in [**12-3**]); h/o DKA in the past # H.pylori # Esophageal webbing # Ovarian cyst--- rising CA125 -> plan for lap BSO, held [**1-29**] brain mets # Hypothyroidism, Surgery for a thyroid nodule # Gout   Social History: Patient is married and lives with her husband who has diabetes and is disabled in [**Location (un) 669**].
Family History: The patient denies family history of malignancies in her uterus, breast, colon, ovary, or cervix.
Physical Exam: VS: 97.5 107 90/41 90-95% RA Gen: ill appearing but NAD, alopecia Heent: OP dry, anicteric, edentulous Neck: supple, JVP flat CV: nl S1 S2, RRR, distant Lungs: coarse crackles left base, milder on right, good air movement otherwise Abd: obese, echymoses b/l lower quadrants, soft, NT, BS+ Ext: warm, trace edema b/l Neuro: A&O x 3, CN intact, appropriate, full strength, limited on right by pain, sensations intact.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD [**2152-6-10**] Multiple hyperdense foci of the left hemisphere including parasagittal, anterior left frontal and the left parietal have decreased in size; for example, the left anterior frontal lesion measured 10 mm on the prior study and now measures 5 mm.
No evidence of edema is noted within the brain.
Previously mentioned shift of midline structure has completely resolved.
One of the residual sequelae of the prior disease is noted within the right subinsular white matter.
The bone windows demonstrate mild mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus.
Interval resolution of multiple hemorrhagic foci with small residual lesions in the left hemisphere.
There has also been resolution of the mass effect of the metastasis and surrounding edema  ECHO [**2152-6-5**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Interval resolution of pulmonary edema.
No significant change to small bilateral effusions and fluid-filled rounded opacity corresponding to known left lower lobe cavity.
Interval development of multiple pulmonary nodules.
Given the short interval, infection and/or septic emboli should be considered.
Minimal increase in left lower lobe lung mass with what appears to be a necrotic center.
No evidence of active hemorrhage within this lesion.
Interval increase of multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, which at baseline were pathological and now also increased in size due to likely reactive.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 F with metastatic breast CA to brain and lung, on steroid taper, DM II, CAD s/p CABG,admitted with DKA and sepsis.
Pt on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for presumed pulmonary source given LLL mass with necrotic area on CT scan.
Blood, urine, stool samples were negative for source of infection.
Leukocytosis worsenend after receiving high dose steroids but patient remained afebrile and hypotension improved.
# Hypoxia: Known diastolic dysfunction.
Required volume resuscitation in setting of DKA and hypotension and patient developed severe pulmonary edema.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis: Glucose elevated to 400s with anion gap of 19 on admission.
# Acidosis: Initially due to DKA.
Then later developed lactic acidosis with elevated lactate to 3.9.
Likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension.
# Renal Failure: Likely related to hypotension and sepsis.
Urine lytes consistent with pre renal etiology.
# Metastatic Breast CA to lung and brain.
CXR showing evidence of rapid growth of likely metastatic mass in lung.
CT with evidence of necrotic mass in left lower lobe, nonhemorrhagic, and multiple nodules consistent with infection.
Received steroids for brain mets with resolution on most recent CT head.
Patient continued to be treated for symptoms with fentanyl and lidocaine patches for pain control and IV morphine for breakthrough pain.
Anemia felt to be multifactorial, secondary to bone marrow suppresion from sepsis and malignancy as well as phlebotomy and dilutional component with volume resuscitation.
# Thrombocytopenia: Initially concerned for consumptive process such as DIC given sepsis or HIT.
Also likely multifactorial with bone marrow suppression or medication related.
- Continued Statin - held BB/ACEI given hypotension .
