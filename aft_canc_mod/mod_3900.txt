Admission Date:  [**2133-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-9-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-12-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: OMED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Pain, change in mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radiation Therapy to T5 and L3 lesions(10 and 14 treatments, respectively)   History of Present Illness: 62 y/o man with unusually agressive metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma presented to the ED [**8-24**] with 2 week history of increasing back pain.
In the ED, patient became tachycardic, hypertensive and his oxygen satuartions hovered in the low to mid 90% range despite oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.
The patient grew lethargic and was alert and oriented x 1 only.
His abdomen was distended, but not terribly tender; he had a history of constipation as well.
CT abdomen was negative for perforation, but the patient was admitted to the surgical ICU for further work-up and treatment.
Given his mental status changes, a head CT was performed which was negative for acute pathology.
CTA showed pneumonia but no PE.
Metastatic disease, most marked in the retroperitoneum and along the left  iliac lymph node chain.
Not significantly changed in size or distribution  since the PET examination of [**2133-8-20**].
Bibasilar consolidation consistent with pneumonia and mild pulmonary  edema.
No perforation.
Suboptimal examination of the abdomen due to suboptimal patient positioning  An MRI of the spine was then performed as the patient had considerable lower extremity weakness.
The results of that study are as follows:  Further compression of the T5 vertebral body results in canal compromise and cord compression.
In the lumbosacral region there is further compression deformity of L3 but no neural compression.
There is extensive prevertebral tumor.
He had left radical groin lymph node dissection by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**] on [**2133-5-26**], with 6 of 9 lymph nodes showing poorly differentiated SCC with focal extracapsular extension.
In advance of inguinal radiation therapy for his resected SCC, repeat PET scanning on [**2133-7-8**] compared to a [**5-1**] PET scan showed new uptake of FDG in left iliac, bilateral para-aortic lymph nodes, and T5 and L3 vertebral bodies.
An area of fainter uptake in the left supraclavicular area was attributed to "brown fat."
Findings were felt c/w metastatic SCC, supported by FNA cytology of the left iliac mass.
ROS: Currently, pt is in pain with slightest movement.
Baseline [**7-7**] pain improved with Dilaudid PCA.
Movement increases pain to [**9-6**], worse lower back > upper back.
+20lb weight loss over the past 3 months.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history as above Hypertension s/p Excision of colonic polyps h/o basal cell ca h/o chronic prostatitis  Social History: Denies any history of smoking since college.
Family History: Paternal GF with gastric CA, paternal GM with Esophageal CA, maternal GF with Colon CA, maternal GM with Pancreatic CA.
Lungs- Decreased breath sounds at bases anteriorly, no crackles/wheeze CV- rrr, nml, audible S1S2, II/VI SM, no r/g Abd- soft but moderately distended  - non-tender, no peritoneal signs, no masses appreciated, tympanic to percussion, no rebound/guarding.
Rectal- deferred secondary to pain Back- deferred secondary to pain Ext- spontaneous movt of all four extremities; LE: warm, trace edema bilaterally.
Strength upper extremities [**4-1**] bilaterally(biceps/triceps/deltoids), lower extremities [**4-1**] plantar/dorsiflexion(no pain elicited), [**3-2**] hip flexors bilaterally - limited [**12-29**] pain.

Pt tranferred to OMED service for radiologic and medical management of vertebral mets causing neurologic impingement.
Other sentinel issues on transfer include pain control, pneumonia and constipation.
1) SCC: Mr [**Known lastname **] has known aggressive SCC with metastasis to retroperitoneum and spine (T5 now with retropulsion of bone and cord compression and L3 with [**Last Name (un) 2043**] involvement).
Other than b/l hip weakness R>L likely secondary to pain, Mr [**Known lastname **] had no neurologic deficits on exam on admission to OMED - no sensory loss, numbness/tingling/bladderincontinence.
Neurosurgery recommended radiation to affected areas without preceeding surgery.
After [**4-2**] radiation treatments, his back pain had minimal improvement, but unfortunately around that time he began c/o pain at R knee when weight bearing.
X-ray of R femur/ knee were done to r/o pathologic/impending pathologic fracture which were both which were negative for signs of fx.
The right knee pain continued to increase over the next few days, to the point where Mr. [**Known lastname **] could not participate in PT or even get out of bed.
The knee/hip films were reviewed with the radiologists who did not feel that the vague sclerotic lesion seen in R tibia and R femur could be causing pt's symptoms.
At this point, it was thought that the R knee pain was likely referred pain from tumor infiltrating lumar/sacral plexus.
Repeat MRI of L spine was ordered on [**9-10**] which showed evidence of L3 compression fx and more retropulsion of fragments and reduction in the anterior/posterior dimension of the thecal sac by approximately 50% but CSF is still visible around the cauda equina.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1327**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 1132**] (both in neurosurgery) and it was decided that neurosurgery is not indicated, in large part because pain was improving at this point from XRT and he had good results symptomatically at the irradiated T5 site.
Furthermore, surgery would include risks of general anaesthesia, incisional wound healing, and potential complications from the procedures.
Also surgery would delay systemic chemotherapy which primary oncology team wanted to initiate as soon as possible since his disease has been so aggressive.
Because ANC is below 1000, please put Mr. [**Known lastname **] on neutropenic preacuations and private room.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncologist, at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9645**] if Mr. [**Known lastname **] develops a fever and get CBC with differential.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28988**] office with any questions that you have regarding Mr. [**Known lastname 55795**] care or if he develops new onset of weakness, numbness/tingling, fevers or other worrisome symptoms.Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncologist, at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9645**] if Mr. [**Known lastname **] develops a fever and get CBC with differential.
Decadron was continued during hospitalization for vertebral mets and pain control.
He continued to have uncontrolled pain on this regimen and his fentanyl patch was progressively increased to 250 micrograms.
Acute pain service evaluated patient.
By time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 55795**] pain was well controlled on Fentanyl patch (250mcg) and neurontin.
3) PNA: PNA on admission both clinically and per CT chest.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have pulmonary edema on CXR on [**8-27**], likely secondary to aggressive IVF hydration for chemotherapy.
He responded well to PO diuresis with no further episodes.
4)ID: Blood cultures from [**8-24**] - 2/4 bottles with GNR - Salmonella species sensitive to both levofloxacin and ampicillin - both of which he was already taking for PNA.
Patient has had extensive imaging of head/abd/pelvis/chest since admission with no sign of active internal bleeding and stool guiaic negative.
Possibly secondary to chemotherapy vs dilutional effect from aggresive hydration.
Hct improved throughout admission with no need for transfusion and was 26.4 on day prior to discharge.
6) Constipation: Pateint experienced constipation throughout admission and was treated successfully with aggressive bowel regimen - including colace, senna, dulcolax, lacutulose, and enema as needed.
7) Prostate Cancer - Patient had received 2 lupron injections prior to admission(8/25,[**8-20**]).
SBP's on transfer to OMED were consistently between 170-200 likely secondary to pain and fluid overload, and his outpatient HCTZ and actopril were restarted.
However, with chemo/radiation pain improved and he restarted training.
10) PPX: Bowel regimen; prophylactic SQ heparin; PPI, Blood sugar levels well controlled but will cont regular insulin sliding scale for coverage given high dose steroids.
[**Month (only) 116**] stop sliding scale at end of steroid taper.
Hyponatremia - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a few episodes of hyponatremia during admission - hypovolumic hyponatremia per exam and labs.
He was started on celexa as his progressive disease, pain, and prognosis had impacted his mental state.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: 45-60 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma: newly diagnosed spinal lesions (at T5 and L3).
Pneumonia - resolved on discharge 3.
Hyponatremia - resolved 5.
Thrombocytopenia - after chemotherapy 6.
Right Knee Pain   Discharge Condition: stable, but weak  Discharge Instructions: Discharge to rehabilitation facility Please continue all medications.
If ANC falls below 1000, please put Mr. [**Known lastname **] on neutropenic preacuations and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further instructions and treatment.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncologist, at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9645**] if Mr. [**Known lastname **] develops a fever and get CBC with differential.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] office with any questions that you have regarding Mr. [**Known lastname 55795**] care or if he develops new onset of weakness, numbness/tingling, fevers or other worrisome symptoms.
