No infectious symptoms and no report of chest pain.
However, he did have a bout of pneumonia 2 weeks ago hence was on levaquin for 10 days which finished 5 days prior to admission.
Patient walks with a cane at baseline and has mild dementia but still highly independent - he still drives, pays own bills and takes own meds.

Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: No dysmetria with FTN but had difficulty comprehending the task.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
The CT perfusion study demonstrates ischemia in the distribution of the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery.
Questionable focal loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation in the posterior left temporal lobe on the non-contrast CT scan is also inconclusive with respect to the presence of an acute infarction.
Extensive cervical and intracranial atherosclerosis.
Moderate, 50% stenosis in the proximal left internal carotid artery.
Mild stenoses at the origins of both vertebral arteries.
Abrupt cut-off in a small distal branch of the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery, likely related to embolic occlusion.
Not clear if pleural effusions are present.
Cervical spondylosis.
Several small diffusion abnormalities in the left temporal and left basal ganglia consistent with acute infarct in the posterior division of the left MCA.
No evidence of acute large hemorrhage, mass, or small microvascular hemorrhages.
Small vessel ischemic disease.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is an 83 yo man with pmhx of DM, HTN, CAD, CHF with EF 20%, Afib, HCC here with acute MCA stroke managed with [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Head CT without acute changes [**3-20**].
Resolving defecits on exam and dysarrthria improved as well on discharge.
The elevated INR was thought to be due to lack of nutrition, antibiotics and liver disease (he has HCC).
Speech and swallow initially thought he was an aspiration risk because of his poor mental status, but as his mental status improved, he was able to eat purreed food with thickened liquids and per nurse was not aspirating at all.
# Mental status changes: Patient was intermittently agitated and somnolent.
We treated the UTI with ceftriaxone and the hypernatremia with D5 W and his mental status improved.
He still has some short-term memory problems but patient has early dementia at baseline.
# Hypernatremia: likely due to poor po intake when somnolent.
# CHF with EF 15-20%: Patient received fluids after his stroke and lasix was held.
He became very overloaded with 2+ pitting edema to his knees on exam and crackles on lung exam.
On discharge, his respiratory status was improved and his LE edema was resolved.
We continued him on 40 mg po lasix but his volume status should be watched closely and this should be adjusted based on his clinical exam.
# Hyperlipidemia: increased atorvastatin on this admission.
# Dementia: continued donepezil .
# FEN: restarted pureed diet with thick liquids per s/s eval [**3-22**] and per nurse, no aspiration events.
# Access: PIV .
# Code: DNR/I- confirmed with his wife- HCP   Medications on Admission: 1.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
