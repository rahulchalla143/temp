He was of normal mental status on arrival but has had confusion and delirium since he was extubated which is the reason for transfer to medicine.
He has also been receiving dilaudid po/iv prn and methocarbamol for pain control.
He has very poor dentition but recent dental work (most recently 5 years ago), his only recent surgery was hernia repair 2 months ago with mesh placement and does have urethral implant.
Hospital course is notable for WBC 17.6 with 18 bands on admission with recent WBC of 12.9 and no diff done.
There was question of some nucal rigidity yesterday which has now resolved, no LP done given surgical site.
While in the sicu patient was noted to have mild hand tremulousness but patient and family (per PA) deny any alcohol abuse.
Of note pt had 6 french foley which required intraoperative placement after dilation and rigid cystoscopy by urology due to his urethral implants and artifical sphincter.

Although much of this could merely reflect atelectasis and effusion, the possibility of supervening pneumonia must be seriously considered.
Mild atelectatic changes are again seen at the right base.
Echo [**11-27**] No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Right maxillary sinus disease.
A sharp metallic surgical instrument with a curved tip is projected posterior to the lowest lumbar-type vertebral body.
Extensive fluid collection between the thecal sac and posterior musculature, with an enhancing rim.
While this may represent a post-operative seroma, infection cannot be excluded.
More focal areas of rim-enhancing fluid within the left psoas and left posterior paraspinal musculature at the L2 level and a tiny focus of probable epidural abscess abutting the left thecal sac at the S1 level.
Within limitations described above, no evidence of pulmonary embolus in the main pulmonary artery, lobar or segmental branches.
Partially loculated left pleural effusion with enhancing parietal pleura raises the question of infection, though an exudative effusion could also have this apperance.
Volume loss in the left lower lobe with possible small area of infection inferiorly.
Atelectasis in the right lower lung.
Allowing for differences in technique, no significant difference in known psoas abscess and appearance of the paraspinal muscles with fluid collection between the thecal sac and posterior muscles, for which infection can not be excluded.
Tubular intermediate density fluid in the left mediastinum adjacent to the left pleural effusion without enhancing rim.
18 mm enhancing intramural and exophytic gastric antral mass has an appearance most consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).
Multiple well circumscribed sclerotic lesions in the right hemipelvis likely represent bone islands.
Tiny hypodensity in the dome of the liver likely a simple cyst but too small to further characterize.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, too small to further characterize but likely simple cysts.
Small right thyroid lesion likely a colloid cyst.
Small loculated left pleural effusion.
There is no free effusion.
Moderate left basilar atelectasis, and plate like right basilar atelectasis unchanged.
Persistent loculated left basal pleural effusion, which has decreased in size since prior CT [**2163-12-4**].
A small area of arterial hyperenhancement in segment [**Doctor First Name **] of the liver may represent a small hemangioma, but is too small to characterize.
Laminectomy is identified at the T11 and T12 vertebrae, following management of epidural abscess.
Partial drainage of the left lower lobe fluid collection, the position of the tip of the pigtail catheter may not be optimally positioned to drain the residual medial component of collection.
Unchanged extrapleural, left paraspinal fluid collection of uncertain significance, could be due to a separate nidus of infection or possibly an unrealted nerve sheath tumor of mixed fat and soft tissue components.
Slight increase subcutaneous fluid collection overlying the laminectomy at T11-T12, abscess or seroma, readily accessible to percutaneous drainage.
There are pleural parenchymal changes seen in the left base consistent with previous empyema and prior pigtail catheter placement.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
There is again seen a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY 61 yo male with PMH significant for HTN, HL, umbilical hernia repair 2 months agos who presented to an OSH on [**2163-11-25**] with severe LBP, fever to 101.3, and left foot drop and was found to have an L3 epidural abscess.
The delirium progressively resolved with rationalization of pain medication and treatment of infection which includes Strep milleri epidural abscess and LLL empyema.
BY PROBLEM # Epidural abscess: Likely odontogenic infection (Strep Milleri).
No obvious source of infection was noted.
# Left Lower Lobe PNA c/b Empyema:  On transfer to medicine, patient noted to be febrile with consolidation on CXR.
A repeat CT chest showed a persistant loculated empyema that was mildly decreased from prior.
Since the second drain had minimal output, thoracic surgery was consulted.
On day 3, the drainage output had markedly decreased.
Another repeat chest CT was performed and it showed resolution of the loculations with minimal fluid in pleural space that the position of the pigtail catheter would not be able to drain.
Since he remained afebrile with no elevations in white count, no further intervention was performed.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 40095**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one week after discharge and obtain a non-contrast chest CT.  # Incontinence: patient with deactivated urethral stricture.
To be discharged on condom catheter and f/u with urologist for reactivation of urethral stricture.
# Altered Mental Status: This was his reason for transfer to medicine, we feel that it was related to medications with an infectious component.
To avoid worsening his condition, His pain control escalation was cautious with tramadol on [**11-28**], Oxycodone on [**11-29**] and Oxycontin with oxycodone breakthrough on [**11-30**].
His mental status cleared with pain control on Oxycontin 20/30 and prn oxycodone and resolution of his infection.
Unclear etiology for poor control, most likely in setting of pain.
# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW with obvious drop 37-30 after surgery but still very low to begin with.
Iron studies likely to confirm chronic inflammation anemia or.
Patient needs colonoscopy outpatient  # Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin  # Gout flare: Patient complained of right toe pain similar to previous gout flares.
No other complaints during hospital stay.
# Gastric mass: noted incidentally on abdominal CT, radiographically consistent with GIST.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] health care center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary  Epidural Abscess  Bacterial Pneumonia  Delirium Secondary  Hypertension  Dyslipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for management of your epidural abscess.
After surgery, you were delirious which was likely related to infection and medications.
You were noted to have a left lower lobe infection which required placement of a drain in your lung that was placed through your skin.
A repeat CT scan showed an improvement, with a small amount of fluid in your pleural space.
You improved and were discharged to complete the treatment of your infection and rehabilitation.
You also had a mass in your stomach noted on CT scan.
NEW MEDICATION Ceftriaxone - take this medication until [**2163-1-19**] Oxycontin - this is a long acting pain medication.
You will need to taper this medication with your PCP as your pain improves Oxycodone - this is a short acting medication to use as breakthrough Senna and Colace - these are medications to prevent constipation while on pain medication  You should contact your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience fevers/chills, difficulty breathing, severe chest pain, confusion, or any other symptom that is concerning to you.
Please tell your PCP:  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] needed as outpatient to further evaluate incidental gastric mass noted on CT consistent with GIST radiographically.
