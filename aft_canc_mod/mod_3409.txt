There CXR showed right sided pleural effusion(concerning for an empyema).
Per his wife he had been having pain in his right groin for about a week.
Pain improved with ibuprofen (800mg [**Hospital1 **] for 3 days) and heating pad.
Pain migrated up to his right side of the chest wall.
No fevers, chills.
Has been having cough with a small amount of sputum and occasionally blood.

[**3-14**] CXR:  FINDINGS:  Compared with 04/16, allowing for differences in position, the left pleural effusion is probably not significantly changed.
No CHF .
Complex-appearing right pleural effusion, with loculated components.
There is dense consolidative change with cystic spaces within the right lower lobe.
The finding is concerning for a cavitating pneumonia.
However, this lung parenchyma is not evaluated for an underlying mass lesion, and one cannot be excluded.
Severe emphysematous changes of the lungs.
Scattered nodular opacities within the left lung.
Small pericardial effusion.
5 cm arterially enhancing mass of the liver at the confluence of hepatic veins, not characterized.
Multiple hepatic cysts are seen, the largest of which is in the right lobe measuring 4.3 x 3.8 x 4.3 cm.
Additionally, there is a hypoechoic solid lesion in the lateral aspect of the right lobe measuring 5.2 x 5.6 x 4.7 cm.
Multiple small stones are seen within the gallbladder and the wall is thickened measuring 3 mm, however this is likely related to hypoalbuminemia as there is a small amount of ascites and large left pleural effusion.
Common hepatic duct measures 1.3 cm and the pancreatic duct is also mildly dilated measuring 0.3 cm.
No discrete pancreatic head mass is identified.
Limited views of the kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
An additional solid hypoechoic vascular mass is seen above the left kidney measuring 3.3 x 2.6 x 3.4 cm.
Solid hypoechoic masses are seen in the right lobe of the liver and above the left kidney, concerning for metastases.
Recommend CT of the abdomen for metastatic work-up, or hepatic MRI if there is clinical concern for a primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
Multiple hepatic cysts.
Dilatation of the common hepatic duct and pancreatic duct with no discrete mass seen in the pancreatic head.
Cholelithiasis and gallbladder wall edema, likely related to  hypoalbuminemia.
A small amount of ascites and large left pleural effusion.
[**3-1**] ECHO: EF 75-80% Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2-25**] Pleural fluid negative for malignancy .
Poorly defined predominantly hyperehancing mass within the medial right hepatic dome just to the right of the IVC surrounding and narrowing the right hepatic vein.
CT imaging characteristics are not specific but differential includes hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma or even a solitary metastasis.
Further charactherization of this mass is recommended with MRI.
Complex right lower lobe empyema/parapneumonic effusion.
There is an adjacent right lower lobe consolidation.
Decrease in the more simple-appearing left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
Several left upper quadrant splenules.
Multiple hepatic and renal cysts.
Descending and sigmoid colonic diverticula.
2-3 mm lingula nodule.
Length of follow up (3-6 months vs 1 year) should be determined based on whether the patients has a primary malignancy .
Immunostains of the tumor are strongly positive for cytokeratin CK7, weakly positive for CK20, and negative for TTF-1, with satisfactory controls.
Note:  The tumor histology and immunostains are most consistent with a biliary/pancreatic origin, including both primary cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic disease.
No signs of bleeding.
Persistent right empyema with adjacent opacities consistent with pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.
Increased intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as well as somewhat increased prominence of the pancreatic duct.
This could suggest an obstructive process near the ampulla, and although no stone or clot is directly observed there, the presence of a stone or blood clot would often not be observable on CT. 4.
Labs on discharge: Na 140  Cl 104  BUN 16  Glc 99 K 3.7  CO2 30  Cr 0.5 Phos: 2.0  WBC 12.1 Hgb 8.6/Hct 26.1 Plts 711     Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 74 yo male with a history of COPD admitted with Strep milleri empyema, now s/p CT tube removal and full course abx, with intercurrent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of likely biliary primary, course complicated by recurrent aspiration pna and blood loss anemia .
# Blood loss anemia- Patient has chronic, macrocytic anemia likely due to alcohol use; B12 and folate were within normal limits.
However, Hct acutely dropped from 25.5 on [**3-27**] to 19.1 on [**3-29**]; EGD, [**Last Name (un) **], CT torso all negative for source of bleeding and Hct responded appropriately to 2units PRBCs and remained stable at 26-27.
Then, after PEG placement, patient had maroon, guaiac positive stool x1, remained hemodynamically stable.
Lavage from PEG was clear/yellow, no blood seen.
CT abd/pelvis did not reveal any bleeding around PEG site.
Discussed with GI briefly possible additional work-up for unexplained Hct drops; ERCP or push enteroscopy with side view scope could identify hematobilia if present, although this is unlikely as explanation of bleeding requiring transfusion since hematobilia would be more chronic; they could perform procedure diagnostically but there would not be endoscopic therapeutic options.
Therefore, monitor Hct and transfusing supportively may be best option for this patient.
# Recurrent/aspiration pna: after completing full course (5 weeks) antibiotics for Strep milleri pneumonia with empyema drained with chest tubes, patient had increasing rhonchi, leukocytosis, low grade fevers.
Given his known aspiration risk and prolonged hospital stay, treating empirically with zosyn/vanc for total 3 weeks, which will be through [**4-24**].
# persistent leukocytosis: WBC remains [**11-11**] thousand despite long course of antibiotics directed at empyema; afebrile.
Neurosurg/spine saw patient and reviewed films, recommended TLSO brace only if patient having pain that limits ambulation.
# Adenocarcinoma: Per pathology prelim read, biopsy specimen c/w adenocarcinoma (not hepatocellular), unlikely lung or colon based on immunohistochemical staining so most likely cholangiocarcinoma.
No h/o prostate CA and PSA wnl.
+ strong smoking history so possibility of Lung ca w/ met but no obvious lesion on CT chest.
# Thrombocytosis- Multifactorial, from alcohol, iron deficiency, and inflammation.
# s/p percutaneous gastrostomy-jejunal feeding tube: Patient required feeding tube for aspiration risk; speech and swallow therapists optimistic that patient will be able to regain swallow function with exercise.
Pain meds for tenderness at insertion site.
