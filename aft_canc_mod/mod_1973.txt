New left moderate hydroureteronephrosis, with no obstructing stone visualized.
Multiple new lytic circular lesions within the pelvis and spine highly concerning for malignancy, notably myeloma.
No aneurysm or evidence of leak.
Lack of IV contrast limits evaluation for dissection or penetrating ulcer.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-5-2**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Multiple lesions throughout the spine, particularly in the thoracic and lumbar spines, may be consistent with multiple myeloma or metastases.
Complete myelomatous or metastatic replacement of the T8 vertebral body with compression fracture and epidural involvement at this level which encases the spinal cord, without evidence of compression.
Mild superior endplate compression at L3.
[**2175-5-22**] echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
NO UROTHELIAL CELLS SEEN.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
Samples were sent to pathology for additional testing.
No evidence of dilated bowel loops is present.
No evidence of free air is demonstrated within the limitation of this supine radiograph.
Renal U/S [**6-1**]: IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of left-sided hydronephrosis.
DIAGNOSIS: I. T8 vertebral lesion, biopsy (frozen section) (A-B): Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving soft tissue and bone.
T8 vertebral lesion, biopsy (C): Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving bone.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
Previous right lower lobe consolidation not well evaluated given pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Severe diffuse bilateral emphysema.
Multiple spinal lytic lesions and replacement/collapse of T9 vertebral body as previously identified.
Bone scan [**6-5**]: IMPRESSION: No discrete foci of increased radiotracer uptake.
No evidence of large neck mass, although study is limited by lack of IV contrast administration.
Bilateral pleural effusions, associated atelectasis, and severe emphysematous changes redemonstrated.
Multiple lytic lesions seen in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.
There may be minimally displaced fracture of the posterior process of T1 where there is underlying lytic lesion.
There is also suggestion of fracture of indeterminate age along the posterior left second rib, where there is also underlying lytic lesion.
Two regions of hypodensity may represent sequela from ischemic disease or may represent edema from underlying lesions.
5-mm lytic lesion in the occipital bone is concerning for metastasis in this patient with multiple known lytic bone lesions.
Compared to [**2175-5-21**], there is worsening of the compression fracture in the T8 vertebral body which demonstrates complete metastatic replacement.
There is increased retropulsion of the posterior portion of the fracture into the spinal canal with associated new moderate-to-severe compression of the spinal cord at this level.
Multiple lesions are redemonstrated throughout the spine.
However, there appears to be increase replacement of the L2 vertebral body with new compression deformity with approximately 40% height loss centrally.
There also appears to be increased anterior wedge compression of the T7 vertebral body.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77M w/ h/o recurrent hematuria requiring bladder irrigation leading to urinary retention, who presented with 10/10 sharp back pain radiating to lower abdomen, s/p hemoptysis, hypoxia found to have multiple lytic spine lesions c/w metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
# Back pain from metastatic carcinoma complicated by cord compression: Likely from compression fx at T8 as well as multiple lytic lesions seen on MRI/CT from C.spine-L.spine.
Etiologies included multiple myeloma, metastatic renal cell, thyroid ca, lymphoma.
s/p biopsy of L4 on [**5-25**],  with non-specific pathology results.
Repeat biopsy T spine [**6-1**] showed metastatic sq cell carcinoma.
On [**6-7**] pt was found to have cord compression, confirmed by neurology consult as well as repeat T-spine MRI.
Currently, pt is getting liquid oral concentrated morphine with excellent effect and minimal side effects.
Pt is also on antiemetics and an aggressive bowel regimen.
It will also be very important for pt to receive scheduled anti-emetics for nausea control.
Pt also found to have apparent leg contractures.
Etiologies included medication effect (got 0.25mg ativan that night), he is on chronic narcotics so doubtful this was due to pain control.
Other possibilities included stroke/intracranial bleed or mets to the brain, however CT scans negative for acute process.
That same day pt was found to have cord compression after neuro consult and  repeat MRI of the T-spine.
# Hypoxia due to bacterial pneumonia - PT has had episodoes of hypoxia.
Pt had hemoptysis and ?consolidation on Chest CT while in ICU.
Suspected pulmonary source given some cough and O2 requirement.
He did not display signs of aspiration.
CXR showed small effusions with ?RLL consolidation.
PT did not display symptoms to suggest a COPD flair.
However, he was continued on his advair and eventually treated with steroids for cord compression.
# Hypercalcemia: Likely secondary to lytic bone disease/malignancy, PTH low, Calcium now normalized.
Etiologies included narcotic overdose (but AAOx3/though sleepy), acute bleed (s/p OR [**6-1**]-has anemia at baseline/being transfused), sepsis (no white count/fever or other localizing symptoms), PE-on anticoagx2, CTA negative, ACS-EKG unchanged, CXR grossly unchanged.
# Acute on chronic renal dx: Thought to be originally secondary to diabetes.
Acute component in setting of diuresis +/- polyclonal gammopathy.
SPEP showing polyclonal gammopathy.
Recent renal U/S showing resolution of L.sided hydronephrosis and an atrophic R.kidney.
#Hemoptysis: One episode of hemoptysis on [**5-21**].
CT chest showed a possible RLL pneumonia with bronchograms, vs BAC.
ANCA neg, anti-GBM neg to r/o a pulmonary-renal syndrome as a cause.
# Urinary retention: Thought to be from extended Foley for bladder irrigation for hematuria, s/p ureteral stent and removal.
Pt also has BPH and he was continued on his BPH medications.
# anemia: Found to be ACD picture, baseline 25-27.
Pt underwent daily HCT, iron studies showed anemia of chronic dx, lysis labs were within normal limits.
# HTN: continued on metoprolol, Imdur .
# DM-continued on NPH, humalog sliding scale.
# Access: indwelling PICC .
It has been controlling his pain with good effect and minimal side effects.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID PRN as needed for anxiety: hold for sedation, respiratory depression.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location 15289**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Major: metastatic squamous cell carcinoma back pain secondary to metastatic cancer spinal cord compression hypoxia  Minor: Acute on chronic renal failure hypercalcemia urinary retention diabetes hemoptysis-resolved, likely cardiac   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for back pain and were found to have multiple lesions in the bones throughout your body.
You were taken to the operating room for biopsy which found metastatic squamous cell cancer.
You also developed a condition called cord compression for which you were started on steroids and received 5 doses of radiation therapy to your spine with good effect.
You also had some episodes of hypoxia for which you were ruled out for a blood clot in the lungs and were treated for a possible pneumonia.
If you develop fevers/chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, new weakness of the arms/legs, numbness/tingling of the arms or legs or any other concerning symptom please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
