Over the weekend he experienced some lower leg aches and took 2 regular strength aspirin on saturday.
On Sunday he felt fine but had no bowel movement.
This morning at 5am pt awoke and felt the urge to defecate, which was unusual as he never feels this in the mornings, and he passed a large volume of what he thought was diarrhea but saw dark red blood in the toilet.
In the ED he had another large volume bloody diarrhea around noon.
Pt states he has never had red blood per rectum before.
Of note, pt had a colonoscopy on [**10-30**] that showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and ascending colon, a polyp at 80cm in the colon (single piece polypectomy with cold snare), and friability and congestion in the sigmoid colon.
Pt does also have a history of hepatitis C, untreated (per pt preference) and history of Hep B core antibody + in [**2111**].
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt felt well, had no complaints.
HPI from admission to Internal [**Name (NI) **] (pt was transferred to [**2-9**] service this admission, IM was the last one) Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79M with h/o DLBCL s/p RICE chemotherapy, adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy,Hepatitis C, prostate cancer, and diabetes who presented on [**11-12**] with BRBPR and is now s/p sigmoidectomy and end colostomy for necrotic sigmoid colon lesions.
Pt had a colonoscopy on [**10-30**] for thickening of his sigmoid colon seen on CT scan.
Sigmoid not well visualized, but biopsies showed ulceration consistent with radiation proctitis.
His Lasix was continued but [**Month/Day (2) **] held due to concern for thrombocytopenia from chemotherapy.
He was then readmitted [**11-12**] for painless hematochezia episodes.
His Hct and hemodynamics were stable, and he had elevated WBC's after being given Neulasta recently.
Had sigmoidoscopy [**11-13**] which was unrevealing due to poor prep.
Repeat colonoscopy was done [**11-15**] and was concerning for necrosis of mid-sigmoid and proximal sigmoid.
Rheumatology was consulted on [**11-20**] for R knee pain and swelling and fever to 102 and tapped his knee which showed monosodium urate crystals consistent with his h/o gout; Gstain and culture were negative.
EKG was concerning for septal elevations, with TWI in II-III, and cardiac enzymes were seen to be elevated with an elevated BNP as well.
The evening of [**11-23**], had episode of fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, increased work or breathing.
Past Medical History: Pt has low grade grade [**1-11**] follicular center lymphoma, diagnosed [**2099**] with transformation into large cell lymphoma in subcut nodules in [**2102**].
4-6 weeks ago pt p/w new pain in his right buttock with radiation down his right leg.
Pain has continued and more recently he developed left lower quadrant pain and tenderness that was felt possibly to be due to diverticulitis.
Given cipro with some improvement in his abdominal pain.
CT abd showed thickening of the distal descending colon as well as a small splenic mass and a large 6 cm mass in his buttock as well as new spiculated nodules at the base of his lungs.
He had a needle biopsy of his buttock mass done by IR at [**Hospital1 **] which showed recurrence of his large cell lymphoma from [**2102**].
He underwent a colonoscopy earlier in [**Month (only) **] that showed some very mild thickening of his colon that did not look malignant, biopsies consistent with radiation induced colitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis C with normal liver function tests, antibodies to hepatitis B core with a negative hep B surface antigen, negative HIV test Mild cardiomyopathy felt possibly to be do to his previous chemotherapy with Adriamycin for which he is on diuretics Large GIB, s/p sigmoidectomy and end colostomy (Hartmann pouch in [**11/2114**]) course complicated by NSTEMI, flash edema, high grade SBO but not surgical candidate, treated medically/CMO Diabetes type 2 uncontrolled Liver mass hypertension lumbar spinal stenosis abdominal aortic aneurysm hyperlipidemia h/o colonic adenoma prostate CA s/p radiation lymphoma   Social History: Marital Status: Married with 3 children.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe three-vessel CAD.
The D1 branch had a 70% origin stenosis.
The true distal LCX had diffuse 80-90% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the OM1 branch.
The dominant RCA had a 60% stenosis in the mid-vessel segment, and 80-90% stenosis in the PLSA prior to two small PL branches.

There was no pulmonary hypertension with a measured mean PAP 17mmHg.
Reduced left ventricular function.
High-grade small bowel obstruction with transition point in the right lower quadrant.
Improving basilar pulmonary nodules, likely due to infectious etiology.
3.5-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Persisting high grade small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right lower quadrant has increased in severity since [**2114-11-28**].
Multiple bubbly air pockets in the pelvis could be either within the bowel loops or could be extraluminal, likely from previous surgery.
However there is no walled off fluid collection.
Residual pneumoperitoneum in the right perihepatic region improved and mild free fluid in abdomen and pelvis has resolved.
Multiple pulmonary nodules in the lower lung have grown smaller since [**2114-10-15**].
3-3.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, stable since [**2114-10-9**].
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 79M with very complicated course and >3wk admission, but briefly: h/o DLBCL s/p RICE chemotherapy, adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, Hepatitis C, prostate cancer, and diabetes.
In the past few months, he had recurrence of lymphoma and was admitted for R-ICE chemo in 11/[**2113**].
He had a CT abdomen which showed colonic thickening, and had colonoscopy [**10-30**] with biopsies showing ulceration consistent with radiation proctitis, but given poor prep, was difficult to visualize; also had polypectomy.
and had sigmoidoscopy [**11-13**] and colonoscopy [**11-15**] concerning for necrosis of mid-sigmoid and proximal sigmoid.
He was doing fairly well post-operatively, except for KUB showing multiple dilated loops of small bowel consistent with ileus.
On post-op day 4, in the setting of fevers, pt underwent CT abdomen showing a 5.7 x 2.7cm partially organized fluid collection in the pelvis - likely representing a seroma given the time-frame post-op (as the patient had no intraabdominal intestinal anastomosis, there was no possibility that this could represent an anastomotic leak).
He was then noted to have large R knee effusion and this was tapped by Rheumatology, showing acute gout flare.
Fevers and R knee pain resolved after aspiration.
On [**11-21**] he began having chest pressure, acutely SOB and hypoxic, so started on NRB and CXR showed flash edema and transferred to MICU for diuresis.
There, on [**11-23**] he NSTEMI'd with positive uptrending cardiac enzymes and EKG changes, thought to be due to demand ischemia, so taken to cardiac cath which showed bad 3vd and 60-70% left main disease, but he was not felt to be an operable / intervenable candidate, so it was medically managed with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and ACS medications.
He was then transferred out of ICU to general [**First Name3 (LF) **], where he was OK initially but after a few days, he began to feel very weak and was dwindling, not getting OOB, and seen to be very weak and orthostatic.
However, he then started vomiting and had abdominal pain, had a WBC count, and was tachycardic and found to have on CTAP [**11-28**] to have SBO with high grade transition point in the RLQ.
He was also noted to have some purulence coming from the inferior-most part of his surgical wound -- this grew Ecoli but was not thought to be the sole reason for his fevers/leukocytosis as the supposed wound infection was quite small.
Repeat CT abdomen [**12-2**] showed persistent high grade SBO in same location, getting worse with larger loops of bowel.
Surgery came and saw him, and said he was not operable because extremely poor prognosis and surgery would likely kill him.
So his SBO was medically managed with broad spectrum ABx, NGT to suction, Octreotide for secretions, and family was very aware and involved in the grim prognosis.
Prior to discharge his pain was well controlled with concentrated oral morphine [**9-27**] mL Q2H:PRN pain and air hunger.
additionally he recieved 8 mg Ondansetron ODT Q8H:PRN for nausea and Ativan 0.5-1 mg PO Q2H:PRN anxiety, nausea or air hunger.
His SBO was not active at the time of discharge, but earlier in his course his secretions and symptoms were well controlled with SC ondansetron TID.
-Would recomend sub cutaneous octreotide if bowel obstruction symptoms worsen -Patient stable on Oral morphine, ativan and zofran PRN for symptom management as above.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for anxiety/air hunger.

You were admitted after having evidence of a GI bleed.
You underwent a surgery to remove part of your colon and had a colostomy afterwards.
Your postoperateive course was complicated by a stress-related heart attack, fluid in your lungs causing low oxygen levels, fevers, a high white blood cell count, a fast heart rate.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed diffuse severe coronary artery disease but you were felt to be too high risk for interventions at this time, so your heart attack was treated medically.
After the catheterization, you also had evidence of a small bowel obstruction, for which you were given broad spectrum antibiotics and were watched.
This did not end up resolving, and our surgery colleagues felt you to be extremely high risk for surgery, and that it could kill you.
