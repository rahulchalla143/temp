CT head revealed hemorrhagic right sided mass with significant edema and MLS.
C/o Headache that is [**9-5**].

Past Medical History: Migraines, carpal tunnel syndrome s/p repair, s/p hysterectomy, anxiety/depression   Social History: denies illicit drugs   Family History: unknown   Physical Exam: O: T:  97.4  HR: 66  BP: 131/76  RR: 16  Sat: 99% ra Gen:  WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes mute bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger bilat  Handedness Right  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: **  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2149-7-27**]: Hyperdense right frontotemporal mass with marked surrounding edema and associated heterotopic irregular bone formation abutting the right anterior clinoid processes, causing leftward subfalcine herniation and possibly early downward transtentorial herniation.
Intralesional hyperdensity could represent hemorrhage or mineralization.
Large extra-axial mass lesion on the right temporal fossa and right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**], likely consistent with a meningioma, associated with  significant vasogenic edema and mass effect as described in detail above.
No significant change in comparison with the prior head CT examination.
Significant midline shifting with uncal herniation and transfalcine herniation is demonstrated with approximately 14.1 mm of shifting towards the left.
The predominant blood supply is from the right internal carotid artery, ophthalmic artery and cavernous branches.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2149-7-29**]: Small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of right temporal meningioma resection, with expected post-operative changes, and no  difference in mass effect from the pre-operative exam.
PATHOLOGY [**2149-7-29**]:  **pending**  MR HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST [**2149-7-30**]: Post-operative changes with findings suggesting residual neoplasm medially.
There is stable uncal herniation with  mass effect on the right cerebral peduncle and abnormal signal.
Restricted diffusion in the right temporal lobe could represent acute ischemia or post operative cytotoxic edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o F presents with headache worsening over the past 24hrs presents with new R temporal hemorrhagic lesion on head CT. She was trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical intervention.
She was taken to angiogram for evaluation of vasculature.
Post-operative head CT demonstrated small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of right temporal meningioma resection, with expected post-operative changes.
Post-op head MRI revealed post-operative changes with findings suggesting residual neoplasm medially, stable uncal herniation with  mass effect on the right cerebral peduncle, and restricted diffusion in the right temporal lobe could represent acute ischemia or post operative cytotoxic edema.
