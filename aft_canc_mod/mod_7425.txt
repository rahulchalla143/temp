She was most recently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**Date range (1) 3683**]/10 for shortness of breath and AMS in the setting of a CHF exacerbation.
Today, she was noted to be more lethargic at her NH with decreased interaction and clarity of speech.
Exam notable for increased WOB and cardiac wheezes.
CXR initially concerning for CHF.
However, subsequently found to have rectal temp found to be 103, very concentrated apperaing urine (100cc UOP after lasix), and persistently tachycardic, so then clinical picture thought more consistent with PNA on review of CXR.

ECG [**2121-2-28**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Portable CXR [**2121-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study due to respiratory motion and artifacts projecting over the right hemithorax.
Overlying pulmonary edema and pneumothorax cannot be excluded on the basis of this exam.
ECG [**2121-3-1**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no change.
Decreased pulmonary edema.
Increased left retrocardiac density consistent with consolidation or atelectasis.
Portable CXR [**2121-3-2**]: There is a left retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
There is also left-sided pleural effusion which is slightly increased from previous.
No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces are seen.
No focal consolidation is present.
Venous congestion and bilateral layering effusions are increased.
Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who presents from NH with increased lethargy and hypoxia.
# Hypoxia:  The patient has had multiple prior admissions for hypoxia in the setting of CHF exacerbation, although on this admission did not appear significantly volume overloaded clinically or by initial chest film.
The patient was low risk by [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] Criteria for PE so no CTA.
She underwent speech and swallow evaluation given concern for possible aspiration, but was cleared for thin liquids and regular-consistency food (this study was done on hospital day 3 when she was more alert than on admission).
She remained afebrile after the initiation of Abx.
# AMS/lethargy: This was felt to be likely multifactorial, with contributions from infection, hypoxia, and electrolyte imabalance in the setting of a severe underlying Alzheimer's dementia.
Given h/o seizure disorder, it is possible that she had ictal or postictal events, although there was no clear evidence of seizure.
She was at times borderline unresponsive (non-verbal, withdrawing to pain but not orienting to voice) and at other times awake, conversant, and able to communicate needs.
After discussion with patient's daughter, it appeared that this was not an acute event but she may have baseline waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status that has been going on for weeks to months in the setting of frequent exacerbations of illness.
Treatment was aimed at underlying infection, hypoxia and electrolyte imbalances with apparent improvement in MS.  # Fever: To 103 rectally in ED per report.
# Hypernatremia: Na was elevated on admission to 146.
Given her recent admission [**Date range (1) 95167**] for presumed CHF exacerbation, it is likely that some degree of volume overload contributed to her symptoms of hypoxia.
# Suprapubic swelling: The patient was noted to have right suprapubic swelling involving the right labia majora which was somewhat mobile but there was no defined mass.
This may be due to a hernia or soft tissue mass such as a lipoma or fibroma.
The patient did not experience any discomfort from the swelling and did not have any obstructive physiology.
# Seizure Disorder: Phenytoin level was initially subtherapeutic.
# Atrial fibrillation: Initially patient had RVR to 150s, but rate was better controlled s/p IVF.
# Chronic renal failure: At baseline.
# Coronary artery disease: EKG stable, elevated trop (at baseline) likely related to CRF.
# Multiple myeloma:  Trend creatinine and electrolytes.
Her cause of death was pneumonia in the setting of chronic congestive heart failure and alzheimer's dementia.
