There was no active bleeding during the time of imaging.
[**5-12**] KUB: No evidence of a capsule is seen within the abdomen.
No active extravasation of contrast is seen to indicate a site of active hemorrhage.
Fluid in the left abdominal flank is stable in size and morphology.
[**2204-5-19**]: GI bleeding study: No evidence of active GI bleeding at the time of the study.

LGIB: Reported to have melena, although at different time noted to have brown stool with bloody mucous.
Immediate concern was for UGIB, particularly variceal bleeding or portal gastropathy in this patient with decompensated liver disease.
Pt with small intestine ulcers on recent capsule study.
EGD on [**5-7**] with non bleeding varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, portal hypertensive gastropathy, polyp in proximal body of stomach, and 8 mm non bleeding polyp adjacent to hepatico-jejunostomy.
The patient had an RBC scan, which showed no definite bleeding seen on 90 minute dynamic imaging, but activity in the rectum on left lateral is compatible with rectal bleeding.
Pt had a sigmoidoscopy the next morning on [**5-12**] that noted blood coating the colon, but no e/o active bleeding.
IR declined angiography at this time, as it would be very low yield as no bleeding was noted on the RBC scan.
On the floor the patient remained hemodynamically stable however he continued to experience melanotic stools with a downward trend in his hematocrit.
He became transfusion dependent, requiring about 2units/day.
He subsequently had a CT-A to looked for vascular abnormalities such as scarred varices however this was unremarkable.
The patient continued to have melena, requiring [**12-24**] units of PRBCs to maintain adequate hematocrit.
No evidence of ulcerations or intramucosal or intraluminal pathology was identified.
This was withdrawn and again no identified lesions were noted.
A bleeding source was not identified during the surgery.
The wound was having ascitic fluid drainage, several clips were removed and a VAC was placed.
The patient had copius amounts of fluid from the VAC, and the output was repleted with intermittent albumin and IV fluids.
On POD 19 the patient was transferred to the SICU for increased confusion.
A head CT was obtained which showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
An EEG showed an abnormal routine EEG in the waking state due to a mildly slow and disorganized background with frequent theta rhythms.
There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform abnormalities noted.
He continued to have large volume ascited from the wound VAC and continued with albumin and fluid replacements, the albumin replacement will continue upon discharge and extra fluids are being instilled with tube feeds.
Two days prior to discharge, he spiked a fever and had increased abdominal pain.
Additionally, his PICC line was removed and sent for culture, which showed no significant growth.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.4 on admission, likely due to decreased perfusion in the setting of bleed.
