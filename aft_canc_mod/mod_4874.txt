[**5-14**] Abdominal xray: No signs of ileus or obstruction.
No signs of free air below the right hemidiaphragm .
Marked extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation to 1.6 cm with mild-to-moderate intra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation with high-density material within the distal CBD with pancreatitis in the head and neck, raising the question of gallstone pancreatitis.
The gallbladder is moderately distended without other secondary findings of acute cholecystitis noted.
Known metastatic lung cancer with partially visualized probable metastases within the right lower lobe and left lower lobe.
Small left pleural effusion and trace right pleural effusion.
Periosteal reaction in femoral shafts likely secondary to hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
Moderate-to-severe colonic diverticulosis with no findings of acute diverticulitis.
Increasing mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Decreased density of left upper lobe and left lower lobe opacities.
No pneumothorax.
Multiple subcentimeter nodules in the right lung.
[**2179-5-15**] ERCP report: Impression: Stone fragments and sludge in the biliary tree.
Normal pancreatic duct (sphincterotomy, stent placement, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  [**2179-5-18**] Echo: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of gallstone.
Thickened and hyperemic gallbladder wall and mildly distended gallbladder.
No evidence of choledocholithiasis, though presence of air within much of the extrahepatic biliary system limits assessment.
Right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo M with NSCLC s/p recent chemo, now neutropenic, presenting with abdominal pain and found to have acute pancreatitis, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] initially for hypotension.
S/p gallbladder pancreatitis: Patient presented with hypotension and sepsis which resolved with significant IV fluids (10L on night of admission).
Other etiologies entertained, but highly unlikely included alcoholic, chemotherapy-induced, or hypertriglyceridemia (labs normal).
LFTs continued trending down and  abdominal pain improved after stent placed.
They wanted a RUQ US to determine if there were residual gallstones and pt might benefit from a perc chol tube.
RUQ U/S showed no gallstones so surgery decided they would not place a decompressiont tube, and already decided he wasn't a surgical candidate for CCY.
# Enterobacter baceteremia - patient presented with hypotension and sepsis.
His BCx on [**5-14**] returned positive for ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES, that was acutely cipro sensitive.
# Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to his acute gallstone pancreatitis.
Other possible etiologies include recent chemotherapy or other toxic medications (such as his outpatient statin).
# Systolic Ejection Murmur: Best heard at LUSB, radiating to the clavicle and carotids bilaterally, concerning for aortic stenosis.
Therefore, likely a flow murmur in the setting of lots of fluids.
# Anemia: Known Fe deficiency thought to be [**3-3**] gastritis from NSAID use for pain control of arthritis.
But also in the setting of pancytopenia so may be secondary to marrow suppression.
He has no s/sx of bleeding on exam throughout this admission, so we continued him on a PPI.
# CKI: Baseline Cr is 1.8-1.9.
# Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Lung: Received Navelbine on [**2179-5-4**].
He was neutropenic on presentation and per his Primary Oncologist, Neupogen was not indicated during the nadir of his cell counts.
