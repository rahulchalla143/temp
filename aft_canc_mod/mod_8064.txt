Admission Date:  [**2143-7-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-8-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-1-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Haldol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4181**] Chief Complaint: Left neck mass with bleeding and airway obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
His wife looked in his throat and saw minimal "redness," and offered the patient some ice cream and water with minimal relief.
Impossible to visualize vocal folds with MAC blade secondary to large 'vascular-looking mass on L pharynx from tonsilar region to posterior pharynx.'
Cerebral aneurysm [**2124**] s/p surgical clipping, complicated by intracranial bleed.
[**Name (NI) **] is disabled with secondary mental retardation, wheelchair bound secondary to balance difficulties.
At baseline will obey commands and able to converse, but reported poor memory for recent events.
: RRR, no abnormal sound or murmur; peripheral pulse weak but present; IV site: clean, non tender, no redness; ankles: no sign of DVT; Abdominal: [**Last Name (un) 103**].
soft, non tender, no defense or rebound; BS normal; G-tube site:no drainage; packed - see instructions for maitenance at 7-10 days;  Neuro: s/p SAH and residual mental and motor impairment; patient is pleasant and cooperative but not well oriented in time or space; limited judgement ability (wife has POA); impaired memory; impaired speech/dysarthria; as prior to hospitalization, patient is wheel chair bound b/c of dystonic movements of 4 limbs;  Pertinent Results: CT neck [**7-24**]: Asymmetric soft tissue density in the left neck extending from the region superior to the hyoid bone, producing mass effect upon the epiglottis and valleculae and severe narrowing of the airway down to the level of the false cords with apparent mass effect, possibly pushing the false cords and cricoid cartilage to the right.
The imaged portions of the lung apices demonstrate patchy ground-glass opacity, left greater than right.
There is enlargement of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle.
CT neck [**2143-8-1**] 1.Interval development of a large medium-density fluid collection with an enhancing rim in the location of the patient's prior neck mass.
As the patient is status post biopsy of this mass, these findings are concerning for nfection.
2.Interval decrease in mass effect on the airway.
3.Unchanged presence of foci of air within the soft tissues of the neck, thought to be related to the patient's recent tracheostomy.
New bilateral pleural effusions.
The mass was hyperdense before contrast with no enhancement previously.
The mass now is hypodense, compatible with both evolution of hematoma, and recent surgery.
There is now peripheral enhancement, again compatible with evolution of hematoma.
CT neck [**2143-8-14**] Significant interval decrease in size of left parapharyngeal mass which shows peripheral enhancement and a central area of low attenuation.
This again may represent a hematoma although an underlying mass or infection cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male s/p cerebral aneurysm clipping / bleed who presents with neck mass acutely obstructing airway and necessitating emergent tracheostomy.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the neck mass is biosied by ENT; histological analysis is suggestive of hematoma and does not reveal any tumor cells.
A US-doppler and arteriogram of the carotids fail to demonstrate any vascular lesion in the mass area.
In the absence of a vascular lesion, a repeat CT of the neck on [**2143-8-14**] shows reduction in size of the peripharyngeal mass and a second biopsy under direct laryngoscopy is performed on [**2143-8-16**].
Frozen sections reveal the presence of normal oropharyngeal tissue with acute and chronic inflammation and culture of an adjacent pus-like throat swab is positive for oropharyngeal flora.
G-tube is placed on [**2143-8-26**] by interventionnal radiology as GI team could not illuminate gastric lumen sufficiently well b/c of [**Last Name (un) **] tissue from previous abdominal surgeries.
A repeat swallow video is performed on [**2143-8-29**] showing post swallow residues in phrayngeal area resulting in aspiration (see attached report) and the patient is discharged rehabilitation on the same day.
Significant medical events during his hospitalization include:  Respiratory - Lung opacity on initial CXR is consistent with pneumonitis from aspiration of blood during procedure and intubation.
During the course of his hospitalization, repeat CXR reveal the development of bilaterl pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis but without showing any consolidation or opacification suggestive of pneumonia.
CV - No history of CV disease.
Transient hypotension during intubation procedure and large amounts of morphine sedation.
Post-incidental ECG and cardiac enzymes (3 sets) revealed no abnormality.
Peripheral IV site: on [**2143-8-6**], patient develops phlebitis and cellulitis at IV puncture site on his right arm; catheter is removed, blood cultures are sent (neg.)
Heme - Leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and abnormal differential with immature forms such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes: hemato-oncology consult report that CBC's over the last several years dating back to [**2138**] showed mildly elevated WBC since [**5-12**] (WBC 12.0).
This CBC is compatible with acute inflammation and possibly infection.
However, his peripheral smear and differential was not normal even prior to his hospitalization and it is recommended to check a CBC again 1 month after his discharge and f/u with a hematologist.
His diagnosis is likely a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that does not require immediate treatment, just regular surveillance.
