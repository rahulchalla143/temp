She was originally seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-16**] with complaints of lower extremity edema.
MRI/MRA abdomen was ordered that was not done until [**1-26**] that showed extensive hepatic venous thrombosis and ascites that was compatible with Budd Chiari syndrome.
Past Medical History: 1) IVC thrombosis: Diagnosed in [**10-10**] when she presented with bilateral lower extremity swelling.
US revealed complete thrombosis of bilateral lower extremity venous systems, as well as the infrahepatic IVC.
A diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis was made via bone marrow biopsy in [**1-10**] demonstrating increased large atypical megakaryocytes constent with the diagnosis.
2) Essential thrombocytosis: See above, diagnosed in [**1-10**] via bone marrow biopsy demonstrating increased large atypical megakaryocytes.
3) Ovarian cysts: Followed by periodic ultrasound, always changing in appearance, with hemorrhagic components, thought to be likely physiologic.
No history of clots in the family, lupus.

MRI/MRA abd: FINDINGS: There has been interval development of ascites within the abdomen.
Additionally, there has been interval development of complete thrombosis of the right hepatic, middle hepatic, and left hepatic veins.
The liver is drained through an accessory left hepatic vein supplying segment VI and there are multiple intrahepatic collateral veins that drain into this segment VI accessory vein.
There is no evidence for thrombus in the intra-hepatic IVC, however, the intrahepatic IVC is very flat and attenuated, likely secondary to hypertrophy of the caudate lobe.
There is a peripheral arterial enhancement pattern of the liver compatible with the interval development of Budd-Chiari.
Multiple retroperitoneal collaterals are seen below the bifurcation, with no native common iliac, external, or internal iliac veins seen.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations as well as subtraction images were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
There is patent venous drainage from the liver through an accessory segment VI vein.
Nonocclusive thrombus within the IVC extending from the infra-hepatic IVC to the iliac bifurcation.
There is moderate amount of ascites in bilateral lower quadrants.
No significant ascites is demonstrated in upper quadrant on this exam.
Moderate amount of ascites in bilateral lower quadrants.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 yo F with h/o essential thrombocythemia c/b bilateral LE DVTs, infrahepatic IVC clot, and L renal vein clot on coumadin presented with increasing LE edema and abdominal girth with MRI/MRA abdomen with findings suggestive of Budd Chiari now s/p IR visualization of portal venous system demonstrating extensive hepatic venous thrombi, with collateralization and drainage of the vessels via an accessory vein into the IVC switched to Lovenox for anticoagulation.
She remained stable overnight and had an ultrasound of her liver on the day of discharge which revealed moderate ascites.
Per liver, no indication to tap her ascites at this time given her asymptomatic status.
#) Essential thrombocythemia - hx of multiple thrombi.
Per heme-onc, no need for Hydrea at time of discharge but this will be reevaluated on Friday at her follow up appointment.
#) Communication- with patient and her patients .
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO three times a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Budd-Chiari syndrome Essential Thrombocythemia  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for swelling secondary to your occludied liver veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome) and your symptoms have improved.
You will need close follow up for your Essential Thrombocythemia and your liver disease as well.
Seek medical attention immediately if you experience new symptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, increased swelling, fevers, abdominal pain, or other new concerning symptoms.
