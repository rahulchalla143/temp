HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 23 year old female with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who is admitted for an auto peripheral stem cell transplant.
The patient was initially diagnosed in [**2112-1-29**] with early stage Hodgkin's disease status post ABVD times four cycles with local radiation chemotherapy and obtained complete remission.
Follow up scans revealed no recurrent disease.
Routine follow up in [**2116-9-28**] showed an increasing ESR and PET scan obtained revealed new left lower lobe nodules, FVG avid.
The patient is status post thoracotomy for removal of the masses, consistent with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma and anterior mediastinal lymphadenopathy, positive for pathology but PET negative, which was consistent with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease.
The patient was recently admitted for high-dose Cytoxan therapy for stem cell collection that was complicated by diarrhea, lethargy and altered mental status with OxyContin and emesis.
Most recently she had a right earlobe cellulitis which was treated with intravenous Oxacillin and transitioned to Keflex times ten days with resolution, approximately one week prior to admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Since discharge, no complaints, no headache, visual changes, oral lesions, no fevers, chills or nightsweats.
No chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness, no abdominal pain, no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.
History of shingles in [**2108-6-28**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Distant leukemia, distant breast cancer in mother's cousin.
Right ear without erythema or drainage.
Neck:  No jugular venous distension, no lymphadenopathy, no masses.
No tenderness or erythema.
Coronary, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly and no masses.
Extremities, warm and well perfused, no edema.
Pathology of bone marrow, mildly hypocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, no morphological evidence of involvement by Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy, no tumor or lymphoma, normal maturation.
She had no evidence of tumorlysis during this hospitalization stay.
She was transfused to maintain her hematocrit greater than 25 and platelets greater than 20 without bleeding.
On [**6-12**], her ANC was greater than 1000, however, she was neutropenic on [**6-17**].
She had a low-grade fever to 100.5, however, she was not neutropenic at that time and no antibiotics were started.
When she became neutropenic she had an episode of fever.
She was started with Vancomycin for question of a line infection and Ciprofloxacin was discontinued and changed to Cefepime.
Cultures grew out 2 out of 4 bottles positive for Apha Streptococcus sensitive for Vancomycin but intermediate sensitivity for Penicillin.
She had acute Redman's syndrome with Vancomycin and it was run over four hours with some premedication with Benadryl with improvement and resolution with the remainder of her Vancomycin treatment.
She also had a chest x-ray which showed bilateral pleural effusions but no infiltrates.
Acute renal failure - The patient was on [**6-28**], had an acute episode of renal failure with increase in creatinine from 0.5 to 1.7.
Initial thoughts were that this was due to Ambazone the 110 dose versus Streptococcus bacteremia.
The patient has been afebrile since and has been just maintained on Vancomycin.
Hematemesis - The patient had a scant amount of vomitus approximately 20 cc with an episode of hematemesis which was likely related to esophagitis and mucositis.
She also had some chest pains with some swallowing, likely all consistent with esophagitis.
The patient had an electrocardiogram which was negative with the episode of chest pain.
The patient was initially started on Fluconazole but was discontinued to Ambazone once she spiked a fever and then the Ambazone was subsequently discontinued.
Access - The patient has a Port-A-Cath in the left chest that was done prior to her admission.
Surgery had come in and placed a right internal jugular and this was discontinued and placed to an interventional radiology-placed new triple lumen catheter.
However, when she spiked a fever she had some erythema around her site and the line was discontinued.
Cultures were negative for infection.
Emesis - The patient had some significant nausea before her stem cell transplant.
She was subsequently maintained on _______ and Zofran, however, Decadron was added to improve her nausea control as well as Zyprexa and she had no further nausea during the remainder of her hospitalization stay.
Earache - The patient had complained of some earache after she had some chest pain, likely associated with the esophagitis.
This was all thought to be due to referred pain from her esophagitis given the fact that the nerve that innervates her esophagus does radiate up to her ear.
She had a normal cranial nerve examination, this was likely thought to be referred pain from the esophagitis.
