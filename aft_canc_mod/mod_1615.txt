HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2161-1-30**], and the patient had his back abscess drained.
After CT scan showed distal small bowel leak to the well drained retroperitoneal abscess, it was clear that the patient had an enterocutaneous fistula.
Immediately postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for septic shock.
The patient was hyponatremic and this was supplemented with cc per cc normal saline replacements from his ostomy as well as in his TPN.
A GI consultation was obtained because of this high output and the patient was started on Questran per their recommendations, 4 grams p.o.
On [**2161-2-13**], postoperative day number nine, it was noted that the patient's ileostomy drainage had decreased slightly.
On postoperative day number 12, the patient's Somatostatin dose was increased and rehabilitation options were looked in to as the hyponatremia seemed to be under control with the TPN and the replacements.
On postoperative day number 13, it was noted that the patient had Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus growing from his abdominal wounds which had been draining some purulent material.
Also, on postoperative day number 14, it was decided that the patient should have a CT scan to see why the abdominal and back wounds continued to drain.
The CT scan showed extensive undrained infection in the abdomen, right lower quadrant, extending to the right flank, hip and buttock.
The patient had decided that he wished to return home with Hospice care and saw no need for further intervention.
