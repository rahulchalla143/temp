Bibasilar areas of consolidation are concerning for superimposed infection.
A non-relaxed gallbladder containing stones, however, there is no pericholecystic fluid or peri-gallbladder fat stranding, however, in the appropriate clinical setting cholecystitis may be present.
Complex appearing right adnexal mass for which a pelvic ultrasound on a non-emergent basis is recommended.
Hypodensity in the spleen, which may represent a hemangioma, abscess or metastasis but is not fully assessed.
Would recommend further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or abdominal ultrasound.
Extensive atherosclerotic vascular calcifications with a femoral-femoral bypass graft.
No retroperitoneal hemorrhage or other hematoma  Video Swallow Study: Aspiration on nectar consistency, penetration with honey-thick consistencies.
No definite evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive given the extensive white matter changes and lack of priors which limits assessment for small acute infarcts.
Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic changes and global volume loss.
Left vertebral artery aneursym, largely thrombosed, with a small central patent component.
There is extensive edema within the medulla some flow anteriorly.
The findings suggest a large partially thrombosed left vertebral artery aneurysm which has invaginated into the medulla.
A 2 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
Large aneurysm arising from the left vertebral artery, either at the origin of the left PICA or just superior to the origin of the left PICA.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Lung nodules measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter, concerning for neoplastic process.
Small left pleural effusion.
Multiple pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Emphysematous changes.
Pelvic ultrasound: Complex cystic mass lesion in the right adnexa, containing internal septations and a mural nodule, concerning for a cystic neoplasm.
Further evaluation of this lesion would require surgery.
CXR: Bilateral lower lobe collapse, left greater than right with left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old female with history of recent hip fracture, HTN, COPD, thrombocytosis who presented with SOB, fever, UTI and anemia.
She was later found to have a large vertebral artery aneurysm, an ovarian mass, and multiple lung nodules concerning for metastatic cancer.
Ovarian mass and lung nodules: Upon admission to the hospital, she had a CT abdomen/pelvis which showed an adnexal mass which was not well characterized.
She had a follow-up pelvic ultrasound which demonstrated a large cystic adnexal mass concerning for cystic neoplasm.
She was also found to have multiple lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease, as well as a pleural effusion and pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Dysphagia: Throughout her hospitalization, she had difficulty swallowing.
This progressed to the point where she couldn't eat or drink anything without aspirating and going into respiratory distress with hypoxia requiring a face mask.
She was then kept NPO and was evaluated for causes of dysphagia.
During this workup, she was found to have the above adnexal mass and lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease.
At discharge, the patient denies feeling hungry or thirsty and is taking no oral intake.
Vertebral artery aneurysm: A brain MRI showed a medullary mass which was later characterized as a large vertebral artery aneurysm.
Neurosurgery was consulted who offered possible treatments, but given the patient's overall medical condition, recommended no intervention.
Anemia: She had guaiac positive stools on admission with a negative NG lavage.
Her hematocrit was 20 on admission and she was given 4 units of blood and her hematocrit increased and remained stable during her stay.
She had a CT scan which showed an enlarged gall bladder, stool, an adnexal mass and pneumonia.
The gastroenterology team evaluated the patient and recommended an EGD/colonoscopy under anesthesia to evalute anemia in this patient.
It was felt that her use of lovenox as an outpatient likely contributed to a slow GI bleed.
Cardiology was consulted to assess the risk of EGD under general anesthesia as she had a troponin of 0.17 on admission with an echo that showed subtle hypokinesis of mid-inferolateral wall but no significant wall motion abnormality.
Cardiology initially felt that she could complete EGD/colonoscopy without further cardiology testing and should start a beta blocker for BP control.
As her respiratory status and functional status were poor, the patient and her family elected to defer further workup due to multiple comorbidities.
Pneumonia: On admission, she had an oxygen requirement and shortness of breath.
Chest xray showed new infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
She used incentive spirometry and continued to have a productive cough.
UTI: She had two positive urinalyses with urine cultures that grew E. Coli.
Her final urine culture had not grown any bacteria at the time of discharge, although did grow yeast.
Thrombocytosis: She has known thrombocytosis and had elevated platelets on admission.
Her platelets remained elevated at the time of discharge, and her hydroxyurea was stopped when her goals of care became comfort measures only.
Coronary artery disease:  She had positive troponin to 0.17 and T wave inversions in precordial leads.
She remained without chest pain and the ECG changes were not dynamic.
She may have had a prior event in setting of her hip procedure or blood loss.
An echo was completed with subtle hypokinesis of mid inferolateral wall but no significant wall motion abnormality.
Hip fracture: She had a hip fracture prior to admission and was admitted from rehab.
Lovenox was stopped due to concern for bleeding.
She complained of occasional hip pain which was initially managed with tramadol and later with morphine.
Hypernatremia: She had transient hypernatremia which was corrected with free water.
Constipation: She had episodes of constipation after admission and was maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen with docusate, senna, and miralax.
Glaucoma: Travaprost for glaucoma treatment.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray [**Hospital1 **]: [**12-27**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for for congestion.
