The mass is complex in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral slow diffusion.
A complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although the CT obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible that the density may be diminished.
Possibly, both may be the case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage.
Abscess is considered less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion.
Multifocal confluent and FLAIR hyperintensities are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Left upper lobe soft tissue mass with coarse calcification, associated traction bronchiectasis, and calcified hilar nodes.
Additionally pleural calcification can be seen in prior asbestos exposure.
There is underlying emphysema.
These findings are worrisome for malignancy, though prior granulomatous infection might also have this appearance.
There is no evidence of malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis.
Status post resection of a left parietal mass with expected post-surgical sequelae including pneumocephalus as well as some blood products within the surgical bed.
Layering pneumocephalus along the left frontal cerebral hemisphere with adjacent mass effect.
Ventricles appear more prominent on today's study compared to MRI of [**2103-4-12**], concerning for early ventriculomegaly.
Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, more prominent on the left versus the right are relatively unchanged since MRI  Brain MRI [**4-14**] - 1.
Status post resection of left parietooccipital mass with blood products at the surgical site without definite residual enhancement.
Pneumocephalus is seen and expected post-surgical changes seen at the surgical site.
Linear area of restricted diffusion, extending deeper from the surgical site to the left periatrial region could represent an area of ischemia adjacent to the surgical site.
Changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
No other enhancing brain lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted to Neurosurgery for workup of new Left parietal lesion.
MRI with and without Gadolinium revealed only the one solitary left parietal lesion and therefore the decision was made to resect the lesion.
Concern for metastatic prostate CA to the brain was low, however CT chest/Abd/Pelvis was performed for oncological workup.
Chest/Abd/Pelv CT obtained on [**2103-4-12**] demonstrated a LUL mass with calcifications and b/l hilar adenopathy.
On [**2103-4-13**], patient underwent left-sided craniotomy and ressection of the left parietal mass.
His post-operative CT and MRI showed post operative changes without evidence of new acute hemorrhage.
During his course on the floor, patient had persistent hypertension.
He was started on amlodipine 5mg with minimal response.
Medicine was consulted for Hypertension management.
The remainder of his course was as follows:  # Left parietal mass/left upper lung mass/likely new cancer diagnosis: Patient and wife aware that mass likely represents a cancer, most likely metastatic lung cancer, though not certain as pathology is pending at time of discharge.
# Hypertension: BP was elevated post-op (160 and higher) and improved on amlodipine and tapering of the dexamethasone.
# Urinary incontinence/retension and E. coli urinary tract infection: Patient has a history of urinary retension and incontince and straight caths himself multiple times per day (~[**4-27**]).
He also had an elevated WBC count.
Foley catheter was removed and regular straight cathing Q3-4 hours per home regimen was reinstated to reduce risk of reinfection and promote ambulation.
# Atrial fibrillation: Stable.
# Coronary artery disease: Stable.
# Obstructive sleep apnea - Patient was continued on CPAP per home regimen.
# Prostate cancer - Patient was continued on bicalutamide.
# Glaucoma - Continued timolol and lantanoprost eye drops  # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen while on pain medications that should be weaned off.
# Code: Full # Communication: Patient, HCP [**Name (NI) 3516**] [**Name (NI) 5598**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5599**]  On day of discharge, patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable.
His wound is clean, dry and intact.
He has no focal neurological deficits.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital following a fall and found to have a mass in your brain.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your neurosurgeon, removed this mass and the pathology to determine exactly what it is, is still pending, though it is most likely some form of cancer.
You were also found to have a mass in the left upper lobe of your lung.
As your pain gets better, you can stop the oxycodone and go back to ultram.
START colace, senna, and miralax as needed to prevent constipation STOP Skelaxin.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
