History of Present Illness: Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 83088**] is a 57-year-old woman with history of metastatic neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple, pancreatic ductal stent, octreotide, CyberKnife to pancreatic head, TACE to the liver, and streptozocin and doxorubicin, who was admitted to [**2140-8-22**] with fever and malaise.
Abdominal CT revealed erosive duodenal metastasis invading through duodenal wall and into portal vein.
She initially required pressors for hypotension but was quickly weaned off and, by the time of floor transfer, had been off pressors for over 24 hours with stable hemodynamics.
Her blood cultures grew out Gram positive rods (some preliminary identification of Corynebacterium) and budding yeast.
Past Medical History: -Neuroendocrine Tumor of the Pancreas - initially presented in [**2139-6-1**] with jaundice and weight loss.
CT scan showed a mass in the head, neck, proximal body of the pancreas invading the SMV as well as multiple enhancing liver lesions.
Pathology of the liver lesion revealed pancreatic endocrine tumor.
An octreotide scan in [**2139-10-1**], showed variable uptake and tumor markers were normal.
CT torso in [**2140-2-29**], there was marked interval enlargement of a pancreatic head mass with invasion of adjacent structures.
She had interval increase in the size of hepatic metastatic foci, all doubled in size since [**2139-6-1**], with a left lower lobe pulmonary nodule of 5 mm.
Has had cyberknife but with increasing lesions.
-Recent hernia repair  Social History: ETOH, no smoking, no illicits.

Large pancreatic head mass with metastases to peritoneum, third portion of duodenum, and possibly distal CBD.
Persistent loculated air and fluid collection in the right mid abdomen, with new air in adjacent portal vein.
This is concerning for erosive duodenal metastasis invading through duodenal wall and into portal vein.
If feasible, repeat examination with oral Gastrografin contrast would be helpful for further characterization.
Stable-appearing liver metastases post TACE.
6 mm left lower lobe nodule.
CXR [**2140-8-23**]: New right lower lobe opacity, consistent with atelectasis or pneumonia, if clinically appropriate.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year-old female with hx of metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor s/p XRT, whipple, with abdominal mets who presented to onc clinic today after 5 days of decrease po intake and 3 days of fevers with hypotension and a CT concerning for a necrotic mass near her duodenum.
# Hypotension/fevers: Upon presentation to the ICU, the patient was started on early goal directed therapy, with broad antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin/Cefepime/Flagyl.
Her CT was concerning for several findings, including her large pancreatic head mass with presumed erosive duadenal metastses into the portal vein, as well as a right buttock subcutaneous air and fluid collection, raises concern decubitus ulcer.
Her blood cultures have grown coag-negative staph, corynebacterium species, and budding yeast in her blood in the setting of necrotic mass invading duodenum.
She was weaned off pressors, and was afebrile on the floor.
Off pressors, her blood pressure remained normotensive to hypertensive.
Upon transfer to the hospital floor on [**2140-8-25**], the patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
The patient will likely require these antibiotics indefinitely due to the extensive tumor involvement of the portal ducts and vasculature and high risk of repeated bacteremia .
# Metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor:  s/p XRT, whipple, now receiving chemo.
Final CT read was concerning for tumor thrombi in portal vein and SMV, as well as a right buttock subcutaneous air and fluid collection.
No decisions were made, but a followup discussion will be arranged in the outpatient setting.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for nausea/vomiting, or anxiety.
Loperamide 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a day as needed for diarrhea.
Sepsis  Secondary Diagnosis 1.
Metastatic neuroendocrine tumor   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and fevers.
We found you had an infection, with bacteria in your blood.
A CT scan of your abdomen showed that the bacteria is likely getting into your blood from inflammation caused by the tumor.
