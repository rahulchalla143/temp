Admission Date: [**2117-10-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2117-10-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-1-22**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 109638**] is a 66-year-old woman with a history of renal cell CA treated 13 years ago with a right nephrectomy.
No chemo or distant mets at that time.
Presented to her primary care provider with an anxiety attack, crying, mental anxiety, no physical symptoms who at that time was noted to have a new heart murmur.
Also had a history of 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs and no shortness of breath at rest.
No chest pain, no lower extremity edema, no fatigue, no night sweats, no weight loss, no hematuria or abdominal pain.
An echo done on [**9-30**] showed a dilated right ventricle with hypertrophy and depressed function, consistent with RV pressure overload, severe pulmonary stenosis.
A CAT scan also done at that time showed a 2-3 cm mass in the main pulmonary artery with calcifications.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for renal cell CA, diagnosed in [**2106**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Daughter with cervical CA and mother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] CA.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  General:  No acute distress.
Neck:  No JVD.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds and no masses.
Extremities with no edema.
Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary process.
CTA shows a 2-3 cm mass in the main pulmonary artery with calcifications.
Following an extensive workup which includes ultrasound, TEE, MRA and cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronaries and a large calcific plaque distal to the pulmonary vein, the patient was ultimately scheduled for pulmonary vein homograft repair with excision of the pulmonary artery mass and on [**10-8**], the patient was brought to the operating room.
In summary, the patient had a pulmonary artery resection with excision of a mass and replacement with a 27 mm homograft.
The patient's bypass time was 204 minutes with no cross-clamp time.
However following the initial wean, she had oxygenation problems and was again sedated and fully ventilated.
Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
Distant heart sounds.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Warm and well-perfused with no edema.
Initial read of PA mass biopsy is renal cell versus sarcoma, more likely sarcoma than renal cell.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post excision of pulmonary artery mass and homograft repair with PDA ligation, status post nephrectomy, status post CCY, status post TAH and anxiety.
