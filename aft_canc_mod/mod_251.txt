HPI: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 9355**] is a 61 year old with ER+ breast cancer metastatic to bone and liver, most recently treated [**2161-4-14**] with 3rd cycle single-[**Doctor Last Name 360**] Doxil, currently on steroid taper after spine radiation, s/p fall at home last week, and referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED by home care nurse with right shoulder pain, generalized weakness, and tachycardia.
Shoulder was imaged on [**2161-4-30**] and showed fracture in distal and mid-clavicle.
She also reports constipation with no bowel movement for four days and abdominal pain.
On the evening on [**5-2**], she spiked fever to 102 through vanc and cefepime and her blood pressure trended down to 100s/60s, along with increased work of breathing.
ABG 7.42/43/83; received narcan 0.4mg, after which pt became verbal but delirious and moved all four extremities but then began salivating, with tachycardia and gooseflesh.
Family did report that the evening prior to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, pt complained of new low back pain.
ROS: denies fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty urinating, denies shortness of breath, coughing  Past Medical History: Onc Hx: Metastatic breast cancer involving the axial skeleton, right and left hip region, as well as sacrum, and bilateral ribs.
She is currently off chemotherapy and has completed radiation treatment to the left hip and thoracic spine.
- [**12/2156**]: Right-sided breast CA dxed on mammography at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Location (un) **].
An ill-defined 2 cm x 2.5-cm mass was identified in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.
- [**1-19**]: wide excision surgery with sentinel lymph node sampling pathology demonstrating 2-cm grade II infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast with clean surgical margins and lymphatic vascular invasion noted.
One sentinel lymph node showed no evidence of metastatic cancer.
- [**8-/2157**], she was maintained on Arimidex until [**6-/2159**] when she developed right hip pain; imaging with plain films and bone scan confirmed metastatic disease involving her right acetabulum, left fourth and fifth ribs.
- [**1-23**]: Palliative XRT to Thoracic spine for back pain and L hip.

[**5-21**] RUE US:  o evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
FINDINGS: There is dense consolidation and multifocal ground-glass opacities present throughout both lungs.
There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with the largest measuring 15 x 9 mm in a pretracheal location.
There are small bibasal effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no central or segmental pulmonary embolism; however, given the extensive consolidation and atelectasis at the lung bases, it is technically difficult to exclude subsegmental distal pulmonary emboli.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are multiple bilateral rib fractures.
There are multilevel degenerative changes present in the spine along with multiple lucent sclerotic lesions suggestive of diffuse metastatic disease.
There is also a fracture through the right clavicle.
Diffuse patchy opacities as well as scattered ground-glass opacities suggestive of infective change in both lungs.
There may be an element of superimposed pulmonary edema.
The cuff of the ET tube is slightly over-inflated and the tip of the ET tube is 2 cm from the carina.
Interval progression of the metastatic disease as suggested by bilateral rib fractures, fracture of the right clavicle and lytic sclerotic lesions in the axial and appendicular skeleton.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.
No vegetations identified.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report [**5-4**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: rule out epidural abscess MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM.
HISTORY: Known metastatic breast CA with Staph aureus bacteremia and new low back pain, rule out osteomyelitis or epidural abscess.
Re-demonstrated is extensive osseous metastasis throughout the lumbar spine and sacrum with compression deformities of L5, T12, T11 and T10.
There is mild epidural disease at T12 which is slightly increased compared to the prior study.
No cord compression is identified.
Small amount of stable epidural disease is also suggested at L4-L5 particularly in the lateral recesses which is unchanged, with extension to the foramina.
There is no loss of discs height to suggest discitis.
There is no evidence for epidural abscess.
IMPRESSION: Stable diffuse osseous metastatic disease with compression fractures at multiple levels.
No evidence for osteomyelitis or epidural abscess [**5-4**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST MR HEAD: Multiple calvarial metastatic lesions are redemonstrated.
However, no evidence of dural or brain metastasis is seen.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute infarction.
A small amount of mucosal thickening is noted in the right sphenoid sinus; otherwise the visualized paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells appear clear.
Diffuse heterogeneous appearance of the upper cervical spine and the clivus is likely due to metastatic disease also.
Multiple calvarial metastases.
Likely also involvement of the upper cervical spine and clivus.
No evidence of brain or dural metastasis.
Mucosal thickening in the right sphenoid sinus may be related to chronic sinus disease.
[**4-30**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS CTA CHEST: Again noted is widespread skeletal metastatic disease with multiple compression fractures through the spine and multiple rib fractures bilaterally at various stages of healing, with resultant deformity of the chest wall.
Note is also made of a new right midshaft clavicular fracture.
The current study is limited by patient respiratory motion; however, no central or large segmental pulmonary embolus is seen.
Lung volumes are decreased and there is likely mild fluid overload, without overt pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the aortic arch and in the coronary arteries.
There is no evidence of mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
A 1.8 x 1.1 cm soft tissue density in the right breast is spiculated in appearance and presumably relates to known breast cancer; the left breast is excluded on the current exam.
While the current exam is not designed for a subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, note is again made of hypodensities in the liver, which would be consistent with metastatic disease.
No evidence of central or large segmental pulmonary embolism; study limited by respiratory motion.
Low lung volumes, atelectasis/scarring, and probable mild fluid overload.
Widespread metastatic disease to skeleton and to liver as previously seen.
Suspicious soft tissue lesion in the right breast also noted and presumably related to known breast cancer.
New right clavicular fracture.
Multiple compression fractures in the spine and multiple rib fractures again noted.
[**4-30**] HUMERUS (AP & LAT) RIGHT SIX VIEWS OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER: There is an acute fracture of the mid clavicle with the distal fragment overriding superiorly approximately 1 cm.
An old distal clavicle fracture contains moderate surrounding callus.
No additional fractures are visualized.
Multiple variable aged right rib fractures are noted.
New mid right clavicle fracture.
Old distal right clavicle fracture.
Na 144, K 2.5, Cl 101, HCO3 37, BUN 15, Cr 0.2, glucose 111   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU for management of altered mental status/respiratory distress: .
In that setting, however, over the next several days she became increasinly hypoxic and spiked low grade fevers.
She continued to spike fevers and was covered with vancomycin/ceftazadime for possible VAP.
Broncheoalveolar lavage was performed when patient developed bloody airway secretions given concern for possible DAH, but showed only a tracheal erosion thought [**1-17**] to her endotracheal tube.
CT scan of the chest for persistent tachycardia and respiratory distress showed no evidence of PE, but demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP was thought to be unresponsive to therapy due to a concomitant CMV viremia found several days into her hospitalization.
The patient was initially started on gancicylovir for CMV therapy though she developed profound marrow suppression requiring change in therapy to foscarnet.
Her CMV viral load trended downward and her PCP pneumonia is thought to have responded to therapy.
Therefore, she went for tracheostomy.
Attempts were made to diurese the patient to treat a possible component of volume overload though this was limited due to relative hypotension.
The patient has signs of persistent diffuse patchy infiltrates on CXR concerning also for fibroproliferative ARDS.
# Altered Mental Status: Thought [**1-17**] to opiate intoxication as improved with narcan.
CT/MRI of the brain showed no evidence of metastases other than to the calvarium.
Patient did subsequently several days later complain of visual hallucinations attributed to an ICU delerium due to prolonged hospitalization, high dose steroids, low grade fevers, and opiate/benzo use.
These symptoms improved.
#CMV viremia:  Patient found to have unexplained fevers early in course, so was started on Gancyclovir for a presumed CMV infection.
She developed marrow suppression thought due to gancyclovir.
#MSSA Bacteremia: Patient had blood cultures + for MSSA.
TTE demonstrated no evidence of valvular lesions.
She had no indwelling lines, and imaging of her lumbosacral spine showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis.
A TEE was attempted but due to significant kyphosis the probe could not be advance beyond the proximal esophagus.
# Fever: Patient developed a fever on [**6-7**] with unclear source.
Originally question whether it was related to Cytogam infusion, however later felt more likely due to infection.
PICC was pulled and patient was started on Cefepime for empiric coverage.
She defervesced and culture data was only notable for sputum culture positive for Acinetobacter Baumannii sensitive to Cefepime.
Patient's tachycardia improved over her ICU course to a range of HR 80-90s.
# Clavicular Fracture: Orthopedics recommended sling and pain control PRN.
Pain was controlled as above with addition of lidocaine patch to her clavicle with some relief.
# Sacral Wound: Initially with several small open sacral lesions approximatley 1-2 cm in diamteter at greatest with one expressing a small amount of pus.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 9359**] of the lumbosarcal spine showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
# Code status.

PICC line flush   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Respiratory failure  Secondary Diagnoses - Breast cancer with metastases - Chronic pain secondary to bony mets - CMV viremia - Anemia - Hypokalemia - Hypophosphatemia - Hypernatremia - Anxiety/depression   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: Chronic respiratory failure - Mrs. [**Known lastname 9355**] has a tracheostomy and is on chronic ventilatory support.
She has had occasional events of respiratory distress while on these vent settings that are likely due to anxiety, somewhat improved with increased sedation.
Infectious Disease - Currently on cefepime 1 gram q12 hours (Start day [**2161-6-7**]).
Electrolytes - Mrs. [**Known lastname 9355**] has required daily electrolyte replacement  secondary to electrolyte wasting with foscarnet.
She will need potassium 40 meq po three times daily, neutra-phos 1 packet three times daily, free water flushes for hypernatremia, and magnesium sulfate repletion as necessary.
Hypotension - Patient has been intermitently hypotensive at night.
She should not return to the hospital for hypotension at night unless there are significant associated complications that raise concern for an unstable process.
