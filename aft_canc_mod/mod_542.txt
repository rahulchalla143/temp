Chest CT showing a near complete collapse of the left upper lobe of the lung, with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and an MRI of the brain with multiple lesions consistent with likely metastasis.
Was going to have outpatient evaluation however had worsening SOB and referred to ED.
No abd pain.
CT on [**2-2**] showed Left upper lobe collapse, concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma.
possible mets seen.
CXR shwoed left sided pleural effusion.
She became hypotensive to SBP 80 and received 1L NS with SBP coming up to low 90's.
Levofloxacin caused red splotches  On arrival to the MICU, She is complaining of left shoulder pain with coughing and deep breaths.

Few atypical cells (see note).
A cell block specimen  	(S12-4617D) was prepared in an attempt to better  	characterize the atypical cells, but these cells were not  	seen on the cell block preparation.
Sinus rhythm.
Low voltage.
Borderline intraventricular conduction delay.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
Left hilar mass with left upper lobe collapse and likely partial left lower lobe collapse.
Small left pleural effusion also noted.
Increasing airspace consolidation in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure is compatible with pneumonia.
No supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy is identified.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes overall appear slightly larger as compared to recent prior.
A pretracheal lymph node previously measured 11 mm in short-axis diameter and is unchanged (3:40) and a subcarinal lymph node currently measures 22 mm and previously measured 19 mm (3:55).
A right hilar lymph node measures 17 mm and previously measured 15 mm (3:53).
The heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
Extensive coronary atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are unchanged.
The thoracic aorta is non-aneurysmal throughout its course and demonstrates no signs of acute aortic syndrome.
There is no pulmonary embolism to subsegmental levels.
However, there is now complete lobar collapse of the left lower lobe; these findings are new from prior CT though similar to multiple recent chest radiographs.
The left mainstem bronchus is obliterated just beyond its origin, which may be due to mucous plugging or bronchial invasion by tumor.
There is increasing midline shift of mediastinal structures, consistent with volume loss and progressive atelectasis.
There is increasing non-hemorrhagic pleural fluid bilaterally, large on the left and small on the right.
The aerated right lung demonstrates moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysema.
A calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe is stable as compared to prior examination (3J:71).
Interlobular septal thickening, ground-glass opacities, and micronodular opacities predominantly with a perifissural distribution have increased and now involve both the anterior and posterior aspects of the right upper lobe, and perifissural portions of the right middle and lower lobes.
Regions of more confluent consolidation along the inferior margin of the right upper lobe along the major and minor fissure, may reflect confluent nodularity or subsegmental atelectasis(500B:12).
The overall increase in reticular-nodular septal thickening and ground-glass opacities suggest either progressive lymphangitic spread of tumor, infection or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Though not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, again seen are multiple punctate hypodensities throughout the liver, findings most consistent with biliary hamartomas.
However, an ill-defined hypodensity in segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/VIII has increased in size, now measuring 2.1 x 2.0 cm as compared with 1.1 x 1.3 cm on the prior examination (3:98), findings concerning for progression of disease.
An additional 1.0 x 0.9 cm ill-defined nodule is newly identified in segment VII and may be a new metastatic lesion (3:99).
Slight increase of the enhancing soft tissue nodule in the posterior right anterior wall.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: A healing fracture of the left 9th posterior rib is noted, possibly pathologic secondary to an underlying metastatic lesion.
Progressive atelectasis of the left lung, now with complete lobar collapse of the left upper and lower lobes.
Increase in bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions, large on the left and small on the right.
Occlusion of the distal aspect of the left mainstem bronchus, which may be secondary to mucous plugging or invading tumor.
Progressive interlobular nodular septal thickening and ground-glass opacities in the right lung.
Findings are nonspecific and may reflect asymmetric edema or infection, though the appearance is concerning for lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Increased size of a segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/VIII liver lesion and a newly identified segment VII lesion, findings concerning for worsening metastatic disease.
Healing fracture of the left posterior 9th rib, likely pathologic.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-7-29**], findings now compatible with acute pulmonary embolism  Brief Hospital Course: 81F with a PMH significant for depression, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism with significant pack-year smoking history who presented with progressive dyspnea and hypotension with increasing oxygen requirement in the context of recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer.
# Bronchogenic carcinoma with brain metastases: Patient presented with progressive dyspnea with CXR and CT imaging ([**2-2**]) confirming LUL collapse with no discrete mass identified, but most concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma associated with extensive hilar and mediastinal LAD.
Numerous hepatic hypodensities were also noted (although likely benign or cystic - possible metastatic).
MR imaging of the brain demonstrated multiple small enhancing foci in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres which likely represent metastases.
Patient had no neurological deficits but was started on dexamethasone at presentation for brain metastases.
# Left sided post-obstructive pneumonia/effusion Presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea and found to have a large left sided mass and pleural effusion.
Returned to the MICU with worsening of her hypoxia and dyspnea.
She was treated with vanc/zosyn for a pneumonia without any resolution.
