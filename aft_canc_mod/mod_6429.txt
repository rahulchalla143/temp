Admission Date:  [**2192-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-7-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**] Chief Complaint: fever, hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Aortic valve replacement Central line access PICC line access Intubation Arterial line Thoracentesis Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS and hypotension.
Per the daughter's report, the patient has been drowsy and delerious since discharge but has become more somnolent over the past 3-4 days.
The patient then developed respiratory distress and hypoxia.
He was transfered to the SICU for a question of aspiration PNA vs PE.
Eventually, it was decided that he did not have an aspiration PNA and that his tachypnea was [**1-7**] distended abd.
He was taken to the OR and found to have an incarcerated hernia which was repaired.
He was seen by the surgical service who did not think that his presentation was secondary to an abodominal process or related to his recent surgery.
MEDICINE TRANSFER HPI: 80M with PMH of CVA, small bowel obstruction, metastatic prostate CA, who was admitted on [**2192-9-28**] with fevers, altered mental status and was found to have MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve endocarditis.
Prior to his current admission he was admitted from [**Date range (3) 77130**] for small bowel obstruction which was complicated by incarcerated hernia which also required surgical treatment.
He was initially admitted to the MICU for sepsis as he was febrile and hypotensive.
Source was initially thought to be PNA given RUL infiltrate on CXR and hypoxia and he was treated with vanc/zosyn/levo.
He was also anemic on admission with HCT 22 and guaiac positive stools concerning for GI source.
On [**2192-9-30**] his blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and pip/tazo + levofloxacin were d/c'd and he was continued on vancomycin alone.
Despite treatment with vancomycin, he continued to have positive blood cultures and fevers.
He developed a pleural fluid which was concerning for empyema.
He had an initial TTE showing no definite valvular vegetation and was felt not to be stable enough for a TEE.
A repeat ECHO showed a large aortic valve vegetation and severe AR meeting criteria for surgery.
On the evening of [**9-8**] he was intubated due to increasing oxygen requirements and work of breathing from heart failure due to aortic insufficiency.
He was also started on levophed for hypotension.
Regarding his ongoing bacteremia, he was changed from vancomycin + daptomycin to linezolid on [**2192-10-12**] due to BCx positive Staph.
On [**2192-10-12**] he developed Afib with RBR and was started on amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] following loading with an IV drip.
Regarding his abdominal pain, on [**2192-10-15**] he had a KUB and RUQ u/s for abdominal pain and concern for SBO vs cholecystitis.
The KUB showed non obstructive bowel gas pattern with retained contrast c/w delayed transit.
His RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
LFT's were slightly elevated on [**2192-10-11**] but were improved on repeat [**2192-10-15**] .
He denies pain but winces on abdominal exam.

STUDIES: [**2192-10-3**] Interventional Radiology - There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild decrease in now small right pleural effusion.
Left pleural effusion, adjacent atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion is stable.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis or pneumonia in both lower lobes.
Mild ectasia of the ascending aorta.
Decreased amount of fluid along the incision in the midline anterior abdominal wall.
The left pectineus muscle is mildly enlarged and appears to have some fluid attenuation within it.
Sclerotic bone lesions suspicious for metastases such as from prostate cancer.
New rectal wall thickening compatible with proctitis.
[**2192-10-7**] CT head with & without contrast - CT HEAD BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or recent infarction is seen on the non-contrast study.
Prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are consistent with age-related involutional change.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the cavernous carotid and vertebral arteries.
A small mucus-retention cyst is noted in the right maxillary sinus.
There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
Small curvilinear calcification along the left posterior fossa is extra-axial and could represent a small meningioma, or dural calcification.
No region of abnormal enhancement is noted after administration of IV contrast.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality seen.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the lateral wall and distal septum.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a large, 2.3cm mobile vegetation with central lucency is seen on the LVOT side of the non-coronary leaflet aortic valve.
At least moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of aortic regurgitation is slightly increased.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the aortic valve vegetation and to identify a potential abscess.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is increase in the opacification of the right lung now involving not only the right lower lobe as seen previously but also the right upper lobe which potentially represent a combination of increased pleural effusion and parenchymal abnormality.
Given the worsening of the left perihilar opacities these findings may be represented by worsening of bilateral edema or multifocal consolidations.
[**2192-10-9**] Right Lower Extremity Ultrasound - IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no obstructive disease.
The LAD, LCx, and RCA all had diffuse irregularities but no significant obstructive stenoses.
There was marked ascending aortic enlargement requiring a JL6 catheter.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-10-20**] 8:13 PM  There is a punctate focus of elevated signal on image 21, series 502 of the diffusion-weighted scans, but which also appears to have slightly elevated signal on the commensurate FLAIR image.
Thus, the finding might represent so- called "T2 shine-through" of a previous small vessel infarct.
A few additional areas of chronic small vessel infarction, all subcentimeter in size, are seen within the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, as well as a few within the right cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly.
On diffusion image 15, series 502, there is a punctate area of elevated signal in the right occipital pole that is not seen on the ADC map, and could be an artifact.
While many of the provided images are degraded by patient motion, there is no overt sign for the presence of an intracranial mass lesion or shift of normally midline structures.
There are no areas of abnormal susceptibility seen within the brain.
There is generalized mild brain atrophy.
There is extensive high T2 signal within the mastoid sinuses bilaterally, which could indicate an inflammatory process.
CONCLUSION: Probable chronic small vessel infarction.
Extensive bilateral mastoid sinus T2 hyperintensity, which could reflect an inflammatory process.
Surgery was consulted on admission and did not feel that the patient had a small bowel obstruction.
MRSA sepsis was associated with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.
Despite treatment with vancomycin, the patient continued to spike fevers and grow MRSA from blood and sputum cultures.
He underwent a thoracentesis to drain accumulating pleural fluid due to concern for empyema.
The patient had a TTE showing no definite valvular vegetation and was felt not to be stable enough for a TEE.
On the evening of [**9-8**] the patient was intubated due to increasing oxygen requirements and work of breathing.
He was started on levophed for hypotension.
RLE Edema: R>L edema was concerning for clot but LENI negative.
AMS: Likely multifactorial secondary to infection and fever.
Per report, he had some degree of altered mental status at rehab following his ventral hernia repair.
Head CT was negative for acute intracranial bleed.
No sign of overt bleeding, however, mildly Guiac +.
Elevated Troponin: Troponins continuing to rise, no clear ECG changes although some T wave flattening on ECGs.
Pt may have septic emboli to coronaries given new wall motion abnormalities and reduced EF on recent echo.
On [**10-15**] he had KUB and RUQ u/s for abdominal pain and concern for SBO vs cholecystitis.
The KUB showed non obstructive bowel gas pattern with retained contrast c/w delayed transit.
His RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
LFT's were slightly elevated on [**2192-10-11**] but were improved on repeat [**10-15**].
MICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 77132**]: The patient was continue on the Lasix 40mg IV BID but this was stopped on [**2192-10-19**] due to concerns of rising creatinine.
An MRI was ordered for further work-up of mental status changes.
MEDICINE COURSE [**2192-10-19**] to [**2192-10-26**]: 80M with PMH of CVA, small bowel obstruction, and metastatic prostate CA admitted originally for altered mental status who developed vancomycin and daptomycin intermediate resistant endocarditis with destruction of the aortic valve now s/p valve replacement with persistant delirium.
He is also volume overloaded with an estimated 18L positive fluid balance not accounting for error and insensible losses.
The DD for his delerium is primary CNS process such as infection, infarct, met, toxic metabolic state, or degenerative process.
His bacteremia seems to be cleared and his cardiac status is stable.
# Delirium: Main clinical issue at this point.
Likely multifactorial related to toxic metabolic state, medications, possible CNS complications such as infection, infarct, met, or degenerative process.
To reduce this we have treated pain with tylenol standing and low dose MS IV if appeared to be in pain.
Has failed speech and swallow examination.
# Atrial fibrillation - he had Afib with RVR post-operatively for which he was started on amiodarone + metoprolol.
He has no h/o afib prior to surgery therefore may have been isolated event in setting of open heart surgery.
# Anemia: HCT 22 on admission with guaiac positive stools concerning for slow GI bleed.
Likely component of phelbotomy induced anemia in the context of anemia of inflammation.
Plan to transfuse if increasingly tachycardic or HCT <21.
Could be due to linazolid toxicity.
# UMN signs and possible frontal release signs.
Pt with toes up bilat, LE rigidity, reports inability to move legs due to weakness.
There is distant concern that he could have epidural abscess [**1-7**] seeding from his endocarditis.
As noted, MRI of the brain showed nothing to explain his delerium or neuro s/s.
Given that some of the signs have fluctuated, this may be a component of his delirium .
# Stage III Decubitus Ulcer - located on coccyx, followed by wound consult service.
# Volume Overload - Positive fluid balance over his length of stay with significant pleural effusions and lower extremity edema.
# Abdominal Pain: Now seemingly resolve.
He had a large BM after tap water enema on [**2192-10-26**].
# Prostate cancer: Known to have metastatic prostate cancer.
# Depression: prior to his prolonged two hospitalizations here he had been treated for depression with Remeron 45 mg qhs, Effexor XR 150 mg tabs (1.5 tabs daily) and Zyprexa 7.5 mg qhs.
He would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist once his delirium resolves.
# Nutrition: Patient due to delirium has been aspirating thin liquids and is unable to take po.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe [**First Name3 (LF) **]: Ten (10) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Staph endocarditis s/p AVR with porcine valve, delirium, stage III sacral decubitus ulcer, post-op afib resolved .
Secondary diagnosis: Metastatic prostate cancer, depression   Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from rehab for fevers.
Ultimately you were found to have Staph growing in your blood.
We found evidence that a valve in your heart was infected by this Staph and you required surgery to repain the damage done to your aortic valve.
We have treated you with long term antibiotics as a result of this infection as well.
