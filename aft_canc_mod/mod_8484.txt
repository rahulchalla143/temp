Low lung volumes.
Repeat evaluation with improved inspiration would be helpful, and following appropriate diuresis if there is concern clinically for pulmonary edema.
Diffusely increased sclerosis in the skeletal structures, consistent with known metastatic prostate cancer.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension/Respiratory Distress - On admission, the patient met SIRS criteria by leukopenia, respiratory rate, and heart rate.
The patient was not interested in invasive procedures, such at intubation or central line insertion.
The patient was interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation, antibiotics and peripheral pressors.
The patient received 5L of fluid in the ED as well.
He could not receive large amounts of fluids for his hypotension because it was felt that fluid overload was contributing to his shortness of breath.
# Acute Renal Failure - The patient's baseline creatinine was around 0.8, but his creatinine on admission was 1.8.
The patient appeared volume depleted on his initial exam and was hyponatremic and hypotensive.
Therefore, his renal failure was thought to be secondary to poor renal perfusion.
# Hyponatremia - It was felt that the patient's hyponatremia at presentation was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
# Hyperkalemia - It was felt that the patient's hyperkalemia on presentation was secondary to his acute renal failure.
He did not have any signs of hyperkalemia on EKG, and he was given kayexalate in the emergency department.
# Leukopenia - The patient presented with a leukpoenia that was likely due to a combination of his recent chemotherapy and marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.
# Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma - During his most recent hospital admission, the patient was evaluated for hospice.
