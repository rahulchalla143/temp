He had no diarrhea and no abdominal pain.
Patient has baseline change in mental status, but no acute change in mental status.
In general, the patient has denied complaints of shortness of breath, but it seems from the history that he had significant compromise in respiratory function.
History of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2198-11-28**] complicated by small cell carcinoma syndrome status post chemotherapy, four cycles of cisplatin, etoposide.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was originally admitted to the medical floor and found to have a pneumonia.
Was started on appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, but continued to develop worsening hypoxia requiring use of BiPAP.
However, during his first day in the Intensive Care Unit, patient suddenly suffered a cardiac arrest.
Initially, he became hypoxic and appeared to be seizing, and was found to be unresponsive with no pulse.
Initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation.
The patient had a very prolonged resuscitation period, rhythm oscillating between ventricular fibrillation, PEA, asystole, torsades and ventricular tachycardia.
Patient remained in ventricular tachycardia and torsades for about 30 minutes receiving multiple shocks at least 10.
He had occasional agonal breaths and was nonresponsive to commands.
The patient had no corneal reflexes.
Patient's family felt that he clearly expressed he does not want to be a vegetable or does not want to live with any artificial support.
Given his poor prognosis suffering a prolonged over 30 minute cardiac arrest, and the slim chances of any recovery combined with the natural course of his illness, the family decided it was best to withdraw care in accordance with the patient's wishes.
