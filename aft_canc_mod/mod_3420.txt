Melanoma that was resected in [**2140**], it was a right shoulder melanoma w/ sentinel lymph node biopsy neg and no chemo given.
Presented with hemoptysis [**2145-3-5**] found to have lung metastasis causing post obstructive PNA but was evaluated by IP for stent and found to have no obstruction.
Also had a right sided pleurex catheter place for malignant effusion which has since been removed.
She had recurrent hemoptysis so had bronchial artery embolization on [**4-8**] and then started on XRT.
also found to have bilateral PE's despite lovenox and IVC filter and was discharged to rehab on [**4-30**].
HTN 3.
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, recent hospitalization thought to have AVNRT 4.
Lower extremity DVT initially on coumadin but recieved IVC filter with recurrent hemoptysis and subsequent PE despite lovenox and filter 5.
She quit smoking 29 years ago 1.5 ppd for 2 yrs and she reports no EtOH.
Family History: Brother - melanoma in 20s.
Father with MI in 60s  Physical Exam: (Per Admitting Resident) VS: 98.2 113/65 127 20 95RA Gen: no acute distress, awake, alert, appropriate, and oriented x 3 Skin: warm to touch, no apparent rashes.
No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic pathology to explain the patient's symptoms.
Left lower lobe vague nodular opacity for which the differential includes infectious versus neoplastic etiology.
Mild decrease in size of right retroperitoneal/retrocaval mass.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
CT Head ([**12-27**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease on this limited non-contrast evaluation.
Cutaneous nodules on the right are unchanged.
ECHO ([**12-29**]) - IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Bilateral Lower Ext U/S ([**12-30**]) - IMPRESSION: Limited exam of the distal superficial femoral veins bilaterally due to body habitus, but no evidence of DVT of either lower extremity.
Increased size of large right mediastinal and hilar masses, with increased mass effect on the trachea, and worsening obstruction of the right middle lobe bronchus, and segmental right lower lobe bronchi.
Findings most consistent with mild pulmonary edema, including new small bilateral pleural effusions, scattered areas of ground-glass opacity, and mild interlobular septal thickening.
Possible enlargement of the pituitary gland currently measuring 10 x 10 mm and previously measuring 7 x 10 mm on prior MR [**First Name (Titles) 27533**] [**2146-9-30**].
metastatic Melanoma to lungs, h.o.
DVT on Lovenox, presents with N/V/D and developed atrial flutter with RVR.
# N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her admission as well as emesis x 3 days.
Most likely dx is viral gastroenteritis.
CT abd/pelvis was negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus, extrinsic compression.
Symptoms of nausea/vomiting resolved early in course, however she was severely anorexic and was not taking any POs.
Pt noted to have SVT on [**2147-12-27**] and showed A. flutter with RVR after receiving Adenosine x 2.
Patient was DC cardioverted with return of sinus tachycardia.
Cause of sinus tachycardia was unclear, patient was afebrile, not in pain, and not anxious.
LENIs were negative for DVT and patient had IVC filter in place.
It remained possible that tachycardia was due to spread of underlying malignancy as evidenced on chest CT.  After she was loaded on amiodarone, she was continued on a once daily regimen of PO amiodarone.
# Panhypopituitarism: Patient was noted to have low random cortisol.
Tests will need to be repeated when patient is off pain medications, since these can also suppress the HPA axis.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Pt had known mets to the lung and is currently being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
Patient underwent chest CT to evaluate disease progression, which did show increased size of large right mediastinal and hilar masses, with increased mass effect on the trachea, and worsening obstruction of the right middle lobe bronchus, and segmental right lower lobe bronchi.
# SIADH: Patient had normal serum sodium on admission, however patient was volume depleted from N/V/D x 2 weeks.
SIADH is likely due to metastatic lung disease.
# Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis that was thought to be related to her admission HA.
On review of CT scan no signs of sinusitis and CTX was D/Ced.
However, patient continued to have mild headaches, sinus pressure and leukocytosis that began rising after abx stopped.
# 02 requirement/wheezing: Patient had wheezing on exam and new 02 requirement noted after atrial flutter with RVR, likely due to pulmonary edema and worsened with IVF hydration in an attempt to control tachycardia.
# h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox, has IVC filter.
Pt was previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis.
LENIs were negative for PE as above.
# Transaminitis: Pt noted to some mild transaminitis on admission, with ALT trending down 81->71, AST increased from 38->50.
Alk Phose elevated in 110s.

These symptoms improved over time.
However, your course was complicated by an irregular heart rhythm called atrial flutter which required a transfer to the ICU.
Lastly, you are completing a course of antibiotics for sinusitis.
The following changes were made to your medications: - START amiodarone for heart rhythm abnormality - START prednisone for low steroid levels - START levothyroxine for low thyroid levels - STOP diltiazem - STOP metoprolol - CHANGE lovenox to 150 mg injected twice a day  Please take all medications as prescribed.
