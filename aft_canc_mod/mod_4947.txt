She noted the onset of her symptoms when walking out of a room and reaching for the light switch.
She had no difficulty with her gait and denied paresthesias, headache, visual changes, vertigo, or loss of consciousness.
No history of palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath.
In the ED, CXR was normal, but CT head showed superior left parietal lobe vasogenic edema concerning for mass/metastatic lesion.
An MRI of the brain then showed a 1.5cm enhancing left parietal subcortical mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of her brain mass and management.
Of note, she did have a mammogram on [**2100-12-28**] that showed dense nodular breast parenchyma with multiple nodular and dilated tubulovillous structures in the retroareolar area suggesting bilateral cysts, solid nodules, or dilated ducts.

No pleural effusions.
Impression: No active disease.
Head CT ([**Hospital1 **]): Superior left parietal lobe vasogenic edema concerning for mass lesion rather than an acute vascular insult.
1.5cm enhancing left parietal subcortical mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
No midline shift, but some mass effect on the posterior body lateral ventricle, lateral ventricule atrium.
Either metastasis or perhaps atypical primary brain tumor.
Discrete zones of cortical swelling, T2 hyperintensity, reduced T1 signal, in the left cingulate gyrus, right precentral middle frontal gyrus, left insular cortex, left frontal operculum.
Suspected to represent small metastases lacking enhancing component.
No brainstem or cerebellar abnormality.
No acute hemorrhage 4.
A T2 abnormality and faint enhancement is also seen at the medial left occipital lobe and T2 abnormality on the previous outside MRI examination from [**Hospital3 **] is seen in the right frontal region.
Although the appearance of the parietal lobe lesion as well as the suspected bony lesion in the right temporal lobe is suspicious for metastatic disease, the T2 abnormalities without significant enhancement are unusual without prior treatment for metastatic disease.
Ct head [**3-14**] - Status post left craniotomy for left parietal lesion resection with trace amounts of post-procedural subarachnoid blood, pneumocephalus, and localized sulcal effacement  MRI Brain w/w/o contrast [**3-15**] - Status post resection of left parietal lobe lesion.
Expected post-surgical changes are seen with a small area of residual enhancement laterally.
Other findings as described above including no evidence of acute infarct, increase in mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
MRI brain Wand study - [**3-16**] - No short-interval change with regard to expected post-surgical Preliminary Reportchanges and residual enhancement following resection of left parietal lobe  Ct heat [**3-16**] - Status post left parietal mass resection with expected postoperative change, but no evidence of hemorrhage or infarct  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2102-3-17**] 1.
Post-surgical changes in the left parietal region, along with blood products in the left parietal lobe at the site of the previously resected lesion.
A faintly enhancing lesion in the medial left parietal/occipital lobe not significantly changed.
Previously noted focus of altered signal intensity in the right temporal [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent a focal lesion or related to prominent venous structures.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 70yo female with pmhx of Stage 1a endometrial cancer s/p TAH/BSO who presented with weakness and numbness in the R arm and was found to have brain mass, concerning for malignancy.
She tolerated the procedure well without complications.
A head Ct obtained post-op showed slight blood at surgical site o/w no evidece of infarct or increase edema.
She tolerated the procedure well without intraoperative complications.
Over the weekend patient reported some hazziness on exam, but was otherwise stable.
