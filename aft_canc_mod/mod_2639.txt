Admission Date:  [**2190-9-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-9-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-6-1**]     Sex:  F  Service:  BMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old white female who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for further evaluation and management of acute leukemia.
At that time she began to feel a generalized weakness and fluid like symptoms.
After about two to three days of these symptoms she called her primary care physician who advised her to go to the hospital.
The patient received several red blood cell transfusions and had intermittent fevers at the outside hospital.
Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed possibility of infiltrates so the patient was started on Rocephin.
The patient denies fevers or chills, rigors prior to admission.
She also denies weight loss, bleeding, easy bruising, headaches or visual changes.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
General the patient was alert and oriented times three and in no acute distress appearing stated age.
Sclera anicteric and not injected.
Oropharynx was clear without lesions, erythema or exudate.
No cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Lungs crackles bilaterally most pronounced at the bases.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No organomegaly.
Well healed low midline scar.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Antecubital ecchymosis.
AML:  The patient's bone marrow biopsy from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital was reviewed and was consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia-AML .
The CT showed patchy infiltrates suggestive of the possibility of pneumonia as well as some emphysematous changes.
The patient was started on Levaquin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia after which she defervesced and had no further fevers.
Once the patient had been afebrile for over 48 hours the Cefepime was discontinued.
Cardiovascular:  During the third day of admission the patient complained of chest discomfort and palpitations.
An electrocardiogram was done, which showed atrial fibrillation.
The next day after returning to the floor the patient developed atrial fibrillation once again shown on telemetry.
After several hours of atrial fibrillation the patient's rhythm spontaneously converted back to normal sinus.
Per cardiology consult the patient was switched from Amiodarone to Sotalol for prophylaxis of arrhythmias.
At this time it was felt that the Sotalol dose should be decreased to avoid prolongation of her QT interval.
On this her electrocardiograms showed a QTC interval within normal limits and she was maintained on this dose.
In addition, while in the Intensive Care Unit the patient had an echocardiogram, which showed a moderate pericardial effusion.
The etiology of this was unclear, but possibly to be due to her pneumonia.
The patient never showed any signs or symptoms of cardiac tamponade.
The patient was not anticoagulated despite her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation due to the fact that her platelets remained low below 50 during the admission secondary to her disease.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially put on Zantac for history of reflux disease as this was her outpatient medication.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good, afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating po and ambulating without difficulty.
Atrial fibrillation.
