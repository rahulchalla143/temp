An 11 mm low attenuation lesion is noted within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the liver, most likely a small cyst and unchanged since previous imaging.
Periportal edema is noted, again possibly related to underlying cardiac dysfunction.
There is a calcified gallstones in the gallbladder.
Two focal area of calcification are present within segment VI of the liver and there is a focus calcification in the spleen.
No interval change in the mesenteric mass measuring 3.2 x 1.8 cm.
There are multiple surgical clips in the pelvis, presumably related to previous cervical surgery.
There is moderate free fluid in the abdomen and extensive anasarca.
There is extensive arterial calcification.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Bilateral pubic rami fractures are also noted.
No significant intra-abdominal hematoma or hemorrhage is identified.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Interval worsening of bilateral acromioclavicular joint degenerative change.
CT Head: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or acute large territorial infarction.
Moderate proportional enlargement of the ventricles and sulci is unchanged from prior and consistent with age-related cortical atrophy.
There is no scalp hematoma or acute skull fracture.
Mild mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid and maxillary sinuses is noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Interval worsening of bilateral acromioclavicular joint degenerative change.

Brief Hospital Course: 87 y/o female with metastatic cervical ca with RP mass, HTN, A fib and h/o DVT on coumadin, short gut s/p surgery for duodenal obstruction in [**2188**], h/o SBO, dCHF, sclerosing mesenteritis, severe MR, moderate pulmonary hypertension who presents to the ED with elevated INR, guaiac positive black stool, and mild confusion.
# Elevated INR/Anemia: Patient presented with a HCT 25.5(baseline Hct 25-29) and INR of 11.9 (coumadin for afib).
She had guiac positive dark stool, but not tarry or melanotic.
No clear precipitating factor for elevated INR.
Per son, he is concerned about patient being more confused than baseline and with possible incorrect self-administration of medications, which may be the primary etiology of elevated INR.
CT scan was done without contrast that ruled out retroperitoneal bleed.
As she has no clinical evidence of chronic liver disease, and her albumin is 2.6, her elevated INR was attributed to moderate malnutrition.
No evidence of acute bleeding.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Rate controlled with metoprolol , CHADS2 = 3.
Per son, patient can sometimes be confused with electrolyte disturbances in the past.
Son also reports alternation of sleep wake cycle, possibly making meals at incorrect times, and possible incorrect self-administration of medications.
No evidence of hypoglycemia, sepsis, or hepatic/ischemic encephalopathy.
Patient had a positive U/A that grew Klebsiella Pneumoniae and she was treated with ceftriaxone.
# Acute renal failure: Resolved.
# HTN: In the setting of concern for GI bleeding, and normotension patient's metoprolol, torsemide were all held and restarted on [**5-31**].
3. loperamide 2 mg Capsule [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
6. codeine sulfate 30 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 0.5 Tablet PO BID PRN () as needed for diarrhea.
10. opium tincture 10 mg/mL Tincture [**Hospital1 **]: Five (5) Drop PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Urinary tract infection - Delerium - Coagulopathy attributed to moderate malnutrition - Acute Renal Failure - GI Bleed, chronic, of undetermined etiology  Secondary - Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Your blood counts showed anemia (a deficiency of red blood cells), which further supported a recent GI bleed.
