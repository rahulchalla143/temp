She first noticed jaundice, [**Male First Name (un) 1658**]-colored floating stools, dark urine, and achylower abdominal pain radiating to back 1 week ago.
She denies weight loss, no N/V.
A MRCP there showed cholelithiasis and severe dilation of CBD (2-cm) due to presumed distal CBD stricture.
She had an ERCP on [**2-9**] c/b submucosal air injection leading to retroperitoneal air, PTX, and pneumopericardium.
She was placed on Unasyn and did not have a fever.
She was discharged without ABX and received Percocet for pain control, and her PTC was capped.
Mild Jaundice  nc/at, eomi, op clear supple crackles left base, [**Month (only) **] air movement s1s2 nl, rrr, no m/r/g soft, obese, nt/nd, PTC capped and in place.
no guarding or rebound tenderness.
Subcapsular collection about the right lobe of the liver containing gas and fluid.
Gas and fluid-containing collection posterior to the duodenum, small right psoas abscess, and retroperitoneal gas are consistent with duodenal perforation.
Ill-defined mass in the head of the pancreas with pancreatic ductal dilation is worrisome for carcinoma.
Multiple hypodense hepatic lesions including a cyst at the dome of the liver and additional lesions too small to accurately characterize.
Bilateral hypodense renal lesions are too small to characterize.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Successful placement of an 8 French locking pigtail catheter within a subhepatic fluid collection without complication.
No evidence of contrast tracking retrograde via the PTC catheter contributing to or causing this subhepatic fluid collection.
No change in small amount of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal air, slight increase in atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions compared to the study done one day earlier.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 82 year old female with a pancreatic mass, s/p ERCP and stent placement at an OSH on [**2198-2-9**], now with a gas and fluid filled collection posterior to the duodenum.
Mental status change: On HD 2, she had an acute mental status change, was  tachycardic, and had an increased O2 requirement.
Fluid collection: Later that day she went for successful placement of an 8 French locking pigtail catheter within a subhepatic fluid collection without complication.
No evidence of contrast tracking retrograde via the PTC catheter contributing to or causing this subhepatic fluid collection.
The drain put out ~100cc of clear, yellow fluid initially, and at time of discharge was only putting out a scant amount.
Resp: A CXR revealed pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Hypovolemia: She received IV fluid bolus for low urine output with good response.
