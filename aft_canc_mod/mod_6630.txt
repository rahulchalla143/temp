Admission Date:  [**2166-8-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-8-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-2-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2042**] Chief Complaint: new diagnosis of SCC of base of tongue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD w/ Biopsy  History of Present Illness: 62 yo man with h/o CAD, heavy smoking and new diagnosis of SCC of base of tongue with lymph node involvement.
At that time a 2.5 cm rt cervical lymph node was palpated and fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed a 1.5 cm rt base of tongue mass.
Eventually, in [**4-2**] he had the neck CT scan which showed a mass in teh rt oropharynx, rt cervical mass , bilateral LAD and compression of the rt internal jugular vein.Pt again did not show -up for f/u.
An FNA of the rt neck mass was also done and positive for poorly differentiated SCC.Post procedure he required pressors for a short time.
On arrival on the floor, pt reports that his neck pain is well controlled.
He has a persistent cough and thick secretions from trach.
CAD s/p STEMI s/p stents x 3 to mid LAD [**4-1**] 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3. s/p ankle surgery   Social History: Pt lives alone, works in food service at [**Hospital1 778**].
Etoh: one six packs/week Illicits: denies   Family History: No known cancer diseases in the family  Physical Exam: T 99.8  P 81 BP 113/72 RR 24 O2 sat 93% RA General: Unable to talk, writes to communicate, appears comfortable in no respiratory distress, coughing copious secretions from trach during interview HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, sclerae non-icteric, o/p clear, MM dry, good movement of tongue but fullness of OP.Poor dentition.NGT in place.
Neck: Supple,trach in place, rt cervical mass extending to supraclavicular region,left cervical enlarged lymph node measuring 3 cm palpated.
CV: S1S2, reg rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
RESP: Good air movement bilaterally, no rhonchi or wheezing.
Recent study reports: [**2166-8-10**]:portable CXR: bilateral atelectasis, no infiltrate.
[**2166-8-4**] CT chest [**Hospital1 2025**] : There is some patchy groundglass opacity in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
There also some airspace opacities in both lower lobes in the basal segments just above the hemidiaphragms.
There is subcutaneous air in the lower neck and upper mediastinum probably related to placement of the tracheostomy tube.
There is also some fluid in the retrosternal area.
There is a 1.1-cm right paratracheal lymph node.
Limited contrast-enhanced views of the upper abdomen show no abnormality within the visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, or kidneys.
[**2166-8-4**] CT NECK from [**Hospital1 2025**]: There is a large peripherally enhancing irregular right tongue base mass with internal air and low density material likely representing necrosis and secretions which extends across midline into the left tongue.
Mass effect displaces the larynx and hyoid bone slightly to the left and there is effacement of the upper airway.
Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are seen bilaterally with central low density likely representing necrosis.
These masses result in extrinsic compression of the internal jugular veins, though the vessels remain patent without evidence of thrombosis.
There is opacification of left ethmoid air cells with air fluid level in the left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses possibly representing hemorrhage.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical spine which are worse at C6-7.
There is no severe stenosis at the origins of the right brachiocephalic artery or at the origins of the bilateral subclavian, vertebral or common carotid arteries.
There is mixed calcified atheromatous plaque of the bilateral carotid bifurcations resulting in mild bilateral internal carotid artery narrowing.
Remaining cervical carotid arteries are unremarkable.
There is mild stenosis of the right vert origin from calcified plaque.
No other significant stenosis is noted in the cervical vertebral arteries.
There is normal enhancement of the visualized intracranial circulation.
Calcified plaque is noted in the carotid siphons and intradural vertebral arteries in which there is minimal narrowing of the left intradural vertebral artery.
Base of tongue, right, biopsy (A-B): Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, seen only on frozen section slides.
The findings support the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.
No discrete fluid collection.
Slight decrease in size of base of tongue mass with improvement in central hypodensity since [**2166-4-17**].
Phlegmonous change or soft tissue swelling with associated narrowing of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, new from [**2166-4-17**].
Enlarged necrotic bilateral cervical lymph nodes, essentially stable, aside from a slightly enlarged left cervical node.
Sinus disease as described above is new from [**2166-4-17**].
Mild biapical and left lower lobe focal ground glass opacities are new from [**2166-8-4**] and nonspecific.
These could represent focal asymmetric pulmonary edema or atypical infection and aspiration cannot be excluded.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left and new or increased compared to [**2166-8-4**], with adjacent atelectasis.
Known cervical lymphadenopathy is better assessed on accompanying CT of the neck.
Coronary artery calcifications in the LAD.
Bilateral floridly FDG-avid soft tissue conglomerate in the neck, right much worse than left.
FDG-avidity in the soft tissues around the tracheostomy site, in keeping with recent procedure.
Mildly FDG-avid, patchy opacity in the lingula, likely infectious in etiology.
Bilateral non-FDG-avid pleural effusions, right worse than left.
Left maxillary, frontal and ethmoid sinus disease.
[**2166-8-14**] Cardiac echo:The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-6**], regional wall motion abnormalities are no longer appreciated.
Alt 24 Ast 21 AP  43 TB  0.2   Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo man with new diagnosis of SCC of the oropharynx Stage IVB s/p tracheotomy transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] for further management.
His course was complicated by upper airway infection with fever and purulent trach secretions and bleeding/skin breakdown around his trach site.
He had transient changes in mental status attributed to the high dose steroids that he received as premedication for the docetaxol in his chemo regimen which were treated with haldol and DC of steroids.
# SCC of the base of tongue: Rad onc and ENT consulted in the ICU.
Pt started on decadron 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 days [**2166-8-15**] and DC'd for agitation [**2166-8-18**].
Treated with allopurinol because of large tumor burden.
However, given hypotension at OSH and sinus bradycardia dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **].
D/C'd plavix per cardiology recommendations since patient is more than a year from stent placement and requiring peg tube placement and chemotherapy in the near future as well as recent hemoptysis and continued evidence of blood in trach secretions.
Cardiac echo with Nl LVEF and improvement in wall motion abnormalities seen after MI.
Seen in consultation with cardiology and treated with decrease in metoprolol and transient DC of fentenyl patch used for his cancer pain and trach site pain.
Restarted fentanyl patch [**8-19**] since this does not seem to be the culprit med and no further bradycardia on telemetry.
# Hyperglycemia: transient, mild, likely due to steroid premedication for chemotherapy.
# Agitation/delerium: likely due to decadron for taxotere, age and sleep deprivation.
Increased morphine to 30-60 mg per G tube Q2H prn pain just prior to transfer.
#Fever: Patient had fever, leukocytosis, and purulent trach secretions in the ICU.
Fever again on the floor.
Source of fever include possible aspiration pneumonia/trach- sinusitis.
Afebrile last 48 hrs Received unasyn [**Date range (3) 86317**] with resolution of fever, WBC normalized and secretions cleared.
DVT PPX: restarted heparin [**2166-8-17**] following DC due to episode of bleeding around trach.
precautions: Aspiration .
Contact: no family/close friends.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for continuing medical care  Discharge Diagnosis: Squamous cancer base of tongue CAD Bradycardia Hyperglycemia (mild with steroids) Pain Upper respiratory infection Skin breakdown at trach site PEG for nutrition Mental status changes (transient with steroids)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] after undergoing urgent tracheostomy for bleeding from your tongue cancer that was causing you to have problems breathing.
While you were in the hospital you had a slow heart rate that was treated with decreasing your metoprolol and stopping your fentenyl patch.
[**Name (NI) **] also had an upper airway infection that was treated with IV antibiotics.
After discussion with the heart doctors, your plavix was stopped because you had some bleeding around your tracheostomy site and also needed your PEG tube placed for nutrition.
