RUQ U/S showed GB wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid that could indicate cholecystitis; cholithiasis present, however no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation and no choledocholithiasis identified.
Patient had a CT a/p on [**2119-11-12**] to r/o RP bleed due to hematocrit drop which was negative for bleed however did show that perc chole drain was in atypical position.
Patient also with abdominal pain attributed to bile leak.
Given overall concern for persistent cholecystitis plan is for HIDA in the am.
Of note, LFTs have been elevated AST/ALT ratio > 2.
Hepatology consulted [**2119-11-12**], thought likely alcoholic hepatitis worsened by sepsis (significant heavy etoh history, currently drinks 3x per day).
Concern for hep B/C given history of multiple blood transfusions and IVIG for MDS.
Also with esophageal stricture as seen on ERCP with possible aspiraton pneumonitis.
Currently patient has no complaints.
No nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Denies any sob or cp.
Mild cough.

Gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, in the setting of cholelithiasis, representing acute cholecystitis.
No choledocholithiasis, or intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
CXR: [**2119-11-9**] No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
Vascular congestion in the lungs and mediastinum is mild, and the lungs are on the verge of edema.
Bilateral simple pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Small-to-moderate intraabdominal fluid is simple in nature and tracks along paracolic gutters and into the pelvis.
No retroperitoneal fluid collections.
| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S PENICILLIN G----------<=0.12 S VANCOMYCIN------------ <=0.5 S   Brief Hospital Course: 65F w/ hx tonsillar CA, last chemo 4 years ago, p/w septic shock secondary to presumed cholangitis.
# Septic Shock: Presented with hypotension requiring pressors.
Presumptive source cholangitis based on presentation of fever, jaundice and RUQ pain with ultrasound showing gallbladder thickening with pericystic fluid.
No evidence of other focal infection such as PNA, UTI initially, though she later had focal infiltrate and was broadened to vanc/cefepime/flagyl.
Pt's vanc/cefepime/flagyl were discontinued on [**11-20**] due to absence of signs or symptoms of infection.
The patient did not have any clinical evidence of cholangitis.
At this time the patient continued to have evidence of severe sepsis.
She continued to have a leukocytosis and intermittently slight fevers throughout her course.
This most likely was a combination of her liver failure as well as continued septic shock.
# Elevated bilirubin/transaminases: Initially fit with picture of cholangitis; however, in the setting of rising Tbili despite PTC drain, hepatology was consulted.
They felt she may have component of alcoholic hepatitis in setting of long term continued alcohol use.
HbsAg negative, HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive suggesting previous infection.
Pt does not have cirrhosis by ultrasound imaging, which shows essentially normal liver structure.
After spending some time in the medical ICU the hepatology service question whether this could also be a biliary disease process as well.
Patient continued to have liver failure with significant elevations in her total bilirubin.
The hepatology service felt that this was a nonreversible end-stage liver disease with a extremely poor prognosis.
# elevated creatinine: Admitted with Cr of 2.2 from unknown baseline (stable from OSH): likely representing acute on chronic kidney disease.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent ARF from septic shock, resolved to Cr 1.0, however elevated again in setting of diuresis to 1.4.
CT a/p was done to eval for RP bleed in setting of intra-abdominal procedures above.
anemia otherwise stable and felt to be [**2-22**] MDS.
The patient remains somewhat anemic throughout her stay and there was no clear source for her anemia.
Most likely secondary to either marrow suppression or anemia chronic disease.
The patient continued to have thrombocytopenia throughout her stay.
There is no significant bleeding episodes.
#Altered mental status: Patient had significant altered mental status most likely was secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
An EEG was performed and showed evidence of some ictal activity.
#Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of a superventricular tachycardia most likely AV nodal reentrant tachycardia.
nutrition was following and provide daily recommendations for nutrition changes as needed.
#Respiratory failure: The patient had significant respiratory problems her stay.
She was eventually extubated but remained somewhat hypoxic and required high oxygen requirements most of the time she was in the medical ICU.
Her respiratory distress and hypoxia was most likely due to episodes of pulmonary edema as well as a suspected ventilator associated pneumonia.
The patient's fluid status was maintained by hemodialysis and she received a treatment of antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.
The patient was weaned from the pressors and given IV analgesia for comfort.
