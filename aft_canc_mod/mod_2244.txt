Admission Date:  [**2148-6-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2148-7-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-9-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL ICU/OMED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old Italian female with past medical history significant for CLL status post allo BMT in [**2148-2-10**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] secondary to a several day history of fevers.
The patient has also had a two week history of a frontal headache and as a result, a head CT was attained in outpatient clinic, which revealed findings of a sinusitis.
She finally agreed to admission and presented to the ED on the 12th with continued fevers and chills along with a two day history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Questionable graft-versus-host disease.
History of CMV viremia x3.
ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.
In general, the patient appeared fatigued, but was in no acute distress.
Her skin revealed a perioral, nasolabial, and chin erythematous rash with white scaly patches.
Left Hickman site was without erythema or pus.
KUB showed no obstruction.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 146 with T-wave inversions in I and L as well as left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.
She developed progressive multiorgan failure.
She developed acute oliguric renal failure.
Her grade 4 graft- versus-host disease of the GI tract and the skin continued to progress despite high doses of Solu-Medrol, CellCept, Remicade, and cyclosporin.
She also continued to have unrelenting diarrhea.
She developed microangiopathic changes and DIC  with an INR that continued to rise eventually reaching 1.7 with schistocytes on her smear, a low fibrinogen and a LDH of 1,922.
She also developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with intermittent rapid ventricular response.
This was thought to be multifactorial in etiology in part due to uremic/hepatic encephalopathy, questionable TTP, and drug induced as the patient had been receiving high doses of benzodiazepines and narcotics in the setting of hepatic and renal function.
As she was given fluid boluses in last effort to improve her urinary output but without effect.
She became persistently more hypoxic with agonal breathing at times.
Towards the end of her hospital course, however, the patient's chest x-ray did reveal multiple nodules bilaterally very concerning for fungal infection.
In light of her worsening clinical condition.
It was decided to continue the current level of care including all medications and laboratory draws, but there was to be no escalation of treatment (i.e., no intubation, hemodialysis, or pressors).
The patient later that afternoon became persistently more hypotensive and bradycardic likely secondary to her progressively increasing acidemia from her renal failure.
Multiorgan failure.
