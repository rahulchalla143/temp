# Hypercalcemia: In the ICU, patiently initially found to have elevated Ca, that resolved with IVFs.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma:  Patient is s/p laparoscopic nephrectomy on [**2099-9-21**] and pazopanib therapies.
On this admission a Chest CT done was done that showed extensive neoplastic invasion of the right hemithorax, extending across the chest wall and into the abdomen overlying the right psoas.
