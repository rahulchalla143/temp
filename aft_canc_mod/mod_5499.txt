Admission Date:  [**2165-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-5-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-8-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Trazodone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, transfer from 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic malignancy,  who presents from the out-patient gynecology unit with complaints of progressive shortness of breath.
She was recently evaluated as an out-patient for complaints of weakness, abdominal pain and shortness of breath.
At that time, an abdominal U/S was obtained, which revealed an enlarged uterus with an echogenic mass.
Further work-up included an abdominal MRI remarkable for an enlarged uterus, thickened endometrial stripe, and a vaginal mass.
A CXR was also obtained, concerning for metastatic disease, and a CT chest subsequently confirmed pulmonary metastases, without PE.
She reports a 2-week history of progressive shortness of breath, with progressive limitation in exercise tolerance.
She endorses a cough, largely non-productive, and tightening "like a band" around her chest, without definite pleuritic chest pain.
She reports no PND, no orthopnea, no lower extremity edema.
She denies fever or chills.
She endorses a 40-lbs weight loss in the past 8 months.
No night sweats.
No fever as noted above.
No history of abnormal PAP, last in 09/[**2163**].
No colonoscopy.
Metastatic malignancy as above 2.
Fibromyalgia  Social History: She lives at home with her husband.
Family History: Sister with uterine cancer at age 53, other sister with breast cancer at age 50, mother with breast cancer at age 74.
No testing for BRCA done.
Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission VITALS: T 99.4  HR104  BP125/71  RR32  O2sat: 92%RA on 6L NC GEN: Tachypneic, able to speak with full sentences, short of breath with minimal exertion.
Thrush in oropharynx.
RESP: Bilateral inspiratory crackles, no wheezing, no bronchial breathing.
No murmur appreciated.

[**2165-5-6**] CXR: Multiple nodular opacities in both lungs, concerning for metastatic disease.
Nonspecific white matter changes.
Several small foci of increased T2 signal in the cerebellum most, consistent with chronic ischemic injury.
Endometrial stripe markedly thickened measuring approximately 5 cm.
Several large uterine fibroids.
Large T2 hypointense T1 isointense enhancing myometrial fibroid in the right aspect of the uterine fundus, 5.0 x 5.3 cm in diameter.
Second large anterior fundal fibroid measuring 5.0 x 5.7 cm which has mass effect on the endometrial stripe, slightly hyperintense the T2 sequence and enhances following administration of contrast.
Evidence of a mass in the posterior superior vaginal wall.
Marked thickening of the posterior wall of the vagina with a focal mass superiorly and posteriorly that measures 2.5 by 1.4 cm.
Note is made of a prominent left iliac chain lymph node which measures approximate 8 mm in short axis dimension.
Innumerable pulmonary metastases.
Enlarged uterus with soft tissue in the endometrial canal which appears confluent with a fundal fibroid.
Differential diagnostic considerations include endometrial carcinoma invading a fibroid or a leiomyosarcoma invading endometrial canal.
Both endometrial carcinoma and leiomyosarcomas of the uterus had been described to demonstrate vaginal metastases.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Innumerable noncalcified nodules, and masses within the lungs concerning for metastatic disease.
Slight regression in overall tumor burden with decrease in the size of most of the pulmonary nodules by 10-20%.
The increased lung volumes are due to ventilation.
Slightly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
New bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusion.
No definitive in situ component or lymphovascular invasion is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic malignancy with innumerable pulmonary metastases and progressive respiratory decline.
1) Pulmonary: As noted above, her initial CT chest was remarkable for innumerable pulmonary metastases, without PE (although a subsegmental PE could not be excluded).
Given her respiratory compromise and hypoxemia, she was admitted to the ICU on the day of presentation.
Empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl were initiated to cover for a possible pneumonia or post-obstructive process, even though no definite airway compression or obstruction was seen on imaging.
The pathology from her vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and per Hematology/Oncology, systemic chemotherapy was initiated with Carboplatin and Taxol (day 1 on [**2165-5-14**]).
2) Metastatic malignancy: As noted above, pathology from her vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly differentiated carcinoma, most likely squamous.
Following initiation of chemotherapy, she developed febrile neutropenia, and antibiotic coverage was broadened appropriately with Aztreonam and Vancomycin in addition to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Caspofungin was subsequently added given persistent fevers without a clear source.
Unfortunately, given minimal radiographic response to chemotherapy, lack of clinical improvement, continued requirement for mechanical ventilation with obvious discomfort with any attempt to wean, and grim prognosis, support was withdrawn at the family's request, and a focus on comfort measures was instituted on [**5-30**].
