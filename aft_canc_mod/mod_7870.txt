She has also had intermittent nausea & vomiting, which she had also experienced during her last admission.
She was evaluated by [**Last Name (un) **] during her previous admission for elevated blood glucose in the post-operative setting.
CXR showed patchy opacification R > L although low lung volumes.

Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.
Moderate cardiomegaly appears increased since [**2181-2-13**], although this may be accentuated by low lung volumes.
Bilateral vascular congestion is concerning for pulmonary edema.
[**2181-3-15**]   Radiology CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO: FINDINGS: There are trace bilateral pleural effusions or pleural thickening and minimal adjacent atelectasis.
The previously seen small nodule in the left lower lobe along the pleura is no longer seen.
The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions.
No evidence of obstruction.
There is no free fluid.
There is no free air.
There is no mesenteric, retroperitoneal, or pelvic lymphadenopathy identified.
There is soft tissue stranding throughout the subcutaneous tissues likely from mild edema.
A small fluid collection measuring 2.2cm AP x 2.3cm T x 8.8cm CC along the incision site most likely represents postoperative seroma.
There is no definite surrounding stranding or rim enhancement to suggest abscess.
The central superior deformity of L3 without retropulsion is unchanged.
There are new deformities at the superior endplates of T11 and L1 compared to [**2181-1-9**] representing new compression fractures, no evidence of retropulsion.
A small fluid collection measuring 2.2cm AP x 2.3cm T x 8.8cm CC in the subcutaneous tissues along the incision site most likely represents postoperative seroma.
There is no definite surrounding stranding or rim enhancement to suggest abscess, however infection of this fluid collection cannot be ruled out by CT. 2.
There are new compression deformities at the superior endplate of T11 and L1 compared to study on [**2181-1-9**].
Patient is status post partial gastrectomy with no intra-abdominal findings to explain patient's symptoms.
[**2181-3-16**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: Previous interstitial pulmonary edema has cleared and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement have resolved, although the heart is still mildly enlarged.
The lungs are clear aside from minimal residual edema, or atelectasis at the base of the left lower lobe.
Pleural effusion is small, if at all, on the left.
No pneumothorax.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2181-3-16**]): No MRSA isolated.
Also WBC was elevated at 18 and Cr was 1.7.
There was a substantial free water deficit and she was aggressively hydrated and repleted with electrolytes when needed.
Potential sources included HCAP and post-surgical infection.
Abd CT showed a small fluid collection measuring 2.2cm AP x 2.3cm T x 8.8cm CC in the subcutaneous tissues along the incision site most likely representative of postoperative seroma - surgery felt this was not infected and not responsible for precipitating DKA.
CXR revealed bilateral low lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.
Subsequent CXR revealed no evidence of infection and so the abx regimen was switched simply to cipro.
A 7-day empiric treatment course of cipro was given - for the low-possibility that pneumonia was present on admission.
She presented with recurrent nausea and diarrhea since previous admission.
Low suspicion for intraabdominal abscess.
Her nausea and vomiting is unchanged since her last hospitalization at which time an upper GI series showed no obstruction and KUB was normal.
The leading thought was that this was partially attributed to a dumping syndrome - and she was made well aware of the need to take small/frequent meals and avoid high-fat, high-sugar meals and minimize large bolus intake at a time.
Obstructive sleep apnea:  Continue CPAP .
Acute renal failure: Resolved after hydration.
Given her recent medical condition and the stresses associated with work, it is unlikely that she will be able to return to work in the immediate-to-intermediate future (at least 2 weeks).
