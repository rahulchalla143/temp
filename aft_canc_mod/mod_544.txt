CONCLUSION:  An infiltrate in the left lower lobe suggestive of infection.
Congestive heart failure.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
MRA/MRI Small hyperintensity seen only on the diffusion-weighted sequence which is too small to fully characterize.
If neurologic abnormalities are referred to this area, followup study could be performed for further evaluation.
More distally/inferiorly, the distal SMA as well as the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are not imaged due to lack of anatomic coverage.
[**2167-12-18**]: SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:    DIAGNOSIS:  BONE MARROW INVOLVEMENT BY PLASMA CELL DYSCRASIA.
VASCULAR DEPOSITION OF CONGOPHILIC BIREFRINGENT MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH AMYLOIDOSIS.
The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with a plasma cell dyscrasia with immunoglobulin light chain associated systemic amyloidosis.
Erythrocytes show mild anisopoikilocytosis and hypochromasia.
Suggestion of red cell agglutination is noted.
The white blood cell count appears mildly increased.
Numerous small, cytologically typical plasma cells, occurring singly and in large clusters are present.
Numerous small plasma cells with vacuolated cytoplasm are present focally in clusters.
Amorphous eosinophilic deposition is present in the thickened blood vessel wall, consistent with amyloid.
Megakaryocytes are present in mildly decreased numbers.
There is an interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly in small clusters occupying 20-30% of marrow cellularity.
ADDITIONAL STUDIES:  Cytogenetics (please refer to separate report)   Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male h/o HTN, COPD, with recent admission for LE swelling with renal failure and transaminitis - found to have dx of amyloid (by renal bx) and multiple myeloma presented LLL PNA.
#  LLL PNA - Presented with SOB in the setting of recent cytoxan tx.
Found to have a LLL infiltrate and completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime.
# Multiple myeloma - Previously started Velcade on [**12-24**] however this was discontinued secondary to transaminitis.
This admit he was given cytoxan with poor response.
After a though case review and multidisiplinary meeting in was determined that with the complication of amyloid, nephrotic syndrome, and complications seen with velcade it was not possible to make significant improvement in his condition.
Acyclovir has been continued with his recent chemotherapy and should be continued in hospice to prevent painful mouth lesions.
# amyloid/nephrotic syndrome- Amyloid noted on [**12-18**] Bone marrow.
[**12-21**] Renal biopsy showed global glomeruli distruction.
The patient remains anasarcic from the nephrotic syndrome associated with this finding.
However diuresis resulted in repeated hypotension and was therefore discontinued.
His renal function was acutley worsened with hypotension however improved to baseline with fluids and dialysis was not need.
# Metabolic acidosis: treated with PO Bicarb while in the hospital  # Chronic Hepatitis B - continued lamivudine.
This should be continued at hospice to prevent a painful hepatitis.
# Constipation - Resolved with Colace, senna, miralox, bisacodyl  ICU course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the ICU on [**1-11**] after an episode of hypotension on the floor in the setting of PNA, possible colitis and BRBPR.
Surgery was consulted with ischemic colitis in setting of hypotension as well as infectious colitis incl C diff on differential.
Lactate was initially 3.7 but quickly normalized and pts abd pain and BRBPR quickly resolved as well.
Exact etiology of hypotension was never determined.
Surgery in the end did not this ischemic colitis likely but did think a 10-14D course of abx would be appropriate.
GI did not want to do colonoscopy due to risk of bowel perforation.
While pt was in ICU, he did have a bedside TTE which showed EF 75% with mild LVH suggestive of possible diastolic dysfunction.
Renal continued to consult during ICU course and thought amyloidosis likely [**12-21**] multiple myeloma was the continuing cause of his renal failure.
Also per their recs, Lasix used for peripheral edema and pt was put on PO bicarb.
Transaminitis persisted and thought to be [**12-21**] velcade toxicity, chronic hep B or amyloid infiltration.
In ICU, patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mood and mental status.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent depression vs disorientation in setting of hospitalization vs primary neurological process.

You were found to have many medical problems including a cancer called multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, kidney failure and neprhotic syndrome.
You were also in the Intensive care unit for hypotension and altered mental status complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding.
In addition your kidney damage is perminant making removal of your excess fluid impossible.
Please contact the hospice team for any symtpoms you are experiencing such as pain, shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhea, fever, headache, or any other worrsisome symptoms.
