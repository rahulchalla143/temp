Admission Date:  [**2107-11-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-12-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-8-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: presenting for elective surgery  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy endotracheal intubation central venous catheter placement arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 60 year old female, with no significant past medical history, recently referred to gynecology-oncology for a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
She initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with a complaint of progressive shortness of breath.
She also reported a 20-30 pound weight loss, gradual abdominal distention and bilateral lower extremity swelling.
She was found to have a large right pleural effusion and underwent a 2.5 L thoracentesis, with negative cytology.
CT torso on [**10-20**] showed bilateral pulmonary opacities, diffuse lymphadenopathy, ascities, and ovarian masses.
Ultrasound on [**2107-10-21**] showed bilateral pelvic soft tissue masses with ascites and normal uterus.
CA-125 was elevated at greater than 2500.
Patient underwent TAH/BSO, and ascites drainage.
Right pelvic lymph node was sent for frozen section which was found to be consistent with lymphoma.
Intraoperatively, she received 1 L IVF and was bolused subsequently for low UOP and for post-operative hypotension.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing treatment.
While in the ICU, she was put on up to 3 pressors for her hypotension.
She went into acute renal failure (thought to be from hypotension-related ATN with a possible component of tumor lysis syndrome from steroid-induced lysis) requiring CVVH and rasburicase.
She was diuresed aggressively for a 20L net positive fluid status since her ICU admission.
Also while in the ICU, she was noted to have an EF of 20%,; it is unclear if this is from an MI in the setting of hypotension or if it is just "shocked" myocardium.
After her acute issues stabilized, the patient was transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for further management.
not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli HEENT: PERRL CV: distant heart sounds, nl s1, s2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTA anteriorly Abd: midline abdominal dressing clean and intact.
obese, nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds.
Ext: warm, trace edema, no cyanosis.
pedal pulses present neuro: not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli [**3-3**] sedation.
CT scan [**2107-11-4**] for lymphoma staging: There is mildly heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid gland with a small 1-cm hypodense nodule within the right lobe.
There are multiple nodes present within the mediastinum, the largest of which is seen within the paraesophageal space measuring 16 mm in diameter.
There are bilateral enlarged hilar lymph nodes which cannot be definitely measured given lack of IV contrast.
There is marked axillary lymphadenopathy with a representative node on the right measuring 20 x 18 mm and is seen on series 2, image 6.
A representative node within the left axilla is seen on series 2, image 8, measuring 16 x 12 mm.
There are multiple tiny nodules seen within the breasts bilaterally, the largest on the left hand side measuring 12 x 15 mm, seen on series 2, image 16.
There are bilateral large pleural effusions.
There is a 27 x 15 mm node along the right pericardium measuring 15 x 27 mm, seen on series 2, image 36.
The gallbladder wall is thickened likely secondary to third spacing.
The adrenal glands are not well visualized secondary to an extensive amount of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extending from the level of the SMA inferiorly and encasing the aorta and IVC.
There is extensive lymphadenopathy within the mesentery with a conglomerate of nodes measuring 57 x 40 mm, seen on series 2, image 85.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
There are no adnexal masses with the exception of extensive lymphadenopathy that extends into the deep pelvis bilaterally inferiorly from the above-mentioned retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy along the iliac nodal chains.
The largest bulk of this lymphadenopathy measures 94 x 47 mm along the left iliac nodal chain seen on series 2, image 105.
Also noted within the subcutaneous tissue in the midline of the abdomen are a few pockets of air seen along a linear soft tissue defect likely secondary to prior surgical intervention.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle.
The apex is milldy aneurysmal and akinetic, but no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though the apex is trabeculated.
There is focal akinesis of the apical half of the RV free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle.
The apex is milldy aneurysmal and akinetic, but no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though the apex is trabeculated.
There is focal akinesis of the apical half of the RV free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is a moderate-to-large amount of ascites present in all four quadrants, best appreciated in the left lower quadrant.
In the left lobe of the liver there are two uniformly hyperechoic lesions, the largest of which measures 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm with appearance consistent with hemangiomas.
No other focal abnormalities are demonstrated within the liver.
The gallbladder is collapsed with likely wall thickening again, which could be secondary to third spacing of fluid.
A small roughly 1 cm anechoic lesion, without blood flow is demonstrated within the spleen, not fully characterized on this study, though possibly a cyst.
The previously described extensive mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy is not well assessed on this study.
Color flow and Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature was performed given history of ascites.
The inferior vena cava is generally narrowed without intraluminal filling defects.
This appearance could be secondary to fluid status or secondary to ascites.
There is a large right pleural effusion with complete passive collapse of the right lung.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
CYTOLOGY: Pleural Fluid: By immunohistochemical stains, the lymphocytes are a mixture of CD20 positive B-cells along with CD3 positive (B greater than T).
Although definite co-expression of CD5 amongst B-cells could not be discerned, a subset of weak CD5 expressing cells is seen amongst the brighter CD5 positive T-cells.
INTERPRETATION Findings are of involvement by a Lambda restricted, CD5-positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immunophenotypically consistent with patient's known mantle cell lymphoma.
The decadron was discontinued after the patient developed psychotic paranoia.
She developed tumor lysis syndrome with elevated uric acid, and initially requiring CVVH.
Malignant effusion:  The patient originally presented with shortness of breath from a right pleural effusion and ascites.
Her right pleural effusion was tapped twice, both large volume.
Cytology was positive for lymphoma.
The patient remained short of breath after this procedure and underwent a 1.6 liter thoracentesis by interventional pulmonary.
She tolerated the procedure well with immediate symptomatic improvement.
She underwent CTA which demostrated a very large right pleural effusion with right lung collapse.
The patient, however, had an improvement in her symptoms and decrease in her oxygen requirement.
She underwent R-CHOP in an effort to treat the underlying cause of her effusions.
The diagnosis of lymphoma was made on an intraoperative lymph node biopsy.
Repeat TTE, when her critical illness resolved revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, but persistent right sided failure.
Prior to beginning treatment with R-CHOP, the patient again had an echocardiogram which demonstrated resolution of the right heart failure and 2+ MR. .
ID:  the patient had asymptomatic pyruia on [**11-14**], and was treated for 7 days with Zosyn for a Citrobacter UTI.
She remained afebrile while neutropenic.
Chronic back pain: MRI demonstrated no spinal or vertebral involvement of her lymphoma.
She was maintained on narcotics for pain control.
As her ascites reaccumulated, her pain medication requirement increased.
MRI revealed no spinal involvement of her lymphoma .
Disposition: The patient will go to rehabilitation to assist her after her prolonged hospitalization and very low functional status at this point.
