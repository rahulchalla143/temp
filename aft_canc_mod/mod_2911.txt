Admission Date:  [**2185-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-2-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lasix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**] Chief Complaint: cough and malaise  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
None   History of Present Illness: 87M with recent admission for PNA here with increasing productive cough.
Pt reported that he felt better when he went home, but 2-3 days later, felt increasing fatigue and increasing cough productive of yellow and then green-yellow sputum.
Denies n/v/abd pain, no fevers/chills at home.
Pt denies any blood in sputum.
Chest CT showed multifocal PNA.
In the MICU, he was treated with vancomycin, azithromycin, and zosyn for pneumonia refractory to levofloxacin.
However, on hospital day 2, he developed hypertension with acute shortness of breath; this was treated with a NTG gtt.
Because of his dyspnea and tight, wheezy lung exam, he was started on steroids for COPD exacerbation, although he does not carry a history of COPD.
A short course followed by short taper was planned to treat the COPD.
Past Medical History: Bladder cancer- originally diagnosed [**2160**] and treated with   conservative mgmt, recurred in [**2181**] in NY, s/p chemo/XRT, s/p   intravesical BCG/IFN x6 completed [**4-29**], recurrent tumors on   cystoscopy, s/p transurethral resection [**12-29**] Peptic ulcer disease DVT- [**2183**] DVT occured spontaneously, DVT 35y ago in postop setting   (varicose vein stripping),on coumadin since [**2183**] CRI- etiology unclear, baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5 spinal stenosis (low back pain and B LE pain) left hernia repair.

CXR [**2185-2-10**]: Multifocal pulmonary opacities in the right mid and both lower lung regions show interval improvement with residual confluent opacity most prominent in the right middle lobe.
IMPRESSION: Improving multifocal pneumonia and likely resolving superimposed interstitial edema.
TTE [**2185-2-10**]: Normal EF, No valvular disease .
7-mm right lower lobe nodular opacity seen on a single view.
Further characterization of this finding with repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs is recommended following resolution of the right middle lobe consolidation.
Micro: BlCx x2: 1/4 bottles w/Coag Negative Staph Negative for Influenza A and B   Brief Hospital Course: 87M with recent PNA on levofloxacin, now with worsening multifocal pneumonia.
had episode of respiratory difficulty overnight requiring numerous interventions including lasix (although CXR afterwards showed no signs of CHF), albuterol nebs, nitro for afterload reduction, and finally BiPAP .
# Respiratory distress/Multifocal pneumonia - Patient readmitted for multifocal PNA that did not respond to levofloxacin as an outpatient.
Alternatively, it was considered that the patient could have a secondary infection superimposed on his prior pneumonia.
The patient was started on Zosyn/Vanco to cover broadly given progression of symptoms and radiographic appearance of PNA as well as Azithromycin to cover atypicals.
He was admitted to the MICU given his oxygen requirement and respiratory distress.
In the MICU, the patient had two episodes of tachypnea to the 40s.
The first episode of sudden tachypnea and increased O2 requirement was thought to be [**2-25**] mucous plugging.
The patient had a second episode of respiratory distress with RR 40s and was given bipap with improvement of rr 20-30.
The patient was started on IV solumedrol for wheezing thought to be consistent with COPD/reactive airways disease.
A TTE perfomed showed no evidence of valvular disease with EF > 55%.
His CTA showed multifocal pneumonia but no evidence of PE (although it was somewhat limited study due to patient motion).
His pneumonia and respiratory status began to improve on the Vanc/Zosyn.
Additionally, the patient was found to have significant wheezing on exam thought to be consistent with a component of COPD/reactive airways disease.
Although the patient does not have known COPD, he was started on IV steroids for presumed reactive airways disease contributing to his severe respiratory distress.
# Hypertension - Patient's hypertension to SBPs 240s in the ED were thought to be likely from catecholamine surge in the setting of possible early sepsis.
# Anemia: Patient found to have new anemia with Hct 30-32.
Hemolysis labs were sent with no evidence of hemolysis.
# Bladder Ca - Patient was found to have recurrent bladder cancer on a recent cystoscopy.
There are no acute issues at this time.
His UA was noted to have many RBCs which is not seen in prior UAs but pt has known bladder Ca.
The patient will need further followup as an outpatient with his urologic oncologist.
Currently no acute issues at this time.
UA was noted to have many RBCs which is not seen in prior UAs but .
# CKD - No acute issues.
# h/o DVT - The patient's coumadin was stopped in the ICU in the event a procedure was necessary and he was bridged with a heparin gtt.
# FEN/GI - heart healthy diet .

Bladder cancer 2.
Patient is stable but still with O2 requirement and wheezing on exam.
Please return to the hospital for symptoms of worsening dyspnea, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
