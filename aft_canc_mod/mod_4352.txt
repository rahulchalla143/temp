Admission Date:  [**2106-9-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-9-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-12-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: lethargy, worsening left weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2106-9-14**]: Right Craniotomy for evacuation of hematoma   History of Present Illness: 70 woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer in [**2104**] with metastatic spread to bone.
The patient is currently on emcitabine and was to begin cycle 2 on [**9-1**]; however, the patient presented to  [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with complaints of weakness for the past two days.
The weakness has been mainly noticed in the BLE.
Imaging revealed Right SDH and she subsequently underwent a craniotomy and evacuation of the SDH on [**9-2**].
CT scan revealed increasing chronic R SDH with increased MLS.
She was afebrile and WBC=10, but U/A was positive.
antigravity b/l UE's and withdraws b/l LE's.
Sensation: Intact to light touch  Incision- well healing, staples in place  On Discharge: A&Ox3 PERRL EOMs intact Motor: 4-/5 BUE, wiggles toes bilateral LE Incision: c/d/i   Pertinent Results: [**2106-9-13**] CT head: IMPRESSION:  Increased size of predominantly hypodense right cerebral subdural collection, likely a CSF hygroma, with increased shift of midline structures.
Effacement of suprasellar cistern is new and compatible with early transtentorial herniation.
[**2106-9-13**] CXR: Left lower lobe consolidation could be secondary to pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.
[**2106-9-14**] CT head postop: Decreased right subdural collection, now consisting of fluid and air, with improvement in associated mass effect.
No new hemorrhage.
Also increased are the signs suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.
Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2106-9-15**]  1:58:56 PM Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Diffuse non-spefific ST-T wave changes.
Low voltage in the axial leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-8-25**] the heart rate is slower and the T wave inversion in  leads V2-V3 is more prominent.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 74 176 80 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 86871**] 156  [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2106-9-16**]  Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated due to the suboptimal nature of this study).
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There has been reduction in extra-axial pneumocephalus when compared to the prior study.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since removal of the right subdural drainage catheter.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-9-17**] 4:25 AM  Mild pulmonary edema has improved, now persisting mainly at the lung bases.
Moderate left pleural effusion stable.
No pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Minimally increased right lateral ventricular effacement and increased size of the right subdural collection by measurements.
This may be technical as there are no new hyperdense blood products, but small interval reaccumulation cannot be entirely excluded.
COMMENTS ON ATTENING REVIEW: There is interval enlargement of the right epidural fluid collection underlying the craniotomy flap, which explains the slightly increased effacement of the right lateral ventricle, compression of the third ventricle, and slightly increased leftward shift of midline structures.
The right subdural fluid collection is stable.
[**9-18**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous focal slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere.
There are occasional runs of very rhythmic delta activity or sharp and slow wave discharges in the right posterior quadrant which do not clearly involved in frequency or field.
These findings are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right posterior quadrant.
The background on the left shows mixed theta and delta activity, suggesting moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
There are no definite electrographic seizures.
Increased right epidural fluid collection underlying the right craniotomy flap, compared to [**2106-9-16**], with associated increased effacement of the right lateral ventricle, compression of the third ventricle, and slightly increased leftward shift of midline structures.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectases are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
Of note, the atelectasis in the right lower lobe has minimally increased.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable.
[**9-19**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of continuous focal attenuation and prolonged runs of quasi-rhythmic 1 Hz delta activity with intermixed sharp waves in the right posterior quadrant.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right posterior quadrant.
The background shows disorganized mixed delta and theta activities suggestive of moderate to severe encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there are no significant changes.
[**9-20**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of continuous focal attenuation and prolonged runs of quasi-rhythmic 1 Hz delta activity with intermixed sharp waves in the right posterior quadrant.
Focal attenuation and runs of delta activity with intermixed sharp waves are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right posterior quadrant.
Background activity is characterized by disorganized mixed delta and theta activities indicative of moderate to severe encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
There are no electrographic seizures.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there are no significant changes.
[**9-20**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: The right epidural collection is minimally decreased.
Unchanged subdural collection along the right convexity.
POstop head CT showed good evacuation of SD collection without new hemorrhage.
The cardiac echocardiogram, but suggestive of Right Heart failure.
A chest X ray was consistent with mild pulmonary edema which has improved, persisting mainly at the lung bases.moderate left pleural effusion stable.
No pneumothorax.
A CT was performed which was questionable for slightly enlarging SDH vs positioning.
Her SQH was decreased to 5000units [**Hospital1 **] due to an increased ptt on AM labs.
[**9-18**], A head CT demonstrated worsening changes and the patient exhibited less movement on the left.
CXR demonstrated pleural effusions.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
