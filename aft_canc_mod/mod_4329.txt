Admission Date:  [**2191-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-7-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-5-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] Chief Complaint: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 58yo F w/ a h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] (d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] 2d PTA), HTN, HL, GERD, duodenal ulcer s/p perforation/repair at [**Hospital1 112**] who p/w 8 hours of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
After she was d/c'd on [**7-18**], she reports feeling well until yesterday evening at 5pm, when she began having large volumes of diarrhea q15 minutes.
Non-bloody and non-bilious.
The vomiting and diarrhea resolved at around 2am with continued nausea.
No pets or recent travel.
She reports no infectious symptoms around the time of her visit.
She was found to [**Last Name (un) **] with a Cr 6.6 and diffuse, painful muscle cramps associated with hypomagnesemia (Mg 0.5).
[**Last Name (un) **] was presumed to be due to contrast nephropathy given I+O+ abdominal CT 3d prior to that admission due to concern for renal mass (later dx as renal cysts).
FeNA was c/w a prerenal picture.
Aggressive volume repletion and Mg repletion ensued, though patient became anuric and renal consult was placed.
U/S concluded patent renal arteries and presence of renal cysts per above.
Physical examination notable for mildly distended abdomen, nontender.
ROS: (+) per HPI (-) for headache, dizziness, increased sweating, syncope, fevers, chills, CP, SOB, cough, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, constipation, feeling of  fullness, increased flatulence, changes in bladder habits, weakness, paresthesias, difficulty with coordination, gait disturbances .
Past Medical History: two past episodes of ?ARF (dehydration/diarrhea leading to need for Mg repletion) HTN Hyperlipidemia Hypokalemia of unclear origin Previous duodenal ulcer with perforation and surgical intervention Renal mass, dx as renal cysts by CT ([**7-12**]) and U/S ([**7-16**]) Anemia  Social History: Lives with her husband, has two adult children (28 and 38 who both live locally).
Physical Exam: VS: Tc 98.4 Tmax 98.4  HR 110 BP 167/99 RR 18  O2sat 97% RA General: weak-appearing, lying in bed HEENT: sclerae anicteric, conjunctiva noninjected, MM moist, oropharynx without lesions, exudate CV: rrr with intermittent pauses (irregular intervals), soft [**3-19**] systolic murmur @ LUSB Lungs: CTAB Abd: soft/NT, distended, hyperresonant to percussion; no fluid wave or shifting dullness, +BS, no guarding or rebound tenderness Ext: LE appear wasted, 2+ pulses, no c/c/e Skin: WWP, no rashes Neuro: Cranial nerves II-XII intact.
Pertinent Results: Renal ultrasound ([**2191-7-16**]): Small renal hypoechoic lesions in both kidneys can be cysts.
Normal renal arteries and venous Doppler.
Poor R wave progression, no findings to suggest ST changes.
EGD-Atrophy and granularity in the esophagus Congestion and hypertrophy in the stomach body and fundus (biopsy) Congestion, nodularity, ulceration and hypertrophy in the whole examined duodenum compatible with acid excess or infiltration (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
C. Random colon: Colonic mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Normal hepatic echotexture, without evidence of a focal lesion.
Small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 58yo F with h/o alcohol misuse, hypertension, and recent admission for presumed contrast-induced [**Last Name (un) **] and dehydration admitted with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and with recurrent [**Last Name (un) **].
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Leukocytosis prompted fever workup esp for viral gastroenteritis, blood and stool cultures sent as well U/A, although bacterial infection less likely given 64.7% PMNs.
Lipase was elevated suggesting ?pancreatitis, but lipase can be falsely elevated in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient did not report abdominal pain and exam was benign but for distention and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Osmolar gap was found to be normal, but urine tox was positive for barbiturates and amphetamines.
Patient adamantly denied drug use, symtoms suggest a more severe underlying process.
On Day 3 of admission ([**7-22**]) patient appeared more somnolent and began having massive volumes of purely liquid stool.
She continued on NS @ 150, was drinking ginger ale but had unremitting nausea requiring both zofran and compazine.
Her diarrhea was calculated to be secretory in nature and she had up to 7L of stool output a day when her symptoms were at the worst.
Several hormonal studies (Vip, gastrin, serotonin, chromogranin A, HIAA) and a TTG were sent to determine the etiology of her diarrhea and were pending when she was transferred back to the floor.
Prep for an EGD and c-scope was started prior to transfer to the floor.
EGD showed hypertrophy of stomach, duodenal hypertrophy congestion consistent with excess acid secretion.
# Coagulopathy, anemia.
It was thought her coagulopathy was likely related to malabsorption and poor nutrition.
A RUQ u/s was ordered and negative for liver pathology.
Likely [**3-15**] to dehydration from large volume diarrhea/vomiting, FeNa was 0.2% suggesting a prerenal process.
TTKG is 10.28, above normal limits and suggesting renal potassium wasting.
SPEP sent given ?hypercalcemia, elevated serum proteins, [**Last Name (un) **], and patient's age, slight suspicion for multiple myeloma.
Also on the differential is amyloidosis given GI sx (particularly diarrhea), [**Last Name (un) **] and proteinuria per prior admission (possibly due to RBCs in urine), some evidence of conduction abnormalities on EKG (skipped ventricular beats).
Hypercalcemia with hypophosphatemia (though also hyperphosphatemia) on last admission might suggest primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
PTH sent to parse out etiology of hypercalcemia, found to be elevated at 167.
Zollinger-[**Doctor Last Name 9480**] possible given history of reflux symptoms (tx with PPI until last admission, now on H2 blocker) and history of duodenal ulcer s/p perforation.
No clinical symptoms or signs of Paget's disease (pain, fractures).
She was found to have vitamin D deficiency and was therefore sent home on calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
# Anion gap: Presumed metabolic acidosis with anion gap of 25.
Likely due to starvation based on excessive diarrhea/vomiting and recent ETOH use.
Serum osms were calculated and there was no gap.
Patient has no documented history of diabetes and did not report taking salicylates.
AG resolved with fluids, metabolic acidosis persisted and urine AG was found to be negative suggesting appropriate renal response to loss of HCO3.
#electrolyte derangements-including hypomagnesemia-likely related to IVF repletion, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea and acid base status.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Major: nausea vomiting diarrhea hyper and hypocalcemia acute renal failure hypomagnesemia hematemesis anemia due to chronic disease elevated parathyroid hormone vitamin D deficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
When you arrived we found that your electrolytes were abnormal and you had kidney injury.
This was likely related to your diarrhea and dehydration.
We also performed a number of tests on your urine and blood to check for different hormonal disorders that could lead to severe diarrhea.
We think you might have gotten a viral illness that made you vomit and have diarrhea but that you also may have something else that is causing these episodes so frequently.
You had an episode of low blood pressure and vomiting a small amount of blood that led to an ICU stay.
In addition, you had an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy.
Your endoscopy shows some abnormalities that can be seen with excessive acid production or possibly due to another disorder.
You may have a possible abnormality near your "thoracic aorta"-blood vessel in your chest.
If diarrhea returns at home, please be sure to drink plenty of fluids or gatorade.
It can lead to many long-term problems including liver failure and heart problems.
Medication changes: 1) Your ranitidine was increased to 150mg twice a day 2) You were started on Mag-tab for magnesium replacement 3) you were started on vitamin D for vitamin D deficiency 4) you were started on calcium for your bones.
If you develop any of the symptoms described below or any other symptoms concerning to you please call your primary care doctor or go to your local emergency room.
Please ask the GI doctors to follow up on your neuroendocrine hormonal markers and biopsy results.
