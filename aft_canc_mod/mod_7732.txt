Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation is present.
A tiny amount of pericholecystic ascites is present.
IMPRESSION: Extra- and intra-hepatic biliary dilatation as described above, in a patient with pancreatic head mass concerning for obstruction due to the pancreatic mass.
The lungs are clear of consolidation or edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
Mild degenerative changes are seen at the lower thoracic spine, primarily in the form of small anterior osteophytes.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
No definite hemorrhage or mass effect.
Punctate 7mm hyperdensity in the right cerebellum may represent a granuloma or other infectious etiology.
No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
Fluid within the esophagus placing the patient at increased risk of aspiration.
Perihepatic/perisplenic ascites and heterogeneous liver compatible with metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M with metastatic pancreatic cancer with known duodenal mass who presented with abodminal pain and hematemesis with altered mental status and was originally admitted to the [**Hospital 332**] medical ICU.
On arrival the patient was noted to be altered.RUQ ultrasound showed ductal dilatation and elevated alk phos with tenderness on exam was concerning for possible cholangitis as the source of a neutropenic sepsis.
Discussions with his family regarding the level of aggressiveness of his care were discussed and it was felt that although he may temporarily benefit from an ERCP if it was cholangitis it was also very possible that given his comorbidities and current state may not be able to be extubated and the family decided not to pursue this and instead to make hte patient CMO.
