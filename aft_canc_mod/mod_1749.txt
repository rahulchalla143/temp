Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p trans-hiatial esophagojejunostomy, total gastrectomy   History of Present Illness: This gentleman has cancer of the gastroesophageal junction which appeared to mostly involve the stomach originally.
He had a large peri portal lymph node which made him unresectable essentially for cure prior to treatment but this was negative on PET CT after his treatment and therefore he became an operative candidate.
It was thought that he may have enough residual disease in his stomach, as noted by PET CT that he may need much more extensive dissection of the stomach and that a minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy may not be feasible.
Prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2106**] status post brachytherapy, most recent PSA [**8-/2111**] 0.1.
Low back pain with history of L4-L5 disk herniation  Social History: He lives with his wife.

POD 4 - Barium swallow performed, limited study showed no leak at the anastamosis site.
