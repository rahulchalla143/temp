Admission Date:  [**2158-1-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-2-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-11-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: L sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 65yo man with PMH significant for small cell lung cancer metastatic to the liver and bone, HTN, hyperlipidemia, OCPD, presents as a transfer from an OSH with new onset headache, L hemiparesis, and alteration of consciousness.
He presented to the OSH on [**2158-1-26**] with acute on chronic diffuse abdominal pain.
The day of transfer, his RN found him at 9am with his legs over the side of the bed, lethargic, incontinent of urine, and complaining of a new frontal headache.
He had a left facial droop and left hemiparesis.
On arrival, he endorsed headache and abdominal pain but no other complaints.
He has been treated with chemotherapy with fair stability of the lesions (last CT showing LAD, hepatic mets with no significant change, but an increased size of the lung lesion), but has had a 60lb weight loss, decreased appetite and po intake, and 4 months of abdominal pain.
Cranial nerves: pupils equal and symmetric, R gaze preference, ?left hemianopia or hemineglect.
Sensory: grimaces to pain throughout Coord: unable to test  On discharge: MS: Frequently sleeping (sometimes with eyes open) but arousable and will follow commands and answer questions appropriately.
Pertinent Results: Admission labs: GLUCOSE-131* UREA N-19 CREAT-1.2 SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-15  freeCa-1.23 CALCIUM-9.3 PHOSPHATE-3.4 MAGNESIUM-2.0  WBC-10.8 RBC-3.28* HGB-10.2* HCT-30.0* MCV-91 MCH-31.1 MCHC-34.1 RDW-19.4* PLT COUNT-65*  PT-12.5 PTT-26.4 INR(PT)-1.1  ALT(SGPT)-19 ALK PHOS-358* AMYLASE-46 TOT BILI-0.5 OSMOLAL-283 LIPASE-29  Discharge labs: WBC-7.9 RBC-3.44* Hgb-10.8* Hct-32.7* MCV-95 MCH-31.3 MCHC-32.9 RDW-19.3* Plt Ct-333 Glucose-103 UreaN-52* Creat-1.3* Na-142 K-4.1 Cl-106 HCO3-22  Pending labs: FREE KAPPA AND LAMBDA, WITH K/L RATIO-PND  IMAGING: Head CT noncontrast: Examination is limited secondary to patient motion.
There is a large hemorrhage in the right fronto-temporal lobe extending to basal ganglia measuring approximately 6.3 x 2.0 cm with surrounding hypodensity consistent with edema.
There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with 2 mm of midline shift to the left.
There is probable mild subfalcine herniation.
IMPRESSION: Right fronto-temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending to basal ganglia with surrounding edema with slight degree of midline shift.
As noted on the examination, there is a large right frontal temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending into the basal ganglia.
There is surrounding edema and mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of herniation.
There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
On series 12, image 388, there is a subtle enhancing lesion in the right centrum semiovale.
This could represent a small vascular anomaly as opposed to metastatic lesion, given the absence of adjacent edema.
There is no enhancement in the region of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: There is no enhancement in the region of hemorrhage to indicate that this is from a metastasis.
Small lesion in the right centrum semiovale could be consistent with a small vascular anomaly versus (less likely) a small metastasis.
No acute infarcts.
Repeat Head CT [**2158-2-2**]: Increasing edema since [**2158-1-28**].
Otherwise similar appearance of large right cerebral hemisphere intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Repeat Head CT [**2158-2-4**]: Overall no significant interval change in size of right large cerebral hemisphere intraparenchymal hemorrhage and associated mass effect since [**2158-2-2**].
EEG [**2158-2-7**]: ABNORMALITY #1: A [**3-16**] Hz slow and disorganized background rhythm was noted in the waking state, which increased by [**12-13**] Hz with external stimulation.
ABNORMALITY #2: The right hemisphere background activity was 1 Hz slower and of decreased amplitude compared to the left hemisphere activity.
ABNORMALITY #3: Bursts of generalized moderate amplitude delta slowing was noted in the waking state.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to patient's mental status.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the slow, disorganized background rhythm, decreased voltage over the right hemisphere and bursts of generalized slowing.
The slow and disorganized background rhythm and bursts of generalized slowing suggest a moderate encephalopathy.
The decreased voltage and slightly slower background over the right hemisphere suggests right hemisphere subcortical dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 65yo man with metastatic cancer presenting as a transfer from an OSH with new left hemiparesis, decreased alertness, plts <100k, and a right frontal hemorrhage.
Most likely etiology is hemorrhage from a metastasis in the setting of thrombocytopenia, though he has no known metastasis there.
Other etiologies include hypertension (though he has not been terribly hypertensive, his BP does not have to be that high, especially with the thrombocytopenia, to bleed), hemorrhagic conversion of stroke; unlikely to be amyloid, trauma, or vascular malformation.
He had an MRI for further evaluation; it did not clearly demonstrate an underlying metastasis, though it did show a small lesion in the right centrum semiovale that might be a metastasis.
As his repeat head CT showed significant edema, the decadron was tapered only to 4mg q12hrs and he was discharged on this dose, to remain stable until his follow up appointment with neuro-oncology.
Hospital course was also notable for: 1. hypertension - treated with metoprolol and captopril for goal SBP<140 2. atrial tachycardia - also treated with metoprolol 3.
NSVT - improving with treatment of hypokalemia (see below) 4. hypokalemia - On transfer to the floor from the ICU, the patient was noted to have a drop in potassium over one day from 3.6 to 2.6.
He had no diarrhea or vomiting.
They felt that the hypokalemia was likely due to urine losses from polyuria due to administration of mannitol and decadron.
5. r/o mult myeloma - SPEP and UPEP were sent for concerns about the quality of the urine.
SPEP was negatve; UPEP showed "MULTIPLE PROTEIN BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN PREDOMINATING", "TWO TRACE BANDS ARE SEEN WHICH STAIN WITH KAPPA BUT DO NOT STAIN WELL WITH FREE KAPPA.
6. pain control - pain was thought to be secondary to multiple hepatic metastases.
MSContin was started on [**2-8**] and may need to be titrated upward for pain control.
He had poor po intake when left to himself; he needs feeding supervision to encourage po intake and has done well with the nurses and aides assisting.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed): apply to left eye at night.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: NE [**Hospital1 **]  [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal hemorrhage Right centrum semiovale lesion Small cell lung cancer Hypokalemia Narrow complex tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Stable; frequently somnolent but arouses and can follow commands and answer questions appropriately.
Left hemiparesis including the face, arm, and leg, with dysarthria but preserved swallow, arm movement from the elbow but not the shoulder or much finger extension, and spontaneous leg movement with some decreased strength.
Call your doctor or go to the emergency room for any worsening weakness or difficulty speaking, or any numbness, decreased alertness, nausea, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms.
