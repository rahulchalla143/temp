She has never had a history of headaches until she developed headaches in [**Month (only) **]; these headaches would occur in various locations of her head, though more recently she describes them as occuring just left of the vertex.
Occasionally, it would be assoicated with photophobia but no son[**Name (NI) **].
Of note, there is a positional nature to these headaches as she says that the headache is usually worse when she wakes up in the morning.
Recently, she has also noted the onset of lightheadedness with positional changes, but no vertigo.
No strength or sensory changes, no visual changes and no weight loss noted since [**Month (only) **].
No history of head trauma aside from recently banging her forehead accidentally on the counter while bartending.
No history of seizures.

A large lesion in the right frontal lobe, measuring 6.8 x 5.2 x 9 cm, seen to extend into the region of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and in proximity to the septum pellucidum.
This can either represent a low-grade neoplasm vs a complex cyst, with the differential diagnosis including subependymoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, the latter two being less likely given the pattern of enhancement and lack of calcifications.
The lesion does appear to have some vascularity, with tiny vessels noted within the lesion.
Expected post-surgical changes, status post right frontal mass removal.
Interval decrease of mass effect when compared to prior study ([**2164-10-11**]).
No hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarction is noted.
No evidence of infarction.
While there is no abnormal enhancement, there is no enhancement of the tumor prior to surgery, so this cannot be used as metric.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after having an MRI of her brain for consistent headaches as an outpatient which showed her to have a right frontal mass which communicated with the right lateral ventricle.
Surgery was without complication.
Post op CT revealed good resection and no hemorrhage.
PCA was discontinued and she was started on PO pain meds with IV for breakthourgh.
She was able to mobilize OOB on this day and walk through the halls without difficulty.
