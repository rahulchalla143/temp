[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was given ativan for headache and anxiety without relief.
CT done revealed a left parietal mass.
Neurosurgery consult requested for evaluation.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2147-10-6**] 4:37 PM IMPRESSION: Left occipital irregularly enhancing mass with chronic blood products and several low-signal areas indicative of areas of necrosis.
The findings are suggestive of an infiltrative primary neoplasm such as glioma.
There is extensive surrounding edema seen with left-sided uncal herniation and distortion of the midbrain resulting in moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2147-10-7**] 12:56 AM IMPRESSION: Left occipital mass demonstrates no evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Increased vascularity is seen predominantly from the left posterior cerebral artery with no large draining veins identified or arteriovenous malformation is seen.
Vascular displacement is seen but no aneurysm is identified.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2147-10-9**] 5:08 PM FINDINGS: There has been interval left parieto-occipital craniotomy, with overlying skin staples and mild pneumocephalus.
Changes of tumor debulking are noted in the left parietal region, with adjacent hyperdense material representing hemorrhage and/or post-surgical changes.
Just inferior to this region, there is evidence of residual hyperdense tumor involving the left occipital lobe, temporal lobe, and splenium.
Persistent surrounding vasogenic edema extends superiorly into the left parietal and posterior frontal lobes, and inferiorly into the left temporal lobe.
Left cerebral sulci are diffusely effaced, and the left lateral ventricle is compressed.
Continued slight widening of the left ambient cistern relative to the right is suggestive of impending uncal herniation.
Coarse calcifications are noted in the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.
Middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Tumor debulking, with stable rightward mass effect and subfalcine herniation.
Areas of enhancement within the left occipital and left temporal lobes are consistent with residual tumor.
Rightward shift of midline structures and left uncal herniation is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 56-year-old left handed man, with no significant past medical history with progressive forgetfulness, confusion, right parietal headache and nausea and voomiting who eventualy developed  right-sided weakness and initiallty presented to the [**University/College **] Hitchcock ED on [**2147-10-6**].
CT head scan there revealed a large left parietal mass with signifcant mass effect.
Given a decrease in conscious level following narcotics for headache, he was MedFlighted to the [**Hospital1 18**].
His cognitive symptoms improved somewhat and MRI revealed a left occipital irregularly enhancing mass with chronic blood products and areas suggestive of necrosis in addition to extensive edema with left uncal herniation and distortion of the midbrain resulting in moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.
He was administered mannitol and dexamethasone and a CTA head showed increased vascularity is mainly from the left PCA.
Neuro-oncology were consulted and he proceeded to a left parietal craniotomy with subtotal tumor debulking and decompression.
Post op CT was stable, without evidence of hemorrhage and postop MRI demostrated subtotal resection of tumor.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 12017**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Occipital Brain Tumor   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
