Admission Date:  [**2121-7-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-12-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, chest discomfort  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 50 year old gentleman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on chemotherapy (axitinib which the patient was told to stop on [**2121-7-15**] given his worsening fatigue), hypertension, Factor V Leiden and PFO.
He presents with fatigue and brief dyspnea and lower chest discomfort on changing from lying->sitting and sitting->standing that is worse over the last 3 days but started about 1-2 weeks ago.
All these symptoms are over the last few days.
Reported dry cough for a few days.
denies dysuria or frequency but reports urinary retention due to prior spine metastases that also had lead to left lower extremity weakness.
He also reports right lower extremity weakness secondary to "spread of tumor".
CXR was notable for worsened right pleural effusion compared to prior [**2121-7-1**] along with partial lung collapse.
Bedside echo was significant for large pericardial effusion that is new compared to echo in [**2119**] but was present in series of CT chests in [**2120**] with progressive slight increase in size in between.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Per cardiology assessment in the ED, the patient does not have pulsus nor kussmaul sign.
Recommended checking pulsus paradoxus every 12 hour with possible pericardiocentesis on [**2121-7-21**].
His [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course was notable for continued tachycardia and borderline hypotension.
IP placed a right pigtail catheter with drainage of 2100cc of serosanguinous fluid.
A small basilar pneumothorax was seen post-procedure though was felt to represent trapped lung.
Cardiology consult team further recommended checking pulsus paradoxus every 12 hour and even though there was no tamponade on echo, pericardiocentesis was performed on [**2121-7-21**] due to the maligant nature and liklihood of future tamponade.
In the CCU he was found to have a small apical left pneumothorax, which has been treated with high flow nasal oxygen.
He was persistently tachycardic and received roughly 5L of NS with improvement in his hemodynamics.
He had a cool right foot with poor pulses concerning for ischemia.
He was broadly covered with vancomycin and cefepime due to a positive urinalysis and persistent tachycardia, but cultures were persistantly negative and his antibiotics were discontinued a few days after to the floor.
He was discharged home with hospice and symptomatic management.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-9-13**], pericardail effusion is new.
CXR [**7-18**]: IMPRESSION:  Significant interval enlargement of the right-sided pleural effusion which is now large.
Lytic skeletal lesion at level of fourth anterolateral right rib is present and has been more fully evaluated on prior CT of [**2121-6-9**] which documented extensive skeletal metastatic disease.
Known pulmonary nodules are also seen to better detail on the CT.
Considering the large size of the effusion and its rapid increase between [**7-1**] and [**2121-7-18**], hemothorax should be considered in the appropriate setting.
Decrease in right pleural effusion following pigtail pleural catheter placement  and development of a moderate hydropneumothorax.
Lytic rib metastases.
There continues to be a lateral and basilar hydropneumothorax with interval decrease in the apical component.
Patchy opacity at the right lung base reflects partial atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobes.
There is likely a small residual right effusion.
Several lytic bone lesions are seen involving the ribs consistent with known metastatic disease.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion subtending the inferior and posterior wall of the left ventricle and the inferior (diaphragmatic) wall of the right ventricle.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
The epicardial surface of the heart appears thickened and heterogeneous in acoustic texture.
This finding, taken together with the small hyperdynamic configuration of the left ventricle despite removal of most of the pericardial fluid, raises a suspicion for the presence of pericardial constriction, possibly as a result of epicardial metastasis of underlying neoplastic disease.
CXR [**7-27**]: IMPRESSION:  1) Moderately large right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
A small amount of streaky pneumomediastinal air is also likely present.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old gentleman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on chemotherapy, hypertension, Factor V Leiden complicated with PE on Lovenox at home.
Presented with worsening SOB and chest discomfort, found to have worsening large right pleural effusion compared to [**2121-7-1**] and worsening large pericardial effusion, concerning for malignant process.
# Dyspnea: multifactorial, most likely secondary to large pleural effusion that is worse compared to prior ([**2121-7-1**]) leading to partial collapse.
Differential for pleural effusion included malignant process vs parapneumonic effusion.
This is most consistent with malignant effusion.
Leukocytosis on admission, but cultures peristantly negative, no improvement on antibiotics (given vancomycin and cefepime).
His large pericardial effusion (see below) worsened in [**2120**] and was not present in [**2119**].
# Pericardial effusion: He had a moderate effusions which may have been contributing to his symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea, however he has had slow progression of symptoms over the last 6 months.
He did not have pulsus paradoxus or kussmaul's sign on exam and TTE did not suggest tamponade.
There were no complications, but he was monitored in the CCU following the procedure.
In the CCU patient continued to have persistent hypotension and tachycardia despite pericardial effusion drainage.
The following day, repeat echo showed no reaccumulation of fluid and he showed no clinical signs of tamponade, so the pericardial drain was pulled.
However in the TTE, the epicardial surface of the heart appeared thickened and heterogeneous which raised suspicion for the presence of pericardial constriction, possibly as a result of epicardial metastasis of underlying neoplastic disease.
He was continued on IVF given his preload dependence and was not symptomatic from his hypotension in the systolic 80s.
# Goals of care: In the CCU and on the floor, patient was seen by palliative care and his outpatient oncologist who had prolonged discussions about patient's and his wife's wishes and goals given his poor prognosis especially with TTE findings of likely metastasis to his heart.
# Renal cell carcinona: s/p right nephrectomy, Sutent, Cyberknife, WB-XRT, was on Axitinib for progression on MRI (stopped [**2121-7-15**] for possible contribution to his progressive fatigue).
While undergoing work up of his pericardial effusion, findings on echocardiogram were suggestive of myocardial/epicardial metastases.
Lovenox was discontinued prior to discharge due to falling platelet counts.
# Urine retention: patient reports requiring tamsulosin for good urine output with history of self catheterization intermittently.
