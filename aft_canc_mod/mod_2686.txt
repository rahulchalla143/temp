A CT scan revealed a large intra-abdominal mass with CT-guided biopsy on [**2127-4-4**] confirming a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
- She was admitted after cycle one with constipation and this has since resolved.
Unfortunately, this was complicated by readmission due to fever and she was noted for positive blood cultures with streptococcus pneumoniae  bacteremia.
CT scan of the chest on [**2127-5-12**] with notable for  ill-defined nodules in the bronchioles and lower lobes as well as bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with possible tricuspid  valve vegetation.
Subsequent TTE on [**2127-5-13**] confirmed a large  1.7 cm long x 0.7 cm wide mobile echogenic mass on the tricuspid  valve.
A [**2127-5-15**] TEE confirmed the mass to be a large globular well-circumscribed right atrial mass adherent to the wall at the base of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.
The pulmonary nodules were possibly related to septic emboli.

Large mesenteric mass on the right, and lying posterior and along the right side of the gravid uterus.
This is new since the FDG-CT imaging examination of [**2127-12-2**], and is consistent with recurrent lymphoma.
A smaller cluster of lymph nodes are seen in the upper left paraaortic region of the abdomen.
Notably, there have been case reports of lymphomatous deposits within the placenta and this is a consideration.
Recurrence of lymphoma with mucosal involvement of the gastric antrum and pylorus, and also loops of small bowel within the right side of the abdomen.
There is a large contiguous soft tissue mass extending from the level of lesser sac into the mesentry with a large mass in the right side of the mesentry, which extends inferiorly to the level of the iliac crests.

Blood products within the endometrial cavity with no evidence of hypervascularity to suggest retained products of conception.
Findings are concerning for post-partum rupture of the vaginal fornix and lateral cervix.
Patent pelvic veins without evidence of thrombosis, as questioned.
Moderate ascites and pelvic free fluid.
Persistent mesenteric masses concerning for lymphoma recurrence, biopsy results pending.
Upper endoscopy ([**6-19**]): Impression:	 Ulcers in the stomach 5 cm ulcerated mass along the lesser curve at the junction of the antrum and body with stigmata of recent blood loss.
No active bleeding.
3 cm ulcerated mass in the fundus along the lesser curve and a mass opposite [**12-25**] cms in diameter.
Severeal shallow ulcerations seen in fundus as well.

# T cell lymphoma- On admission, patient had a significantly elevated LDH, concerning for recurrence of the lymphoma.
CT and MR of the torso revealed a large mesenteric mass and multiple lymphomatous foci throughout the abdomen.
The mesenteric mass was biopsied and was consistent with T cell lymphoma.
EGD revealed multiple ulcerated lesions in the stomach, likley lymphomatous involvement.
# L&D- Patient had no evidence of preterm labor on arrival to labor and delivery.
She received a course of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity (complete on [**6-3**]).
12 hour postpartum, she was restarted on lovenox 40 daily for her history of DVT with septic emboli.
On [**2128-6-13**], she developed a fever up to 102.6 with fundal tenderness, so she was started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin for postpartum endometritis.
# Fevers- Initial concern for endometritis (see above).
MRV was initially suspicious for a fluid collection in the pelvis.
CT chest shows large R-sided pleural effusion post PE.
Repeat CT chest from [**7-8**] shows decreased RML and LLL disease but unchanged RLL effusion and consolidation.
Patient was started on vancomycin and meropenem for HAP and possible pelvic infection.
C. diff toxin (+) on [**7-9**], and PO vancomycin was started and plan to be continued till counts recover...  On discharge, Micafungin was switched to PO voriconazole for fungal coverage.
# PE- On [**6-30**], the patient reported acute onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
The pain radiated to her right back and under her left breast.
The patient has a high risk for PE given her clotting history, but had been off anti-coagulation for approximately 2 weeks given ongoing small GIB (see below).
Given her increased oxygen requirement and tachycardia, the patient was transferred to the ICU.
Heparin drip initiated with a goal of PTT 50-70 to reduce her bleeding risk.
On [**7-1**] this was transitioned to bivalirudin given concern for HIT due to thrombocytopenia.
Ultrasounds of both lower extremities were negative for DVT, so there was no need for an IVC filter.
Her pleuritic pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA, which was transitioned to PO oxycodone.
# Upper GI bleed- On [**6-18**], patient had with a small amount of coffee grounds emesis with stable vital signs and no drop in Hct.
Ulcers thought to be secondary to lymphomatous involvement.
During her first course of ESHAP, patient was kept NPO for concern of perforation during chemotherapy.
Her diet was then slowly advanced without additional episodes of hemetemesis.
# HTN- History of borderline high blood pressure.
During this admission, patient had new SBP 160-180s and was started IV 0.625mg q6h, uptitrated and transitioned to lisinopril 10mg daily.
