2 wk h/o maxillary and frontal sinus pain, last 1 week more midfrontal pain up to [**10-8**].
At that time, PMD noted R facial droop, thought to be Bell's palsy.
Family took her to the ED again today for headaches and vomiting.
Overall generalized weakness and fatigue x2-3 weeks.
At the OSH, CT head showed multiple bilateral parenchymal lesions with significant vasogenic edema (L frontal, L basoganglia, R temporal, R frontoparietal, R occipito-temporal).
No recent travel.
No HIV risk factors.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS:  T  98.1    HR  78  RR 12-18   BP 119/70   Sat 98% on RA General:  Awake and alert, interactive and cooperative, NAD HEENT  AT/NC, mucous membranes moist and pink, no lesions Neck  Supple, no thyromegaly or thyroid lesions, no lymphadenopathy Chest  Clear bilaterally, good aeration CVS  Normal S1 and S2, no m/r/g ABD  Soft, nondistended, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds EXT  no C/C/E, distal pulses full, warm and well perfused, brisk capillary refill, no rashes or petechiae  Neuro MS: alert.
Can do simple addition, had difficulty with simple subtraction.
No apraxia (mimics brushing teeth).
No L/R confusion.
CN:  I--not tested; II,III--PERRLA4-->2, VFF by confrontation, III,IV,VI--EOMI w/o nystagmus, no ptosis; V--sensation intact to LT/PP; VII--mild flattening of R nasolabial fold but activates well with spontaneous and voluntary smile; VIII--hears finger rub bilaterally; IX,X--voice normal, palate elevates symmetrically, gag intact; [**Doctor First Name 81**]--trapezii [**5-3**]; XII--tongue protrudes midline.
Motor: Normal bulk and tone, no tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia.
With arms out mild pronation bilat arms, no clearly assymetric pronator drift.
Gait: Hesitant small steps but able to walk without assistance.
Difficulty with tandem gait.
No bradycardia or hyptertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo F with hypothyroidism, smoker presents with HA and vomiting, multiple intracerebral nodules with surrounding vasogenic edema, 5mm midline shift and early uncal herniation.
Mild MS changes (attention, repetition, naming), flattening R nasolabial fold, 5-/5 R WE and FE, +rhomberg and small hesitant steps.
Most likely metastatic lesions.
DDx includes infection or primary brain malignancy.
Neurologic exam was notable for mental status changes (poor attention, [**Last Name (un) **] indifference, mild word finding and repetition difficulties), assymetry of pupils (R larger than L), papilledema, mild R hemiparesis.
No worsening of neurologic status during admission.
CT torso done to eval for primary malignancy.
Right upper lobe lung mass likely represents primary lung neoplasm such as nonsmall cell or adenocarcinoma, although metastasis is also possible.
Especially as there is a spiculated appearance of brain lesions on CT. Primary care office contact.
They do not have a record of any recent mammograms or pap smears.
[**5-25**] She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring due to her mild uncal herniation.
She had no acute events overnight.
No complications.
CT head with and without contrast done instead, showing multiple complex rim-enhancing masses at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction with associated vasogenic edema, consistent with metastases.
The superficial right temporal lobe lesion appears to transgress the pial compartment, to involve the overlying dura, consistent with leptomeningeal spread of tumor.
Brief MRI in planning for biopsy showed the following: Redemonstration of four parenchymal complex enhancing lesions at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, consistent with metastases.
Right temporal metastasis at the right tentorium demonstrates associated dural thickening and enhancement.
Preliminary pathology is metastatic carcinoma.
Disp:*30 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: A right upper lobe lung lesion - most probably a neoplasm, with intracerebral metastasis   Discharge Condition: Most of the neurological deficits had improved, she remained with a slight right sided ptosis   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
