His presenting symptoms were some mild abdominal discomfort along with a workup of anemia.
Further workup included a colonoscopy which was negative however, endoscopy showed two small masses in the stomach very close to each other which when biopsied showed to have high grade dysplasia with carcinoma insitu.
He had no family history of stomach cancer however, given the high grade dysplasia and carcinoma insitu resection was recommended.

Diabetes Type 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well developed overweight gentleman.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Notable scar on the left nares secondary to prior surgery in [**Country 532**].
Neck:  Supple without masses, nodes or thyromegaly  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation.

An Upper Gastrointestinal study on [**2178-5-16**] and [**2178-5-19**] both showed free flow of contrast into the jejunum from the esophagus without any leak in the anastomosis.
Abdominal CT on [**2178-5-19**] shows ill defined area of fluid stranding and pockets adjacent to the porta hepatis and no discrete drainable collection.
This could be post surgical changes or resolving hematoma.
Superimposed infection cannot be ruled out.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 14975**] presented to the hospital on the day of his surgery [**2178-5-12**] on which day he received a gastroscopy, total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y, and a feeding jejunostomy tube placement  His operative course was unremarkable however, his postoperative course in the recovery area were significant for a desaturation which required placement on CPAP.
High oxygen requirement immediately postop.
He was slowly weaned off this mask as his pain medications were weaned along with some incentive spirometry.
Since then he was weaned to nasal cannula and on discharge sating 95% on room air without any respiratory distress.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14975**] continued to have nightly fevers to about 102 Farenheit at approximately postop day 5.
Upper GI's also showed free flow of contrast from the esophagus into the jejunum.
Because of continued fevers an abdominal CT was also obtained which showed an area of stranding at the porta hepatis which may be considered consistent with postoperative changes however, since infection cannot be ruled out a five day course of intravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl was initiated.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14977**] diabetes was managed by sliding scale insulin however, on discharge he may be restarted on Glucophage and continued on sliding scale insulin.
The site of the tumor is upper one third of the cardia and fundus.
There is no vascular, lymphatic or peroneal invasion.
