She underwent 7+3+3 induction chemotherapy and two cycles of high dose cytarabine consolidation and attained a complete remission.
She was lost to follow-up until she presented in [**8-17**] with pancytopenia and  AML.
She was re-induced with 7+3, received three cycles of high dose cytarabine consolidation, and went into complete remission.
She remained in remission until [**6-19**] when she noted increasing lower extremity bone pain and fatigue and a CBC revealed a decreased white blood count with circulating blasts.
Her post-induction course was complicated by E. coli bacteremia for which she was treated with a 14 day course of levofloxacin.
Following that, she developed some left facial numbness and was treated with Valtrex and clindamycin for possible shingles and tooth infection.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-11**] with a fever of unknown source.

She experienced a fair amount of back pain with the ATG that was improved with pre-medication with methylprednisolone, up to 100 mg.  Several hours following her stem cell transfusion she developed a syndrome of severe body aches (especially in her head, back, and legs), rigors, and tachycardia.
This was thought to be a delayed reaction to the ATG and she felt better after being treated with Solu-Medrol, Benadryl, and Demerol.
A portable chest X-ray was suggestive of fluid overload but was also worrisome for a diffuse infectious process or an ATG effect.
A chest CT scan showed moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, scattered nodules, ground-glass opacities in a predominantly perihilar distribution, increased septal lines and periportal edema.
These findings were thought to be consistent with interstitial/pulmonary edema, potentially secondary to a diffuse infection.
Over the next 2 weeks, patient gained >30 pounds from excess volume.
Eventually, the patient was transferred to the MICU for increasing respiratory distress on [**2200-10-22**].
The patient was electively intubated for airway protection due to worsening encephalopathy and shortness of breath.
Patient was ventilated with assist control ventilation with low tidal volumes ranging from 400-500 and low FIO2 40-50%.
Attempts to transfer to pressure support were unsuccessful due to patient agitation and discomfort therefore AC was maintained throughout her ICU admission.
The differential for respiratory failure remained unchanged and still included fluid overload vs. diffuse infectious process vs. ATG effect.
Patient also with low EF with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] likely contributing to pulmonary edema.
In terms of an infectious process there is concern for fungal infection as the patient was severely immunosuppressed.
Serial CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema with bilateral infiltrates and round opacities suggestive of aspergillus.
Galactomanin was negative, although drawn after initiation of antifungal therapy.
Patient was started on hemodialysis on day 2 of ICU admission for fluid removal and acute renal failure.
Daily HD was performed with removal of up to 5 L of fluid daily with no hemodynamic compromise.
Patient was also maintained on high levels of pain control and sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam since attempts to wean her sedation lead to agitation, tachycardia, and episodes of crying (likely secondary to severe pain).
The decision was made not to switch to Voriconazole for coverage of Aspergillus since this medication is hepatotoxic and has numerous drug-drug interactions.
The decision was also made to hold off on bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis given the patient's coagulopathy and critical condition.
Vancomycin was added on [**2200-10-28**] after blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains.
the decision was made to treat through the lines since the risk of removing all lines and placing new lines was significantly higher given her risk of bleeding and coagulopathy.
Patient also had a bronchoscopy with BAL performed on [**10-30**] which showed friable mucosa, no lesions or active bleeding.
The renal failure was thoought to be secondary to her progressive VOD.
Her creatinine remained elevated but decreased from peak to 1.2.
On [**11-4**], HD was attempted by the patient became hypotensive and therefore it was discontinued.
On [**11-5**], the decision was made to convert to CVVH due to her low blood pressures and in the hope to remove more fluid over an extended period of time.
Venoocclusive disease (VOD) of Liver (Sinusoidal Obstructive Syndrome):  During the week of [**10-12**], patient had an isolated slowly rising LDH.
Liver ultrasounds were done which showed ascites and patent portal and hepatic vein flow.
At this point the patient met clinic criteria for VOD (weight gain, bilirubin>2.0, RUQ pain and hepatomegaly).
Initially the patient received q 6 hourly labs including platelets, hematocrit and INR due to high transfusion requirements.
Platelets were maintained due to the high risk of bleeding with Defibrotide.
On [**10-31**], however, she began to having bleeding from an OG tube that was placed on [**10-30**] and from her ET tube and was transfused to maintained platelets >50.
She was transfused for Hct <30 and required one unit on [**10-31**] due to blood loss from her ET/NG tubes.
After completing the study she had a RUQ ultrasound which showed no change in her liver and patent vasculature.
Then, CT scan performed on [**11-3**] showed infarction of a large portion of her liver on the right side with question of right hepatic vein thrombosis.
Left foot dry gangrene/cellulitis:  Initially, her left foot became dusky involving only the heal which became violacious and dark in color.
Her toes seemed to be primarily involved and eventually became frankly necrotic with dry gangrene.
Her right foot did not show similar changes but did have some superficial skin breakdown on the dorsal aspect.
Most likely cause was the underlying microvascular obstruction from underlying VOD but an embolic source could not be ruled out.
Little treatment could be offered due to her coagulopathy and low platelets.
The tube was placed without trauma, however, given the patient's low platelets and coagulopathy she started to have some bleeding from the OG tube.
OG lavage was positive for moderate blood.
She also developed some blood tinged secretions from her ET tube on [**10-31**].
DIC labs were sent, for which the interpretation was obscured given her underlying liver disease but were not frankly indicative of DIC (see pertinent labs), although fibrinogen remained elevated.
She had intermittent bloody secretions from both her ET and OG tubes over the last few days of her life, on the last day she had dark brown material from her OG tube likely coffee grounds/blood vs. feculent matter.
CHF/Cardiomyopathy: On day 3 of admission she complained of chest tightness and was noted to have a pericardial friction rub on exam.
A TTE showed no pericardial effusion but did reveal moderate tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and global mild to moderate hypokinesis, new from previous echocardiogram.
A cardiology consult was obtained and they felt her chest pain was unlikely to be ischemic in origin or due to pericarditis.
They felt that her decreased EF and valvular regurgitation was most likely due to toxicity from her chemotherapy and did not warrant any acute treatment.
She continued to complain of mild chest tightness for several days but this gradually dissipated.
The patient was chest pain free for the next 3 weeks, although she was tachycardic and hypertensive.
Patient's pain was treated and a beta blocker was started on [**10-21**].
Her blood pressure remained borderline high throughout around 140s/80s.
Repeat ECHO was performed on [**11-4**] once the patient became hypotensive and CT showed infarction of her liver and spleen.
It did not show any masses or thrombi.
Coagulopathy: Stable INR <2, also with thrombocytopenia [**3-19**] to hepatic failure and study drug Defibrotide.
Patient was transfused with FFP approximately 1 unit daily and for plts <30, or <50 with active bleeding.
Hypothermia: Patient with history of low temps in the past down to 92 F. She was treated with warming blankets when she was hypothermic.
She had a long period of time when her temperature was stable, although she became hypothermic again, down to 94F during the last few days.
Gordonia/CMV/Enterococcus infections: Patient initially diagnosed with Nocardia line infection on past admission, incorrectly diagnosed, now thought to be Gordonia.
CMV viral loads were drawn weakly and eventually came back positive with 56,800 --> 78,500 copies/ml, which was previously undetectable.
This was thought to be due to reactivation since the patient was IgG positive on past admission.
In addition, Enterococcus grew from one of her central lines which was Vancomycin sensitive.
Both infectious disease and oncology teams agreed to treat her through the line.
Rash: Patient noted to have erythematous area over her upper chest and shoulders, thought to be cellulitis, line infection or possibly the onset of GVHD.
Patient began to have auditory and visual hallucinations on [**10-8**].
She became agitated at night, showing evidence of delirium exacerbated by her baseline anxiety.
During the next two weeks, the patient became increasingly agitated and confused.
The patient's symptoms were felt to be related to uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, Haldol, benzodiazepines, and decreased clearance of morphine.
CT of the head was performed on [**11-3**] which was negative for any bleed or other intracranial changes.
Patient remained heavily sedated for pain throughout her ICU admission.
Her WBC rose to 19 with rising lactate to 7.8 thought to be due to underlying sepsis from her multiple known infections or possibly due to a new infection.
The differential remained broad but included pneumonia, line infection, intraabdominal infection given positive for enterococcus, CMV, and gordonia.
Eventually the patient also required IVF boluses although this was a last measure given her severe fluid overload.
Liver Infarction/Splenic infarcts: Initially, patient had dramatically elevated LFTs thought to be due to VOD, this improved with treatment with Defibrotide with essentially normalization of her liver function tests but with persistent hyperbilirubinemia.
CT of the abdomen was performed which showed a large area of infarction in the right portion of her liver with multiple splenic infarcts.
An embolic source was considered and Echocardiography was performed which was negative for an embolic source.
Most likely this was due to thrombosis of hepatic vein which was poorly visualized on sono and CT scan but suggestive of thrombosis.
The mechanism for thrombosis was unclear given her severe coagulopathy and low platelets.
Defibrotide was continued during her lasts days of life in an attempt to treat her liver disease.
Abdominal distension: CT of the abdomen was negative for obstruction and showed old contrast from prior studies (almost one month prior) still in the colon.
On [**11-5**] the patient was noted to have a firm, markedly distended abdomen.
Prior exams were positive for edema and distension but her abdomen had always been soft.
The patient had a dramatically rising lactate from 4.0 to 7.8 over the span of a few hours and therefore the diagnosis of bowel perforation or ischemia was considered.
The decision was made with the ICU team and family to continue current treatment but not to provide any further interventions given her worsening status.
Imaging by CT done the day prior did not reveal any obstruction or free air.
Surgery was not an option at that stage given her severe hemodynamic compromise, coagulopathy, multiorgan failure as well as underlying infections and immunosuppression, therefore continue supportive measures were continued while treating underlying infections, maintaining blood pressure support and giving blood products as necessary.
Pain: Patient has a history of neuropathic pain in bilateral legs from prior chemotherapy.
After development of VOD/SOS, the patient was presumed to have significant pain from underlying hepatic capsule distension and morphine PCA was started.
As her mental status declined, this was changed to a basal fentanyl PCA.
In addition, it was presumed that she had pain from necrosis of her left foot.
Attempts at weaning sedation produced agitation and tachycardia with one episode of crying.
She was monitored throughout for signs of pain including agitation and tachycardia.
Protonix was given coagulopathy and later increased to [**Hospital1 **] with active GI bleeding.
OG tube placement was not difficult however patient did develop positive lavage with frank blood and clots the following morning.
Insulin drip for strict glucose control.
