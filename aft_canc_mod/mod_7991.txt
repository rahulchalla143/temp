No evidence of active contrast extravasation.
There is interval improvement of the atelectasis with currently better aerated left upper lung and central position of the mediastinum.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, with no appreciable change in the left perihilar mass.
Right lower lung opacity might reflect area of atelectasis.
Minimal interstitial edema is better seen in the right perihilar area.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
CXR [**4-14**]: As compared to the prior study obtained at 8:42 p.m. on [**4-13**], [**2119**], there is minimal interval change on the current radiograph, but there is definitive interval increase in right pleural effusion and right lower lung opacity that might reflect aspiration or hemorrhage.
There is interval progression of pulmonary edema.
Known left mass and multiple pulmonary nodules are redemonstrated, partially obscured by pulmonary edema and newly appeared bibasal areas of atelectasis and pleural effusion  [**4-16**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-15**], there is some improved level of inspiration with decrease in the bilateral opacifications.
CXR [**4-17**]: In comparison with the study of [**4-16**], there are slightly lower lung volumes, but otherwise little change.
No definite focal area of consolidation or vascular congestion.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Unable to perform a IR embolectomy due to difficult anatomy and no visible blush was seen on angiogram.
Flexible bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed complete obstruction to level of Left main bronchus, but no active bleeding, w/ some blood tinged fluid suctioned throughout the day.
On HD2, patient developed sepsis physiology (see below).
IP performed rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-14**] which showed purulent secretions (though cultures would not grow anything back), LUL that was completely occluded.
She underwent debridment and electrocautery of LUL bronchus, which was opened, no active bleeding, but notable for old clots.
No further bleeding was noted.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure.
obstructive PNA/Volume overload/Hematemesis.
On HD#1 was noted to have fevers, 103F Tmax with decreased UOP and hypotension.
She was started on Vancomycin/Cefepime ([**4-13**]) for post obstructive PNA and Flagyl was added [**4-14**].
was extubated on [**4-15**] with en episode of flash pulmonary edema.

She was started on a prednisone taper for laryngeal edema [**2-23**] intubation.
# Stridor.
Noted grade III subglottic edema during ETT exchange on [**4-14**] w/ IP.
# RCC.
# CKD: S/p nephrectomy.
# Hypertension: pt developed significant hypertension on the floor, likely as a result of prednisone.
She has a history of HTN, and has previously been on HCTZ, but did not tolerate this well so on admission had no HTN therapy.
Pt instructed to get BP cuff and check daily, and educated about signs/symptoms of hypotension.
