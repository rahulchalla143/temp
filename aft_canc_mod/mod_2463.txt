Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cervical laminectomy Halo collar PEG tube placement Tracheostomy IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 67 yo R-handed woman with metastatic endometrial cancer to multiple sites, including the C-spine, who presents with weakness in her R-arm and leg following a fall 3 days prior to presentation.
She presented with metastatic disease in [**Month (only) 216**] and underwent XRT to the C-spine, along with a dexamethasone taper (now finished).
This was associated with excellent pain relief and good neurologic function.
She was seen in oncology clinic several weeks ago and was continued on Megace for control of metastatic disease.
At that time she was stable, ambulatory, and feeling very well without neurologic complaints.
She did not hurt her head or lose consciousness.
However, immediately following the fall she experienced increased neck pain, mainly on the R, and noted increased difficulties in ambulating, with weakness in her right arm and right leg.
She denies any numbness or tingling.
The weakness has not progressed over the last days.
No bladder or bowel symptoms.
She lives in [**Location 583**] with her husband, [**Name (NI) **], who is an electrical engineer and a professor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 39035**] Polytechnical Institute.
Mother died at 74 of complicated pneumonia.

Pertinent Results: [**2112-10-23**]     GLUCOSE-104 UREA N-16 CREAT-0.4 SODIUM-132* POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-97 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-16 [**2112-10-23**]    WBC-5.4 RBC-3.38* HGB-11.0* HCT-30.7* MCV-91 MCH-32.4* MCHC-35.7* RDW-13.6 [**2112-10-23**]   NEUTS-79.1* LYMPHS-12.7* MONOS-5.4 EOS-2.3 BASOS-0.4 [**2112-10-23**]   PLT COUNT-436# [**2112-10-23**]   PT-13.9* PTT-23.0 INR(PT)-1.3  IMAGING;  MRI of the head w/wo gad:[**2112-10-23**] No new lesions are seen.
The left parietal mass is redemonstrated.
While a metastatic neoplastic focus would seem a reasonable consideration, given the widely metastatic disease elsewhere, a resolving hemorrhage could be considered, with infection being less likely.
CT of C-SPINE W/Contrast : [**2112-10-24**] There is loss of vertebral body height at C3 with some retropulsion of bone into the spinal canal.
There is bone destruction in the right side of the posterior elements extending to the midline.
There is a fracture of the spinous process of C3.
There is no significant displacement of the fracture fragments.
BILATERAL LOWER EXRTREMITIES DOPPLER [**2112-10-31**]: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving the pulmonary arterial branches supplying the left lower lobe.
Extensive mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, not significantly changed since the prior examination.
Multiple nodular opacities are again demonstrated within both lungs, with interval increase in the degree of cavitation involving two left lower lobe nodular opacities.
These findings most likely represent pulmonary metastases.
Interval worsening of ill-defined left upper lobe nodular opacity.
Minimal decrease in size of the right pleural effusion with compressive right lower lobe atelectasis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The degree of prevertebral soft tissue thickening has increased.
The prevertebral fluid collection extending anteriorly to the right has increased in size, although less air is present at this surgical site.
An effusion is visible in the right lung apex and associated with atelectasis.
New multilobar consolidations as described in both upper lobes and left lower lobe.
Multiple nodular opacities within both lungs, some cavitary, likely represent metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 39033**] is a 67-year-old woman with recurrent, stage IC, grade 3 endometrial cancer metastatic to multiple sites including the C spine C2-5 and lung, s/p XRT to pelvis and C spine, who presents with right arm and leg weakness following a fall on [**10-20**].
Radiation oncology felt that additional radiation therapy would not be of benefit, and neurosurgery was consulted in view of progressive cord compression precipitated by recent neck trauma.
The risks and potential benefits were explained to the patient and her husband, and she was interested in proceeding with surgery.
She operated on [**2112-10-28**] for posterior C3, partial C2-4 Laminectomies with occiput C1-5-6 plates and screws, Halo, and general surgery placed a tracheostomy at the same day.
On [**2112-10-30**] her oxygen saturation decreased, chest radiograph showed increased left sided opacification and large pleural effusion.
A CTA of the chest revealed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving the pulmonary arterial branches supplying the left lower lobe.
Prior to IVC filter placement, a bilateral lower extremity Doppler study showed no evidence of DVT.
Given her complicated disease course and understandable emotional/physical stress, a psychiatry consult was obtained.
Psychiatry recommended continuing lorazepam for anxiety/sleep, and ongoing support for family.
If a clearer picture of depression emerged, they would consider an antidepressant.
ID reconsulted regarding cellulitis on the posterior wound site started on Vancomycin and meropenem, discontinued ceftriaxone.
Stool sent for C-diff which also came back positive, and she started on Metronidazol for C-diff coverage.
Given the extensive nature of her metastatic disease, her poor performance status, and the low likelihood of obtaining meaningful neurological recovery, the patient and her husband expressed the desire that she be transferred to home with hospice care.
She has a known pulmonary embolism and will continue to be treated with lovenox.
