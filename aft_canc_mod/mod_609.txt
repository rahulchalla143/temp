HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**], end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis since [**2164-5-29**]), renal cell carcinoma with positive metastases, type 2 diabetes, who presented to the Coronary Care Unit after an elective cardiac catheterization for preoperative evaluation for possible future nephrectomy after a Persantine MIBI in [**2164-4-29**] showed moderate partially reversible inferior and apical perfusion defects, mild partially reversible later wall defect, global hypokinesis, with an ejection fraction of 37%.
Never complained of any chest pain, and was doing well until Persantine MIBI in [**2164-4-29**] when preoperative revealed the aforementioned defects.
The patient was preopped for possible future nephrectomy after a CT scan showed possible abdominal metastases.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**8-17**] showing left main coronary artery disease diffusely at 30%, left anterior descending artery of 70% proximally, 50% mid, 80% large diagonal, 90% mid diagonal occlusions, and left circumflex 90% proximal, right coronary artery occluded proximally.
The patient had rotablation into the diagonal, stent to the mid diagonal and original diagonal, stent to the original left anterior descending artery.
The patient had some increased shortness of breath during the procedure.
He states he has some shortness of breath at baseline.
No chest pain.
The patient states shortness of breath is better after dialysis.
The patient also noticed to have intermittent 2:1 heart block after this cardiac catheterization, ectopic atrial fossae, and occasional wide complex response.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**], triple bypass with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery, posterior descending artery and diagonal with pericardiectomy.
End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis since [**2164-5-29**].
Renal cell carcinoma with positive metastases, status post nephrectomy diagnosed in [**2153**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include CT SCAN CONTRAST and MORPHINE.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with coronary artery disease, died at age 82.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
No jugular venous pressure appreciated.
There was a 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border which radiated to the axilla.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had trace edema bilaterally.
No calf tenderness.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with intermittent 2:1 heart block.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 73-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, type 2 diabetes, renal cell carcinoma with metastases, now status post cardiac catheterization, status post intermittent heart block.
in the setting of possible heart failure, and the patient was set to go for stent of his left circumflex on Monday.
The patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction status post catheterization on [**8-17**], with a creatine kinase of 407, and a MB of 76, with an index of 19.
Other impressions at this cardiac catheterization were 2-vessel coronary artery disease and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Renal revealed the patient underwent regular scheduled hemodialysis through a right Quinton catheter throughout his stay without complications.
This was possibly consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Endocrinology revealed the patient had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
As an inpatient the patient had his glyburide held and was started on a insulin sliding-scale.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  No change in code status.
Coronary artery disease, status post stent.
Congestive heart failure.
Iron deficiency anemia.
End-stage renal disease.
