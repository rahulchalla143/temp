RETROPERITONEAL LIMITED US [**2150-4-27**]: There is a large left pleural effusion.
There is no ascites.
IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion without ascites.
TTE [**2150-4-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient, but the gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever into the mild range.
There is a mobile, linear density which is ill-defined but seen in the proximal main pulmonary artery (2 cm x 0.cm) which may represent mass or thrombus (best seen in clips 37, 39, 42) .
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to extensive mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
Possible proximal pulmonary artery mass versus thrombus.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Moderate functional mitral stenosis from extensive mitral annular calcifications.
Small left ventricular cavity with hyperdynamic systolic function and inducible left ventricular outflow tract gradient.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-1-11**], the severity of aortic stenosis has slightly progressed.
Mitral stenosis is now present.
A pulmonary artery density is now seen.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS [**2150-4-28**]: There are no abnormalities identified in the proximal pulmonary artery that could correspond to the finding described in the echocardiogram.
A 19 x 11 mm retrosternal soft tissue mass surrounds the left internal mammary artery (3:41); it is unchanged compared to prior study [**2150-4-18**].
Over ten days the large non hemorrhagic left large pleural effusion and atelectasis of the lingula and left lower lobe have all increased.
No right pleural effusion.
Pericardial effusion is minimal.
Calcifications are identified in the mitral annulus and aortic valve.
Thoracic aorta is normal in size, with atherosclerotic calcifications and mural plaques, some ulcerated.
No worrisome lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
No abnormality in the main pulmonary arteries to explain the finding described in the echocardiogram.
Interval increase in size of the non-hemorrhagic left large pleural effusion.
Interval worsening of atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula.
Interval increase in size of the nodular opacity and surrounding satellite nodules, right upper lobe, either growing mucoid impaction or focal infection.
CXR PA/Lateral [**2150-4-30**]: Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Adjacent left lower lobe opacity probably represents atelectasis, less likely reexpansion pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Stable left pleural effusion and likely associated left basilar atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2150-4-30**]: Compared to [**2150-4-28**] there is interval decrease in left pleural effusion which is currently small to moderate accompanied by atelectasis (at least partially rounded) in the left lower lobe.
The right middle lobe consolidation, 3:30 and the subpleural areas of consolidation in the lingula has slightly increased in the interim, thus might represent areas of atelectasis, although infectious process cannot be excluded as well as malignancy given a short-term dating back only to [**4-18**], [**2149**].
There are no new abnormalities seen within the lungs and the airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally except for most likely mucus impaction in the left lower lobe bronchi.
Extensive calcifications of the aortic valve and coronary arteries are of unknown clinical significance.
The heart is not enlarged and there is no pericardial effusion.
Extensive calcifications of the aorta are noted as well as areas of mural thrombus and potential focal area of small dissection at the level of the aortic arch.
The evaluation of the descending aorta demonstrates an aneurysmatic dilatation of the aorta at the level of the hiatus up to 3 cm.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates partially imaged biliary sludge, a relatively small but again partially imaged right kidney and aortic calcifications and otherwise is unremarkable within the limitation of the non-enhanced study that was not designed for evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.
Significant calcifications of the mitral annulus are present.
There are no bone lesions worrisome for malignancy.
Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
No lymphadenopathy to explain pleural tap findings.
Hypodensity in the pancreatic tail, incompletely evaluated on this non IV contrast scan.
This finding is unlikely to represent lymphoma but could represent a pancreatic tumor.
Pleural effusions and basilar atlectesis, left more than right.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Equivocal thickening of posterior wall of stomach, likely fluid.
These abnormal B-cells comprise approximately 8% of total analyzed events.
T cells comprise 80% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens.
Review of cytospin preparation showed a predominant population of small mature lymphocytes, with fewer scattered larger atypical plasmacytoid cells.
Correlation with clinical and radiologic findings to assess any other mass lesion with possible biopsy may be contributory in further subclassification.
MRI abdomen [**2150-5-10**]:  MRCP: There is a moderate left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis of the lower portion of the right lung, incompletely imaged.
There is nodular thickening of the left postero-medial pleural.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
While the examination is slightly limited by motion and the lack of IV contrast, there is no evidence of a focal pancreatic lesion, particularly in the tail.
There is no pancreatic ductal dilation.
There is no hydronephrosis of the kidneys.
There are cystic lesions which are hyperintense on T2-weighted images at the lower pole of the left kidney, likely representing cysts.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen in the abdomen.
Small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.
Slightly limited exam, but no evidence of a focal pancreatic lesion.
The finding on CT may have been related to fat infiltration in the pancreatic tail parenchyma and/or volume averaging.
Thickening of the gastric fundus.
Moderate left pleural effusion, with nodular thickening of the left pleura posteromedially.
CXR [**2150-5-11**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2150-5-4**], there has been some further increase in pleural fluid in the left hemithorax.
This may be associated with mild shift of the mediastinum to the right.
Pleural fluid cytology: Pleural fluid:    SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Some   cells display nuclear irregularities and some appear   binucleate.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old lady who presented with increasing shortness of breath and an enlarging left pleural effusion.
# Dyspnea/Hypoxemia: Multifactorial in a patient with new malignant effusion (lymphoma) and episodes of acute diastilic heart faliure with flash pulmonary edema.
Patient underwent thoracentesis and removal of approximately 1400 ml of serous appearing fluid, final cytology with malignant cells, likely lymphoma.
Studies were consistent with exudate and flow cytometry was consistent with a B cell lymphoproliferative process.
Her CT was concerning for right upper lobe nodules, but these nodules were felt to be mucoid impaction.
Patient remained afebrile and without elevated white count throughout her stay her.
She has outpatient pulmonary follow up as scheduled to assess for reaccumulation of pleural effusion.
# Lymphoma:  Flow cytometry on the pts initial pleural fluid specimen was consistent with a B cell lymphoma.
It was felt the pt had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, or primary effusion lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**2150-5-11**], however there was only aspirate and no definite tissue for pathology from that specimen.
Also explained that given pts chronic kidney failure, history of TIAs, atrial fibrillation, O2 requirement, advanced age, moderate aortic stenosis, and PVD (so likely CAD), pt is at high risk for a procedure.
# Diastolic heart failure and valvular disease:  Patient had evidence of diastolic heart failure with poor forward flow.
TTE revealed diastolic CHF with inducible LV outflow gradient.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been anti-coagulated on coumadin.
On [**5-13**] she developed severe hypoxia and was also noted to be in rapid ventricular response.
Notably, patient also developed sinus pauses of up to 12-13 seconds with witnessed syncope.
This episode likely reflected tachy-brady syndrome.
# Tachy-Brady Syndrome: As noted above, patient developed significant sinus pauses requiring pacemaker placement.
# Acute on Chronic kidney failure: Initial creatinine was elevated at 2.3, with baseline of 1.7-1.9.
This was felt to be due to a component of poor foward flow/CHF.
# Pancreatic tail hypodensity:  Noted on CT abdomen.
MRI abdomen showed no pancreatic tail mass, so likely it was artifact noted on CT scan.
# Hypercalcemia: Pts calcium was elevated at 11-12.
# Chronic aortic dissection: Noted on CT of the lungs with 'extensive calcifications of the aorta noted as well as areas of mural thrombus and potential focal area of small dissection at the level of the aortic arch'.
Discussed with [**Month/Year (2) 1106**], and this is NOT an acute aortic dissection, but rather just a chronic finding from choleterol plaques.
# ?Clot vs tumor on TTE: TTE commented on possible tumor vs. PE in the pulmonary artery.
CTA was performed and showed no pulmonary artery abnormality.
She was continued on Neurontin for neuropathic pain.
She was discharged to the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU for IV heparin and pulmonary rehab.
