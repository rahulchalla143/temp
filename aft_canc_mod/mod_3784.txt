Vomiting and wretching continued intermittently and he became increasingly SOB and thus, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
He denies hematemesis.
He endorses chest pain [**7-4**] intermittently which is unchanged compared to baseline pain for which he is on fentanyl patch and dilaudid.
He has had ongoing intermittent dry cough over the past several weeks which has has remained stable and has not become markedly worse over the past 2-3days; he denies sputum production.
His SOB has progressed such that he was feeling winded with any exertion and was noting increasing SOB even at rest.
No abdominal pain nor diarrhea.
He was complaining of chest pain (although appears c/w his baseline pain thought [**12-28**] to his esophag.
ca) and EKG revealed minimal ST depressions in lateral leads; CK negative and troponin 0.02.
A CTA chest was performed which showed no e/o PE, but did reveal what appears to be esophageal microperforation.
It also demonstrated worsening right sided pleural effusion.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended broad spectrum antibiotics and chest tube for drainage of right pleural effusion.
No abd pain.
Decreased urination over the past 24 hours.
No HA/lightheadedness/changes in vision.
No LE edema.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of esophagus.
Five cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU completed [**9-/2102**], some with concurrent radiation therapy, followed by consolidation chemotherapy alone and also CyberKnife radiation therapy to left pelvic metastasis in [**10-29**].
Course c/b RUE DVT related to his line.
In [**7-/2103**], Mr. [**Known lastname 13144**] began to experience difficulty swallowing, evaluation revealed local recurrence.
He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who removed as much of the mass as possible.
Changed to Taxotere [**1-2**] due to insufficient palliative response in esophagus despite apparent systemic control; currently s/p Cycle 1 Week 3 of Taxotere.

No evidence for acute pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Residual chronic pulmonary emboli.
While these foci may be retained within the mass given the lack of gas in the superior mediastinum, possibility of a small microperforation is not excluded, especially given the increase in size of adjacent moderate pleural effusion.
EKG:  Sinus tachy to rate 107, nml axis, TWI III and aVF (unchanged from old), TW flattening in II (old shows TWI in II), <1mm ST depression V4-V5.
[**2104-7-5**] pleural fluid analysis: 3+PMNs, no microorg, cytology negative for malignant cells .
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  53yoM with h/o esophageal ca s/p esophageal stents p/w 2-3days of N/V, fever, and worsening SOB found to have ?esophageal microperforation on CT chest and increasing size of right pleural effusion admitted to ICU for further management.
# Pleural effusion: Pt was admitted with shortness of breath.
He was found to have a large R sided pleural effusion.
Analysis was negative for microorganisms, with cytology negative for malignant cells.
# Tachycardia: The patient was tachycardic in to the 170s in the intensive care unit, then in the 100-115 range throughout hospitalization.
He has a history of afib in the setting of pericardial effusion and pericardial window.
# Fever:  Questionable etiology of initial fever, perhaps aspiration PNA given history of vomiting and potential RLL infiltrate on CXR.
# Esophageal cancer: CT scan performed on [**2104-6-26**] that showed interval increase in the right-sided pleural effusion, stable pericardial effusion and no significant change in the esophageal wall thickening and mass nor in the intraabdominal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
[**7-5**] barium swallow shows widely patent esophagus with adequate stent placement.
There was initial concern for microperforation of the esophagus on CT scan, however, barium swallow showed widely patent esophagus in proper place with no evidence of communication of the esophagus with the air.
has baseline pain in the setting of his esophageal ca for which he is on fentanyl patch and dilaudid.
EKG was obtained in the ED which was largely unchanged from prior, but ED sent cardiac enzymes out of concern for possible very mild lateral lead ST depressions (<1mm V4-V5 on review of EKG).
Suspiscion very low for ACS and CTA negative for new PE to suggest as cause of pain.
His dose of Fentanyl patch with increased during hospitalization and he tolerated Dilaudid po for breakthrough pain upon discharge.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Tessalon Perles 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every eight (8) hours as needed for cough for 2 weeks.

Esophageal cancer 3.)
Atrial tachycardia   Discharge Condition: afebrile, displaying stable vital signs, tolerating po   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of a fever and difficulty breathing.
If you have difficulty breathing, trouble swallowing, worsening pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or fever, or if your condition worsens in any way, seek immediate medical attention.
