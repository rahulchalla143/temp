Liver, "segment 3", biopsies (AC-AD): A.  Biopsy designated as right shows focal bile ductular proliferation, cholestasis, and associated mixed inflammation; no carcinoma seen.
B.  Biopsy designated as left shows more pronounced neutrophilic aggregation among multiple foci of bile ductular proliferation consistent with bile duct hamartoma; no carcinoma seen.

EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with newly diagnosed with pancreatic mass was admitted to the Surgical  Oncology Service for evaluation and treatment.
On [**2154-9-17**], the patient underwent pylorus-sparing radical pancreatoduodenectomy, cholecystectomy, placement of gold fiducials and transgastric feeding jejunostomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Neuro: The patient received Bupivacaine/Dilaudid via epidural catheter, with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV: Brief episode of hypotension immediately post op, which required placement in ICU for pressors support.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Several staples were removed and patient's wound was packed with moist-to-dry dressing.
