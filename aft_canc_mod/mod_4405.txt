He was transferred to our ICU after he developed expressive aphasia and a small IPH was found at the OSH on the day they had planned to discharge him to home ([**8-17**]).
led to formal recognition of an expressive aphasia, facial weakness and mild hand clumsiness.
A stroke-protocol NCHCT revealed a small (?1x2cm) IPH with overlying small SDH per OSH notes.
Neurosurgery was consulted and by report recommended transfer to a tertiary care hospital (here) for Neurologic care.
He was made NPO due to swallowing difficulty.
There was a faint RUL opacity on CXR, which resolved by repeat imaging on abx [**8-12**].
He had multiple venous clots identified on U/S, including bilateral LE-DVTs and a small clot in the Left AC, and "edematous walls to several smaller veins and arteries" noted.
Before transfer, his Lovenox was held and he was given FFP x3U and protamine IV as well as a platelet transfusion due to mild thrombocytopenia to the 70s-80s.
He arrived in NAD, with no apparent ICU needs; exam below.
Myelodysplastic syndrome per 2x BMBx, "mild" with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
History of gadolinium IV infiltration in fall of [**2189**]; patient and family think his soft tissue swelling and "migratory thrombophelbitis" has 5.
History of legionella PNA in [**2-/2190**] 6.
History of BPH (straight caths self) on flomax, c/b UTIs 8.
No scleral icterus.
Neck: Supple, with full range of motion and no nuchal rigidity.
No masses or organomegaly were appreciated.
Extremities: Warm and well-perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Language is fluent (borderline, but technically fluent; despite increased response latency and mostly short sentences that trail off, he sometimes strings together sentences of as many as [**8-17**] words that are sensible).
No difficulty with audio or [**Location (un) 1131**] comprehension (subjectively or objectively).
Follows commands without difficulty.
No apraxia or neglect or ideomotor apraxia; the patient was able to reproduce and recognize brushing teeth and saluting with either hand.
VII: Right facial weakness not evident at rest (although patient drools intermittently, but becomes prominent with voluntary smile.
Minimal weakness to cheek-puffing.
No tremor or asterixis.
Normal muscle bulk and tone, no flaccidity, hypertonicity, or spasticity noted.

Heel-knee-shin testing with no gross dysmetria.
No dysdiadochokinesia noted on rapid-alternating hand movements.
Tandem gait with moderate sway, but no fall.
Pertinent Results: NCHCT [**2190-8-17**] ~1000 Left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent subdural hematoma.
There is regional sulcal effacement without mass effect on the lateral ventricles, or shift of the midline structures.
NCHCT [**2190-8-17**] ~ 1700 Slight interval enlargement of the left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage which now measures 2.6cm x 2.9cm.
Slight interval enlargement of subdural hematoma along the anterior left frontal lobe which measures 4.3mm (previously 2.7mm).
No intracranial vascular malformation identified.
NCHCT [**2190-8-18**] 1700 Decrease in size of organizing intraparenchymal hematoma with stable small overlying subdural hematoma.
No new focus of hemorrhage.
No further mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67 yo RHM h/o MDS, unspecified small-medium mixed arterial/venous vasculitis with migratory thrombophlebitis who suddenly developed garbled and slurred speech, right facial weakness and right hand clumsiness on [**2190-8-17**].
The patient had been hospitalized for investigation of a fever of unknown origin in the setting of his vasculitis on chronic prednisone therapy and his MDS with interval finding of a BAL suspicious for but not confirmatory of Pneumocystic jirovecii infection (for which he was switched from Atovaquone daily to [**Hospital1 **] dosage) and a left gastrocnemius vein DVT, left deep brachial DVT, and left median cubital superficial thrombophlebitis for which he was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
His initial NCHCT showed a small inferior left frontal IPH with small associated SDH that on repeat imaging that evening appeared to have an interval progression in size (1x2cm to 2x3cm) without any change in neurologic exam.
On arrival, his examination had improved such that he had quite limited weakness on the right, but moderate-severe dysarthria with nonfluent aphasia.
While in the ICU, he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
A repeat NCHCT showed a slight decrease in the size of his IPH and given his overall clinical stability, he was transferred to the neurology floor.
He was seen by the hematology team regarding the issue of his thrombophlebitis and lower extremity clots.
We performed our own lower extremity ultrasounds which revealed only a chronic right popliteal vein thrombus and a superficial venous thrombus on the left.
On discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 87576**] neurological examination was positive for mild-moderate dysarthria that is comprehensible for the most part.
He displayed a mild right sided facial droop.
Benadryl 25mg qhs PRN for insomnia  Discharge Medications: 1. atovaquone 750 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO once a day.
4. clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for insomnia, anxiety.
Sequential Compression Device Please provide bilateral sequential compression devices   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Subdural hemorrhage  Discharge Condition: Discharge Condition: Stable Mental Status: Awake, alert and oriented.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Neurology ICU and Neurology Wards for a new brain hemorrhage that caused symptoms of difficulty producing clear and fluent speech.
Your speech and language has subsequently improved/ - For this bleed, we recommend that you receive a conventional brain angiogram to look for structural causes of your bleeding such as abnormal blood vessel/vascular malformations/vasculitis.
- For your symptoms related to systemic inflammation, please take prednisone at 40mg daily (starting tomorrow, [**2190-8-21**]) and taper your dose down to 20mg daily over the course of [**3-12**] days.
- We checked ultrasounds of your legs and found a chronic clot in a large vein of your right leg (right popliteal vein).
