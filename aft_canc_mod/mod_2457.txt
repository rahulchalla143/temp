Admission Date:  [**2154-11-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-11-28**]   Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year-old female with a past medical history of colon cancer status post right colectomy who underwent CT guided biopsy of a liver lesion, which was subsequently confirmed to be a metastatic colon CA at an outside hospital.
CT scan at that time revealed free intraperitoneal blood in both pericolic gutters.
The patient was emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department and she arrived awake, alert and in no acute distress.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient was alert and in no acute distress.
Abdomen was soft, mildly distended, positive right upper quadrant tenderness and positive bowel sounds.
No guarding or rebound were noted.
The patient was also started on Unasyn for empiric coverage.
Repeat CT on that day revealed large amounts of intraabdominal free fluid and a subcapsular liver hematoma.
Findings were consistent with the patient's known history of hemoperitoneum status post liver biopsy and appeared stable compared to the outside CT three days prior.
There is no evidence of active extravasation at the time of examination.
Incidentally the patient had multiple low attenuation lesions within the right lobe of the liver.
Pathology from the outside hospital revealed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with primary disease.
Subsequent chest x-ray revealed proper placement of the line.
In addition on hospital day number four [**2154-11-25**] the patient received a CT of the chest to examine possibilities of metastatic pulmonary disease, which revealed no evidence of pulmonary metastases, but extensive respiratory motion as well as a basilar atelectatic change, small pleural effusions, limited the assessment for a very small lesions.
Also of note there was increased number of lymph nodes in the mediastinum and in particular lymph node on the left upper paratracheal lesion just below the left lobe of the thyroid gland, which was slightly enlarged by CT criteria.
Also of note was persistent subcapsular hematoma, hemoperitoneum and a heterogenous hemorrhagic liver lesions previously noted.
This change was most likely due to blood transfusion reactions.
Subcapsular hematoma of the liver status post liver biopsy.
Colon cancer metastatic to the liver.
Organic brain syndrome not otherwise specified.
