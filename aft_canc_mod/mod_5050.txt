Patient is deaf and some communication barriers at baseline due to difficulty with traditional ASL.
Per best interpretation, he has had at least 2 weeks of diarrhea with dark/black stools.
He saw his primary NP and was found to have BRB on rectal exam.
Past Medical History: - Atrial fibrillation - Hypertension - Deaf/mute - Gallstone pancreatitis - Cholecystitis s/p cholecystectomy in [**2109**] - Frequent falls   Social History: Lives in senior citizen housing nearby in [**Location (un) **].
No tobacco or ETOH.
Family History: Not elicited  Physical Exam: Exam at Admission:  General: Alert elderly male, no distress, nontoxic appearing.
No adenopathy.
Abdomen: soft, ND, no HSM or mass, very mild TTP in LLQ near iliac crest.
Extrem: Slightly cool, bilateral venous stasis changes with 2+ edema to mid thigh.+ scrotal edema.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
EGD [**10-5**] No fresh or old blood was found.
Colonoscopy [**10-10**]: Diverticulosis of the whole colon Polyps in the distal transverse colon and rectum (polypectomy) Polyp in the proximal ascending colon Ulceration, erythema and granularity in the proximal ascending colon compatible with indetermined colitis (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: 83yo deaf male with atrial fibrillation presenting with lower GIB in the setting of supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin, admitted to the ICU s/p 3 units of PRBCs with normal [**Hospital 63664**] transferred to floor with colonoscopy significant for diverticulosis, two colonic polyps, and non-specific colitis of proximal colon.
In the ED the patient received 2 units of PRBC's and 2 units of FFP for concern of GI bleed and anti-coagulation was reversed with vitamin K for supratherapeutic INR of 3.9.
Colonoscopy was performed after patient was transferred to the floor, and showed extensive diverticulosis (no source of bleed), two small polyps, one in ascending colon and one in transverse colon (which were excised and specimen sent to pathology), localized inflammation in the proximal ascending colon, most suspicious for the source of pt's GIB (biopsy was sent to r/o lymphoma).
Pt had no further episodes of BRBPR and Hct was stable on the floor.
# Anemia: patient initially presented with 5 pt drop in hematocrit over 1 week in setting of GIB.
GI recommended holding iron supplementation due to concern for false guiac positivity, but this should be re-addressed as an outpatient.
# SOB: Pt reported SOB over several days up to admission.
Likely contributing factors include anemia (prior to admission).
On admission pt recieved blood and then became fluid overloaded requiring lasix.
Repeat CXR showed worsening RLL airspace disease concerning for aspiration although time course of event remained unclear.
# Atrial Fibrillation: initially patient's anticoagulation and rate control medications were held in setting of GIB.
Coumadin was discontinued as pt's CHADS2 score is 2 and given history of repeat GIB, and pt was started in Aspirin 325mg daily prior to discharge.
# Anasarca: patient initially presented with bilateral lower extremity edema with visible JVP.
CXR was also notable for pulmonary edema.
Patient with left parasternal systolic murmur on exam.
# Heart Murmur: left parasternal systolic murmur evaluated with TTE which showed normal LVEF > 55 % and mild 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 63665**]s were trended and unremarkable.
