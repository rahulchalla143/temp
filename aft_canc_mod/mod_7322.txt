There are no strictures, masses, or polyps.
A moderate amount of fluid is seen throughout the colon; however, this displaces with repositioning and does not interfere with interpretation.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**4-24**]: The liver is without focal lesions.
There is a low-density lesion in the left kidney, which on prior CT examination has been demonstrated to represent a cyst.

Aside from this, no worrisome nodules are seen within either lung.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
A left renal hypodensity is noted arising exophytically in the interpolar region measuring 2.6 x 4.5 cm, most likely a simple cyst and grossly stable from prior exam.
The stomach and duodenum appear unremarkable.
Again, there is no sign of aortoenteric fistula.
No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or hematoma is seen.
No abdominal free air or free fluid.
PELVIS: Loops of small bowel demonstrate no evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Colonic diverticulosis is noted without evidence of diverticulitis.
No adnexal masses are seen.
BONES: Left posterior rib cage deformity is again noted.
Bilateral sacroiliac sclerosis and vacuum disc phenomena likely reflect sacroiliitis, chronicity unclear.
Massive fusiform aneurysm of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, up to 7 cm in diameter, increased from prior CT scan without signs of rupture or aortoenteric fistula.
Complex septation and lobulation of this fusiform aneurysm is again noted with gross stability.
Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule which bears monitoring on followup imaging.
There is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern seen with non-distended air-filled loops of large and small bowel.
There is no evidence of any intra-abdominal free air.
There is no evidence to suggest small bowel obstruction or ileus.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence to suggest obstruction or ileus.
No mucosal lesions could be identified.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the whole colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
No mucosal lesions could be identified.
CTA [**2122-5-2**]: LUNG BASES: There is bibasilar atelectasis without pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is a left extrarenal pelvis incidentally noted.
The aorta is markedly irregularly aneurysmal with chronic dissection.
There is no sign of aortic rupture.
The celiac axis is tightly stenotic and appears to fill by retrograde direction.
The right femoral artery also demonstrates an irregular aneurysmal dilation of the common femoral, with occlusion of the superficial femoral artery, which is not fully evaluated but appears unchanged.
There is no contrast filling small bowel to suggest acute GI bleed.
There is no pelvic side wall pathologic lymphadenopathy.
The colon is largely collapsed and demonstrates diverticula, but no evidence of diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There is multilevel degenerative change without concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions.
No CT evidence of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Redemonstration of markedly irregular thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm with probable retrograde filling of the celiac axis.
Multiple [**Month/Day/Year **]-containing abdominal hernias.
The luminal blood then moved in a serpentine pattern across the abdomen toward the left lower quadrant.
Imaging for up to 90 minutes showed no other bleeding activity.
IMPRESSION: Intermittent bleeding in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, in the distal jejunum or proximal ileum .
Stomach: Mucosa: Patchy erythema and congestion of the mucosa were noted in the antrum and stomach body.
jejunum:  Flat Lesions A single small angioectasia that was not bleeding was seen in the mid jejunum.
No evidence of fresh blood noted .
No evidence of fresh blood noted Angioectasia in the mid jejunum (thermal therapy) Erythema and congestion in the antrum and stomach body compatible with gastritis Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to distal jejunum .
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: Ms [**Known lastname 50388**] is an 85yo female with GERD, PUD, and a 7.3cm thoracoabdominal aneurysm with a GI bleed of obscure etiology despite extensive workup.
#GI bleed: Initially admitted to the ICU given hypotension in the ED.
She continued to have melanotic, guiac positive stools, with subsequent hematochezia.
On [**4-16**] (in the ICU) she had an EGD notable for small non-bleeding angioectasia, which was cauterized, and gastritis.
On [**4-17**], colonscopy was performed which was notable for sessile polyps and sigmoid diverticulosis, however it was felt to be a difficult study most consistent with a proximal source of bleeding.
Additionally, she had a virtual CT colonscopy which showed no abnormality.
However, due to slow transit time (through esophagus and stomach), the capsule was retained in the upper GI tract for an extended period, resulting in a nondiagnostic study.
The capsule subsequently lodged in the terminal ileum and remained there for several days, but eventually passed as evidenced on serial KUBs.
Given her persistent GI bleeding, decison was made to re-prep for colonoscopy on [**5-1**] which showed no colonic lesions, but consistent pooling of blood in the cecum from likely small bowel bleed.
CTA was obtained on [**5-2**] but showed no source for the bleed, and no sign of aortoenteric fistula.
Of note, hematochezia had resolved on discharge.
Per the IR team, this also preculdes her from embolization procedure for her GI bleed .
# Gout: Continued Allopurinol .
# Back pain/shoulder pain: Back pain likely her chonic OA.
Shoulder pain seems to localize to muscle spasm on medial side of scapula.
# Mild ARF: Cr 1.2 on admission.
Clinical picture fit with Pre-renal, and resolved with transfusions.
Her diuresis was held for majority of admission but restarted on [**4-29**] in the setting of LE edema (home dose of 40mg daily).
However this was discontinued on the day of discharge given tachycardia and likely volume depleted state.
# CAD:  Held Imdur and lisinopril in setting of hypovolemia.
