Admission Date:  [**2138-6-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-6-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-8-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15237**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint: Leaky J-Tube .
Reason for MICU transfer: Ventilator Management   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 78y/o M with history of bronchoalveolar carcinoma s/p rt upper lobectomy in [**2-/2138**], aspiration pneumonia c/b L sided empyema s/p thoracentesis and chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy transferred from OSH for J tube evaluation.
In [**2-/2138**], patient was diagnosed with bronchoalveolar carcinoma and underwent a lobar resection.
Pt also has h/o partial gastrectomy and Bilroth II procedure and thus J tube was considered over G-tube.
Per OSH surgeons, cause of leak was [**12-25**] poor wound healing from malnutrition.
Recent health has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia which led to chronic respiratory failure requiring trach, which was completed 3 days ago.
This PNA was also complicated by MRSA empyema which was drained by pigtail catheter placed over past weekend.
Pigtail catheter fell out yesterday however repeat CT showed interval improvement of pleural effusion.
Patient was started on imipenem empirically for aspiration pneumonia was due to finish treatment on [**6-14**].
On MICU, Patient was in no acute distress and had no complaints.

MODERATE GROWTH.
There is no supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Scattered nonenlarged nodes are seen.
The heart and pericardium are unremarkable with physiologic pleural fluid.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary vessels and aortic arch are noted.
Aortic and mitral valvular calcifications are also noted.
Dense consolidative process is seen involving the basal portion of the right upper lobe as well as the entire right lower lobe in a similar fashion as on the prior with slight improved aeration in the right middle lobe.
Patient is status post what appears to be partial right upper and right lower lobectomies.
Aspirated secretions are seen in bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchus as well as in the left main stem bronchus concerning for continued aspiration with a bolus of secretion seen immediately superior to the tracheostomy tube (601B:21).
Scattered ground-glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification is seen in the remaining lobes concerning for milder aspiration related changes versus infectious or inflammatory process.
Small left pleural effusion is seen and improved from the prior study with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
Though the indication describes a left-sided empyema what appears to be a loculated air-fluid collection in the prior study in the right pleural space is improved on the current examination resembling a partially loculated right pleural effusion which is small and simple in appearance.
Paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema is noted.
Though this study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, limited upper abdominal evaluation demonstrates numerous surgical clips compatible with history of gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction.
Multiple left-sided rib fractures are seen along with diffuse osteopenia.
Aspiration with secretions within bronchus intermedius, right lower lobe bronchus and left main stem bronchus along with dense opacification in the right lower lobe and basal right upper lobe.
Ground-glass/tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the left upper, right upper and right middle lobes could be additional foci of aspiration versus infectious or inflammatory process.
Given the history of bronchoalveolar carcinoma, these pulmonary opacifications should be followed up for resolution.
Though the indication describes left-sided empyema, it appears the prior empyema was on the right according to the outside hospital CT and this collection appears to have improved now reflecting a smaller loculated effusion, though determination of empyema is limited by non-contrast technique.
Decrease in size of small left effusion with improved left lower lobe aeration.
Consolidation is observed in the superior segment of the right lower lobe with air bronchogram which is highly suspicious for aspiration pneumonia.
Loculated right pleural fluid is observed with enhancement of both the visceral and parietal pleura most probably represent empyema.
Moderate amount of left pleural fluid with secondary atelectasis.
ABDOMEN: Many artifacts due to retained contrast media from previous fluoroscopic examination and from many surgical clips.
No intra- or extra-biliary dilatation is noted.
Tubular air filled structures that branch are seen on series 2, image 75, free air cannot be ruled out definitely.
Free fluid that is of slightly high density is observed in the abdomen and in the pelvis.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is observed.
Fractures of right ribs 11 and 10 with no calus formation.
Consolidation of the superior segment of the right lower lobe with air bronchogram consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Air-filled tubular structure within the right lower quadrant, cannot rule out free air we recommend further clinical follow up or an interval CT examination with oral contrast ( through J tube ).
Echo ([**6-17**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
No thrombus identified.
There is a PICC line in situ within the right subclavian and right basilic veins.
No thrombus identified in relation to the intravenous line.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o M with h/o malnutrition requiring J-tube with recent respiratory failure from aspiration PNA c/b MRSA empyema now s/p tracheostomy transferred with J-tube evaluation found to have profound malnutrition who clinically deteriorated during MICU stay and after multiple family meetings was ultimately made CMO.
MICU admission was warranted as patient was recently trached for respiratory failure.
Family requested an autopsy given possibility of surgical trauma at outside hospital - the case was submitted to the medical examiner because the suspicion of trauma was raised.
