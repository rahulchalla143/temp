HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old female with a past medical history significant for end stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on four liters of home O2 with O2 saturations in the low 90s, multiple intubations in the past, on chronic steroids, who is admitted for dyspnea.
The patient was recently seen at the [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2137-11-16**] for dyspnea and cough.
The patient was discharged to Pulmonary Rehabilitation and then was only at home for two days and experienced dyspnea and was readmitted on [**2138-1-22**], this admission.
The patient states that she has worsening dyspnea on exertion.
She has a cough which has been productive of white sputum for approximately one month.
She denies any nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain; she has stable two pillow orthopnea.

Her chem-7 was notable for an elevated glucose of 184.
She did have a chest x-ray done which showed an interval enlargement in right pulmonary nodule.
She had an EKG done which showed wandering pacemaker with a rate of 90; no ischemic changes.
Considering her history of end stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and multiple intubations, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
A repeat chest x-ray was done which showed enlarging mass of the lateral segment of the right middle lobe with near total collapse of the right lower lobe.
This is highly concerning for a neoplastic process.
The patient did have a PET scan in [**2136**] for work-up of this mass which was negative for cancer, however, this interval enlargement is suspicious for a neoplastic process.
Cytology specimens were taken, however, were not catalogued and analyzed, thus no cytology specimens are available.
The patient did have cultures sent on bronchial washings which were negative for infection.
All micro data is no growth.
On the floor, a repeat discussion was had with the patient in regards to her prognosis and her presumed diagnosis of cancer; again she declined any diagnostic procedures or further work-up.
