History of Present Illness: 46 year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to brain).
Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea or change in bowel habits.
No urinary symptoms.
No urinary/bowel incontinence (had 1 episode of stool incontinence a few days prior with a loose bm, has not recurred).
She recently completed course of antibiotics (levo/clinda, finished the day prior to admission) for aspiration pneumonia from her previous admission.
She states she had undesirable fatigue and myopathy from the steroids and would not want to take these again.
In the ED, she was tachycardic and found to be orthostatic by VS. She was given 2 L IVF (D5NS).
CT head showed mets but no new mets, no increased edema, and no mass effect.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Recently diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain.
She was found to have a mass on CXR during a workup for worsening hoarse voice in [**8-4**].
She then had a CT scan at an OSH which revealed a R lower lobe infrahilar mass.
She then had a PET scan which showed this mass was FDG-avid, as were multiple bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes.
She had an MRI as part of her metastatic workup which revealed multiple brain metastases, the largest of which was 1.5cm.
Unfortunately, on [**2165-9-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname 8957**] had loss of consciousness and what sounds like a seizure at work.
There was no shaking movements, no tongue biting, no urinary or bowel incontinence.
She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] hospital where a CT scan revealed edema in the area of the L temporo-parietal region, which was the area of the largest brain met seen on previous MRI.
While in the ER, she was given 10mg decadron and anzemet for nausea, but she had another seizure witnessed by her husband.
She was loaded with fosphenytoin and had a repeat CT scan which showed no additional change.
Once discontinuing the wellbutrin, she felt like she developed the HA and perioral numbness and tingling.

CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-11-20**] IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the size and distribution of multiple intracranial metastases.
No hemorrhage or midline shift.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There has been a mild increase in edema surrounding the left parietal and right thalamic regions.
Right middle lobe collapse.
Rapid worsening of right middle and right lower lobe consolidations with new right pleural effusion.
New left retrocardiac consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 year-old female with history of metastatic NSCLC presenting with nausea and vomiting status post chemotherapy.
There was high concern for a central process.
CT of the head showed mild increase of edema.
Gastroenteritis was felt to be a distant possibility.
Oral levofloxacin/clindamycin caused worsening symptoms and the patient was given antibiotics intravenously for a brief course.
Compazine, ativan, phenergen, and zyprexa were given as needed for nausea.
The patient had approximately 3 tonic-clonic seizures in a single evening and developed post-ictal confusion requiring transfer to the intensive care unit.
The patient had a negative head CT for any acute bleeding at that time.
The patient had episode of decreased oxygen saturation to 87% on room air.
This was felt likely secondary to aspiration event/pneumonia and largely resolved once the patient was made NPO.
Aspiration pneumonia seen on CXR [**11-21**] but as patient had been afebrile and stable, was believed to be resolving PNA from previous admission.
ENT was consulted and visualized bilateral vocal cord paralysis which had previously been only right-sided on last admission.
Right-sided vocal cord paralysis visualized on last admission, now bilateral.
The patient was status post 14-day course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia from previous admission.
No intervention was made for her vocal cord paralysis.
The patient initially refused to restart decadron due to past leg pain associated with this medication.
After the patient's seizures as described above, she agreed to restart decadron.
Patient remained afebrile throughout admission.
[**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to aspiration PNA.
Malignancy and steroids on differential.
The patient was started on levo/clinda for a short course.
Likely secondary to chemotherapy.
