Pathology Examination SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: SPLEEN & DISTAL PANCREAS.
Spleen: No diagnostic abnormalities.
Pancreas, distal: A. Mucinous cystic neoplasm with low grade to moderate dysplasia.
No invasive carcinoma seen, entire cyst examined.
Much of the cyst lining has been destroyed and replaced by fibrous tissue with hemosiderin, giant cells and cholesterol.
B. Focal chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 1.
D. 5 lymph nodes with no tumor seen.
Clinical: Pancreatic cyst.
She tolerated the procedure well without complications (please refer to operative note for further details).
She remained in the PACU overnight to monitor her BP's and the epidural was adjusted by APS but low BP's persisted.
The PCA provided some pain control temporarily but the epidural had to be restarted with just bupivicaine 0.05% solution and the PCA was continued in order to control her pain.
She was restarted on her depakote via NGT immediately post-op for seizure prophylaxis.
Her epidural was discontinued on [**2126-5-12**] by APS along with her PCA and her pain was controlled with PO dilaudid.
Her oxygenation on room air was normal and she was ambulating well without incident.
There was no change in the volume or quality of the JP output and it was subsequently removed on [**5-13**] (POD#6).
Of note, she developed blisters on her R knee and L medial thigh from presumably the [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings.
