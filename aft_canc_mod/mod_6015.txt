The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course did not change significantly for her metastatic pancreatic cancer.
The patient's case was discussed with her primary oncologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 150**]) who felt that given the patient's poor functional status and extremely grim prognosis that the patient was likely not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy.
For hypoxic respiratory failure, the patient continued on a 50% face mask.
Otherwise, the patient had no further episodes of desaturations and no further admissions to the  Medical Intensive Care Unit for hypoxic acute respiratory compromise.
For diastolic congestive heart failure, the patient's goals were to maintain even input and output.
The patient's tachycardia was felt likely secondary to pain; although, in the setting of a deep venous thrombosis a pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out.
For deep venous thrombosis, the patient had lower extremity Doppler studies given that she had asymmetric lower extremity edema which were significant for bilateral deep venous thrombosis extending from the femorals to the popliteals bilaterally.
For decubitus ulceration, the patient developed a decubitus ulceration to which Duoderm was applied and remained stable during her hospitalization.
It should be noted that the patient has a transfusion reaction to blood and should be given Benadryl prior all blood transfusions.
