Pt had symptoms of dysphagia for 2 months, lightheadedness, and hematemesis ([**1-10**] cups).
When trasferred to [**Hospital1 **] EGD was done on [**7-4**] which showed a necrotic, obstructing mass in the esophogus.
There seemed to be evidence of airway compression as well.
CT showed Ulcerated necrotic mass, 9.7 x 7.5 cm encasing the esophogus and freely communicating with esophogeal lumen.
It also confirmed widely metastatic disease.
PEG tube was not recommended since increased risk of aspiration with esophogeal stent.
