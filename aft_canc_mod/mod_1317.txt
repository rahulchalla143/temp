Patient then returned to clinic with increased SOB in [**5-18**] and found to have extensive mediastinal tumor encasing her trachea and with narrowing of her esophagus.
Bronchial washings showed recurrence of squamous cell Ca and the patient was started on low dose Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **].
Patient found to have progression of disease afer this therapy and was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] on [**2144-5-21**] who felt that the patient would not tolerate further chemotherapy.
Recently had low grade fevers at home and mildly increased SOB from baseline over past 3-4 days.
Patient also had increased work of breathing and attempt was made to intubate x 2 in the ED.
This was unsuccessful due to stenosis of the trachea and therefore the patietn was taken to the OR for intubation.
CXR showed RUL consolidation felt to be a pneumonia and therefore patietn received Azithromycin, Vanco and Gent.
[**Name (NI) **] spoke with PCP who then spoke with daughter and decided no cardiac cath, but wanted medical management with hope to wean from vent quickly.
Past Medical History: -lung cancer in right upper lobe, ~4 years ago, treated with chemotherapy and surgery -neuropathy around lung cancer surgery scar -diabetes, diagnosed in '[**29**], followed at [**Hospital **] Clinic -COPD: [**9-18**] FVC 64% prediceted, FEV1 59% predicted and Ratio: 91% -osteoarthritis of knees, hips -polymyalgia rheumatica, 8-9 years -macular degeneration, recently diagnosed -s/p right cataract surgery -hypertension, controlled with medication - Mult ED admissions for hypoglycemia.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: 95.6 (ax) 91/54  20  94% (AC 400/18 Peep 5 FiO2 100) Gen: Intubated and sedated, minimally responsive on no sedation.
HEENT: PERRL, no scleral injection or icterus, elevated JVP to mandible, neck supple CVS: Distan HS, regular, unable to appreciate any murmurs but exam imited by BS Chest: coarse bronchial BS throughout, NO R anterior BS, lat [**Last Name (un) 8434**] with mild wheeze ABd: mild distention, NABS, soft, no masses Ext: cool to touch, no mottling, pulses + by doppler Neuro: arousable to voice, following commands  Pertinent Results: CT Chest [**2144-6-23**]: Impression: 1.
Interval increase in the mediastinal soft tissue extending up to the hilum and causing narrowing of the right and left main bronchi.
There is slight improvement in the narrowing of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi.
Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, very minimal on the right and moderate on the left.
New right lower lobe pneumonia, likely to aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 72 yo woman with NSCLC s/p chemo, s/p R upper lobectomy with recurrence of mass surrounding trachea s/p tracheal stent.
# Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and progressive Lung CA now encasing her trachea.
Most recent PFTs indicate FEV1/FVC = 90 suggestive of concomitant restrictive disease likely [**12-18**] to chest wall disease/infiltrative CA.
Also CXR at OSH showed R sided infiltrate, ?PNA vs. infiltrative CA vs. post obstructive.
Pt has elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of infectious process.
Sputum positive for coag + staph aureus, likely MRSA.
Solu-Medrol for COPD exacerbation for 72 hrs.
CT of the chest was performed to evaluate for interval change regarding her lung CA and new infiltrate on CXR.
This showed interval increase in the mediastinal soft tissue extending up to the hilum and causing narrowing of the right and left main bronchi, slight improvement in the narrowing of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi.
Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, very minimal on the right and moderate on the left.
New right lower lobe pneumonia, likely to aspiration.
Sputum cultures also came back positive for MRSA and sparse GNR growth.
# CAD: Patient with 1 mm elevation in III, TWI in V1-V2 new compared to EKG [**4-7**] and q waves in anteroseptal leads likely representing an old anteroseptal MI but does not meet criteria for acute STEMI.
Patient arrived on heparin gtt later discontinued given lack of evidence for acute MI.
Patient weaned off dopamine after first day of admission with maintenance of BP with IVF.
Beta blockers were held due to her severe COPD.
# DM: Patient with history of hypoglycemic episodes in past.
# PPx - Heparin SC, pneumaboots, PPI, FS with Insulin gtt, OG feeds then PO intake after extubation.
# Comm - Daughter.
The pain and palliative care who agreed with morphine for pain control/resp distress.
Scopolamine Base 1.5 mg Patch 72HR Sig: One (1) patch Transdermal every seventy-two (72) hours as needed for increased upper airway secretions.
