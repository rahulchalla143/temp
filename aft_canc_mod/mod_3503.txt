Admission Date:  [**2189-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-12-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**] Chief Complaint: monitoring s/p mechanical thrombectomy and extensive venous angioplasty LE DVTs by IR [**2189-2-9**].
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical thrombolysis/angioplasty of DVT w/ repositioning of IVC filter ([**2-7**], [**2-10**]) Transfusion of 2U FFPs and 2U PRBCs XRT   History of Present Illness: 78 y.o male h.o intradural extramedullary mass (adenocarcinoma) (originally presented as sudden back pain, progressively worsening ascending paralysis) s/p thoracic laminectomy T4-7 and mass resection [**2189-1-8**], surgery complicated by hemorrhage resulting in paraplegia, s/p IVC filter for PE ppx.
Pt went to rad onc today (brain/spine radiation) at whic time he was noted to have worsening scrotal and LE edema and decision was made to have pt come in for thrombolysis to recannulize the femoral/iliac vessels with potential IVC filter retrieval/replacement.
In IR pt had extensive thrombectomy with recanalization of thrombosis in popliteal, femoral, iliac, and IVC with mechanical device using AngioJet and balloon angioplasty.
There was good angiographic result with some residual thrombosis.
However, soon after being admitted to the medicine service he triggered for hypotension with blood pressure as low as 80/P.
A stat hct was sent and revealed a drop from 29.5 immediately post procedure to 23.6.
Although b/l lower extremities were swollen, there was no clear e/o hematoma in popliteal regions nor in groin.
T+S was sent and he was ordered for FFP and prbcs and transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and care.
Upon arrival to the MICU a portable u/s showed no trauma to the popliteal veins in the popliteal fossa.
Initally on the floor, the patient reported nausea which has since resolved, band-like numbness across abdomen (unchanged) and paresthesias of b/l LE (unchanged.)
He denied abdominal pain and leg pain, although sensation limited as above.
Past Medical History: - Recently diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma (intradural/extramedullary).
Mets to brain (mult cystic enhancing lesions seeon on MRI.)
CT torso showing mult densities in the lungs, diffuse metastatic bony disease.
- Paraplegia (from hemorrhagic complication of thoracic laminectomy) - s/p IVC filter placement - Prostate Ca s/p XRT, horomonal therapy (approximately [**2180**]-[**2181**])   Social History: The patient was last at a rehab facility.
neck: No JVD, no LAD chest-b/l AE no W/C/R heart-S1S2 RRR no m/r/g abd-+bs, +multiple ecchymotic areas ([**3-14**] fragmin?
Venogram was obtained with injection of contrast through the micropuncture sheath, which demonstrated thrombosis extending from the popliteal vein to the femoral vein.
A 5 French Kumpe catheter was advanced into the iliac vein and SVC and a venogram was obtained, which demonstrated thrombosis in the right iliac vein and IVC, below the IVC filter.
After injection of 1% lidocaine and using ultrasound guidance, access was gained into the left popliteal vein with a micropuncture needle.
A venogram was obtained with injection of contrast through the micropuncture sheath, which demonstrated thrombosis extending from the popliteal to femoral vein.
Venogram after mechanical thrombectomy was obtained with injection of contrast through right vascular sheath, which demonstrated multiple stenoses/residual mural thrombosis of the left popliteal and left femoral vein.
Venograms after balloon dilatation was obtained with injection of both popliteal veins sheaths, which demonstrated marked interval improvement of venous flow with small residual mural thrombosis.
Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 55 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
COMPLICATION: Hematuria developed right after the procedure and is likely due to hemolysis from the Angiojet thrombectomy.
IMPRESSION: Thrombosis involving the bilateral popliteal, femoral and iliac veins and IVC, below the IVC filter.
Successful recanalization of thrombosis in popliteal, femoral, iliac, and IVC with mechanical thrombectomy using AngioJet and balloon angioplasty, with good angiographic result and some residual mural thrombosis.
CT LOW EXT W/O C BILAT  [**2189-2-10**] 12:02 AM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH NO IV CONTRAST ADMINISTRATION: The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrate dependent atelectatic changes and a small bilateral pleural effusion.
Small axial hiatal hernia is also visualized.
The liver, spleen, left adrenal gland, gallbladder, pancreas, common bile duct, stomach, and loops of small bowel and large bowel appear normal.
Both kidneys contain multiple hypodense lesions which most likely represents cysts.
The patient demonstrates signs of fluid overload.
Small amount of free fluid is noted within the pelvis.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding is visualized.
CT OF THE Lower extemity: There is significant amount of fluid accumulation within the scrotum and penis related to venous obstruction.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
No retroperitoneal bleeding is noted.
There is copious fluid accumulation in the soft tissues and most prominantly in the scrotum.
This is most likely related to venous occlusion.
Persistent contrast in the venous system is most likely related to the residual clot.
Right adrenal adenoma as described.
Axial Hiatal hernia.. .
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2189-2-19**] 3:27 PM RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echotexture with no focal lesions.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
There is no ascites.
Sludge layers within the gallbladder, with no echogenic gallstones identified.
The gallbladder wall is not thickened, and the gallbladder is only mildly distended.
There is no pericholecystic fluid.
Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

1) Hypotension Patient had decreased bp after procedure, necessitating ICU transfer.
Likely related to peri-procedural complication given time course and acute blood loss.
No clear source of aneurysm or hematoma b/l popliteal and right groin on bedside U/S performed by IR.
Had cosyntropin stim test which did not show any evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
He did receive intermittent doses of lasix (IV and PO) which also affected blood pressure.
Patient did not have symptoms of lightheadedness of dizziness.
2) Hematuria Had hematuria post-procedure which is common occurrence due to jets in thrombectomy which can cause hemolysis.
Hematuria later recurred after he received Lepirudin (see below).
Upon discontinuation of Lepirudin, hematuria resolved and further flushes were not needed.
3) Extensive Lower extremity DVTs/Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Although IVC filter had been replaced and mechanical thrombectomy achieved some level of success, the patient had extensive residual clot burden from IVC filter to the popliteal veins.
The patient developed the hematuria (as above) on Lepirudin, however his Hct was stable.
He was switched over to Fondaparinux, which he tolerated well (no evidence of a decrease in blood clots).
4) Lower Extremity and Scrotal Edema This is secondary to extensive clot burden.
Although patient had good urine output with Lasix, edema was essentially unchanged.
Lasix had to be intermittently stopped due to low blood pressures.
5) Metastatic adenocarcinoma - unclear primary (lung vs. prostate) w/ paraplegia Mets involving brain, spine, bone.
6) Sacral Decub/Scrotal skin breakdown The patient had a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer as well as some scrotal skin breakdown.
7) Urinary Tract Infection - MSSA/Pseudomonas He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with a 2-week course of Ciprofloxacin (last dose on [**2-24**]).
8) Anemia After his transfusion, the patient's Hct remained stable between 34-36. .
9) C. diff Colitis The patient developed diarrhea while on antibiotics.
The patient had intermittent passage of jelly-like stool, thought to be secondary to the infection.
Overall disease process/prognosis was also discussed with patient via the hospital interpreter.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Diff Colitis 9) Hypotension - intermittent 10) Scalp pain - likely secondary to XRT 11) Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You have an extensive blood clot going down most of the lower half of your body.
Due to this clot blocking the return of blood flow from your legs and scrotum, you have developed significant leg and scrotal swelling.
Attempts to remove the clot through mechanical means were only partially successful.
The definitive treatment of thrombolysis can't be done because you have metastatic lesions in your head and would be at very high risk for bleeding.
Unfortunately, you developed a reaction to this medicine (decrease in your platelet counts - Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia), for this reason you were changed to another medication, Fondaparinux.
You will need to watch for signs of bleeding, such as blood in your urine or stool.
As a result of receiving necessary antibiotics, you developed C. Difficile colitis (an infection in your colon).
Call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you should develop chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening headache, blurry vision, increased weakness or numbness, or significant bleeding.
You will need to set up a follow up appointment with him to follow up on your hematuria (blood in urine), management of your foley catheter, and your elevated PSA found during this hospitalization.
Can call to further discuss options for palliative care.
