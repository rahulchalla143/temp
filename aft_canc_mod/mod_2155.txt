At that time, incidental mass was identified, and he now presents electively for resection of said mass.

Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2193-4-11**] 02:46PM BLOOD WBC-18.4*# RBC-3.81* Hgb-11.0* Hct-32.7* MCV-86 MCH-28.8 MCHC-33.5 RDW-15.5 Plt Ct-517* [**2193-4-12**] 03:11AM BLOOD PT-12.8 PTT-24.1 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2193-4-11**] 02:46PM BLOOD Glucose-179* UreaN-11 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-4.2 Cl-107 HCO3-24 AnGap-12 [**2193-4-11**] 02:46PM BLOOD Calcium-8.3* Phos-4.2 Mg-1.7  Imaging: MRI/A Head Neck [**4-13**]: TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of a large meningioma in the right frontal region.
Extensive right-sided brain edema is again identified.
Mild slow diffusion in the surrounding area on diffusion images is indicative of postoperative change.
There is blood in the left lateral ventricle.
There is persistent mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
Changes of small vessel disease are seen.
Note is made of new areas of slow diffusion in the right medial thalamus.
These findings are indicative of acute infarcts which are new since the previous study.
Additionally, enhancement and flow void in the left medial temporal lobe region indicative of an aneurysm at the site of previously noted arteriovenous malformation.
IMPRESSION: Previous MRI examination, the patient has undergone resection of a large frontal meningioma with blood products at the surgical site without residual nodular enhancement.
Acute right-sided thalamic infarcts are seen which are new since the previous study.
The fat-suppressed images demonstrate subtle increased soft tissues adjacent to the proximal right common carotid artery as seen on the CTA.
There is no definite dissection seen.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
The left medial temporal lobe arteriovenous malformation is also not clearly visualized.
IMPRESSION: No vascular occlusion or stenosis seen on the MRA of the head.
Postoperative changes are noted following removal of frontal lobe tumor.
Acute right thalamic infarcts are identified.
MRA of the head demonstrates no stenosis or occlusion.
Post-operatively, he was transferred to the ICU for continuous monitoring.
The vascular surgery team agreed that there was no carotid artery dissection and no intervention needed on their part.
The patient was able to eat without difficulty.
On [**4-16**] the patient was noted to have bloody urine in the foley.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
