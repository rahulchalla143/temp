She remained on this treatment for the next year with several dosage adjustments due to peripheral neuropathy and fatigue.
as a result of peripheral neuropathy and fatigue -	 [**2127-3-10**], the patient developed pain in her sacrum, and an MRI of the sacral area revealed lesions in her sacrum as well as a sacral fracture according to the patient.

Multiple Myeloma, back pain  MRI was done that ruled out cord compression, but revealed an extensive right paraspinal (T9-sacral) plasmacytoma that invaded the spinal canal at multiple levels and caused displacement of the cord, but no frank cord compression.
She had very significant pain that required ultimately placement of intrathecal catheter(with dilaudid/bupivacaine/clonidine), dilaudid drip, morphine pca, iv ketamine drip, flexeril, baclofen, neurontin, NSAIDS and her usual fentanyl patch.
The last few of her radiation treatments did not require this as her pain was better controlled.
She was sent to the ICU twice during this course; once for pain control/intensive nursing after an especially explosive attack of pain, and again for monitoring when her pain regimen was increased.
Both stays were unremarkable; no respiratory depression or hypotension with increased regimen.
UTI  Pt's pain became refractory to all IV and intrathecal opiates/benzo's.
