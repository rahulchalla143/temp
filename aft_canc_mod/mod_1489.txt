Patient's initial neurological symptoms began in [**2115**] when she was having difficulty hearing in the right ear while using the telephone.
In [**2117**], she was noted as having a right drift while walking and started drooling on the right.
MRI in [**Country 651**] done at that time revealed a right cerebellar lesion.
Pathology slides were not available from [**Country 651**], but her family had her MRIs and the tumor looks consistent with a meningioma.
Postoperatively, she was left with a total right facial droop, loss of sensation, and hearing.
In [**2118-3-24**], she had an episode of abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of consciousness.
On [**2120-4-4**], she had an increase in the size of her tumor on routine MRI.
Repeat MRI done on [**2120-8-14**] showed  progression of the tumor as well again of her right cerebellar-pontine angle tumor on [**2120-9-18**].
Right facial weakness and numbness was observed.
Patient had VII and VIII cranial nerve palsies on admission.
Left upper extremity weakness persisted on [**9-20**], believed to be a left upper extremity brachial plexopathy from surgical positioning.
Patient underwent her first bedside swallow evaluation on [**9-20**], which showed overt aspiration on thin and nectar-thick liquids.
A video swallow examination followed, which revealed that the patient had moderate oral and profound pharyngeal paresis characterized by moderately reduced A/P tongue movement and moderately reducible with control as well as right pharyngeal paralysis.
Her left arm numbness and weakness continued to improve until [**9-22**] when she exhibited full strength on neurologic examination.
Patient reported no headache or neck stiffness.
ENT was consulted on [**9-24**] for vocal cord paralysis.
Ophthalmology was consulted on [**9-24**] as well secondary to right conjunctivitis of her right eye secondary to her right facial palsy.
On [**9-25**], the patient's repeat head CT showed increased ventricular size after drain was clamped.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed without complication on [**9-26**].
Patient with persistent difficulty in closing right eye on [**9-27**].
Repeat video swallow done revealed that the patient should remain NPO because of severe dysphagia and nonfunctional swallow mechanism.
Reconsult of Ophthalmology on [**9-28**] to placement a [**Doctor Last Name 5749**] shield over eye because of her risk for corneal perforation.
Eyelid suture of the right eye to prevent progression of her corneal keratopathy.
Patient tolerated procedure well with no sequelae.
Repeat swallow on [**10-4**] again noted a severe dysphagia, and need for the patient to remain NPO.
Patient underwent PEG placement on [**10-8**], which was without difficulty.
