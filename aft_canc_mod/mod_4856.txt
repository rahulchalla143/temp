Admission Date:  [**2106-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-10-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: pelvic mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, tumor debulking, omentectomy, extended right colectomy, right pelvic peritoneal implant excision, partial wedge gastrectomy, ileal descending colostomy, and rigid proctosigmoidoscopy  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70-year-old G2, P2 sent by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for consultation regarding a possible diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
The patient presented with a several month history of increasing abdominal distention, diffuse abdominal discomfort, and exacerbation of heartburn symptoms.
She was evaluated with an upper endoscopy on [**2106-8-27**], at which time a submucosal mass in the stomach was noted.
This revealed the surface of the liver to be studded with multiple discrete enhancing nodules.
There was disseminated peritoneal carcinomatosis, with large omental cakes seen along the right flank.
There was a small amount of perihepatic ascites.
Discrete nodules were identified studding the surface the liver as previously described, as well as the surface of the spleen and stomach.
There was no significant retroperitoneal adenopathy.
In the pelvis, there was some suggestion of uterine and bilateral adnexal masses.
This revealed high-grade papillary carcinoma, consistent with ovarian origin.
The patient states that she has had increasing abdominal girth and has difficulty fitting into her clothes.
She has had about a 12 pound unintentional weight loss.
She has some shortness of breath, which she attributes to the increasing abdominal distention.
She has diffuse but low-grade abdominal discomfort.
Physical Exam: GENERAL:  Well developed and moderately overweight.
HEART:  Regular without murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and moderately distended.
There was no appreciable ascites.
There was a palpable mass extending along the entire right side of the abdomen.
No definite pelvic masses were appreciated.
There was no definite cul-de-sac nodularity and the rectal was intrinsically normal.
Small-bowel obstruction with candidate transition point in LLQ 2.
Large left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
Overall, slight improvement in carcinomatosis and malignant ascites.
The patient's post-operative course was complicated by low hematocrit, post-operative fever w/ Clostridium perfringens on blood culture, an intrahepatic IVC thrombus, bilateral upper lobe opacities and bibasilar effusions L>R with dyspnea/hypoxia and O2 requirement, lower extremity fungal infection, and small bowel obstruction.
Hcts subsequently remained stable at ~27, and she had no evidence of bleeding.
Per surgery recommendation the patient was started on heparin for anticoagulation, however this was discontinued when the pt had another Hct drop.
1 of 2 bottles from [**11-4**] was positive for c. perfringens.
She underwent a CTA of the chest which showed no pulmonary emboli but did show bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia.
She was started on levofloxacin, and repeat chest x-ray showed that her pneumonia improved after 4 days of levofloxacin, and this was discontinued.
Given continued temperatures, CTs of the abdomen were obtained [**11-8**], [**11-12**] which showed increasing carcinomatosis and multiple pelvic pockets of free fluid, some loculated, which were thought to be malignant ascites; none amenable to percutaneous drainage.
The pt remained afebrile on Vanco/Zosyn from [**11-11**], with decreasing WBC, and V/Z were discontinued on [**11-23**].
The patient was also noted to have a bilateral lower extremity and groin rash on [**11-23**]; ID consult was obtained, and it was felt that this was the result of a fungal infection, and IV fluconazole was started.
3) Pulm: In addition to the presumed pneumonia as above, the pt continued to have subjective dyspnea and O2 requirement.
CXR's and CTs showed bibasilar effusions, L>R.
The patient's hypoxia and shortness of breath resolved spontaneously, and for the last week of admission she was 96-100% on RA.
3) FEN/GI: Given nausea and poor po intake, the pt was started on TPN, with diet slowly advanced.
However, on CT scan [**11-22**], the patient was noted to have a small bowel obstruction, associated with some nausea and vomiting.
She was made NPO until passing flatus and subjective resolution of nausea, and was advanced to clears [**11-29**], then regular [**12-1**].
She was covered for somewhat elevated FSG's with an insulin sliding scale.
