[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], who felt a liver mass.
He [**Name (STitle) 1834**] an ultrasound that demonstrated a 9-cm mass in the right lobe of the liver.
This demonstrated a 9-cm mass appearing to be rising in the medial segment of the left lobe and invading the anterior segment of the right lobe.
There was also portacaval adenopathy and celiac adenopathy.
This demonstrated a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that was positive for CK7, CK20, CAM 5.2, and negative for AFP, hepar-1, CA19-9, and CDX-2.
He had a sigmoid polyp removed that was read as an adenoma.
He states that he is eating and tolerating a regular diet, having normal formed bowel movements without change in bowel habits, and denies any weight loss.
He denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or history of liver disease.
He is now referred for consideration of hepatic resection.

Family History: brother with lung cancer, a sister with lymphoma and breast cancer, and his mother with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and gastric cancer.
99.2, height 5 feet 8 inches, weight 82.3 kg  On physical exam he is a well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress.
Skin:  no stigmata of chronic liver disease.
No palmar erythema or spider angiomata.
HEENT:  no scleral icterus.
Neck:  no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
No splenomegaly.
There is some tenderness in the midclavicular line subcostally.
Extremities:  no peripheral edema.
Segment 3, medial margin (A-G):  a.  Hepatic parenchyma with moderate steatosis, no lobular neutrophils or intracytoplasmic hyalin seen.
Small bile duct hamartoma.
No tumor is seen at margins.
Portal lymph node (K):  One lymph node with focal lipogranuloma formation, no carcinoma seen.
Mild chronic cholecystitis.
One lymph node with follicular hyperplasia and lipogranulomas, no carcinoma seen.
b.  Cystic spaces consistent with hamartoma seen adjacent to infiltrating adenocarcinoma.
c.  Focal bile ducts with high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ seen.
EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Multiple tumors more than 5 cm or tumor involving a major branch of the portal or hepatic vein(s).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Hilar large bile ducts show prominent periductal fibrosis with cautery artifact.
No definite carcinoma seen (slide AK).
Trichrome stain shows increased portal and periportal fibrosis with focal bridging and sinusoidal fibrosis (stage 2 and focally stage 3 fibrosis).
Iron stain shows mild iron deposition predominantly in Kupffer cells.
Part 1 is additionally labeled "segment 3 medial margin; stitch-true final" and consists of two tan-red tissue fragments, the larger of which measures 2.3 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm and the smaller that measures 1.8 x 1 x 0.6 cm, respectively.
The larger tissue fragment has a surgical suture that has been left in place that designates one surface as the true final resection margin.
The smaller fragment is unoriented but based on the appearance and shape of the tissue fragments it appears that it is a piece that has broken off the larger fragment.
The smaller fragment has three identifiable surfaces of which one has been inked yellow and the second has been inked black and the remaining cauterized surface remains un-inked.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a nodule that measures 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm which a homogeneous white cut surface.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: H=tumor closest to yellow margin, I-J=additional sections of tumor in relation to yellow margin.
Part 3 is additionally labeled "portal lymph node" and consists of a tan-red fragment of tissue measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm.
The specimen is bisected to reveal an unremarkable cut surface.
A cystic duct lymph node is identified and measures 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: L=cystic duct margin and gallbladder neck, M=gallbladder body and fundus, N=frozen section remnant of lymph node, O-P=remainder of cystic duct lymph node, entirely submitted.
Part 5 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is additionally labeled "liver right lobe".
It consists of a right lobe of liver that measures 19.9 x 16 x 9 cm.
The liver is serially sliced to reveal an irregularly shaped firm nodular tan-white tumor which is continuous with surface puckering that measures approximately 9.2 x 4.8 x 8.5 and is located 2.8 cm from the black-inked resection margin.
Multiple satellite lesions are present which measure up to 1.7 cm.
Please note that grossly satellite lesions and tumors are greater than 2 cm of the parenchymal margin and hence no representative sections can be taken, U-V=uninvolved parenchymal margin, W-sections that possibly represent vascular surgical margin where multiple staples were present.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2135-7-17**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right hepatic trisegmentectomy, segment III wedge resection and cholecystectomy for metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver from an unknown primary versus primary hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
There were no intraop complications.
Two JPs were placed as well as a T tube.
He was fluid overloaded and experienced mental status changes, thereofore he remained intubated.
A CT of the abdomen showed large bilateral pleural effusions with areas of adjacent passive atelectasis and bilateral ground-glass opacities.
A small area of the inferior remaining liver parenchyma that was not perfused.
Additionally, a small subphrenic fluid was noted.
Diffuse colitis was noted.
Peritoneal fluid was positive for vanco sensitive enterococcus.
He remained mildly confused.
He required multiple feeding tube replacements for self removal secondary to confusion.
On [**8-31**] an abd CT demonstrated an increase in a large right pleural effusion, with a stable small left effusion.
There was stable intermediate attenuation perihepatic fluid collection believed to represent a hematoma.
New right pericolic gutter fluid collection, without definite air or surrounding fat stranding and continued improvement of previously described colitis.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] from hepatology was consulted for liver failure due to a small left lobe and steatosis noted on pathology.
T bili remained elevated as well as BUN.
He eventually was transferred out of the SICU only to return  for worsening encephalopathy.
Cipro and Zosyn were stopped and changed to Cefepime given concern for possible intersitial nephritis.
He experienced acute renal failure initially felt to be secondary to antibiotics, but w/u for interstitial nephritis was negative.
He was transferred back to the SICU for a severe hypoglycemic episode thought to be due to an infectious process and insulin while feeding tube was out.
He started to complain of abdominal cramping after JP was removed on [**9-18**].
An abdominal CT showed focal transverse colon colitis, stable perihepatic fluid collection, stable right pericolic gutter fluid collection and no evidence of bowel obstruction.
On [**9-23**] abdominal discomfort increased with increased bowel movements.
A repeat ABD CT showed pneumatosis intestinalis, worrisome for ischemia and possible necrosis.
There was no evidence of portal venous air.
