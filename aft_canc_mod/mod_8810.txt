Admission Date:  [**2142-1-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-1-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-12-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Unsteady gait  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis [**2142-1-14**]  History of Present Illness: This is an 81-year-old female with a history of stage IV NSCLC diagnosed in [**5-/2140**], now getting palliative XRT, who presents today after she was unable to rise from a seated position on her bed.
Patient reports noticable instability for the past few weeks; nothing acute, but increased trouble rising from a seated position and extra help needed with ADLs.
Upon arrival in the ED, patient was found to be short of breath, with an 02 sat of 50-60% on room air.
EKG showed frequent PVCs, but no concerning ST changes.
ROS: Patient actually denies any trouble breathing, stating that she has had some DOE, but nothing at rest.
She also denies any fever, "chest congestion," nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, hemoptysis, dysuria, or other symptoms.
A CT scan on [**12-25**] showed extensive disease (though slightly diminished from prior) with large right-sided tumor and metastatic spread to liver.
Family History: Father with chronic leukemia and mother with HTN.
Right upper lobe mass,increased in size from [**2141-7-19**], but likely similar to CT [**2141-12-25**] .
Additional lung findings and lymphadenopathy are better assessed on a prior CT. .
No acute intracranial process.
Please note limited sensitivity of non-contrast CT for intracranial metastases for which gadolinium-enhanced MRI is a better modality.
Moderate atrophy which may reflect age-associated involutional changes.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Overall worsening multiloculated right pleural effusion with interval increase in multiple necrotic masses, compatible with progression of metastatic lung cancer.
Multiple foci of air within the right pleural cavity admixed with associated pleural effusion, mildly increased since the prior study which may be due to necrosis but raises the possibility of a bronchopleural fistula.
Rounded 2.1 cm hepatic dome low-attenuation lesion (3:88), suboptimally characterized given arterial phase of imaging.
This could represent a new metastasis or venous structure and attention on followup is recommended.
No CT evidence of large metastases, within the limitations.
Unchanged moderate volume loss and chronic small vessel ischemic disease    Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81-year-old female with a past medical history of NSCLC who presents from home with a 2-day history of worsening shortness of breath.
SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Shortness of breath most likely from increasing tumor burden and worsening pulmonary effusions.
Other possibilities include infection, cardiac cause, or pulmonary embolus (though ruled out with CTA).
Infection is unlikely given absence of fever, leukocytosis, or localizing symptoms.
Cardiac cause is also lower on the differential given an absence of cardiac history.
The patient continued to have an oxygen requirement following admission, and underwent an IR-guided thoracentesis after CT chest showed a loculated right-sided pleural effusion.
1.1 liters of exudative pleural fluid were removed, with subsequent improvement in oxygenation.
The interventional pulmonology service were consulted regarding possible placement of pleurx catheter in right thorax given likely recurrence of malignant pleural effusion in setting stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
IP performed rigid bronchoscopy on [**1-17**] which was consistent with postobstructive pneumonia.
Patient became progressively more hypoxic after this procedure despite supplemental oxygen and antibiotics.
Patient subsequently became bradycardic apneic and expired on [**1-18**].
Complaint is likely multifactorial, with etiologies including hypercalcemia, deconditioning, and poor appetite and intake.
Patient also has a history of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, which could contribute to her weakness.
Mild hypercalcemia was treated with IVF.
HYPERCALCEMIA: Patient with elevated calcium, espeically in light of low albumin.
In addition to other etiologies, paraneoplastic syndrome were entertained in an individual with lung cancer (possibly squamous cell -> PTHrP).
LUNG CANCER: Patient with stage IV NSCLC.
