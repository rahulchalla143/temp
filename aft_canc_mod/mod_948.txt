Pt felt pain at the site of ventral hernia and thought abdominal pain was related to hernia.
Pt was previously admitted in [**March 2201**] w/fevers and joint pain concerning for possible chronic osteomyelitis of L knee.

Pt has had low grade temps 99-100 consistently over past month while at NH, HR 100s.
CXR negative, Urine negative, abdominal CT with stool per wet read, has ventral wall hernia, abdominal Xray with no free air or air-fluid levels on wet read.
Surgery evaluated in ED, did massive disimpaction, but no concern for surgical process at this time.
Patient was started on empiric Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam due to h/o MRSA/VRE and new leukocytosis.
Past Medical History: Past medical history: Seronegative arthritis, possibly ankylosing spondylitis, of hips, knees, wrist, on steroids/immunosuppressants since [**2190**] (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, prednisone) L prosthetic knee infection with C. albicans and CoNS - now with  spacer Citrobacter fasciitis of abdominal and chest wall - required skin grafting Multiple abdominal abscess - citrobacter, VRE Right lower extremity DVT requiring IVC filter anemia of chronic disease MRSA infection PUD anabolic steroid abuse (16 months in early 20s) -Recent MRI knee suggestive of osteomyelitis PSH: [**2200-8-28**] radical debridement of soft tissues of R chest wall, abdominal wall, flank, groin; step incisions in abdominal wall fascia & musculature with drainage of peritoneal abscess [**2200-8-29**] repeat debridement of necrotic soft tissues of R chest,  abdominal wall, b/l groins, additional step incisions in abdominal wall fascia & musculature with drainage of peritoneal  abscess -[**2200-9-4**] tracheostomy with 8-0 cuffec Portex tube, irrigation &  debridement of wounds with further drainage of periappendiceal abscess, placement of 26Fr mushroom-tipped catheter into appendiceal stump within cecum -[**2200-9-17**] IVC filter placement -[**2200-9-26**] vac dressing change under general anesthesia -[**2200-9-30**] vac dressing change under general anesthesia -[**2200-10-2**] preparation of wound bed with debridement & excision of  scar, meshed skin graft (16/1000" meshed at 1.5, total surface area 40x55 cm) -[**2200-10-7**] removal of bolster, skin graft, replacement of wound dressing with DuoDerm gel & Xeroform gauze ... -L TKR [**3-1**] c/b wound dehiscence & septic arthritis in [**3-2**] -R THR [**10-30**] -L THR [**1-26**] -R TKR [**4-28**] -L tibial osteotomy -L4-L5 laminectomy [**2193**] (s/p MVA with traumatic disc herniation)  .
Was a semiprofessional body builder in early 20s with h/o anabolic steroid abuse x 16 months.
No wheeze/crackles anteriorly abd/GI: Skin grafts intact over L. Abdominal wall, Multiple abdominal scar sites; c/d/i.
left lower midline ventral hernia noted, ostomy in place with nl green output.
No LE Edema.
Imaging: CXR: INDICATION: 33-year-old man with diffuse abdominal pain with history of necrotizing fasciitis.
Unchanged mediastinal widening is compatible with mediastineal fatty deposition.
The lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No free intra-abdominal air is visualized.
Elevated right hemidiaphragm.
No free intraperitoneal air and no air fluid levels.
Mildly distended small bowel loop is noted in the left upper quadrant area.
Status post bilateral total hip replacement, with possible periprosthetic lucency about the left femoral stem.
Extensive colonic fecal loading rectosigmoid more than left colon.
Mildly prominent small bowel loops measuring upto 3 cm, may reflect partial obstruction, not completeobviously with a functioning colostomy.
Mild left renal collecting system fullness to the UPJ is new without cause evident.
Small upper abdominal fluid collections in the gastrohepatic and gastrosplenic space are significantly smaller than prior study, nearly resolved.
RUQ U/S: FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality.
There is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.4 cm.
Several small gallstones are seen within the gallbladder measuring less than 1 cm and there is a small amount of sludge present.
There are no signs of cholecystitis.
There is no ascites seen in the right upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION: Subcentimeter gallstones and small amount of sludge but no signs of cholecystitis.
No biliary dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 33 year old male with seronegative arthritis on immunosuppressants and extensive infectious history presenting with malaise and abdominal pain.
# Abdominal Pain: Likely etiology 2' to constipation leading to temporary partial bowel obstruction, as pt had improvement of pain after disimpaction in ED, and was abdominal pain free during his ICU stay.
He is also on a very heavy opiate regimen for pain that may also have contributed to his constipation.
He had an extensive surgical history concerning for SBO, but KUB did not show air-fluid leves, and CT was negative for strangulatation of his ventral hernia, and his lactate was normal.
His RUQ US was also negative for acute cholecytitis: he may have had transient choledocholithiasis with a passed stone, as small subcentimeter stones and GB sludge were noted on U/S, and he  transiently elevated AP and LDH that decreased over 24 hours while in the ICU.
# Leukocytosis: Pt had an elevated WBC 20 on admission, but he did have recent Prednisone burst started by rheumatology on [**6-13**], so may be related to steroids.
His CT showed no evidence of abdominal abscess.
He has a h/o VRE, MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella, and has a history of osteomyelitis, given bilateral hip and knee hardware.
These are chronic problems and unlikely completely causative of his leukocytosis.
He was afebrile during his hospital course.
