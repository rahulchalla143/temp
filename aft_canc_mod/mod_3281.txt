Family History: There is a significant family history of premature coronary artery disease in father, paternal uncles, and paternal grandfather.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: No evidence of JVD, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly CV: Distant heart sounds, no S3/S4, no m,r,g Chest: CTAB, +crackles at posterior lung bases, poor air movement posteriorly Abd: Soft, NT/ND.
+ midline scar, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCX had a 90% stenosis proximally.
The left renal artery had an 80% stenosis at its origin.
The left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 17mmHg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
[**2159-10-31**] Renal Ultrasound: The left kidney measures 11.7 cm and demonstrates unremarkable echotexture without evidence of stones, hydronephrosis, or mass.
Appropriate Doppler flow is demonstrated to the left kidney without evidence of stenosis.
The right kidney is otherwise unremarkable without evidence of stone, hydronephrosis, or mass.
[**2159-10-31**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis of the mid inferior and inferolateral segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2), best seen on image 101.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic right frontal cortex and right basal ganglia infarcts with associated right ventricular dilation and right temporal lobe encephalomalacia.
Left lower lobe nodule, lung carcinoma until proved otherwise.
No good evidence for metastasis, aside from small liver lesion warranting axial imaging.
Small bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions, more likely related to cardiac decompensation than malignancy.
Atherosclerotic calcification, including coronary arteries, aorta and splanchnic vessels.
Granulomatous calcifications, peripancreatic, lower mediastinal lymph nodes in liver.
Abnormal FDG-avidity in a 12mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule highly concerning for lung carcinoma.
Mild to moderate FDG uptake in the left adrenal gland.
No corresponding nodule identified on CT.
Bilateral pleural effusions and moderate pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease, left renal artery stenosis and moderate subclavian stenosis.
CARDIAC: He remained pain free on medical therapy which included intravenous Heparin.
Preoperative echocardiogram notable for moderate aortic valve stenosis and moderate LV dysfunction with an LVEF of 40-45%.
Postoperative course was complicated by bleeding which required re-exploration on postoperative day zero.
Experienced atrial fibrillation on postop day two which was treated with Amiodarone infusion and beta blockade.
Brief episodes of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation were noted.
PULMONARY: Preoperative chest CT scan notable for a left lower lobe nodule.
PET scan showed abnormal FDG-avidity in the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule highly concerning for lung carcinoma.
Renal ultrasound showed normal left kidney and an atrophic right kidney.
Nephrology was consulted to evaluate finding of renal artery stenosis in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
NEURO: Given history of cerebrovascular disease, he underwent carotid ultrasound which showed moderate disease of his left internal carotid artery(see result section).
Preoperative head CT scan was notable for chronic right frontal cortex and right basal ganglia infarcts with associated right ventricular dilation and right temporal lobe encephalomalacia.
Aneurysm clips were noted in the anterior clinoid process.
Folllowing cardiac surgery, there were no neurologic complications.
There was no evidence of infection.
He remained afebrile with negative cultures throughout his hospital stay.
ENDOCRINE: Endocrine service was consulted for pre and postoperative management of his diabetes mellitus.
