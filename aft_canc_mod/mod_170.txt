He was also given lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy.

male with history of AIDS, HCV cirrhosis, polysubstance abuse, diarrhea, admitted for mental status changes and respiratory monitoring.
His micu course was uncomplicated, he had some meds (trazodone, mirtazapine, percocet and clonazepam) held to prevent further somnolence and he was given lactulose for high ammonia.
#) Mental status changes - The patient's mental status changes were likely related to his overdose of opium, as his mental status improved through his course.
Given his elevated ammonia a concern for encephalopathy was raised, but this was unlikely.
With the history of fever and headache in ED, he was initially treated for meningitis, though on the floor he was afebrile with no meningismus, so concern for meningitis was low and he was not treated any further.
#) Cirrhosis: The patient had improved mental status on the floor, and while he had elevated ammonia it was unlikley he had encephalopathy, so his lactulose and rifaximin (given in the ED and MICU) were stopped.
He did not appear to have a large amount of ascites, though given his delicate fluid balance he had an US which showed minimal ascites.
As he had Acute renal failure, his lasix and spironolactone were held, and his fluid balance was closely followed.
His renal function improved prior to discharge, so to prevent fluid overload his diuretics were restarted at a lower dose, and he will be followed closely by ID and the coinfection clinic as an outpatient, so he is maintained on the appropriate dose of diuretics to prevent reacummulation of ascites.
#) Diarrhea - The patient has chronic diarrhea, and the acute worsening was likely due to the lactulose he was given.
#) Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of bone marrow toxicity secondary to Bactrim/AZT.
#) Acute renal failure - The patient has a baseline creatinine that appears to be around 0.9-1.0, and this was elevated to 1.3.
This was likely due to dehydration in setting of diarrhea for this patient.
