His wife noticed increasing edema and abdominal girth approximately 1 month ago.
Approximately 2 weeks ago, his wife again noticed increasing abdominal girth and firmness as well, associated with decreasing urine output.
His edema and decreased urine output continued to progress, and he began to develop scrotal edema.
At this point he had urinary retention, and his wife brought him to the emergency department.
Review of his medications from OMR revealed that he had been prescribed Tamsulosin for BPH but he was not taking this medication.
A CXR showed vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions left>right.
An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 63, RBBB, LAFB, unchanged from prior EKG.
Bedside US showed bilateral pleural effusions.
Abdominal U/S showed free fluid and no hydronephrosis, but scrotal fluid.
He was not given diuretics initially because of his elevated creatinine.
In the evening, he triggered for worsening shortness of breath.
He was also given his nebulizers and one dose of Solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation.
His CXR at that time showed bilateral plueral effusions and vascular congestion.
Of note he also had two episodes of hypoglycemia to 40s overnight accompanied by tachypnea and wheezing; his respiratory symptoms resolved with euglycemia.
His symptoms and hypoglycemia resolved with dextrose.

Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
There are small R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-5-13**] there is no significant change.
The heart size is moderately enlarged but appears similar compared to the prior study.
There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness as well as moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions.
Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is identified.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with small right, and moderate-sized left, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
No hydronephrosis, stones or massesis are observed.
No signs of hydronephrosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and the aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
These findings are suggestive of a chronic pulmonary process, e.g., PPH, chronic pulmonary embolism, COPD, OSA, etc.
Chest X-ray [**9-12**]: Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by slight improvement in degree of pulmonary edema and associated decrease in right pleural effusion, now small in size.
Bibasilar opacities appear similar to the prior study as well as a moderate left pleural effusion.
Hemodynamic catheterization revealed the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the setting of moderately elevated left venticular filling pressures.
Right ventricular filling pressure was mildly elevated in the setting of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Vasodilator test wtih inhaled nitric oxide revealed no reversibility of the pulmonary hypertension.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal segments of both the right and left lower lobes.
More confluent airspace opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical segments of the right upper lobe.
Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema.
Ground-glass change is also seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary edema.
Dense calcification of the left coronary artery are seen.
There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely representing the primary tumor.
The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value of 100.
No focal liver lesions are identified.
Note is made of a 17-mm low-attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are identified.
There are no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise normal in characters and caliber CT OF PELVIS: The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the urethra and should be repostioned.
Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.
There were no enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.
Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the anterior aspect of the pancreatic body.
A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56).
Several other sub centimeter low attenuation foci are seen adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57).
Findings are in keeping with multiple pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms and could be further evaluated with MRCP.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are seen involving the thoracolumbar spine.
A 3-mm sclerotic focus in the right ilium has the appearance of a benign bone island.
Splenomegaly with low-attenuation lesions, incompletely characterized, but by demographics likely representing a hemangioma.
High attenuation liver parenchyma likely secondary to amiodarone therapy.
No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
Airspace opacities and pleural effussions most in keeping with pulmonary edema.
Cystic pancreatic lesions requiring further evaluation with MRCP.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo M with diastolic CHF and pulmonary arterial hypertension, CKD, diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy, asthma, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG [**2115**], remote H/O colon cancer, new breast cancer s/p biopsy 2 weeks ago, presenting with volume overload from a combination of right sided CHF and acute on chronic kidney injury who is no longer responding to IV :asix and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for aggressive diuresis.
Patient was volume overloaded on admission, which was attributed to his known left and right sided diastolic CHF (with moderate RV hypokinesis).
Repeat echo was similar to prior showing severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and resulting right sided heart failure, with EF >60%.
Right heart catheterization with inhaled vasodilator testing was performed which showed elevated pulmonary pressures that were not responsive to either 100% FiO2 or inhaled nitric oxide (PA 89/19/42).
Course was further complicated by transient bradycardia which resolved spontanously, acute on chronic renal failure and anemia.
CXR and CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary effusions.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted for potential thoracentesis, however they were unable to find a pocket suitable for drainage on two occasions despite use of ultrasound guidance.
The patient's O2 requirement increased to 6 L/min via shovel mask with saturations in the mid 90s.
Diuretics were discontinued, and the patient was given PO morphine, hyoscyamine for secretions and PRN Ativan.
After a few agonal breaths and a few faintly audible heart sounds, the patient was documented to have undetectable carotid pulses, pupils dilated to 5 mm bilateral and non-responsive to light, no apparent respirations by visualization and auscultation, no audible heart sounds, and several minutes of asystole on the bedside monitor.
Chief cause of death was respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure.
