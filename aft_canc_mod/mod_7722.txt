Cryptosporidium/Giardia (DFA) (Final [**2138-9-29**]):  NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; please refer to the report from chest CTA performed on the same day.
CTA Chest, CT A/P: FINDINGS: CHEST CTA: Enhanced pulmonary vasculature demonstrates multiple bilateral filling defects consistent with acute pulmonary emboli involving most lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries with relative sparing of the left upper lobe branches.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is mild bibasilar atelectasis, but the lungs are without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
A tiny granuloma is noted in the right apex (2:8).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver is diffusely hypodense suggestive of fatty replacement.
There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.
A calcified soft tissue mass is noted in the root of mesentery with irregular margins and finger-like projections.
The major venous structures appear patent though given the presence of mild mesenteric edema, venous compromise is likely present to some degree.
There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.
There are no lytic or sclerotic foci suspicious for malignancy.
Mild degenerative changes are visualized throughout the thoracolumbar spine with disc vacuum phenomenon at L5-S1.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Calcified mass in the root of small bowel mesentery measuring approximately 7.9 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm with tethering of adjacent small bowel.
Ddx includes carcinoid tumor vs chronic sclerosing mesenteritis, vs less likely amyloidosis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
A late systolic jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate to severe mid-systolic mitral regurgitation.
Mild elevation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
# Diarrhea/Vomiting: Given patient's immunosuppression, the differential diagnosis was broad.
Pt has mesenteric mass that may represent carcinoid tumor which can also manifest as diarrhea/tachycardia/mitral regurge murmur.
# Tachycardia: Etiology is likely multifactorial and includes ?carcinoid syndrome, tachycardia secondary to hypovolemic state in setting of diarrhea, PE induced sinus tachycardia.
Tachycardia improved with treatment of PE and was resolved by the time of discharge.
# Bilateral PEs: pt at risk given possible underlying malignancy.
Pt will remain on lovenox until after his mesenteric mass is excised.
# Mesenteric Mass: Surgery was consulted for excisional biopsy; however, it was decided to wait a few weeks to allow for PE clot burden to decrease.
# Transaminitis:  Admission transaminases were ALT 40, AST 90, [**Female First Name (un) **] 3.2.
It was felt that bilirubinemia (which was predominately indirect) could be related to atazanavir.
However, transaminases remained mildly elevated.
# Thrombocytopenia: PLT baseline 130-200s, was 90s on admission.
HIV is often associated with thrombocytopenia independently.
# Anemia: Initially with some suggestion of hemolysis (low hapto), however, hap to returned to [**Location 213**].
# Mitral Regurgitation: Pt with history of severe MR, confirmed on echo during this admission.
# HIV/AIDS: Has biopsy proven stage I-II kaposis sarcoma.
Transitional Issues: - PENDING labs - MMA, HHV8 viral load, urine histoplasma Ag, stool norovirus Ag, stool viral cutlure, blood cultures - will need outpt surgery eval for mass excision - will remain on lovenox until after excision, then should be transitioned to coumadin - all need [**Location (un) 2274**] onc f/u after mass is excised - will need further outpatient evaluation of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and transaminitis  Medications on Admission: Atazanavir 300mg emtricitabine-tenofovir (truvada) 200-300mg, daily Ritonavir (Norvir) 100mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
FoLIC Acid 1 mg PO DAILY RX *folic acid 1 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth daily Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diarrha, NOS Pulmonary Embolus Mesenteric Mass  Secondary HIV/AIDS   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea and a fast heart rate.
You had a CAT scan which showed blood clots in the lungs and a mass in your abdomen.
At the time of discharge, all of your stool studies were either negative or still pending.
However, this will not happen until after your mass is removed.
For your abdominal mass, you were seen by the surgeons and the oncologists.
After your mass is removed, you should also follow-up with the [**Location (un) 2274**] oncologists.
MEDICATION CHANGES - start lovenox for your blood clots - start vitamin B12 and folic acid - start atovaquone (to prevent pneumonia) - continue your HIV medications as you were taking them  *** You were given a short supply of the Lovenox and atovaquone until your mail order medications arrive.
