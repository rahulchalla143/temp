[**MD Number(1) 3795**]  HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT  ILLNESS:    This  is a 54-year-old gentleman,  who  was  recently  discharged  on  the  13th  of [**Month (only) **]  to  rehabilitation  with multiple medical problems, including  coronary  artery disease, status post [**Female First Name (un) 899**] in [**2115**], congestive  heart  failure with EF of 20% to 30%, status post pericardial  stripping,  prostatic mitral and tricuspid valve placement   in   [**Month (only) 205**],   [**2123**]   for   valve  dysfunction  and constriction  after radiation; ICD placement for nonsustained VT  and  low  ER  inducible  VT.
The  patient was admitted recently  with  shortness  of breath and pulmonary edema.
He had respiratory distress, which was felt to be multifactorial and  in part, due to MRSA pneumonia and CHF.
Cultures  were  negative except for sputum  with  MRSA.
Pleural effusion was tapped and it was transudative  with  on  evidence  of infection.
He has had a chronically  low  hematocrit, which is multifactorial.
He did have blood loss from the left  femoral  artery puncture site and required transfusion, bronchitic support, and blood loss anemia.
His chest x-ray showed CHF versus ARDS.
He developed a fever to  101.2.
He notes increased sputum production, but no dyspnea or chest pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post inferior myocardial infarction  [**2114**]  complicated  by  left ventricular thrombus, status post left circumflex stent in [**2123-4-1**].
Congestive heart failure.
History  of cerebrovascular accident with residual left finger numbness.
History of Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 27, status post radiation and splenectomy.
History of cervical diskectomy.
Constrictive pericarditis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:  The patient is resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress.
Extraocular  muscles  are intact; anicteric sclerae.
LUNGS:  Coarse sounds  throughout;  no  wheezes or rhonchi.
EXTREMITIES:    Positive  pitting of the lower extremities of thigh,  pitting  edema  in  the  arm,  markedly improved from previous  hospitalization.
There was a well healed scar of the  left arm, PIC in the right arm.
Decubitus  on  sacrum  mildly erythematous without obvious drainage.
The  last echocardiogram revealed an EF of 25 to 35%   with   normal   valve   function;  severe  global  left ventricular hypokinesis; mild right ventricular dilation.
HOSPITAL  COURSE:    Mr. [**Known lastname **] was treated simultaneously for infectious pneumonic process, as well as congestive heart failure.
For pneumonia he had initially received Vancomycin, and  the  Zosyn.
He was initially tried  on  Milrinone,  but  failed secondary to hypertension.
Sputum  eventually showed polys with no organisms,  but  grew  out  a  fairly  resistant Serratia and Klebsiella   and  was  started  on  Imipenem.
There was an episode  of  acute  renal  failure during the week of [**11-10**],  probably secondary to hypotension after failed attempt to  wean  Dopamine in conjunction with oncotic support in the form  of  packed  red  blood cells and Lasix.
Access  had  been  a  difficult  issue secondary to extensive bleeding  in  the  femoral  region  in  the  past.
Right internal jugular complicated  by  arterial  puncture  and a PICC line had been placed in the right arm, which is functioning at this point.
The  patient  was  placed back on pressor support ventilation and improved significantly in terms of his mental status.
Cardiovascular:    The  patient  is status post multiple  inotropic  trials  to  improve cardiac function and diurese both left and right side fluid overload.
The  most successful of these regimens has been a combination of  dobutamine  and  Lasix.
In  terms  of his tricuspid and mitral valve replacement, the patient  was  initially  on Coumadin, which had been stopped, however,  his  INR  continued  to  take  a  long to drip down secondary  to  poor  nutrition.
There was  moderate  bleeding from the trach-site.
During  this admission  grew Klebsiella and Serratia sensitive to Imipenem and  Bactrim.
The patient developed a rash to Imipenem and was  started  on  Bactrim.
The patient developed a rash to Imipenem.
However, this was  stopped  in  the  setting of acute renal failure for the worry  of  possible  interstitial  nephritis.
Chest CT was performed on the [**11-19**]  to  help  characterize  the  degree  and  extent  of pulmonary  disease.
The CT was notable for consolidation and interstitial disease, which was central sparing the periphery consistent the primary pulmonary process.
No significant CHF was seen in the periphery.
The patient had sensitive renal function.
His renal function was very sensitive to blood pressures below 70 to  80, causing acute renal failure with an ATN type picture.
ISSUE  #4:    Endocrinological:    From  an  endocrinological standpoint  he  has a history of hypothyroidism; TSH has been relatively  high  and  consistent  with hypothyroidism in the setting  of  systemic  illness.
The patient was received tube feeds  through  his  PEG, however, due to increased agitation and  abdominal distention in the absence of clear obstruction or  perforation, his tube feeds were stopped in favor or TPN.
The mechanical ventilation was restarted  with  progressive  clearing  of his mental status.
There was no evidence of CO2 narcosis.
However, hypoxia is a significant  possibility  for  cause of mental status changes during    independent   ventilation.
The patient has been placed on  a  proton pump inhibitor and had an elevated INR for much of  his  hospitalization, but recently this has been reversed as described, and the patient has been Heparinized.
