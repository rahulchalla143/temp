He has been having a constant, bilaterally frontal throbbing headache for about 1 week which has been worsening for the last three days.
His headache is worsened by movement and walking and ameliorated by staying still and laying down.
Ibuprofen and hydromorphone also improve his headache but do not completely make it dissapear.
He describes his pain as [**9-13**] on the pain scale.
When the patient arrived home from XRT he started to get confused and does not remember a couple of hours while he was in his bedroom.
The patient woke up in his bed and denies any tongue biting, numbness or paralysis of limbs, or funny smells.
The patient has received radiation in the past for lung cancer and Day 1 currently of his radiation regimen, however he never experienced such severe headache, syncope or amnesia before.
Previous Chemotherapy: -Completed courses of cisplatin and etoposide concurrently with radiation therapy on [**2195-12-14**] and ending [**2195-12-28**]; of note, just prior to starting therapy, he was found to have a large left pleural effusion with cytology positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, indicating the presence of Stage IV disease.
An MRI revealed innumerable enhancing lesions within the supra- and infra tentorium of the brain as well as at least one lesion within the left frontal calvarium and an additional lesion within the upper spinal cord.
Many punctate lesions appeared to be present within the cortical sulci.
In addition, he had enhancement along the sulci, brainstem internal auditory canals, and trigeminal nerve  - consistent with leptomeningeal metastases.
He has had no other opportunistic infections.

Imaging: [**7-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: 1) Significant interval increase in opacification of the left hemithorax likely representing combination of right pleural effusion, underlying partial collapse of the left lung.
Left upper lobe/suprahilar spiculated opacity likely represents patient's known mass, lymphadenopathy and fluid, better evaluated on CT. .
[**7-28**] CT-Head with contrast: IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
Stable appearance of innumerable enhancing lesions within the supra and infratentorial brain as well as at least one lesion within the left frontal calvarium consistent with metastatic disease.
Stable enhancement along the sulci, brainstem, internal auditory canals, and trigeminal nerves, consistent with leptomeningeal spread of disease.
No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
[**7-29**] EEG: MPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to two regions of focal slowing seen in the right posterior quadrant and left posterior temporal regions independently.
These abnormalities are suggestive of subcortical lesions in these areas.
There were no epileptiform abnormalities noted.
[**8-2**] Cytology: Cerebrospinal fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
[**8-5**] CT-Head without Contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
Stable right frontal hypodensity, most suggestive of metastasis with vasogenic edema.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Widely patent head and neck arteries.
Incompletely evaluated pleural and parenchymal disease in the left upper lobe most likely representing sequelae of the known lung cancer.
[**8-11**] EEG: MPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the persistent left frontal focal delta slowing.
This suggests a focal structural abnormality in the left anterior quadrant.
The background rhythm was otherwise well maintained posteriorly, and there were no epileptiform features.
No acute intracranial pathology.
Stable right frontal hypodensity, compatible with edema from known metastatic disease at this site.
[**8-13**] CT-Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, and no change from [**2196-8-11**].
Stable right frontal hypodensity, reflecting vasogenic edema from known metastatic lesion at this site.
[**8-15**] CXR: There is interval increase in left pleural effusion which is currently large and is most likely combined with a known advanced lung cancer within the left lung.
Only minimal apical portion of the left lung continues to be aerated.
The right lung is essentially clear with no evidence of right pleural effusion.
[**8-15**] CT-Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
MRI is more sensitive for evaluating for metastatic disease.
Extensive opacification involving the left hemithorax is essentially unchanged, consistent with the known advanced lung cancer and associated effusion and atelectasis.
There is only a small amount of the apical portion of the left lung continues to be aerated.
[**8-17**] CXR: Increased rightward mass effect on mediastinal structures compared to two days prior suggests interval increase in left pleural effusion.
[**8-12**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-7-28**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
[**8-31**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary & Formulation on Presentation, [**2196-7-28**]: 40 yoM with HIV, metastatic lung CA with brain metastases, s/p first whole brain radiation treatment, now with nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, amnesia, and a syncopal episode prior to admission.
# Headache/nausea/vomiting/confusion/amnesia/syncope - After an extensive work-up including multiple CT-scans of the head with and without contrast, MRI of the head with contrast, EEG x 3, and LP x 2 - both of which revealed elevated ICP and were palliative for the patient's headache, and the first of which grew out negative cultures and demonstrated malignant cells - neurology diagnosed the patient's constellation of symptoms to be caused by progressive metastatic leptomeningeal lung metastases in the setting of whole-brain XRT-associated cerebral edema; seizure and stroke were ruled out.
Dexamethasone was also started and continued to treat cerebral edema in the setting of ongoing whole brain radiation.
# Progressive decline in cognitive function - Over the course of the hospitalization, the patient suffered a stroke-like episode thought to be caused by leptomeningeal disease.
This episode precipitated a number of tests described above, which ultimately pointed to the diagnosis of progressive leptomeningeal metastatic lung cancer.
Following this episode, after which the patient recovered some function, the patient's cognitive function precipitously and progressively declined, presumably due to the natural history of leptomeningeal metastatic lung cancer and due to superimposed cerebral edema caused by what was at the time ongoing daily whole brain radiation as well as superimposed hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, itself caused potentially by pain or some other unclear etiology.
The patient's mental status waxed and waned after the initial stroke-like episode, but overall, his mental status has steadily declined - he is now inconsistently oriented to person, place, and time, unable to concentrate, and intermittently visually hallucinating; he has also developed intermittent, sporadic ballistic movements and change in voice.
# Leptomeningeal metastatic lung cancer: The patient received 13 out of 15 daily scheduled whole brain radiation treatments in conjunction with daily dexamethasone for cerebral edema.
# Transient unresponsiveness - On [**2196-8-14**] the patient was found unresponsive on the floor and was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He developed hyponatremia while in the ICU, which was likely secondary to his malignancy.
# Non-traumatic falls - On several occasions during the hospitalization, the patient was found on the floor by his bed; none of these episodes resulted in any trauma.
# Hyponatremia - Analysis of serum and urine osmolality in the setting of euovolemia pointed to a diagnosis of SIADH.
# Pleural Effusion - Presumed to be a malignant pleural effusion, since it has been a recurring chronic problem.
Patient had thrush detected on [**8-2**] and was treated by nystatin swish and swallow.
# Bacteremia - The patient had gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters growing in his blood early in the hospitalization; it most likely was a contaminant because of only one positive culture and no signs of clinical infection, Vancomycin was started and discontinued on [**8-2**].
# C.Dif - The patient developed loose stool over the course of the hospitalization, was placed on contact precautions and started empirically on oral flagyl, which was subsequently discontinued after cultures were negative for C.Dif.
# MRSA - Found to be MRSA negative.

You were brought to the hospital because of a chronic severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and memory loss after you had started whole brain radiation treatment for known metastatic lung cancer in your brain.
We carried out imaging tests to assess your brain tumors and you were seen by the neurology physicians, who believed that your chronic symptoms as well as your acute episode of right sided weakness early in your hospitalization course may have been caused by seizures or stroke.
You were started on medications to prevent seizure and reduce the brain swelling normally caused by whole brain radiation.
Your symptoms improved on these medications as well as analgesics and they improved further after the neurology physicians drained fluid from around your brain on two occasions.
After evaluating you extensively, reviewing the brain image, and observing your brain's electrical activity, the neurology physicians determined that your symptoms were not caused by seizures or stroke and that they were most likely caused by the progressing metastatic lung tumors in your brain.
