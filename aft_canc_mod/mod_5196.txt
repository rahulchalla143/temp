Admission Date:  [**2169-5-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-10-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: Left adnexal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparoscopy converted to laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, dissection of intraperitoneal cyst, left salpingo-oophorectomy.
History of Present Illness: 70 year old woman referred to gyn oncology by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22552**] secondary to a recent discovery of a left adnexal mass.
The patient had complained of persistent lower abdominal pain, and CT of the abdomen was done at [**Hospital3 4107**] which revealed mild ascites and a 5 cm left adnexal cyst.
There was a calcification noted on the margin of the cyst.
She also underwent an MRI of the pelvis, which suggested that the 5-cm cystic mass may be arising from the uterine fundus, possibly representing a cystic degenerating exophytic leiomyoma.
She had a few lab abnormalities that were concerning for malignancy: namely a CA 125 up to 106, anemia with a hematocrit of 30, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count in the 800,000 range.
After discussing her options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**], the decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for difinitive diagnosis of this mass.
The plan was made for a laparoscopic approach, although conversion to laparotomy was felt to be a high risk given her previous surgeries.
Early in [**2169**], she had a persistent common bile duct stone that caused right upper quadrant discomfort and it was removed via ERCP.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  15 years ago, she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
3 years ago, she had an appendectomy with return to the OR 3 days later for lysis of adhesions.
2 years ago, she had a diagnostic hysteroscopy for post-menopausal bleeding which revealed only atrophy.
She has no history of fibroids, pelvic infections or abnormal Pap smears.
NECK:  Supple, no masses.
BACK:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, well-healed incisions are noted all over the abdomen.
There is no evidence of herniation with Valsalva.
GROIN:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Vagina reveals no masses or lesions.
Cervix reveals no mass or lesion.
There is no cervical motion tenderness.
Uterus is normal in size and consistency, and there is no palpable adnexal mass today.
There is no rectal mass on exam.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Small foci of airspace opacity in the lingula and right middle lobe, which are concerning for infection.
No evidence of acute blood products within the abdomen.
Inflammatory stranding, and intraperitoneal air in the mid abdomen, with no discrete abscess.
This intraperitoneal air is likely due to postoperative status, though in this patient with known enterostomy, extravasated air from the bowel cannot be excluded.
Extremely thinned fascia in the mid abdomen with pockets of air on both sides in both the subcutaneous tissue and intraperitoneally.
No definite evidence of dehiscence.
Enhancement of the peritoneal lining associated with the ascites is a nonspecific finding, but can be seen in intra-abdominal infection.
There is severe global  left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Increased intraperitoneal fluid compared to a few days prior with successful placement of 2 pigtail catheters, one right sided and one left sided, without complication.
Thrombosis within left gonadal vein 3.
30-mm left omental soft tissue density may represent a focus of heaped omentum in the setting of copious ascites, though malignant omental caking cannot be completely excluded.
Decreased free intra-abdominal air with a few small foci persisting.
Persistent subcutaneous emphysema without definite location of the site of patient's enterocutaneous fistula.
29 x 24 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Persistent large pleural effusions.

REPORT TO: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  DIAGNOSIS: Peritoneal washings:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
The procedure was complicated by a small enterostomy which was repaired.
The patient's post-operative course was complicated by development of an entero-cutaneous fistula, post-operative CHF, post-operative acute renal failure, and bacteremia.
She was in the ICU from [**5-18**] - [**5-21**] due to Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia, CHF, and hypoxia requiring intubation, and again from [**Date range (1) 17331**] for a second CHF exacerbation.
Her course is summarized below by issue:  # CHF, systolic - as noted above the patient was intubated and in acut eresp failure from CHF.
ECHO done revealed poor EF and wall motion abnormalities, concerning for CAD.
This may be arranged by PCP or cardiologist.
# Multifocal strial tachycardia/NSVT - was noted on telemetry.
# Sepsis from serratia bacteremia - this was treated with flagyl/cipro/vanco for a total of 2 weeks - through to [**2169-6-5**].
Fluconazole was given as well for fungal UTI and course completed.
Another CT abdomen did not reveal occult abscesses.
Per patient and on talking with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 22552**] (PCP) - had a borderlie high WBC that he has been following up since [**December 2168**], usually around 12K.
# EC fistula - Gyn onc followed patient here and out-patient follow up was arranged for at discharge with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 71662**].
The ovarian cyst was [**Last Name (un) 17066**] on pathology and cytology of ascitis fluid was positive for atypical cells.
# Malnutrition - Given albumin of 1.8 - the patient was severely malnpurished esp with the many medical issues.
she was started on TPN due to poor po intake while here.
she is advised to follow up PCP for weekly weight checks to ensure she is not loosing wt in which case she may need a nutritionist evaluation or alternative source of supplement feeding.
# Anemia: likely due to chronic disease.
# AAA - seen incidentally on imaging and a follow up US/CT should be arranged for at the discretion of the PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 6 months.
