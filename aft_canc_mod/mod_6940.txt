She came to the ED today because she had not appetite and felt generally weak and ill. One week prior to admission she noticed loose to liquid tan colored, large volume ostomy output.
A CT abdomen with contrast showed no obstruction or small bowel problem (though it did show a possible sacral mass).
She denies fevers, chills, nightsweats, nausea and vomiting.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.9 Hr 97 BP 68/42 RR 20 SaO2 97% (delivery method not recorded) she triggered for hypotension and was given 4L IVNS.
FeNa was 0.3%, Renal u/s showed no hydronephrosis or stones, CT abdomen showed dialated loops of fluid filled bowel unchanged from [**2143-11-29**], consistent with mild chronic obstruction.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Mildly dilated loops of small bowel in the right lower abdomen with normal caliber distal small bowel, may suggest early/ partial small bowel obstruction.
Soft tissue seen in the presacral region, may represent post surgical/radiation fibrosis, but recurrent tumor not excluded.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2143-12-15**])- Multiple loops of fluid-filled dilated small bowel, slighty progressed since the [**2143-12-9**] examination, tapering somewhat near an area of surgical scar/remnant tissue at the rectal bed, concerning for partial small bowel obstruction secondary to presacral soft tissue to which the bowel appears adherent.
This tissue may be due to prior post-operative change and radiation fibrosis although recurrent tumor is not excluded.
No secondary signs of ischemia are present.
There are no focal fluid collections.

#Hypovolemic shock: Likely etiology thought to be acute gastroenteritis.
#Diarrhea: Acute infectious gastroenteritis was  suspected initially and patient was started empirically on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
In addition, negative x 1 for c.difficile and ova and parasites.
With finding of blood in stool and hematocrit drop (see below),  it is possible that increased output from ostomy was secondary to the cathartic effects of blood, and once acute bleed stopped, output slowed.
#Probable acute blood loss anemia: Patient had a hematocrit drop from last ED visit on [**2143-12-9**] (36.8) to [**2143-12-15**] (33.8) and dropped even further with fluid resuscitation to 27.0.
Gastroenterology was consulted and did an upper endoscopy which was notable for friable mucosa throughout the stomach and duodenum consistent with gastritis and duodenitis, in addition to two polyps which were biopsied.
No ulcerations or specific sites of bleeding were noted.
She was also instructed to notify her outpatient providers if she has recurrence of increased stool output or has any symptoms of dehydration or pre-syncope.
#Acute renal failure: Appeared to be prerenal azotemia in the setting of hypovolemia from large volume output.
Creatinine also improved with fluid resuscitation, returning from peak of 5.9 to baseline of 1.1 and remaining stable thereafter.
#Hyperkalemia: Initially 6.1 and improved to 4.7 with volume resucitation as her prerenal azotemia improved.
EKG showed no pr shortening or significant tenting of the t waves; no qrs widening.
#Soft tissue mass in the presacral region with adherent bowel based on CT with oral contrast from [**2143-12-9**] and [**2142-12-16**]: Primary surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], suggested a PET CT for definitive evaluation.
Home lisinopril 20mg daily held at the time of discharge given normal blood pressure and recent acute kidney injury with plan for patient to restart at the discretion of PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] appointment.
#Peripheral neuropathy secondary to spondylosis: Dose adjusted for renal failure initially, then changed back to home dose gabapentin 200mg TID prior to discharge.
With findings of gastritis on EGD, pantoprazole was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
#Transitional issues: [] PET/CT to evaluate presacral tissue mass with adherent bowel [] ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to be continued through [**2143-12-20**] [] lisinopril held at time of discharge given recent [**Last Name (un) **] and normotension [] Endoscopy biopsy results pending [] Blood culture final results pending [] H.pylori pending [] Consider outpatient capsule study for evaluation of small bowel to continue anemia work-up [] Patient scheduled for f/u with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and surgery  Medications on Admission: -Lipitor 20 mg Daily -Lisinopril 20 mg Tab Daily -Neurontin 200 mg TID -Methimazole 5 mg Daily -Protonix 40 mg Daily -Aspirin 81 mg Daily -Tylenol Arthritis 650 mg (dose uncertain) -Lorazepam 1 mg Daily prn -Lomotil 2.5 mg-0.025 mg Tab 2 Tablet(s) by mouth qid prn -Centrum Silver Daily -Calcium+D 400 mg -133.3 unit Tab   Discharge Medications: 1. atorvastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Gastritis 2.
Anemia 3.
Acute Renal Failure 5.
Ulcerative colitis s/p colectomy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of increased output from your ostomy.
You were treated for potential bacterial infection in your GI tract with two antibiotics.
In addition, you had a drop in your blood counts and were found to have blood in your stool.
The gastroenterologists did an exam of your esophagus and stomach and found irritation of the lining in your stomach.
Also, you have a blood test pending to look for an infection in your stomach that could be causing the irritation and bleeding called H.pylori, you should discuss this result with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at your follow up appointment.
A CT scan of your abdomen noted a new mass in your abdomen, which is likely related to past radiation.
