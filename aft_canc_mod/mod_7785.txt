He got DDAVP for plts of 65 in setting of liver failure.
He never became tachycardic.
He received the beginning of a blood transfusion on the floor but became hypothermic and developed rigors.
He has HCC [**2-14**] hepatitis C complicated by esophageal varices s/p banding, anemia requiring transfusion, portal gastropathy, and ascites requiring intermittent paracenteses.
He had stopped his chemo at that time due to an admission for a GI bleed.
He had banding of a non actively bleeding variceal bleed at that time.
All bladder discomfort and rigors has resolved.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx: -[**2150-11-19**]: resection of 4x4x3.8cm liver lesion in segment 5.
Pathology consistent with HCC.
No lymphovascular invasion -[**2151-5-20**]: resection of 1.8cm lesion in segment 5 -[**2152-2-14**]: chemoembolization of a branch of right hepatic artery with taxotere and embospheres for two right lobe lesions measuring 1.5 and 0.5 cm along with microwave ablation of the 1.5cm lesion -had been on transplant list when MRI [**2152-8-11**] showed 2.4 x 4.3cm lesion in segment 8 and thrombosis of a portal vein branch.
Underwent biopsy of the lesion which revealed a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor embolus in the portal vein branch.
However, pt had anemia (despite d/c-ing internferon and ribavarin), making him ineligible from study -began radiation in [**11/2152**] and finished 01/[**2153**].
Episodes of anemia secondary to GI bleeding.
EGD and colonoscopy performed, revealing esophageal varices, hemorrhoids and mild portal gastropathy.

Large volume intra-abdominal ascites.
Negative for above-knee DVT bilaterally.
Mild perinephric stranding adjacent to the left kidney, most likely from recent percutaneous biopsy.
A small hyperdense focus in the posterior aspect of the left kidney likely represents a tiny hematoma.
Hyperdense blood within the left collecting system, including the proximal ureter, with no evidence of obstruction.
There is a large amount of blood and clot within the bladder.
There is no large hematoma outside of the collecting system.
Massive abdominal ascites.
Multiple irregular hypodensities within the liver, incompletely characterized on this non-contrast enhanced study, compatible with multifocal HCC, better seen on prior reference imaging studies.
Mediastinal and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy.
Colonic diverticulosis.
[**2153-3-21**] Kidney biopsy: ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE FOR RENAL BIOPSY BY NEPHROLOGIST: Ultrasound examination of the kidneys was performed.
The lower pole of the left kidney was identified and the position was marked on the patient's back for renal biopsy to be performed by the nephrologist.
No pleural abnormality.
Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
[**2153-3-26**] Peritoneal Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2153-3-26**] Paracentesis: IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis of 3 liters of serous fluid.
Unchanged hyperdense focus in the posterior left kidney, consistent with a small subcapsular hematoma.
Decreased amount of hyperdense blood and clot both within the proximal left collecting system and the bladder.
No hematoma is seen outside of the collecting system.
Large amount of abdominal ascites.
Incompletely characterized irregular hypodensities within the liver consistent with the patient's known multifocal HCC.
Brief Hospital Course: 63-year-old male with hep C cirrhosis and HCC with new onset acute renal failure and transferred to the unit for GU bleed after left renal biopsy.
# Acute renal failure: Cr was elevated on admission to 11.9 from baseline 0.9.
Renal was consulted and advised dialysis as well as a kidney biopsy.
His lasix was held given his acute renal failure and hypotension.
Renal ultrasound showed enlarged prostate and large amount of ascites but normal kidneys.
Initially, it was felt that his acute renal failure was secondary to sorafenib induced nephrotoxicity.
However, the kidney biopsy light microscopy showed mesangial proliferative GN.
There were no thrombi in the microvasculature to make deifinite diagnosis of a TMA to implicate the sorafenib.
SPEP showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and UPEP showed no monoclonal IG and was negative for bence [**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins.
Preliminary biopsy results were suspicious for fibrillary glomerulonephritis.
# GU bleed s/p kidney biopsy: Pt underwent kidney biopsy on [**2153-3-21**] that was complicated by gross hematuria.
CT abdomen showed perinephric stranding adjacent to the left kidney, most likely from recent percutaneous biopsy, a small hematoma in left kidney, and blood in the collecting system and bladder.
Repeat CT abdomen showed that small hematoma in kidney was stable.
He no longer had hematuria at discharge and was able to urinate without a foley.
Per transfusion medicine, this was likely not a febrile non-hemoltyic transfusion reaction given the short duration of his symptoms, no subsequent fever and that leukoreduction significantly decreases the risk of these reactions.
He experienced no adverse reactions from his subsequent transfusions.
# Hypotension: BP at admission was systolic 80s.
He later became hypotensive to systolic 70s following hematuria after a kidney biopsy and hemodialysis.
Pt also with mild hyperthermia to 95 concerning also for infection on admission.
Patient started on CTX 2gm Q24hrs x2 days for possible SBP, but was dicscontinued [**3-23**] as likelihood of SBP felt to be very small with no abdominal pain, normal WBC and no fevers.
Peritoneal fluid showed no signs of infection.
On admission he endorsed some calf pain as well.
B/l LENIs were obtained, which were negative for DVT.
# Hepatocellular carcinoma: Pt was s/p sorafenib [**2153-1-22**] to [**2153-3-6**].
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute renal failure  Secondary: Hepatocellular carcinoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with acute kidney failure.
The severity of your kidney failure required several sessions of hemodialysis.
Your blood pressure recovered and the bleeding in the urine stopped.
2) STOP aldactone.
