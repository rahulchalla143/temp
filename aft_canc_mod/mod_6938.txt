A couple of years later he developed left shoulder pain and further testing indicated he had MM and he was started on treatment with Velcade and completed four cycles.
The only complication he developed from this treatment was lower extremity neuropathy which he feels as pins and needles and numbness with some tnederenss of the feet.
He was then found to have a lesion on a rib on a cxr following his velcade regimens.
His last BM showed no morphological evidence of a plasma cell myeloma and his last protein electrophoresis performed on [**Month (only) 116**] 29was negative for an M spike.
He reports that he has a heat rash on his chest afer all of the heat recently.
He also reports some dry skin, but no other skin changes or skin breakdown or lesions on his feet.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 61 yo M w/ PMH of multiple myeloma s/p velcade treatment who was admitted for high dose melphalan and auto stem cell transplant complicated by neutropenic fever and atrial tachycardia requiring ICU stay.
He developed high grade mucositis and required TPN for nutrition during this time and IV pain medication.
#Neutropenic fever- patient developed neutropenic fevers on Day +4 with fevers to 104 despite broad spectrum antibiotics.
He had imaging of his sinuses and chest given cough and sinus symptoms and was found to have a sinusitis.

He remained hemodynamically stable and chest pain free despite the tachycardia.
He was transitioned from the drips to PO amiodarone and diltiazem without recurrence of the tachycardia.
Of note, he had a few episodes of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation while in the ICU (pt has known h/o Afib status post ablation).
He had no recurrence of the tachycardia on the oral medications.
#Neuropathy- patient has peripheral neuropathy following his velcade treatment.
# Diarrhea: Thought to be due to melphalan.
tablet PO BID Disp:*50 tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple myeloma- autologous stem cell transplant Sinusitis Atrial tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You underwent this and had some fevers and were found to have a sinus infection while you were here and treated with IV antibiotics while your counts were low.
