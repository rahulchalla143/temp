His BP remained low in spite of the steroids and IVF, so he had a right IJ placed, and was started on noriepinephrine.
His foley was replaced in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG showed lateral ST depressions, a CXR with no acute process and had a head CT with interval improvement, and felt that there was no intervention needed from their service at this time.

Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM Tm/Tc 98.5/96.5  BP 136/54 (116-136/40-62)  P 70 (57-70)  R 18 Sat 94%RA I/O: 24h: 1315/1600 Physical exam: GEN: No acute distress, arousable and answers questions.
AAOx2 HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, no lesions noted NECK: No cervical LAD.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] PULM: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
ABD: Soft, tender in epigastric and periumbilical regions, non distended, bowel sounds present.
No rebound or guarding, no organomegaly.
SKIN: Vesicular rash noted on right flank from midline of abdomen to center of back.
Pertinent Results: CT head [**9-26**]- FINDINGS: Since the prior CT, there has been significant resolution of the biopsy-related hemorrhage within the right basal ganglia/insular mass.
There is now a slightly hyperdense appearance to the periphery of this mass which measures 2.0 x 2.3 cm and is seen on series 2, image 19.
Associated vasogenic edema is noted though there is no significant mass effect or shift of midline structures.
There is no new hemorrhage.
The known additional masses (right temporal lobe and right thalamic lesions) as seen on MR are not clearly seen on this study.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity suggests chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no associated soft tissue emphysema or fluid collection.
The dense calcification at the left quadrigeminal cistern appears unchanged.

Patient felt to be too poor a performance status for chemotherapy.
# Infection/Hypotension: given grossly positive U/A, likely urosepsis causing change in his mental status, baseline mental status not clear, however is alert and interactive, oriented X [**2-6**].
Pt is on vancomycin and gentamicin given possible anaphylactic reaction to penicillin.
Patient was also found to have findings suspicious for pneumonia on chest x-ray.
# NSTEMI: Pt had a concerning EKG with ST depressions with positive cardiac enzymes that have continued to climb.
Echo showed EF of 40%, moderate septal hypokinesis, mild anterior wall and apical hypokinesis, mild aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
# Shingles: On day of discharge, patient noted to have zoster rash on right flank.
# Hyponatremia: Given that pt seemed hypervolemic/euvolemic on exam, possibly [**3-8**] SIADH given GBM.
However, could be an early salt wasting syndrome, or developing congestive heart failure, although echocardiogram findings argued against that.

The cause of thrombocytopenia was unknown.
