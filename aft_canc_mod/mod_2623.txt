This occurred in the setting of severe right hallux pain from an ulcer related to his Buerger's disease; he had treated himself with up to 15 tablets of ibuprofen per day for approximately 1-2 weeks when he went to see his podiatrist who felt he was quite ill and advised him to report to the ED.
At the OSH, he was found to be hypotensive, hypoxic, profoundly acidemic (ph 6.9), and in acute renal failure.
[**Name (NI) **] has a heavy smoking history but recently quit (about 1 month prior to admission).

)Acute renal failure -- In reviewing the clinical history, urine sediment, FeNa, and rapid response to fluid hydration, Mr. [**Known lastname 3527**] acute renal failure was most likely from severe volume depletion and NSAID abuse.
The possibility of ATN was entertained, given the severity of the renal function decrement and exorbitant NSAID use, but given the rapid response to fluids, this appeared less likely.
)Anion gap metabolic acidosis -- With his highly elevated BUN and Cr, this was felt to be a uremic acidosis.
)Hypotension -- Without an elevated lactate, fever, tachycardia, ECG changes, or persistently elevated cardiac enzymes, Mr. [**Known lastname 3527**] hypotension was attributed to severe volume depletion, corroborated by his excellent reponse to hydration.
)Leukocytosis -- With an otherwise negative ID work-up, this lab finding was felt to be due to both severe hemoconcentration and, potentially, a C. difficile infection, as described below.
[**Known lastname 3517**] has a history of essential thrombocytosis and has been intermittently followed by a hematologist as an outpatient.
The acute elevation, up to 1000, was probably due to an acute phase reaction; once this resolved, his platelet count declined but still remained slightly elevated.
Podiatry was evaluated for a possible paronychial infection, which they agreed with; they debrided the ulcer and drained the pus from around the nail, providing significant relief.
