HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old man with a history of nonHodgkin's lymphoma, status post six cycles of CHOP treatment and radiation treatment completed six months ago with "some type of heart involvement", here status post development of chest pain radiating to the neck while watching television the night prior to admission.
The patient's pain was nine out of ten and decreased to one out of ten with Nitroglycerin paste.
The patient was given Aspirin, 5 mg intravenous Nitroglycerin, and he ruled in for myocardial infarction and was given a 2B 3A.
The morning of admission to the CCU the patient's chest pain escalated to two out of ten with frequent premature ventricular contractions.
The patient also had an eight beat run of ventricular tachycardia and was taken for cardiac catheterization the morning of admission to the CCU.
The patient was held in the CCU for observation and to rule out cardiogenic shock.
He also has a chronic left lower extremity ulcer which began two months prior to admission.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He quit the day that his chest pain began.
General appearance - The patient is a well appearing disheveled male in no apparent distress.
The neck revealed no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
He had a strong dorsalis pedis pulse and weaker tibial pulse.
The left lower extremity had cellulitis with erythema, edema, discoloration and serosanguinous drainage.
Skin - slight maculopapular rash on the trunk and face thought to be secondary to Dicloxacillin.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in V1 through V4.
There were no signs of hypertrophy.
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate, effusion or pneumothorax.
The patient's catheterization results showed moderately increased filling pressures, depressed cardiac index.
Left ventriculography was not performed secondary to his acute myocardial infarction.
The left anterior descending had 100% proximal lesion with extensive calcifications throughout.
The left circumflex was dominant with mild luminal irregularities throughout.
There is 60% stenosis of the left posterior descending artery.
The right coronary artery was nondominant and provided some collateral to the distal left anterior descending.
There was left anterior descending occlusion which was crossed with moderate difficulty and express stent placed at the mid left anterior descending.
An echocardiogram was performed to assess his left ventricular function which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 30 to 35% with septal, apical and anterior akinesis.
For his rhythm, the patient had one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia the day after his myocardial infarction, however, after that, the telemetry strips were unremarkable.
Pulmonary - The patient had no issues.
Hematology - In terms of his hematology/oncology issues with his nonHodgkin's lymphoma, his outside records were obtained from [**Hospital6 1129**] which showed that he had had no recurrences in his lymphoma over the past year and there were no records of cardiac involvement with the lymphoma.
The patient also was switched from Dicloxacillin to Clindamycin and Levaquin for his left lower extremity cellulitis.
However, the cellulitis began to worsen with increased serosanguinous drainage, more petechial rash developing, streaking up the left lower extremity past the original delineation of the cellulitis.
In addition, his maculopapular rash continued to worsen with Clindamycin and Levaquin and it was suspected that he may be allergic to either Clindamycin, Levaquin, Lipitor or Captopril.
Therefore, he was switched from Captopril to Lisinopril and infectious disease and dermatology and vascular consultations were obtained.
Otherwise for prophylaxis, the patient was given [**Last Name (un) 6877**] Lotion, Hydroxyzine, Benadryl and Zantac for itching, Colace to prevent constipation, Protonix 40 mg once daily to prevent gastrointestinal ulceration and he was maintained on Integrilin, Heparin, and subsequently Aspirin and Plavix and then subcutaneous Heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis formation.
