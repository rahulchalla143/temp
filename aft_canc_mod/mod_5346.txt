Admission Date:  [**2189-6-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2163-7-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Bactrim / Pentamidine Isethionate / Vancomycin Hcl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none (chest tube placed at OSH) Intubation,  A line placement   History of Present Illness: 25 male with AML s/p BMT in [**2187**], GVHD, recent PTX medically managed, presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hosp from [**Hospital1 **] [**2189-6-30**] with SOB, N/V, and an enlarged hydropneumothorax.
He noted the onset of shortness of breath yesterday at rest, was hypoxic, and found to have a larger pneumothorax.
He has not had recent f/c, though has been vomiting daily.
His immunosuppression was recently decreased due to voriconazole.
CXR from 1 am showed increased left pneumothorax.
He was brought to the CCU for further management of his chest tube.
Review of Systems: Nausea and vomiting, rash on left leg, poor appetite, decreased energy.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Gen- Cachectic, pale, ill appearing male, uncomfortable Heent- MMdry, blood in mouth and nares, anicteric Neck- supple, no LAD Cor- tachy, regular, s1,s2 Chest- breath sounds bilateral, rhonchorous anteriorly; chest tube draining serosanguinous fluid, no bleeding at site Abd- soft, tender at g tube site, no g/r.
Imaging CT Head [**2188-6-30**] - FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures or evidence of major territorial infarction is apparent.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is opacification of multiple ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses consistent with inflammatory changes.
No acute intracranial abnormality detected.
Opacification of multiple ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses consistent with inflammatory changes.
FINDINGS: There is a mild-to-moderate left hydropneumothorax with a left-sided chest tube running along the lateral chest wall in an apical direction.
Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is noted likely reflective of atelectasis from overlying fluid.
Mild right basilar atelectasis is present.
There is no evidence of focal parenchymal infiltrate or pulmonary edema.
CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2189-7-2**]: TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest without administration of IV contrast.
A moderate left hydropneumothorax is similar in size to the [**2189-7-2**] chest radiograph.
Associated atelectasis is most pronounced at the left lower lobe; coronal reformats show a 3.7 cm ovoid extrapulmonary fluid collection contiguous with loculated pleural fluid laterally, probably a fibrin clot.
Vague ground-glass and centrilobular opacities, most pronounced in the right middle lobe, medial left upper lobe, and in dependent portions of both lower lobes, along with bronchial wall thickening, most pronounced in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, all reflect endobronchial infection.
A small volume of consolidation in the left lower lobe adjacent to the extraparenchymal loculated fluid is the only candidate for active pneumonia, and that could be atelectasis.
A small, layering, nonhemorrhagic, right pleural effusion is also present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No mediastinal lymph nodes are larger than an 8 mm precarinal node (4:90).
This study was not designed to examine the abdomen, however, no mass lesions are seen in the imaged portion of the liver, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, or pancreas.
There are no bone findings suspicious for malignancy or infection IMPRESSION: 1.
Minimal left lower lobe consolidation.
Mild, multifocal bronchitis and bronchiolitis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Motor responses of the left peroneal nerve, recording extensor digitorum brevis and tibialis anterior, were absent.
Motor NCSs of the left tibial nerve showed normal distal latency, moderate reduction of response amplitude, and mild slowing of conduction velocity.
Slow (3-Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation of the left ulnar nerve, recording abductor digiti minimi, showed no decremental response at baseline, immediately after 1 minute of maximal voluntary contraction, or at 1-minute intervals following maximal voluntary effort out to 5 minutes.
Slow (3-Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation of the left spinal accessory nerve, recording trapzeius, showed no decremental response at baseline, immediately after 1 minute of maximal voluntary contraction, or at 1-minute intervals following maximal voluntary out to 4 minutes, though the study was technically limited by movement.
Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the left vastus lateralis showed motor unit potentials (MUPs) of mildly short duration, small amplitude and increased polyphasia with early recruitment.
EMG of right vastus lateralis showed MUPs of mildly short duration, small amplitude and increased polyphasia with early recruitment.
EMG examination of the right deltoid showed a mixed population of normal MUPs and MUPs of mildly short duration, small amplitude and increased polyphasia with early recruitment.
The study was prematurely terminated due to the patient's increasing respiratory distress.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a mild, generalized myopathic process without denervating features, as can be seen in critical illness myopathy.
The findings also suggest the possibility of a mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy with predominantly axonal features.
There is no definite electrophysiologic evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, but the limited nature of the study precludes exclusion of this diagnostic possibility.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Though pt has no established history of lung disease, suspect that his hypercarbia has been a chronic issue.
His pco2 of 112 caused pH of only 7.29, and serum bicarb of 45, suggesting chronic process.
Possible causes of hypercarbia considered include sedation from meds--pt had been getting fentanyl, dilaudid and ativan; question of myopathy/neuromuscular disease (?
steroid myopathy or chemo-induced myopathy); and/or obstructive lung disease.
He was evaluated by neurology regarding question of neuro-muscular disease.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] PTX was treated w/ chest tube On [**2189-7-3**], pt noted to be increasingly tachypnic and fatigued.
Gas showed worsening hypercarbia (see results section).
CT chest was performed, which showed persistent hydro-pneumothorax as well as non-specific ground-glass opacities & tree & [**Male First Name (un) 239**] structures.
His pulonary physiology was consistent with severe obstructive process (high peak pressures, low plateaus, and auto-PEEP of ~13).
Pt does not have h/o reactive airway disease or COPD.
Question of GVHD related lung disease raised.
Infectious process also possible cause (?
Pt was started on linezolid and zosyn for coverage of possible PNA, though no clear infiltrate on CT.  # Pneumothorax:  No history of this before.
Small air leak noted.
Immunosuppresive medications were continued as were his prophylactive anti-biotics, atovaquone & voriconazole.
Hematology consulted for question of GVHD in lung.
# Pain: Low dose dilaudid and fentanyl patch.
He just finished a course of levo/flagyl for unclear reasons, and no cultures were positive there.
Here his bld cx was positive for enterococcus, sensitive to vancomycin.
# Depression: continue celexa and remeron  # Nausea: His tube feed have recently been on hold due to high residuals.
Unclear if related to PTX, pain, hypoxia or a combination.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. hydropneumothorax 2. hypercarbic respiratory failure Secondary: 1.
AML s/p BMT   Discharge Condition: critical   Discharge Instructions: Transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] MICU for respiratory failure and care under his primary hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11907**].
