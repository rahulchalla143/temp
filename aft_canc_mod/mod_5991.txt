It is possible that the patient had a vascular event after the initial transfusion, however, the initial presentation was cardiac in nature.
Because the patient continued to be unresponsive and tachypneic while ventilated despite alkalemia and propofol sedation being held due to hypotension, there was concern for anoxic brain injury.
However, the patient had intractible atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was never stable for transport to radiology despite being maintained on a diltiazem drip, titrated to effect, amiodarone loaded iv, and metoprolol adjunctive nodal blockade.
The patient was felt to be in distributeive shock, total body overloaded with intravascular hypovolemia and his hypotenstion responded to iv boluses.
The patient was started on dexamethasone as stress-dose steroids for possible adrenal insufficiency.
The patient had multiorgan system failure with acute renal failure, pnacytopenia [**1-10**] CHOP chemotherapy for bladder cancer, and line infection.
After the patient's wife was able to visit from the rehabilitation hospital where she had been convalescing, the patient was terminally extubated and passed away comfortably using adjunctive opiates to control terminal restlessness and agonal respiration.
