She was apparently in USOH until 2 weeks ago, when she began to experience increasing SOB, in setting of anxity episodes.
Family reports increasing weight and LE edema in setting of not elevating her LEs.
They have also noted a cough, productive of white/yellow sputum over the past few weeks, though per patient this has been unchanged for several months.
There have been no recent changes in her medications.
She c/o of chronic insomnia and often of anxiety w/ episodes of dyspnea.
There have been no recent changes in her medications.
At time of interview on the floor, she denies CP, diaphoresis, fever, night sweats but has occasional chills.
She was started on nitro gtt, was given lasix 80mg IV x1 (UOP ~ 200cc), Vancomycin 1g, Cefepime 2g and Levofloxacin 500mg for suspected PNA (CXR w/ volume overload and "unable to r/o LLL PNA."
Of note, during [**2105-7-2**] meeting with Oncology ([**Doctor Last Name 6401**]/ [**Doctor Last Name **]) after a discussion regarding an incurable nature of her cancer and her refractoriness to treatments a recommendation was not to pursue further chemotherapy as her "numerous medical comorbidities would preclude her participation in any ongoing clinical trials" a decision was made to pursue hospice care.

Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2105-7-28**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2105-7-31**]): NO GROWTH.
Low lung volumes with persistent and possibly worsened central pulmonary vascular congestion, with blurring of the vascular borders, concerning for CHF.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette persists.
Multiple pulmonary nodules, consistent with metastatic disease, better assessed on CT. .
The multiple metastatic nodules are again seen throughout both lungs in a patient with substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and a pacemaker device in place.
EKG: Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient was initially admitted to the ICU.
Her baseline dyspnea is multifactorial: CHF, OSA w/ [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respirations, innumerable lung metastases and restrictive lung disease (obesity).
Pt was volume overloaded on CXR at admission, clinical exam of decompensated CHF.
[**Name2 (NI) **] history and lack of fever or white count made infectious etiology less likely.
Most likely exacerbating factors were PE (given burden of malignancy) and viral bronchitis.
Urine legionella antigen, blood cultures, and urine culture were sent and were negative, despite some appearance of bacteria on the urinalysis.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic heart failure / renal failure: Last TTE showed EF 20%.
At this point, it was unclear if the patient had been overdiuresed or if there was still fluid overload with poor forward flow secondary to heart failure.
A repeat urinalysis was sent to investigate intrinsic renal causes of decreased kidney function, but the Renal team did not express any concerns about the presence of blood or the urine sediment.
Since she still seemed fluid overloaded on exam, gentle diuresis of Lasix 120mg daily was started.
The day before admission, the creatinine bumped back to 3.6 but she remained asymptomatic and it was felt that with close follow-up, she could return home.
At home, she will skip the 1st day of Lasix but then continue her Lasix 120mg daily + metolazone 5mg only as needed for increasing edema or shortness of breath, with close follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Her digoxin was discontinued because of her renal dysfunction.
# Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis: Multifactorial etiology - (1) contraction alkalosis from aggressive diuresis, and (2) likely chronic CO2 retainer with metabolic compensation.
Initial blood gas in MICU showed elevated PaCO2 of 64 and a pH of 7.48, with HCO3 40.
# Anxiety / restless legs:  Patient was started on ativan PRN in the ICU.
On the floor, she was given clonazepam PRN and started on ropinirole with mild improvement.
Sometimes restless legs can be caused by iron deficiency, so the patient was transfused twice over this hospital visit with some effect.
Her chronic anemia is likely a combination of iron deficiency, ACD (low TIBC, high ferritin) and BM suppression (reticulocyte index of 0.96) in setting of malignancy.
No evidence of an active bleed.
# Paroxysmal Afib/flutter: The patient was continued on amiodarone, metoprolol, and aspirin.
# Metastatic endometrial carcinoma / goals of care: Patient previously undergoing palliative chemotherapy, but resistant to multiple treatments.
She does not seem to have full insight into her condition and is quite anxious about her lack of mobility and dependence on others for help.

You were admitted because of weight gain, increasing lower leg swelling, and you were having trouble breathing normally.
While you were here, we gave you medicine that helped to get rid of the fluid that you were retaining in your body, causing your shortness of breath and swelling.
You were also very anxious during your hospital stay and had trouble keeping your legs still.
Please continue to think about the level of care you would want in an emergency situation and your physicians will discuss this further with you at your frequent follow-up visits.
We have made the following changes to your medications: START Furosemide 120mg by mouth daily START Amiodarone 200mg by mouth daily START Ropinirole 0.5mg by mouth daily START Metolazone 5mg by mouth daily as needed for worsening edema or shortness of breath.
