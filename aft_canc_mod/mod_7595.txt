The patient's wife states that the patient has had low grade fevers and a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past month.
The patient was given vecuronium in order to obtain a head CT. CT head showed large mass centered in left frontal sinus with lytic bony destruction and posterior extention into left frontal lobe.
CXR showed a large right hilar pulmonary mass causing post obstructive atelectasis.
According to OMR notes, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] 3 weeks prior with flu-like symptoms and R shoulder pain.
His CXR showed a RUL consolidation, however there was concern for an underlying lesion on a CT.
After discharge from the hospital, he continued to have low-grade fevers and night sweats.

VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
Aspergillus galactomannan- negative Beta glucan- negative  IMAGING: CT head w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large predominantly hyperattenuating mass centered in the left frontal sinus associated with aggressive lytic osseous destruction and posterior extension into the left frontal lobe, most concerning for neoplastic process, particularly given known right lung mass.
Supervening infection must be considered.
MRI head w&w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large heterogeneously enhancing mass in the frontal sinus with intracranial extension and destruction of inner and outer tables of the frontal sinus, bilateral cribriform plates and invasion of the anterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus.
However, a primary sinus neoplasm with intracranial lesion cannot be entirely ruled out.
CT head w&w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large peripherally enhancing mass centered predominantly in frontal sinuses with associated vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
The above findings are most compatible with metastatic disease, given the reported history of right upper lung mass lesion.
Alternative differential considerations include aggressive infectious, inflammatory processes or a primary sinus neoplasm.
EEG ([**2118-11-28**])- This portable bedside EEG gives evidence for focal slowing in the left frontal quadrant compatible with a structural lesion of that area with superimposed high voltage interictal epileptiform transients in the left frontal polar region and short runs of brief electrographic seizure activity that were without any obvious clinical accompaniment.
EEG ([**2118-11-29**])- This EEG gives evidence for a focal slow wave abnormality over the left frontal polar region suggestive of a subcortical/cortical junctional structural abnormality.
Right hilar mass with mediastinal invasion and a right paratracheal mass or nodal conglomeration.
Probable malignant right pleural effusion.
Bilateral adrenal metastasis, left greater than right.
Near complete collapse of the right upper lobe due to bronchial obstruction.
Partial compression of the right lower and right middle lobe bronchi with resulting areas of postobstructive pneumonia in the right lung.
The differential would include metastatic disease to the right kidney or a primary renal lesion and biopsy should be considered to help differentiate between these two possibilities.
Soft tissue nodule posterior to the left psoas muscle in the retroperitoneum.
Right hilar mass with mediastinal invasion and a right paratracheal mass or nodal conglomeration.
Probable malignant right pleural effusion.
Bilateral adrenal metastasis, left greater than right.
Near complete collapse of the right upper lobe due to bronchial obstruction.
Partial compression of the right lower and right middle lobe bronchi with resulting areas of postobstructive pneumonia in the right lung.
The differential would include metastatic disease to the right kidney or a primary renal lesion and biopsy should be considered to help differentiate between these two possibilities.
Soft tissue nodule posterior to the left psoas muscle in the retroperitoneum.
Fusion Protocol Maxillofacial CT ([**2118-11-30**])- Unchanged NSCLC metastasis in the frontal sinus with destruction of surrounding osseous structures and invasion into the ethmoid air cells and frontal lobe of the brain.
CT Neck w/contrast ([**2118-11-30**])- No evidence of metastasis in the neck.

Seizures: Patient presented with generalized tonic clonic seizures.
He had no history of prior seizures and toxicology screens were negative.
CT scan of head in the ED showed a large mass in the frontal lobe.
With further imaging (MRI, CT with contrast, fusion maxillofacial CT), it was noted that the mass invaded through the bone into the frontal sinus and ethmoid air cells.
Patient has known RUL mass, so concern that brain mass was metastatic lesion, however, as lesion crossed midline and invaded through bone, it did not follow pattern of typical hematogenously spread met.
He had no further clinical seizures, but on EEG continued to have subclinical focal seizures in the frontal lobe.
On HD2, patient was no longer having seizures per EEG, so EEG was discontinued.
LP performed on day of admission was not consistent with an infectious process.
ENT was consulted and did not feel that it was safe to biopsy this lesion, given invasion through bone and risk for post-procedure CSF leak.
# RUL and sinus mass: Patient had a recent admission at [**Hospital1 **] with pneumonia.
CXR showed a right upper lobe mass, which was followed by a CT scan which showed the same, with resulting post-obstructive pneumonia.
Regarding newfound pulmonary mass, it was felt by neurosurgery and ENT at [**Hospital1 **] that the location of the mass made a biopsy too high-risk of a procedure.
Of note, pathology was confirmed at [**Hospital1 **] and showed that the lung mass was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
# Leukocytosis/fever: Elevated white count thought to be partly due to stress response, however, CXR with large post-obstructive pneumonia.
Patient was treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl sent home with augmentin to finish a 7 day course.
It was felt that a large component of this leukocytosis was secondary to a leukemoid reaction in the setting of pulmonary malignancy.
# Hypertension: Normotensive throughout admission, requiring only fluid boluses, never pressors.
Path sent for tumor marker studies, pending at the time of discharge.

You were admitted to the ICU after having a seizure, and a large mass was found in the sinus area of your head communicating with the brain, which was most likely the cause of the seizures.
We also started antibiotics out of concern for pneumonia and we will send you home with antibiotics to continue a 14 day course.
(to decrease inflammation in lungs and brain - STARTED ambien (for sleep - we gave you trazodone originally which gave you heartburn so switched to ambien) STARTED augmentin 875mg my mouth twice daily (antibiotic for pneumonia) STARTED tylenol for headaches STARTED docusate and senna (for constipation)  In summary, the complete list of your medications is:  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with the radiation oncology appointment below.
