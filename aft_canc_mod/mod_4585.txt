IMAGING / STUDIES: # CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2176-6-10**] at 10:23 AM): IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lobulation and enlargement of the left hilus is best explained by adenopathy, conceivably with some calcification but malignant until proved otherwise.
There is fullness in the aortopulmonic window and suggestion of the indentation on the origin of the left main bronchus as well as in the right lower paratracheal station, probably adenopathy as well.
Although the left hilar bronchial anatomy is not entirely clear, there could be occlusion of the left upper lobe bronchus.
There is heterogeneous opacification in the left upper lobe, both anterior and posterior to the tracheal plane as seen on the lateral view.
Generalized hyperinflation is due to emphysema.
There is no left pleural effusion.
There may be a small right pleural effusion.
Differential diagnosis would depend upon clinical history and prior radiographic appearance.
It includes bronchogenic carcinoma and tuberculosis.
# ECG ([**2176-6-10**] at 1:51:26 PM): Sinus rhythm with a right axis deviation.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (3).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion with some stranding.
There is mild right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
The mass measures about 3.6 x 2.1 cm (image 93, series 4).
It is associated with contiguous nodular thickening of the interstitium as well as multiple satellite nodules in both the adjacent left upper and left lower lobes.
Multiple additional nodules are identified throughout both lungs, the majority of which are round, well circumscribed, and less than or equal to 6 mm in diameter, such as a 6-mm right lower lobe nodule (image 154, series 4).
A combined ground-glass and solid nodular opacity is identified in the periphery of the right upper lobe (image 83, series 4).
Lungs are otherwise remarkable for biapical scarring and upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema.
Extensive mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy are present, with conglomerate nodes throughout the right and left sides of the mediastinum with the largest nodal mass centered in the region of the aorticopulmonary window.
This nodal mass is difficult to measure due to absence of intravenous contrast, but is at least 3.3 x 4.2 cm and appears centrally necrotic.
Other nodes in the mediastinum also have relatively low density suggesting necrosis.
These are located in the prevascular and bilateral paratracheal nodal stations.
There is also suggestion of enlarged nodes in the left supraclavicular region, not ideally assessed without contrast.
Mildly enlarged subcarinal nodes are also present, as well as bulky left hilar lymphadenopathy.
The aorticopulmonary window and left hilar nodes result in narrowing of the left main and upper lobe bronchi which have an irregular configuration.
Moderate pericardial effusion is present as well as a 1.4 x 3.0 cm mass extrinsic to the heart and likely within the pericardium.
There is no significant pleural effusion.
With this limitation in mind, no concerning abdominal abnormality is identified in this limited assessment.
Skeletal structures demonstrate a small sclerotic focus in a lower left lateral rib, which is probably a benign bone island.
Large spiculated left lung mass and associated bulky necrotic mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral pulmonary nodules, pericardial effusion and pericardial mass.
Tuberculosis is considered less likely.
Bronchial narrowing and irregularity on the left, which may be due to a combination of extrinsic compression and potential intrinsic airway involvement.
# PERICARDIOCENTESIS ([**2176-6-13**]): Subxyphoid pericardiocentesis with removal of 140cc of bloody fluid.
Echo shows minimal residual effusion.
Pericardial effusion .
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Trivial pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-6-11**], the previously seen small to moderate pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of tamponade has markedly decreased in size and is now trivial without the presence of tamponade physiology.
# Portable TTE (Focused views) ([**2176-6-14**] at 11:30:00 AM): There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Peaked P waves and rightward P wave axis, as well as right axis deviation, are consistent with pulmonary pathalogy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-6-10**] no diagnostic interim change.
# MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2176-6-16**] at 6:59 PM): FINDINGS: There is no infarction, hemorrhage, mass or mass effect.
There is a cavum septum pellucidum and septum vergae.
There is no abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal or pachymeningeal enhancement.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the paranasal sinuses.
Both orbits demonstrate no mass lesion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease or acute intracranial pathology.
Right axis deviation.
Peaked P waves and rightward P wave axis consistent with right atrial abnormality and pulmonary pathology.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-6-16**] no diagnostic interim change.
# BRONCHOSCOPY ([**2176-6-17**]): Findings: There was endobronchial tumor that was not obstructive involving proximal and distal LMS.
Hyperemic mucosa at distal trachea, main carina and RMS.There were enlarged nodes at stations 4R, 7, 4L, 11L.
All abnormal lymph nodes were sampled by EBUS-TBNA.
Impression: There was endobronchial tumor that was not obstructive involving proximal and distal LMS.
Hyperemic mucosa at distal trachea, main carina and RMS.There were enlarged nodes at stations 4R, 7, 4L, 11L.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2176-6-17**] at 11:58 AM): FINDINGS: The lungs are hyperexpanded without focal consolidation.
The left upper lobe mass and left hilar enlargement due to known adenopathy are stable.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Stable left upper lobe mass and left hilar lymphadenopathy.
# CT ABD & PELVIS ([**2176-6-17**] at 4:52 PM): CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
The previously noted pericardial effusion is not well visualized on this study.
There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is some minimal calcified plaque noted in the abdominal aorta.
There is no ascites.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no pelvic ascites.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic changes.
No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Cytology [**6-17**]:    Lymph node biopsy   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with small cell   carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 year old Vietnamese male with significant smoking history who presented to his PCP with chronic cough and weight loss, found to have LUL mass and left hilar adenopathy on CXR.
He remained afebrile, had no elevated WBC count, and was not hypoxic.
CT chest was performed shortly after admission and was highly concerning for either a primary or metastatic lung malignancy.
A large LUL mass and multiple smaller nodules and opacities were seen, as well as a pericardial effusion and possible pericardial mass.
He was initially kept in respiratory isolation, but this was discontinued given the low likelihood of TB based on his history and imaging findings.
IP was consulted for bronchoscopic biopsy, but early tamponade physiology was then noted on echo, and drainage of his pericardial effusion was considered more urgent.
Bronchoscopy was deferred until results from his pericardiocentesis were available, since the results could have been be sufficient to establish a diagnosis without bronchoscopy if positive for malignancy.
Initial pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells, however, and bronchoscopy was performed on [**2176-6-17**] once the patient returned to the general medical floor.
Multiple abnormal nodes were biopsied on EBUS, and endobronchial lesions were seen involving the proximal and distal LMS.
# Pericardial Mass / Effusion: In addition to the lung lesions, a pericardial mass and effusion were seen on CT chest.
Subsequent TTE on [**2176-6-11**] showed a small to moderate effusion with stranding and evidence of early tamponade physiology.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended drainage of the pericardial effusion, which was performed on [**2176-6-13**].
Subxiphoid pericardiocentesis was performed with removed of 140 ml of serosanguinous fluid with the procedure complicated by three unsuccessful needle sticks of the right ventricle.
Pericardial pressure feel from six to zero with pericardial fluid removal.
Post-pericardiocentesis TTE showed minimal residual effusion.
He remained hemodynamically stable, and the drain put out 250 ml of serosanguinous fluid.
The drain stopped putting out at 9am on [**2176-6-14**], and repeat TTE showed a very small pericardial effusion.
The drain was pulled around 7pm that night without incident.
# GERD: He reports a history of facial swelling after taking a medication for GERD in past, but was uncertain which medication.
# Transitional Care: -- Multiple lymph node biopsy results pending at time of discharge -- Follow up in Thoracic [**Hospital **] Clinic to be arranged .
Medications on Admission: None   Discharge Medications: None   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Lung Masses Pericardial Mass Hilar Lymphadenopathy Pericardial Effusion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for cough, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath.
A chest X-ray prior to admission showed a mass concerning for lung cancer.
You had a chest CT which showed several lung nodules and enlarged lymph nodes which were also concerning for lung cancer.
The CT scan also showed fluid around the heart called a pericardial effusion.
You had a bronchoscopic lung biopsy in order to obtain a sample of the abnormal lymph nodes and make a definite diagnosis.
Several other studies including a brain MRI and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were performed.
These are to help determine whether there are any abnormal lymph nodes or masses in other parts of the body.
