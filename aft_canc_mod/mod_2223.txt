ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
However, there is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MICRO: Positive E. Coli Blood Cx x2 Positive E. Coli Urine Cx Positive GNR in Sputum Cx  Brief Hospital Course: 71 yom with multiple medical problems including DM2, ESRD on HD, b/l BKAs who presents with SOB, fever, respiratory failure.
PLAN:  # SEPSIS: Pt was admitted with acute respiratory failure and met SIRS criteria.
He became bradycardic and expired on the evening of [**2168-8-26**].
