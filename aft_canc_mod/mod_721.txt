While here, the presence of bulky metastases was felt to compromise his respiratory failure.
Of note, his oxygenation is position sensitive in that he has had episodes of desaturation which subsequently resolve with suctioning and repositioning.
He is suctioned q2-3hours and there is minimal secretion.
He had a liter of left sided pleural effusion tapped [**2169-3-16**].
He had multiple chest x-rays in house showing multiple pulmonary opacities and bilateral air space opacities likely from his distributed pleural effusion.
CT scan of the chest [**2169-3-14**], showed that he had no pulmonary embolus.
It showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral lymphadenopathy and multiple pulmonary masses, collapse of the left upper lobe and extensive airway narrowing distal to his two bronchial stents.
It also showed a left adrenal mass.
Respiratory failure - As detailed per above.
Atrial fibrillation - He remained in atrial fibrillation while here and his heart rate was well controlled in the 70s to 80s.
Diabetes mellitus - Fingerstick within normal range while here.
Renal - The patient had a history of renal cell carcinoma.
Oncology team evaluated the situation and unfortunately felt that given his refractory and progressive nature of disease, as well as his severe debilitation that he is not a candidate for further treatment.
Respiratory failure, bulky metastatic disease and compressive atelectasis.
Renal cell carcinoma, metastatic disease to the lungs.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
