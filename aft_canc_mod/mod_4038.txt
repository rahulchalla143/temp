Patient presents after a morning episode where he developed gradual throbbing/ pulsating in his right thigh when he was walking.
He rates the pain [**3-28**] with walking and improved with putting his feet up.
Patient also endorses a single temperature f 99 and a brief episode of sweats, but no chest pain or shortness of breath, after walking around during this time.
He endorses a chronic runny nose, but otherwise has been asymptomatic with no localizing symptoms including no fevers, chills, neck stiffness, cough, dysuria, diarrhea.
That evening, he developed a single fever of 100.3, called in, but was told to wait it out.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Longstanding history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with myeloid metaplasia s/p splenectomy [**2188**], previously treated with hydroxyurea and splenectomy.
He was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia on the [**2196-6-6**], negative for NPM mutation and for the FLT 3 mutation, treated with induction chemotherapy of idarubicin and Ara-C, but had persistent disease and was therefore reinduced with mitoxantrone, etoposide and Ara-C on the [**2196-6-1**].
His hospital course was complicated by febrile neutropenia, E. coli and VRE bacteremia, a questionable fungal pneumonia.
He had significant edema and hypoxia, which at one point required an ICU admission.
He recovered from those, was discharged from the hospital on [**2196-7-26**] to complete a course of IV meropenem and daptomycin for his E. coli and VRE bacteremia.
A followup bone marrow showed him to have persistent fibrosis, but no evidence of leukemia.
He did not have a sibling donor, but a [**5-24**] matched unrelated donor was identified and the patient has agreed to participate in protocol 07-384, reduced intensity conditioning for an allo hematopoietic stem cell transplant using clofarabine, total lymphoid radiation and ATG.

[**2196-11-7**] CT chest: FINDINGS: There is no pathologic enlargement of central lymph nodes by size criteria.
Tiny pericardial effusion is physiologic.
Apparent thickening along the right posterior costal pleural surface deep in the medial pleural gutter is more likely atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion.
This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, but shows there is no adrenal mass or lesions in the imaged portions of the unenhanced solid organs of the upper abdomen suspicious for malignancy.
There is no evidence of active intrathoracic infection currently.
No evidence of intrathoracic infection or malignancy.
Previous multifocal pulmonary abnormality, presumably infectious has resolved since [**7-21**].
[**2196-11-11**] CT ABD/PELVIS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is mild linear bibasilar atelectasis.
The liver enhances homogeneously, without focal lesions or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
The pancreas does not show focal or diffuse abnormalities.
There is no evidence of peripancreatic stranding or fluid collection.
The kidneys do not show solid or cystic lesions and present symmetric nephrograms and excretion of contrast.
No pelvicaliceal dilatation or perinephric abnormalities are present.
There are no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement.
No ascites or abdominal wall hernias are noted.
The stomach, duodenum and small bowel are within normal limits without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.
The appendix is not visualized but there is no evidence of appendicitis.
Examination of the sigmoid and descending colon including the splenic flexure demonstrates thickening of the bowel walls with areas of surrounding fat stranding as well as areas of mucosal enhancement.
No fluid collection is identified.
No free air is seen.
There are multiple diverticula.
No dilitation of the small or large bowel.
No pelvic wall or inguinal lymph node enlargement is seen.
There is no pelvic free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Multilevel degenerative disease of the lumbar and thoracic spine.
Diffuse mixed sclerotic and lucent appearance of the bones which is unchanged.
Thickening of the bowel wall including the entire sigmoid and descending colon including the splenic flexure with surrounding fat stranding and areas of mucosal enhancement may represent infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic etiology.
No evidence of perforation, obstruction, or abscess formation.
Diffuse mixed sclerotic and lucent appearance of the bones which is unchanged and consistent with AML.
CT SINUS [**11-16**] FINDINGS: There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells as well as minimal mucosal thickening of the inferior left maxillary sinus and frontethmoidal recess on the left.
No aerosolized secretions to suggest significant acute component are seen.
No notable air-fluid levels except for minimal amount in the left maxillary sinus.
There is S-shaped deviation of the nasal septum with a shallow bony spur on the left which does not cause significant occlusion of the middle meatus.
There is mucosal thickening around the ostiomeatal units with obstruction of the infundibulum on the right.
The olfactory fossae are [**Last Name (un) 36826**] type [**1-20**] bilaterally with some demineralization of the cribriform plate and lateral lamellae; left cribriform plate is higher than right.
Altered attenuation of some of the bones- c spine and mandibular condyles is noted and may relate to osteopenia/ underlying marrow disorder- inadequately imaged.
IMPRESSION: Mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells with minimal mucosal thickening of the left frontoethmoidal recess and left maxillary sinus.
No aerosolized secretions or notable air-fluid levels except for minimal amount in the left maxillary sinus.
No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy or infection.
Longstanding widespread blastic and lytic involvement of the entire chest cage.
Increased thickening of the bowel wall of the descending colon with increased fat stranding consistent with worsening colitis of unclear etiology.
No evidence of perforation, obstruction or abscess formation.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
Diffuse mixed sclerotic lucent appearance of the bones, which is unchanged and consistent with AML.
Extensive soft tissue swelling, which is centered in the right oropharyngeal mucosal space and palatine fossa, extends into the right pyriform sinus of the hypopharynx and likewise involves the right submandibular space and right neck soft tissue planes.
While these changes likely represent diffuse phlegmon, there is no discrete or drainable abscess and no lymphadenopathy.
No CT evidence of odontogenic abscess or mandibular osteomyelitis.
Unchanged predominantly ethmoid sinus disease.
There is a lucency in the maxilla, seen on the lateral view, but it is unclear as to whether this represents some rarefaction in the normal trabecular markings or a frank abscess adjacent to the incisors.
Otherwise, no discrete abscess is seen subjacent to the lower mandible molars or incisors.
Rapidly progressive right upper lobe consolidation, consistent with pneumonia.
Bibasilar atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Mild paraseptal emphysema.
Multifocal lytic and sclerotic bone lesions, unchanged since [**2196-5-18**].
Extensive bilateral peripharyngeal soft tissue induration, markedly worse than three days ago, with no drainable abscess or fluid collection identified.
The origin of the infection is unlikely to be from a sinus because of the lack of marked acute sinusitis seen on the prior study.
Evidence of new right lung pneumonia and atelectasis, better evaluated by the chest CT performed on the same day.
New fluid opacification of the bilateral sphenoidal sinuses, which may represent acute infection or may be due to pooling of secretions after endotracheal intubation.
Right upper lobe pneumonia, though unchanged since prior radiograph dated [**2196-11-28**], is smaller as compared to radiographs through [**11-22**] to [**2196-11-23**].
Bilateral lower lung consolidations have also improved.
No new lung opacities.
No pleural effusion.
These raise concern for multifocal pneumonic infiltrates or, possibly, areas of aspiration.
The differential could include atypical pattern of fluid overload, but this is considered much less likely, as no upper zone redistribution is identified .
The constellation of findings are suggestive of a residual acute myeloid leukemia.
The dysplastic megakaryocytes are also suggestive of residual megakaryoblastic lineage, as discussed in the BMT conference on [**2196-10-25**] and [**2196-11-1**].

Given persistent relapse in face of overwhelming infection, patient was made DNR/DNI and ultimately comfort measures only on [**2195-12-20**].
Patient expired overnight [**2196-12-20**] from overwhelming pseudomonas sepsis secondary to refractory AML.
R thigh pain was imaged and seen to be c/w AML recurrence; bone marrow biopsy confirmed disease relapse.
LDH elevation >4000 dropped markedly after MEC & pt tolerated MEC well, but initial post-treatment course was complicated by neutropenic fevers (see below).
Repeat BM bx on [**11-19**] (day 15) and [**12-7**] showed AML relapse again.
Given persistent relapse in face of overwhelming infection, patient was made DNR/DNI and ultimately comfort measures only on [**2195-12-20**].
# FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA Patient had fevers intermittently throughout admission.
Initially, given history of E. coli and VRE bacteremia, he was empirically started on meropenem and daptomycin, then broadened to voriconazole given hx fungal PNA.
Micro (including line cultures) and pan-CT scans were negative for sources of infection until on [**11-16**] BCx grew GNR which speciated as Pseudomonas auruginosa initially pan-sensitive except to meropenem.
Soon thereafter, he developed PNA seen on chest imaging & BAL sputum Cx grew pseudomonas now with evolved resistances only sensitive to Cipro/Tobra/Gent.
Neck soft tissue infection also likely contributed to fevers.
He was afebrile on [**12-7**] at time of ICU callout on dapto/cipro/vori.
He became febrile again on [**12-9**]; at that time, possible infectious sources included PNA and, although cultures remained negative, possible bacteremia from oral flora seeding from retropharyngeal ulcer site was considered an ongoing possibility.
Pseudomonas from throat swab noted to have evolved resistance to ciprofloxacin along with MDR E. coli.
# DIARRHEA/COLITIS Diarrhea started [**2196-11-8**].
He also developed LLQ pain; a CT abd/pelvis obtained with concernf or tiflitis showed descending colitis.
Gastroenterology was consulted for question of infectious colitis vs GVH (especially off immunosuppression).
# PSEUDOMONAS SEPSIS Patient became septic with pseudomonal bacteremia from likely GI source.
At time of ICU transfer his urine output was wnl and he was mentating at baseline but he was having relative hypotension with BP ~15 pts below his baseline.
# RIGHT MANDIBULAR/TONSILLAR SWELLING, SOFT TISSUE INFECTION Pt developed acute-onset R buccal swelling and tenderness on the morning of [**11-19**] which evolved rapidly throughout the subsequent 8 hours.
Urgent ENT consult followed closely; no biopsy was performed given lack of drainable collection on imaging.
As swelling evolved to includer peri-tonsillar soft tissue it caused airway obstruction which prompted ICU transfer and intubation.
Repeated CT scans showed soft tissue swelling, no collection or abscess to drain.
Soft tissue swelling gradually resolved but left residual R retropharyngeal ulcer after extubation persisted and was cleaned daily by ENT.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS/INTUBATION Patient developed acute airway compromise [**1-19**] neck/tonsillar soft tissue infection, with stridor on exam.
#TONSILLAR NECROSIS/R RETROPHARYNGEAL ULCER Upon extubation necrosis of the right tonsil with open ulceration became apparent.
Tonsillar necrosis was treated supportively with normal saline washes and daily debridement by ENT.
Continued on daptomycin for gram positive coverage of oral bacteria, in case of translocation through necrotic tissue.
Given inability to swallow liquids or solids without aspirating, he was kept NPO on TPN.
# PNEUMONIA In the ICU he developed a RUL seen on CXR which was treated as ventilator associated pneumonia.
Sputum originally grew pseudomonas, with the same sensitivities as in blood, which was treated with zosyn with double coverage with tobramycin.
CXRs on the floor in setting of ongoing fevers showed persistent RUL opacity c/w known PNA.
He continued to produce thick yellow-white sputum which was difficult to manage in combination with low-level bleeding from oral ulcer.
# Tachycardia: Patient with history of Afib with RVR.
Ocasionally tachycardic in setting of fever but EKGs confirmed sinus tachycardia.
Became persistenly tachycardic with fevers and had two episodes of SVT >200 on [**12-18**] and [**12-18**] broken by carotid massage.
