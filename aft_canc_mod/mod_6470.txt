Admission Date:  [**2107-10-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2025-11-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13565**] Chief Complaint: Falls - found to have R cerebellar hemorrhage at OSH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 61509**] is a LHM, and is a retired printer (former veteran), who normally does cross-word puzzles, Sodoku and plays Game Boy.
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 36913**] cleaned his step-father up, and noticed that he had hit the right side of his forehead and right forearm.
He had a CT of his brain which showed a right cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion with vasogenic edema and some compression of the fourth ventricle, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Asthma 2.
Family History: Not known  Physical Exam: Vitals: T99, HR 40, BP 157/60, RR 16, SpO2 96% on room air General: right forehead and right arm bruises noted.
Moderate dysarthria.
No pronator drift.
1.5 cm hyperdense lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with surrounding edema, and mild effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Differential considerations include hyperdense or hemorrhagic metastasis, versus vascular malformation, or other source of hemorrhage, including hypertensive bleed.
1.3 cm probable small calcified meningioma right middle cranial fossa.
Vascular calcifications, and bilateral basal ganglia chronic lacunar infarcts, and right frontal chronic infarction.
MR head: Approximately 1.5-cm lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema most consistent with a hemorrhagic tumor.
These findings are most consistent with a malignant hemorrhagic tumor.

There is also enhancement of the cerebellar sulci which could signify leptomeningeal seeding from a tumor.
IMPRESSION: Approximately 1.5-cm lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema most consistent with a hemorrhagic tumor.
These findings are most consistent with a malignant hemorrhagic tumor.
MRI Brain [**11-7**]: Prelim read: Large decrease in mass effect of right cerebellar mass on fourth ventricle since MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**10-24**] with small improvement in mass effect seen since head CT of [**11-4**].
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 81 year old LHM with a h/o smoking presents with recent multiple falls with possible loss of balance per patient.
He also developed nausea and vomitting plus bifrontal headache.
Patient was found to have 1.5cm R cerebellar hemorrhage with significant vesogenic edema and some effacement of 4th ventricle.
Neurosurgery and neuro-oncology were consulted given the high index of suspicion for either primary CNS or metastatic tumor.
While in the ICU, patient also had moderate/severe sundowning.
Lately he has been much improved without significant trouble, although he does have some confusion worse at night and early morning.
He has had significant improvement in his dysarthria as well.
Over the past week he was noted to have a persistent elevated WBC count.
This leukocytosis is likely due to steroids and not an acute infection.
He has been afebrile throuhgout the hospital course.
He had a repeat MRI which showed stable lesion with decreased swelling.
It should be noted that he had evidence of a right subdural hygroma on his initial and follow-up scans, deemed incidental to his presentation.
He is mildly dysarthric.
EOMI are full with few beats of nystagmus on right end gaze.
He has slight asterixis L>R.
His right sided is mildly dysmetric with finger-nose-finger and he has slight overshoot on rapid actions.
He has a steady gait with assistance.
Brain biopsy failed to reveal a diagnosis, which may be tumor or amyloid angiopathy.
