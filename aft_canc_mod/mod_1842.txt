Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2176-2-8**] Video-assisted thoracic surgery right upper lobectomy, video-assisted thoracic surgery right lower lobe superior segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection and flexible bronchoscopy.
[**2176-2-9**] Flexible Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: 76F who is a former smoker had a history of dry cough for the past year.
She saw her physician and had [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CXR, which showed a RUL infiltrate.
She was treated with antibiotics without improvement.
This scan showed an increase in size in the RUL consolidation with some new fullness in the R hilum.
PET-CT was done on [**2175-9-9**], revealing intense FDG activity in the R lung consistent with malignancy.
There was also an FDG-avid area in the proximal descending colon.
No lymph nodes were biopsied.
She then underwent a CT guided biopsy of the mass which revealed NSCLC most consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

This includes the mediastinal and tracheal displacement as well as distortion of the right hilus.
The left lung remains essentially clear except for some atelectatic streaks at the base.
There appears to be a hiatal hernia in the retrocardiac region on the lateral projection.
[**2176-2-11**] Tiny loculated right apical pneumothorax unchanged, small to moderate right pleural effusion probably decreasing, pleural tubes still in place.
Mild cardiomegaly stable.
Hiatus hernia noted.
The small to moderate right apical pneumothorax is again seen, though quite subtle.
Right perihilar opacity persists, most likely representing a combination of atelectasis and contusion in this recently postoperative patient.

Overnight she developed respiratory distress and was re-intubated and transferred to the SICU for respiratory failure.
Respiratory: Respiratory failure [**2176-2-9**] re-intubated on a vent, sedated, unable to to protect her airway and manage secretions.
Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on [**2176-2-10**] which showed slight effacement of right middle lobe medial segment.
She was followed by serial chest films which showed atelectasis and stable right apical space.
GI: prophylactis PPIs and bowel regime were administered  Nutrition: She tolerated a regular diet.
Vocal cord paralysis since [**2164**] no signs of aspiration.

Once extubated she was converted to PO oxycodone with good pain control.
