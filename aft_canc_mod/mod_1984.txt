1) Resp failure- pt admitted w/ primarily hypoxic respiratory failure.
Following admission to the floor the pt developed increasing hypoxia and somnolence, requiring intubation on HD 5.
Previously treated for CAP as outpt but hypoxia continued to progress.
Pt underwent bronchoscopy on [**11-16**] following transfer to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation (7.25/52/70 on 100%NRB).
Repeat CXR was unchanged from previously in the ICU (official read noted mild CHF, but pt was continuing to autodiurese and has remained net negative everyday while on the floor.
2) astrocytoma- grade II, as per d/w PMD, Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt has poor prognosis, but reasonable for ongoing treatment.
Pt has had two recent neg head CTs, so unlikely the etiology of the patient's MS change.
3) MS change- on admission pt was agitated, requiring restraints and antipsychotics, however as he became increasingly hypoxic he became somnolent.
On the floor the patient intially was imporved, but has plateaued, responding to simple commands and verbalizing groans but no real speech.
Pt had multiple head CTs which ruled out progression of astrocytoma.
EEG was w/o evidence of epileptiform activity and c/w toxic encephalopathy.
Course was c/b one episode of gross hematochezia on [**12-22**], w/ concomitant hct drop of ~3 pts.
Given that the pt was w/o evidence of DVT it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation in the setting of gross GIB, outweigh the risks of undetected deep vv thrombosis/pe.
4) hypersensitivity reaction- on [**11-18**] pt was noted to have developing rash of abdomen and anterior thighs.
Derm initially reviewed and thought that it was not c/w hypersensitivity rxn.
Over the next the rash progressed, and the patient subsequently began spiking fevers to approx 103F, c/b hypotension requiring aggressive fluid repletion and pressors, and tachycardia to the 130s.
The patient also developed elevated transaminases and pancreatic enzymes during this time.
Pt continued to have elev pancreatic enzymes and pentamidine was switched to clinda/primaquine.
On arrival to the floor the patient was noted to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] reticular rash of upper arms, which resolved over the next 48h.
6) ARF- Cr mildly elevated on tx to ICU, u lytes c/w prerenal azotemia, which resolved w/ IVF.
7) hyponatremia - also hyponatremic on transfer, resolved w/ ivf.
17) DNR, but may intubate for reversible causes .
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 2) Astrocytoma 3) Hypersensitivity to Bactrim 4) Hematochezia 5) h/o DVT   Discharge Condition: Good, still w/ altered mental status but improving.
