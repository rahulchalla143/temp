Admission Date: [**2123-2-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2123-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-4-3**]        Sex:  F  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old with secondary MDS/AML status post allo BMT 97 days ago, with history of breast cancer, who presents with new radiologic findings of left upper lobe nodule.
She noticed non- productive cough and recent URI symptoms, which were persistent, left sided chest discomfort, and slight pleuritic pain.
She noticed decreased appetite over the past two days, accompanied by nausea, no vomiting.
She noticed right upper quadrant mild discomfort with eating meals.
She noticed bilateral back pain which worsened in the sitting position.
No dysuria, hematuria or frequency.
The patient states that the back pain lasted approximately 1 week.
Status    post allo BMT from matched sibling donor, complicated by    CMV colitis and GVHD.
Sweet syndrome treated with prednisone.
Heart - Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities - No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Skin - No rash.
Back - No costovertebral angle tenderness.
Blood cultures, urine cultures, influenza A and B cultures, CMV viral load pending.
Chest CT with contrast - Slight spiculated 1.4 cm left upper lobe nodule which is new since prior CT, most likely consistent with infectious process.
Probable radiation changes at the right apex which are unchanged, and persistent right sided small pleural effusion.
Chest x-ray - New, ill-defined opacity in left upper lobe concerning for atypical infection.
Stable appearance of chest, with right apical pleural opacity and right sided volume loss.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the oncology service, given the fact that she had a lung nodule which was most likely infectious in etiology.
They also added minocycline throughout her stay, for worsening pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory decompensation.
The patient also had hypotension responsive to fluid and transient pressor requirements.
Due to the patient's need for volume, given her hypotension, she inevitably developed congestive heart failure.
The course was complicated, as well, due to biliary sepsis, which was thought secondary to acalculous cholecystitis, based on abdominal ultrasound findings, though there was also some concern that, given the patient's prior history of GVHD, that the patient could have had some graft versus host disease occurring in the liver as well.
The patient was placed on voriconazole as well, given the patient's pulmonary infection and worry for pulmonary aspergillosis, although this was not substantiated on invasive testing.
After discussion with the family, the patient's code status was changed to "comfort measures only," given the dire situation, the patient's volume status, persistent problems with oxygenation and hypotension.
