No spinal tenderness Extrem: large legs, no pitting edema, R leg shorter and internally rotated.
No tenderness to palpation at wound site.
At discharge:: 97.8 / (129/61)  /  84  /  97% on room air -I/VI holosystolic murmur -lungs clear bilaterally, poor effort, distant -abdomen obese, soft, nontender -scar on right hip with staples, minimal erythema, overlying sheets stained with yellow serous fluid -legs are obese and symmetrically large.
unclear how much of leg distension is a result of fluid overload vs obesity.

Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Thickening of the mid segment of the sigmoid colon with no proximal obstruction is compatible with the patient's known sigmoid cancer.
7-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Considerations include metastatic focus or inflammatory/infectious process.
Pulmonary edema and atelectasis limits evaluation for pulmonary nodules; dedicated repeat chest CT could be obtained after optimization of pulmonary status for better assessment.
Colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
Dilated CBD and possible focal pancreatic ductal dilation (vs small pancreatic cystic lesion).
Relative enlargement of the right ovary which is unusual for the patient's age.
Large axial hiatal hernia.
Bilateraly hypodense renal lesions, too small to characterize, and 31-mm right renal lesion possibly representing a hyperdense cyst but indeterminate.
Chronic fracture of the right femoral neck which is associated with displacement of the femoral neck and head fracture fragments, not in contact with the dynamic hip screw.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo F with hx of CHF, dementia and hip fx s/p ORIF on Coumadin presented with asymptomatic anemia and supratherpeutic INR, found to have 6 cm fungating mass in sigmoid colon on colonoscopy.
Surgical and medical oncology agreed that the pt must recover functional status (ie be able to walk) in order to be a candidate for surgical resection of her colonic mass and subsequent chemotherapy.
# Anemia: Pt's HCT was in the 30s 1 mo ago; on admission, HCT was 23 and dropped to 21 with guaiac positive stool but no frank blood in stool.
EGD was performed which showed large hiatal hernia but no source of bleed.
Colonoscopy was performed, which showed a 6 cm fungating mass in the sigmoid colon which was the likely source of the pt's anemia.
Pt was also found to be iron deficient and she was started on supplemental iron.
# Colon Cancer: Adenocarcinoma by biopsy.
--7mm RLL nodule noted; FDG-PET can be obtained for further evaluation.
--Relative enlargement of the right ovary which is unusual for the patient's age.
This can be further evaluated by pelvic ultrasound (US showed complex cyst which should be followed in [**1-23**] months).
--31-mm exophytic cyst of the lower pole of the right kidney, does not have the complete appearance of the simple cyst.
Given pt's recent DVT and high risk for thrombosis given malignancy, she was started on lovenox at prophylactic dose (30 subQ [**Hospital1 **]).
At time of discharge, scar has minimal erythema, staples are in place, there is no overt sign of infection.
Pt also had TTE which showed nl EF, mild AS, mild TR, mod PAH, and some signs of early diastolic CHF.
Given good response to Lasix IV, would dose on a prn basis for low 02 saturation and dyspnea.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO qhs prn as needed for sleep.
COLON CANCER 2.
Failed gamma nail fixation with cutout and acetabular destruction.
The surgical and medical cancer specialists agree that you have to regain your strength before proceeding with removal of the mass in your colon and the chemotherapy which is required after surgery.
If you note significant blood in your stool or if the scar on hip appears to be infected please return to the hospital.
