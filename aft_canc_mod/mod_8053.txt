Moderate atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta with no focal dissection or aneurysm identified.
Bilateral lower lobe lung consolidation and atelectasis as described.
MRA chest was also done to rule out a calcified aorta.
During a family discussion it was decided that she would not undergo treatment of her aneurysm as it would require an open craniotomy with clipping of the aneurysm.
Her SBP was well controlled without the use of pressors or anti-hypertensives.
