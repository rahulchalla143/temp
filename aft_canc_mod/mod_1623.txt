Admission Date:  [**2155-2-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-11-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: Upper GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Temporary hemodialysis line placement [**2155-2-25**] Blood Transfusion Removal of Dialysis Line Removal of Portacath Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 80 year-old man with multiple myeloma was recently hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] for a fall while on narcotics.
He had been also taking his his long and short acting oxycontin/oxycodone.
He was taken to an OSH where he was found to have elevated troponins.
S/p EGD that found [**Known lastname **] bleeding ulcer that was injected.
Past Medical History: MULTIPLE MYELOMA TREATMENT HISTORY: # Multiple Myeloma: on treatment with Revlimid      Initially presented with T12 compression fracture, ARF, hypercalcemia and SMV thrombosis in [**2143**].
He continued thalidomide until [**10/2148**] when it was stopped due to debilitating symptoms of ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.
In [**4-/2151**], the Zometa was stopped for concern of right lower jaw osteonecrosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] was off all therapy for his myeloma since that time.
Bone marrow biopsy done on [**2152-10-30**] showed a marrow cellularity of 28-30%, interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly and in clusters.
After this first cycle of Decadron he developed an infection in his mouth and lower extremity weakness so he did not start his second cycle until [**12-20**].
He started cycle 2 Velcade on [**2153-3-6**] - he received 2 doses but the rest was held due to shortness of breath and weakness.
This course was complicated by a hospitalization for EColi sepsis with unclear source.
EMG showed diffuse complicated neuropathy.

IMAGING: CXR [**2155-2-22**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
RUE U/S [**2155-2-23**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
ECHO [**3-4**]: No evidence of endocarditis   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] is an 80 year-old man with multiple myeloma who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with ARF [**1-14**] ATN from UGIB related hypotension vs myeloma related nephropathy.
Course also complicated by bacteremia requiring removal of central access and initiation of Vancomycin for 2 wk course.
# Acute renal failure on stage 3 CKD secondary to multiple myeloma: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] had chronic kideny disease secondary to his multiple myeloma.
He developed acute renal failure in the setting of hypoperfusion during his NSTEMI and GI bleed vs light-chain cast nephropathy.
His renal function deteriorated and pt became uremic with BUN >110.
# Bacteremia: Pt remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout admission but given concerning fluid from portacath, blood cultures were drawn and grew coag negative staph and 2 strains of strep viridans on [**2-25**].
ECHO ruled out endocarditis and pt should complete a 14 day course of Vancomycin, last day [**3-12**].
# Multiple Myeloma with T12-L2 vertebral compression fractures: His pain medications were gradually tapered.
Long term treatment plan to be determined by outpt oncologist based on recovery from renal failure.
# Upper GI Bleed: Pt developed GI bleed in setting aspirin, plavix and heparin initiated for NSTEMI treatment.
He underwent an EGD at OSH with [**Known lastname **] bleeding ulcer injected (biopsies not taken).
# NSTEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] had an NSTEMI at an OSH in the absence of chest pain.
Troponin I only mildly elevated and also in the setting of ARF.
The troponin elevation is likely from demand ischemia related to hypoxemia/hypercarbic respiratory failure in addition to a probable stress response with narcan use and his rebound pain and agitation.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Patient was going in and out of afib with ventricular rates in the 130s.
Anticoagulation was held while concern was for bleeding (s/p reversal of INR with FFP at OSH as per HPI).
Pt was asymptomatic while both tachycardic and bradycardic and after discussion with pt's cardiologist, it was decided that there is no indication for pacemaker and low dose metoprolol TID is the appropriate treatment.
There is no need to monitor on telemetry or treat tachy or bradycardias unless pt symptomatic.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Renal Failure Upper GI bleed Atrial Fibrillation Bacteremia  Secondary: Multiple Myeloma  Discharge Condition: A+Ox3 Ambulating with assistance  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from another hosptial and had quite a complicated hospital course.
You were found unresponsive at home and taken to the ER where it was found that you had significant strain on your heart.
To treat your heart you were started on several medications that thin you blood and in this setting you started bleeding from an ulcer in your stomach.
However due to poor perfusion of your kidneys (due to the GI bleed, low blood pressure from the narcotic pain medications) you developed worsening kidney function and failure.
Meanwhile it was noted that your chemotherapy port that you have had for years appeared infected and you were shown to have bacteria in your blood stream.
Because of this infection it was necessary to remove both your port and your new dialysis line which may have been harboring bacteria.
You were started on antibiotics and responded very well, with all furthur blood cultures negative.
We made the following changes to your medications: 1) STOP: Oxycontin 2) STOP: Revlamid 3) STOP: Coumadin 4) STOP: Percocet 5) START: Oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours as needed for new pain control 6) START: 3 Lidocaine patches to the back daily, 12 hrs on 12 hrs off for additional pain control 7) START: Pantoprazole 40mg twice daily to decrease risk of bleeding 8) START: Atorvastatin 20mg daily for heart disease prevention 9) START: Metoprolol 12mg three times daily to prevent very fast heart rates with atrial fibrillation 10) START: Vancomycin varying doses based on trough (currently getting 500mg every day to every other day)   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with:  1) DR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13016**], please call to schedule a follow up appointment within 1-2 weeks 2) DR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**5-5**] at 4:40pm.
