Complex congenital heart disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This full term infant was admitted with complex congenital heart disease.
MATERNAL HISTORY:  Mother is a 35-year-old gravida 2, para 1 now 2 woman with past obstetrical history notable for full term infant with ventricular septal defect in [**2181**].
Past medical history is notable for neurofibromatosis type 1, hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine), and mitral valve thickening (procedural SBE prophylaxis).
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for ventricular septal defect in the sibling of this infant, neurofibromatosis in the mother but is negative for other congenital heart disease or congenital conditions.
The pregnancy was complicated by note of a congenital heart defect on the 18-week fetal survey.
Subsequent fetal echocardiogram showed hypoplastic tricuspid valve, right ventricular hypoplasia, ventricular septal defect, unobstructed pulmonary artery flow, mild aortic arch hypoplasia.
The fetus was followed with serial ultrasounds which showed a 2-vessel umbilical cord but otherwise remained unremarkable.
Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery and yielded clear amniotic fluid.
There was no intrapartum fever or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
There was no nasal flaring.
There were no grunting respirations or intercostal or subcostal retractions.
The infant had good breath sounds bilaterally with no adventitious sounds.
There was 1 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border without radiation.
The abdomen was soft, nondistended with no organomegaly and no masses.
Complex congenital cardiac anomaly, consisting of right     ventricular hypoplasia, tricuspid hypoplasia, and mild     aortic arch hypoplasia.
The [**Hospital3 1810**] cardiology service has     recommended low dose prostaglandin infusion in light of     the complexity of the cardiac anomalies.
Given the elective cesarean section without intrapartum     sepsis risk factors, we have not obtained a blood culture or     started empirical antibiotic therapy.
The infant will be transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for     definitive cardiac evaluation and management, including     consideration of palliative pulmonary-systemic shunt.
The parents have been updated regarding current status,     diagnostic considerations and our management plan, including     transfer to [**Hospital3 1810**] to which they have provided     consent.
The infant has been stabilized for transport.
