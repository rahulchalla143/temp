Brief Hospital Course: 86 female with severe COPD on home O2, NHL in remission on intermittent Rituximab last [**2-/2192**], recent EVAR AAA repair [**7-/2192**], TIA s/p LCEA, HTN, who was found unresponsive on couch by her friend and in respiratory distress.
CXR showed new infiltrates and elevated TnT on admission which downtreneded and likely represents non-ST elevation MI due to demand ischemia in the setting of prolonged hypoxia.
She developed worsening respiratory distress on [**2-24**] and was transferred to the MICU for BiPAP.
# Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient was admitted with a WBC of 24.8, 85% PMNs, which resolved over the course of her hospitalization.
Chest xray in the ED showed new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
She was afebrile throughout her hospital course.
# Severe COPD: On Home O2 and very debilitated by SOB on any exertion.
She was treated with regular and PRN nebs, Prednisone for 5 days course and pneumonia was treated with IV Abx as above.
She developed worsening respiratory distress on [**2-24**] and was transferred to the MICU for BiPAP.
# NSTEMI/ CHF exacerbatoin: Patient had a rise in cardiac troponins (max 0.31) and CKMB (max 18) on presentation which began trending downward on hospital day 1.
She denied chest pain prior to presentation and throughout her hospital course.
She was treated with aspirin and a 48 hour heparin drip, and cardiac echo showed new wall motion abnormality in region of PDA.
Shortness of breath responded to IV diuresis, as evidenced by improving O2 requirement after lasix was given.
She was discharged on these medications, except ACEI in setting of renal failure, and will f/u iwth cardiology as outpatient.
# Rule out Pulmonary Embolus: Given the acuity of the patient's dyspnea on the morning of presentation, the differential diagnosis included pulmonary embolus.
She does not have active neoplasm, has other more likely etiologies of dyspnea, was not tachycardic, has not had recent surgery or immobilization, and has not had hemoptysis, thus her [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] score is <2 and she is considered "low probability" for PE.
She had no EKG changes suggestive of PE, and cardiac echo showed new wall motion abnormality more suggestive of recent MI.
Given this low probability and due to her diminished renal function and GFR, CT angiogram was not pursued.
Due to low probability of PE and the fact that V/Q scan would likely be unrevealing in the setting of pulmonary edema (demonstrated on X ray), V/Q scan was also not pursued.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient's creatinine on presentation was 1.5, up from her baseline of 0.8-1.0.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] on vacation) who agreed to follow up labs as outpatient, as patient was anxious to go home.
# Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma: Last had Rituximab in 3/[**2191**].
Currently felt to be in remission, though she did present with anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.
On presentation, she denied systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, nightsweats.
4. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Outpatient Lab Work On Friday, [**2193-3-1**], please check creatinine and potassium and fax to office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102411**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 8930**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Community acquired pneumonia Myocardial infarction Heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital for shortness of breath.
This was most likely caused by a combination of things, including pneumonia, COPD flare, and a small heart attack.
You were also found to have a heart attack, which likely contributed to your shortness of breath and to the fluid in your lungs.
You also were noted to have some kidney dysfuction from your bloodwork.
This was most likely due to dehydration and from increased doses of lasix.
