[**2191-7-25**] EGD: Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Atrophy and granularity of the mucosa were noted throughout the esophagus.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Congestion and hypertrophy of the mucosa were noted in the stomach body and fundus.
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Congestion, nodularity, ulceration and hypertrophy of the mucosa were noted in the whole examined duodenum compatible with acid excess or infiltration.
Impression: Atrophy and granularity in the esophagus Congestion and hypertrophy in the stomach body and fundus (biopsy) Congestion, nodularity, ulceration and hypertrophy in the whole examined duodenum compatible with acid excess or infiltration (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
[**2191-7-25**] Colonoscopy: Findings:  Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding diverticula with small openings were seen in the ascending colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
C. Random colon: Colonic mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
ECG: 9:30 AM Sinus tachycardia with rate in 130's, late R wave progression, LVH, L-bundle like appearance of QRS (though QRS not widened) .
No evidence of focal pancreatic lesion.
Mild dilatation of the distal (pancreatic head) portion of the duct of Wirsung with no upstream dilatation seen.
Enhancing, well-circumscribed nodule lateral to the second part of the duodenum, most likely related to a small lymph node.
Thickened gastric rugae, likely related to gastritis.
No evidence of focal pancreatic lesion.
Mild dilatation of the distal (pancreatic head) portion of the duct of Wirsung with no upstream dilatation seen.
Enhancing, well-circumscribed nodule lateral to the second part of the duodenum, most likely related to a small lymph node.
Thickened gastric rugae, likely related to gastritis.
The diarrhea resolved without intervention.
Hypotension resolved and patient actually became hypertensive.
Her home labetolol was resumed at 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and later increased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **] given persistently elevated BPs.
MICU Course #2: Pt was readmitted to the MICU for profuse diarrhea and vital sign instability on [**8-4**].
Pt was then restarted on PPI, volume repleted with electrolyte repletion as needed, and diarrhea slowly resolved.
Vitals signs stabilized with volume repletion.
The results of the Friday scan revealed Octreotide-avid focus of tracer uptake anterior to the lower pole of the right kidney.
As the patient improved, vital signs and diarrhea improved she was transferred back to the floor on [**8-7**] for further work-up and care.
Medicine course ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HTN and hyperlipidemia who has recently experienced bouts of secretory diarrhea for which she is being worked up for a gastrinoma.
# Gastrinoma.
The read of the CTA showed no focal lesion in the pancreas.
# Diarrhea, likely secondary to gastrinoma During her stay on the medicine floor, the patient did not have any recurrence of diarrhea.
She did not need to use the tincture of opium that was available to her prn for diarrhea.
She also denied any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
The transition to PO went well, without any apparent side effects or recurrence of diarrhea, and her bowel movements were regular.
# Hypokalemia: Likely secondary to GI loss.
The patient's hematocrit remained steady, with no suggestion of a GI bleed, imprtant beacuse of her history of perforation and the recent diagnosis of gastrinoma.
# Tachycardia, likely secondary to dehydration: The patient did not experience any sustained tachycardia or hypotension during her medicine admission.
# UTI: On [**8-4**], the urine culture was positive for > 100,000 E. coli.
She denied any dysuria or hematuria.
# Leukocytosis, resolved for the last 6 days of medicine admission: C. diff and all stool cultures negative.
[**8-4**] blood cultures showed no growth.
[**8-1**] blood culture showed no growth.
Lo-Peramide 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for diarrhea.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Gastrinoma Diarrhea, likely secondary to gastrinoma, resolved Urinary tract infection  Secondary Hypertension Hyperlipidemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
A medication called pantoprazole can reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes and prevent you from having diarrhea.
Report to emergency department if repeated bouts of diarrhea  Followup Instructions: Please schedule a follow up appointment with your PCP within two weeks, and call your PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] referral to a GI specialist within 4-6 days.
