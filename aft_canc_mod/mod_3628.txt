He was diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1096**] with GBM (by biopsy) in the setting of increasing confusion, memory loss.
His family reports mildly productive cough (cold sx) beginning approximately 1 week ago; he had a CXR 3-4 days ago which reportedly was negative for pneumonia and took atovaquone.
CXR showed multifocal PNA at RUL, RLL, LLL.
Head CT demonstrated "no new findings" and was reportedly reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgery however there is no note in chart/OMR.

# Septic Shock:  Met criteria for septic shock.
On presentation had clear pulmonary source of infection.
Initial sputums grew out pneumococci.
Patient relatively immunocompromised due both to cancer diagnosis and chronic steroid use secondary to brain tumor.
Patient had EKGs without signs of ischemia, and  multiple sets of normal cardiac enzymes.
He did rarely require brief periods of neosynepherine, due to too-rapid diuresis.
Historically, it was noted that the patient had a red left knee a few days prior to admission.
This infection was found to be MSSA, which also grew out of his blood and eventually out of his R chest chemo-port, which was removed by surgery.
He was maintained on a 6week course of Nafcillin for this staph infection.
A TEE demonstrated no signs of endocarditis.
The patient also had a full course of Clinda for a question of toxic shock syndrome or aspiration pneumonia.
He recieved a full Ophtho eval which demonstrated no ocular involvment.
# Afib c RvR:  New-onset afib in the face of sepsis, hypotension, infection.
Patient initially controlled with boluses of Diltiazem or Lopressor.
Due to his brain tumor he was note anticoagulated during his time in the ICU.
# Septic Arthritis:  As above, had septic arthritis of L knee treated via washout by ortho on [**12-17**].
Patient did have a swollen L wrist later in his course, but this was tapped by Ortho and never grew out any bacteria.
He has a bronchoscopy on [**12-18**] which showed diffuse thick bloody sputum greatest in the R LL.
The patient tested negative for legionella and influenza.
On [**12-25**] the patient was noted to have an increasing o2 requirement and a CXR demonstrated a moderate-sized R pneumothorax.
#GBM:  Head CTs compared to his baseline [**Hospital1 2025**] scans showed no interval change.
#Anemia/thrombocytopenia:  Had anemia of chronic disease, admitted with thrombocytopenia attributed to Avastin and timador.
# Hyperglycemia:  Intitally hyperglycemic in face of sepsis, controlled with SS insulin and resolved on its own.
#R Chest wound:  Con't to drain purulent material s/p removal of port.
#Mental Status:  The patient presented with altered mental status felt to be due to sepsis.
He continued to be Aox1-2 in the MICU, with symptoms consistent with delerium.
#Prophylaxis: Patient was initially on pneumoboots and then Heparin SC, a bowel regmimen and a Gi prophlyaxsis throughout his hospital course.
This was felt to be mostly due to a diarrhea and thus GI loss, and was resolving at the end of his hospital course as diarrhea resolved.
# Nutrition:  The patient was maintained on TF while intubated, and also s/p intubation as he failed his initial speech and swallow exams.
#LFTs:  Patient had elevated LFTs on presentation which were attributed to sepsis.
He should continue on weekly LFT checks due to his continuing nafcillin.
