HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old male past medical history for Hodgkin lymphoma treated in the late [**2151**] that is in remission.
Status post radiation therapy, complicated by significant brachial plexus injury rendering his right upper extremity, which is illicitly nonfunctional.
The patient complained of abdominal discomfort that was consistent with biliary colic in [**2187-10-2**], underwent an ultrasound, which demonstrated an intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal diltation prompting an ERCP.
ERCP was performed in [**2187-12-2**] that demonstrated findings consistent with a Klatskin type tumor and/or stricture located at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts.
CT of the abdomen was performed demonstrating a mass located in the hilum abutting the cystic and the common and hepatic duct with intrahepatic ductal diltation.
Findings were consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
Also noted was abdominal lymphadenopathy with no evidence of hepatic disease, no intrahepatic metastases.
Patient underwent brushings at the time of the ERCP and there was no evidence of malignancy observed.
No chest pain.
No shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, hyperthyroidism, Hodgkin lymphoma status post radiation treatments, history of questionable pancreatitis and duodenal ulcer.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatomegaly.
No hernias appreciated.
Patient received fluid boluses for low blood pressure.
MRS [**Last Name (STitle) 15570**] was performed with a rectal swab demonstrating staph aureus coag positive.
On [**2188-1-22**], patient had a bronchioloalveolar lavage.
It was noted on chest x-ray that patient had a right main stem bronchus with narrowing correlated to secretions that was demonstrated on recent CAT scan on [**1-16**].
On [**2188-1-22**], the patient had bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrating staph aureus coag positive.
Urine culture demonstrate no growth.
Blood cultures demonstrated no growth.
The patient was continued on antibiotics for MSSA pneumonia and polymicrobial cholangitis.
On [**2188-1-28**], the patient had a cholangiogram that demonstrated no evidence of obstruction, extravasation or anastomotic stricture.
[**2188-1-24**] bile fluid was sent for gram stain and culture demonstrating staph aureus coag positive [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
On the floor patient received aggressive chest PT, pulmonary toilet, calorie counts, bedside swallow to evaluate if he had any problems swallowing.
Speech had seen him on [**2188-2-1**] demonstrating that he has significant dysphagia at the bedside.
Barium swallow was notable for a weak tongue, dysarthria, right Horner and severe dysphagia.

The common bile duct distal margin shows acute and chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
Common bile cyst duct and common bile duct demonstrate acute and chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis, 2 lymph nodes that were not malignant.
The septum of bifurcation demonstrated fibrous and granulation tissue with chronic inflammation and fibrosis and liver needle core biopsy demonstrated mild portal inflammation with focal bile duct proliferation, 2 minimal macrovesicular steatosis without intracellular hyalin or neutrophils.
Also trigone stain increased portal fibrosis, no bridging and iron stain no stainable iron.
Also make sure he has pulmonary toilet.
