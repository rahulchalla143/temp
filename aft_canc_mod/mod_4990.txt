CXR: [**2194-6-8**] opacity in the right mid and lower zones, consistent with pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle and some atelectasis at the left lung base.
[**2194-6-6**]: New right mid and lower lung zone opacities consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
[**2194-6-2**]:Decrease of the left retrocardiac opacity with mild residual atelectasis.
Slight increase of a moderate left pleural effusion.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Right subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with evidence of pull through.
Left lower lobe consolidation has worsened, could be atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe aeration have improved.
Right lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis has minimally worsened.
There is minimal right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.
No evidence of PE to the subsegmental levels.
46 x 47 mm chest wall collection inferior to the right scapula may represent a fluid collection.
Neighboring subcutaneous emphysema is present.
Minimally rim-enhancing subjacent pleural loculations are seen, which are also suggestive of an infectious process.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with some loculations at the right base, accompanied by neighboring compressive atalectasis.
the anastamoses appear intact, however, further evaluation is limited due to lack of oral contrast at this level.
[**2194-6-5**]: Lower Extremity Dopplers Occlusive thrombus is seen within the two left peroneal veins in the left calf.
IMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis in the left peroneal veins.
Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with pericardial fat pad.
Surgical laparoscopic jejunostomy.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy.
Diagnostic esophagoscopy.
Chest tube and JP was removed following the esophagus study which was negative for anastomotic leak.
Chest films: he was followed by serial chest films with showed bilateral atelectasis and small left lower lobe effusion.
On [**2194-6-5**] his chest film  Cardiac: He remained in atrial fibrillation 70-80 rate control on IV Lopressor.
Abdomen mildly distended, non-tender.
With rectal suppository his bowel function returned with decrease abdominal distention.
No episode of diarrhea his Pentasa was restarted.
He was volume overloaded gently diuresis with IV Lasix.
He was discharged home with 4 days of Lasix 40 mg and Kcl 20 mEq with instruction for daily weights and to contact his PCP should he require further treatment.
His warfarin 5mg daily was restarted [**2194-6-3**] for atrial fibrillation.
On [**2194-6-5**] he had lower extremity Doppler which showed Deep vein thrombosis in the left peroneal veins.
Chest X-ray showed aspiration pneumonia.
He had no further fevers.
Pain: Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural with good pain control was managed by the acute pain service.
Neuro: no neuro events or concerns during this hospitalization.
