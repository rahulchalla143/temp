The patient had an AGUS Pap smear followed by cervical biopsy and ECC in [**2196-6-12**] revealing atypical endocervical cells.
She had no prior history of abnormal Pap smears or cervical dysplasia.
On [**2196-11-14**], she underwent CO2 laser conization of the cervix with final pathology demonstrating both in situ and microinvasive adenocarcinoma with the lateral extent of the invasive component measuring 1.5 mm and deepest invasion 1.5 mm.

Limited exam, but no large or definite pulmonary embolus identified.
Interval development of multifocal bilateral patchy opacities diffusely within the lungs, but greatest in the lung apices.
This may represent an infectious process versus pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral effusions and associated atelectasis.
There is a small amount of free air visualized which likely relates to the postoperative status of the patient.
Interval enlargement of precarinal lymph nodes.
Previously noted pulmonary nodules are unchanged.
There are other nodular opacities, but these may reflect the infectious process or edema occurring at the current time.
Heterogeneous thyroid as previously described.
Please also see chest CTA of the same day showing patchy opacities throughout the lungs concerning for penumonia.
Free fluid is seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
There is no evidence of focal fluid collections such as abscesses.
CXR [**2197-2-4**]:  There is dense opacification involving both lungs, somewhat more pronounced in the upper zones bilaterally.
Differential diagnosis includes pneumonic infiltrates, CHF and ARDS.
There are dense, somewhat patchy alveolar infiltrates throughout both lungs, most pronounced in the upper zones.
Differential diagnosis includes pneumonic infiltrate, CHF and ARDS.
No effusion is identified.
CXR [**2197-2-7**]: Improving alveolar infiltrates which represents improving pneumonic infiltrate or CHF.
EKG [**2197-2-2**]: Normal sinus rhythm, without diagnostic abnormality.
Pulm: The pt had an episode of dyspnea and desaturation on room air to 78% on POD#2.
She was ruled out for PE by CTA on POD#[**3-17**], although she was shown to have a multifocal pneumonia.
Her oxygen requirement continued to increase until she was requiring 6L via face mask to maintain adequate O2 saturation; she was therefore transferred to the ICU for further monitoring on POD#3.
Her O2 sats continued to fall, and on POD#5 she became dyspneic and had another desaturation to 78% on room air; she was therefore transferred back to the ICU.
ID: The pt spiked a fever on POD#[**3-17**], and a CTA showed a multifocal pneumonia.
She was started on Levaquin for coverage of a presumed community-acquired v. atypical pneumonia.
She continued to spike temperatures in the ICU, and a CT of the abdomen was obtained, which showed no abscesses or postoperative fluid collections.
She continued to have fevers along with her desaturations on the floor, and official ID consult was obtained on POD#5; they recommended adding Vancomycin and Zosyn for more broad coverage for her pneumonia.
She completed a 7 day course of both the Vancomycin and the Zosyn, and did not spike fevers again after POD#8.
She was discharged home on no further antibiotics.
A FeNa was calculated at 0.45 on POD#3, consistent with intravascular fluid depletion.
She received Lasix for presumed CHF while in the ICU with appropriate diuresis noted.
CV: The pt was ruled out with enzymes for postoperative MI as a potential etiology for her desaturations on POD#[**3-17**].
She never had chest pain.
Heme: The pt had baseline anemia with a Hct of ~27 as an outpt, etiology unclear.
