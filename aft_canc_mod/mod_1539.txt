Admission Date:  [**2169-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-6-2**]   Service:  Neurosurgery/cardiac medicine HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 30097**] is a 79 year-old Russian male with history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2166**], status post left nephrectomy in 2,000, status post IL2 therapy, with lung metastasis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes who presented one year ago with an metastatic renal cell carcinoma in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
An MRI on [**2169-5-1**] showed a dural based mass involving the calvarium and superior sagittal sinus.
He was admitted on [**5-23**] for tumor embolization and left frontal parietal craniectomy with resection of the tumor and cranioplasty on the 13th.
On the evening of [**5-24**], however, the patient developed right arm Enzymes were cycled at that time and the patient ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction with troponin peaking at greater than 50 and CK of 1,014 with an MB of 82.
Electrocardiogram showed a new left bundle branch with ST elevation and T wave inversions in V3 and V4.
The patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease with left main disease and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed prophylactically.
At the time of our evaluation the patient had no complaints.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma left, diagnosed in [**2167-11-11**] with lung metastasis at diagnosis.
Patient underwent IL2 therapy beginning in [**Month (only) 956**] of 2,000 complicated by atrial fibrillation.
2) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation secondary to IL2 treatment.
He was in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed a bandaged scalp with an incision that went across the top of his head.
There were no oral lesions.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
On brief neurologic testing the patient showed no focal signs.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure and no focal infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram on [**5-17**] showed sinus bradycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy and left axis deviation.
There was poor R wave progression and left anterior vesicular block.
Electrocardiogram on [**5-24**] showed bigeminy with flattened T waves anteriorly and later in the evening with development of chest pain and new left bundle branch block.
Electrocardiogram on [**5-25**] elevations in V3 and V4 with T wave inversion.
Echocardiogram from [**2168-4-11**] showed left atrial enlargement with slight left ventricular hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram postoperatively on this admission showed left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement.
There was left ventricular hypertrophy.
Patient had pulmonary hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation and wall motion abnormality.
Cardiac catheterization on [**5-25**] showed left main disease with an ostial 38 or 40 percent, distal 90 percent, mid LAD lesion of 80 percent, diagonal of 100 percent, mid left circumflex of 90 percent with right to left collateral flow distally, RCA with 90 percent involving the PDA.
Given the patient's three vessel with left main disease the patient was evaluated by CT surgery.
With the severity of his disease, decreased ejection fraction, and other co-morbid illnesses the patient was thought to be too high risk exceeding the possible benefit of bypass grafting.
Given the patient's elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure of 26 the patient was diuresed and later started on a daily dose of Lasix orally.
As for the patient's atrial fibrillation with the patient's increasing risk of falling anticoagulation was discussed wit the neurosurgery team who felt that it would be wise to hold off on restarting Coumadin postoperatively and to re-evaluate this in one month after the patient is back on his feet.
On muscle strength testing the patient showed an upper motor neuron distribution of weakness with proximal muscle strength muscle groups being 4 to 4+/5 on motor testing.
A head CT obtained showed postoperative changes with edema and effacement of the sulci over the left parietal region.
There was no hemorrhage or infarction in any major territory noted.
MRI obtained showed mild compression of the lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**] on the left .
The patient will have follow up radiation therapy in one week with radiation of the sagittal sinus portion of the tumor that was unresectable.
3) Diabetes mellitus.
Given the patient's chronic renal insufficiency creatinine was followed daily, especially when the intra-aortic balloon pump was in place.
5) Infection disease.
For prophylaxis the patient was prophylaxed with heparin subcutaneously a well as pneumoboots and Prilosec p.o.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Status post tumor embolization and left         frontoparietal craniotomy with resection of tumor         and cranioplasty.
Postoperative non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with decreased left         ventricular systolic function.
Resolving right sided lower extremity hemiparesis         secondary to postoperative surgical edema.
Diabetes mellitus.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, the patient had a mildly elevated heart rate at discharge to rehabilitation in the 80s given his high dose of beta blocker.
