Mr. [**Known lastname 68713**] does occasionally have bouts of hypotension as he describes occuring about twice a week.
They are associated with some light headedness but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, arm/jaw pain, changes in vision or increased perspirations with any of these events.
He did mention one prior episode of syncope occuring 3-4 months prior assoicated with only light headedness and no other symptoms.
He also mentioned a decrease in his nutritional intake for approximately two weeks since his last admission to this hospital.
He does endorse anorexia and poor PO intake but says these have both been present for a while.
While in the medical ICU his initial SBP's were in the low 100s and had a few bouts of light-headedness but unclear if these were at the times of hypotension.
Patient received volume repletion of 3L in the ED, no additional volume in the MICU.
His pressures increased somewhat overnight without further volume adminisitration.
He did report a continuing cough that began approximately 2 weeks ago and is productive of white sputum.

Mild pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar opacities at the lung bases could be atelectasis, cannot exclude superinfection in appropriate clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 year old man with a past medical history of severe CHF, CAD, and s/p MVR presenting after recent hospitalization for GI bleed and endovascular infection with hypotension.
1) Hypotension: Differential is, of course, concerning including sepsis vs cardiogenic shock.
That being said pt had no fevers, is on broad spectrum antibiotics, and does not suggest any signs or have ECG suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
He also was minimally symptomatic and improved dramatically with fluid boluses suggesting perhaps simply dehydration.
2)Hx of GI Bleed/ UE DVT: Pt developed DVT in left arm around his PICC line.
Later on that evening he had a bloody bowel movement and his hematocrit dropped to 23.
His Hct has been stable since this episode and with ID approval we switched him over to oral antibiotics for his endocarditis.
He also has a questionable diagnosis of lymphoma that is being followed by Heme/onc.
3) Acute Kidney Injury on CKD: Likely due to dehydration from poor PO, which is also contributing to hypotension.
4) CAD: No signs of acute ischemia at this time and low index of suspicion for acute CV event causing shock.
Benzonatate was given for cough suppression and his symptoms have improved since admission.
7)Left nipple Melanocytic nevi- This lesion was found on admission physicial exam.
