The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Large, diffuse infiltrating mass within the right lobe of the liver with possible peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, left adrenal mass and multiple lung nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
Intrahepatic biliary dilatation, likely from the obstructing tumor.
Right axis deviation.
There is a late transition with anterior and anterolateral and lateral ST-T wave changes consistent with possible right ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2182-10-9**] right axis deviation is new and the ST-T wave changes are more prominent.
Large, diffuse infiltrating mass within the right lobe of the liver with possible peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, left adrenal mass and multiple lung nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
