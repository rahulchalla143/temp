She was in her usual state of health until Thursday, when she noted malaise and a vague sensation of difficulty breathing.
The remained "about the same", although with persistent general malaise until Saturday morning, when she awoke complaining of a sore throat and was noted to have swelling around her neck, "like a collar."
She was still able to speak, although her voice was very rough and raspy, and to take PO's without difficulty.
Of note, patient has had thrush in the past involving her entire esophagus, for which she still takes nystatin solution.
Patient began to experience difficulty breathing as was intubated.
Metastatic CA of unknown origin (likely breast given BRCA mutation):  metastatic to liver, lungs, omentum, bones (see Onc history below) 2.
Osteopenia  PERTINENT CANCER HISTORY: - A bone scan on [**2156-3-15**] showed multiple areas of increased tracer uptake consistent with metastatic disease in L1, the proximal right femur, bilateral sacroiliac joints, left ischium, and bilateral scapula as well as the occiput.
- CT scanning revealed multiple liver lesions as well as multiple small lung nodules primarily located in the right middle and right lower lobe, as well as a subcarinal lymph node measuring 1.2 cm.
There was also some nodularity of the omentum consistent with omental caking.
- Ms. [**Known lastname 58746**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a liver biopsy [**2156-3-30**] which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated with immunoassay positive for CK7, negative for CK20, negative for Ttf-1 and estrogen receptor, chromogranin, synaptophysin, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu.
A CA-125 was only slightly elevated at 56.
However, her CA27.29 was significantly elevated at 177.
However, given + BRCA1 mutation and family history, presumed primary tumor is breast CA.

INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with history of metastatic breast cancer with progressive shortness of breath and spiking fevers with left common femoral DVT.
Please perform CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolus.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is no evidence for central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
A filling defect in the right internal jugular vein is probably in situ thrombus related to the adjacent Port- A-Cath catheter.
The airways are patent to the segmental level bilaterally; however, there is mild interval worsening of the bilateral multifocal interstitial opacities predominantly in the upper lung lobes suggesting worsening atypical pneumonia.
Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema, predominantly upper lobe, and biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring are unchanged.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion, and no pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Mediastinal lymph nodes in the precarinal region and aortopulmonary window up to 7 mm wide, are stable, and do not meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Again seen is a wedge deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, unchanged.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Slight worsening of interstitial opacities within the upper lung lobes predominantly, suggesting worsening atypical pneumonia.

MRI EXAM OF THE LUMBAR SPINE  CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic breast cancer, assess for compression or tumor progression.
Extensive metastatic deposits are noted involving the lower thoracic, the lumbar spine and the sacrum.
No pathologic compression fractures are seen.
There is involvement of the pedicles at several levels.
Small metastatic deposits are also noted involving the iliac portion of the sacroiliac joint.
Annular bulge of the disc is seen at L4-L5 level with a left-sided facet effusion.
No spinal canal stenosis was seen.
IMPRESSION: Extensive metastatic disease involving the lumbar spine, the sacrum and iliac portions of the sacroiliac joints in addition to the visualized portion of the lower thoracic spine.

DR. [**First Name (STitle) 39063**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 58748**] Approved: MON [**2156-6-21**] 11:40 PM *  Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  66 W with undergoing chemothrapy for widely metastatic CA of unknown origin admitted with febrile neutropenia and soft-tissue swelling of the neck x 2 days.
#Respiratory distress: Patient was intubated in the ED for airway protection - no documented stridor or hypoxia.
Unclear etiology of neck swelling as below, although it was thought it may be angioedema as an allergic reaction from an ACEI vs peritonsillar or retropharyngeal infection.
CT neck in the ED did not show any fluid collection or abscess that would represent an infection.
On HD#3, pt developed the start of improved cuff leak around the ETT tube, and was evaluated by ENT who after a repeat CT neck was unchanged, and laryngoscopy was unremarkable, recommended for extubation.
#Fever Neutropenia: Ddx was broad in this neutropenic patient including bacterial, viral, and fungal etiologies.
Given concurrent neck swelling, was initially concerning for possible infection by oral flora including anaerobes and her history of extensive thrush is worrisome for possible systemic or localized fungemia.
She was started on IV Vanco, Cefepime, Clindamycin, and IV Caspofungin for broad coverage.
She did spike low grade fevers with a maximum of 101, antiobiotics were held, blood and urine cultures were unrevealing.
A chest xray demonstrated a possible early developing pneumonia, but this could not be correlated clinically.
As she continued to spike fevers, a CT scan was ordered revealing ground glass opacities in the Right lung fields, as she continued to spike fevers, she was placed on zosyn and vancomycin for the possibilit of hospital acquired pneumonia, in discussion with ID she was transitioned to flagyl, ceftazadine and vancomycin.
Her oxygen requirement continued to increase to 2liters and she continued to spike fevers, and pulmonology was consulted.
Azithromycin was added for coverage of atypical infections, and an induced sputum was attempted but no sputum could be collected.
In addition, legionella, and viral cultures from a nasal swab were collected but without growth.
Her azithromycin should be continued until [**2156-7-6**] to complete a ten day course from the day that she became afebrile.
* # MSK:  After call out from the ICU, she was noted to have increasing proximal muscle weakness as her steroids were tapered.
A cortisol stimulation test was performed to determine if adrenal insufficiency was a component of her weakness, she responded within normal limits to the cosyntropin stimulus, steroid myopathy was considered as an alternative hypothesis of her proximal muscle weakness.
An MRI of the spine while demonstrating spinal involvement was negative for cord compression.
# Anxiety:  She had continued anxiety during her hospital course which was thought to be exacerbated by her steroid use.
She complained of insomnia during her hospital course and was treated with trazadone and zolpidem with some relief.
Other etiologies for increased anxiety were negative, including UTI, thyroid, metabolic causes.
#  DVT: Noted to have a clot in the left common femoral, started on heparin drip, then transitioned to lovenox, noted to have an elevated antifactor xa, .
She had an episode of sinus tachycardia during her hospital course likely secondary to anxiety, she was monitored on telemetry and her cardiac enzymes were cycled without abnormalities noted.
#Lacrimal Duct Obstruction: Per daughters, improved since starting new steroid eye drops.
Her right sclera was noted to have a erythema and lesion, and optho was consulted and she was to follow up with a clinic appointment in 4 days.
# Metastatic CA of unknown origin: presumed to be breast CA, undergoing chemotherapy, was restarted fentanyl patch 25mcg q 72 hours.
R femoral line.
Discharge Instructions: Please take your medications as directed  If you experience increased pain fevers chills or other concerning symptoms please call your doctor.
