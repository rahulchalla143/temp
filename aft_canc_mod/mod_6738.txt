Sepsis:  The patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis during IR extrahepatic biliary drain placement.
It is likely that the patient became bacteremic during this procedure, given his hypotension and rigors.
At this time, there was also a verbal report of Pseudomonas growing in the bile culture, so he was placed on Cipro for double Pseudomonas coverage.
He was intubated for respiratory failure on [**8-29**], and his pressors requirement gradually increased.
# Respiratory Failure:  The patient developed respiratory failure on [**8-29**] and was intubated.
He was placed on ARDSnet ventilatory parameters and ultimately expired secondary to severe sepsis as described above.
# Pancreatic Cancer: Now widely metastatic.
Renal was C/S on this admission, and they believe the patient's ARF is likely [**2-2**] ATN (given contrast for CT, poor PO intake) v. renal obstruction.
