On [**2171-1-29**] pt felt lightheaded, sat down and then was found on bathroom floor (awoke when wife opened door).
He had sxs of dizziness, SOB, and pounding in his ear, but these improved.
In ED had CT chest confirming bilateral large PE and U/S of legs showing bilateral LE clots.
He had a STAT echo that showed RA and RV dilation with global RV HK and abnormal systolic septal motion.
He required NC for breathing and this was continued on transfer to the BMT service.
Started dendritic vaccine trial in [**Month (only) **] and was due for his third injection yesterday (not given due to PE symptoms--> referral to ED).
The percent of monoclonal IgG lamda has been in the 6-10% range over the past two years, with a slight rise to the 10% range more recently.
DVT 2 years ago, treated with coumadin for 8 months, negative hypercaog w/u   Social History: lives with wife and daughter in [**Name (NI) 13588**] works at [**Name (NI) 1819**], director of service - TOB rare ETOH, (-) hx IVDU  Family History: mother died lung cancer at age 72 father died of CHF, had MI in 50's  Physical Exam: T: afebrile HR 94-120 155/102 18 96% 2liters comfortable, no distress HEENT: NCAT Oropharynx clear lungs: CTA B/L No wheezing or crackles heart: +s1+s2 RRR abd: Soft NTND ext: R leg chronically larger than the L ; no edema  Pertinent Results: CT-A: 1.
Large extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Right upper lobe subpleural nodule with adjacent pleural thickening, concerning for carcinoma.
Nonspecific nodular opacities within the left lung.
This could represent a partially imaged normal structure such as colon or a splenule, but a soft tissue nodule cannot be excluded given that is not completely imaged.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity  size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Enlarged prostate .
ECHO [**2171-2-1**]: Bubble Study Limited contrast study was performed at rest with cough and Valsalva.
There  was no evidence of shunt across the interatrial septum at rest or with  maneuvers.
LENI: There is thrombosis extending from the right common femoral, including the origin of the greater saphenous, through the popliteal vein with non-compressibility and intraluminal thrombus.
On the left side, there is compressibility of the left common femoral vein, but intraluminal thrombus and lack of compressibility are present from the mid superficial femoral vein through the left popliteal.
- Bilateral DVTs .
male with MM and h/o DVT, treated with coumadin, who presented with bilateral massive pulmonary emboli.
# PE - Large causing compromised respiratory status and right heart strain - He was hypoxic to 85-89% with tachycardia on admission to ED.
There was no indication for clot lysis at this time as patient stabilized with regard to his O2 requirements and his hemodynamic status.
He was able to start ambulating the hallways without dyspnea without supplemental oxygen.
Known hypercoaguable complications from dendritic cell vaccine, although vaccine given several weeks ago, making this less likely.
New RUL nodule incidentaloma from CTA concerning for malignancy.
Liver hypodensities and soft tissue mass in abdomen also found.
# Ventriculomegaly - seen on head CT - Repeat head CT as needed  .
