**FINAL REPORT [**2132-5-2**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2132-5-2**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Findings suggestive of active bleeding within proximal transverse colon (3B, 276) and (3B, 274).
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no change.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis.
Impression: Erythema in the stomach body compatible with mild gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Avoid NSAIDS No source of GI bleed found, will proceed to Colonoscopy.
Post-Procedure Diagnosis - GI Bleed  Colonoscopy Report: Findings:  Contents: Blood was seen in the colon, with a pool of fresh blood seen in the sigmoid colon within a cluster of diverticula.
There was no blood seen in the ascending colon and cecum.
Protruding Lesions A single 3 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the sigmoid colon.
It was not removed given presentation with GI bleeding.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen throughout the colon with highest concentration, of moderate severity, in the sigmoid colon.
Potential site tattooed (where there was a larger pool of fresh blood) If no further episodes of bleeding, repeat Colonoscopy within a few months to remove sigmoid polyp.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo male presents with gastrointestinal bleed s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion, NG lavage likely negative.
Acute blood Loss Anemia, Diverticulosis with hemmorhage He was nitially admitted to ICU.
More likely lower GI bleed given BRBPR.
RUQ u/s was done and showed no e/o portal hypertension.
Hct and vital signs remained stable so patient was transferred to medical floor with plan for EGD and colonoscopy.
EGD showed gastritis but was otherwise normal.
However, colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis with evidence of fresh blood in addition to sigmoid polyp; polyp was not intervened upon at this time due to evidence of current bleed (planned follow-up in several months for removal).
IR and surgery were consulted given pt continued to have multiple bloody bowel movements; VS remained stable despite acute blood loss but pt was transferred back to the ICU for further monitoring.
Pt had CTA which showed findings suggestive of active bleeding within proximal transverse colon (see full report for details) however the patient stopped bleeding before intervention could be performed.
Decision was made to manage medically given stabilization of his hematocrit.
He had one further bloody bowel movement, but this was in the setting of constipation with straining.
His hematocrit was stable and no further bleeding.
# Chronic Stable Asthma.
