Admission Date:  [**2132-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-5-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-4-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**] Chief Complaint: chest pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: trans-thoracic lung biopsy bronchoscopy aborted   History of Present Illness: Patient is an extremely poor historian and much of the history was obtained from signout.
Per report Ms. [**Known lastname 112340**] is a 51 yo F with LUL and RUL FDG avid lesions who presented to [**Location (un) 1459**]/[**Hospital3 **] in [**Month (only) 958**] with unintentional weight loss and severe left sided chest and arm pain.
The radiologist described an irregular left upper lobe parenchymal opacity and recommended a chest CT.  She returned on [**2132-3-6**] where CT chest revealed a 2.5 x 4 cm thin walled air containing cyst, which contains a mural nodule laterally on the left.
The radiologist raised concerns for possible pulmonary aspergilloma or fungus ball.
There was also an irregular density at the right lung apex, a right hilar lymph node, 2 left hilar lymph nodes and upper lobe emphysema.
There were no effusions.
The radiologist raised concerns for a fungal infection such as mycetoma and/or malignancy.
The above imaging was followed up with PET here on [**2132-4-17**] which revealed FDG avid RUL, LUL, left axillary, left lung base and pleural thickening.
Blood tests from previous workup show negative Quantiferon TB gold, aspergillus fumigatus 2 bands positive, concerning for possible fungus ball, elevated esr with +[**Doctor First Name **] and DS-DNA+.
She was referred to IP for consideration of bronchoscopy for diagnosis and staging.
ECG showed SR 76, no ST changes, no priors for comparison.
On the floor, patient is in no acute distress, but c/o chest wall pain and some LUE pain.
By report from nursing, Pt had highly abnormal behavior, but patient able to follow commands.
States that Pt had a dry cough since [**2131-11-8**].
No fevers, no chills, no nightsweats.
Reports that Pt had greatly reduced appetite and has lost about 10 lbs unintentionally over the last 3-4 months.
States that Pt's mental status has changed only in the last 10-14 days, and attributes it to excess pain medications, which she says Pt takes (either oxycodone or hydrocodone) 2 pills every 4 hours everyday, although Pt started taking her pills 4 weeks prior.
Also says Pt complained about R arm and leg numbness and weakness.
No incontinence.
Pt has apparently had L scapular pain starting in [**Month (only) 956**].
Mother reports Pt had forgetfulness, personality changes, and confusion since [**2132-2-7**].
Pt had severe L sided rib and chest pain.
Past Medical History: LUL mass (Per Atrius Records) Elevated sed rate positive [**Doctor First Name **] abnormal CT with LUL mass, hilar lymphadenopathy   Social History: Lives with husband, mother is in from [**Name (NI) **] to help with her care.
Family History: No history of lung disease or cancers.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on admission: VS - Temp 98.2F, BP 110/70 , HR73 , R 18 , 98O2-sat % RA GENERAL - middle-aged woman, crying, complaining of severe L sided chest pain.
HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - coarse breath sounds throughout, worse on left.
HEART - RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 CHEST/BACK - severe tenderness to palpation of left chest and back.
ABDOMEN - tender to palpation in left abdomen, but not right.
EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs)  SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - A&O x name, unable to state location (city or country, but knows it's not [**Location (un) **]), does not know date.
Exam limited by lack of Pt participation, but Pt denied any numbness of bilateral upper extremities.
FDG avid right apical (SUVmax 6.02) and left lung (SUVmax 5.63) lesions concerning for malignancy.
Large left upper lung cavitary mass abutting the left chest wall with extension to the left axilla (SUVmax 12.3).
Left hilar lymphadenopathy (SUVmax 11.55) with adjacent compressive effect on the distal left main bronchus.
[**2132-4-23**] Radiology CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on the pre-contrast acquisition.
There is extensive left hemispheric edema within the temporoparietal and occipital lobes.
To a lesser degree, there is right temporo-occipital edema adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
These surround a number of intracranial masses, better evaluated on postcontrast images.
This lesion, along with all of the others, demonstrates a conspicuously very thin rim of peripheral contrast enhancement.
This lesion along with the associated edema exerts mass effect on surrounding structures, including minimal rightward deviation of midline structures, and effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
Superior to this, there is a 1.7 x 1.2-cm lesion in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe, with similar characteristics (3:21).
In the right parieto-occipital region, just inferior to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, lies a more irregularly-contoured lesion measuring 2.7 x 2.5 cm (3:13).
A distinguishing feature of this lesion is possible subependymal enhancement (3:9).
Finally, a posterior fossa lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere measures 1.6 x 1.4 cm (3:6).
Upon retrospective review of the prior CT (from PET study), although the masses cannot be visualized due to incomplete imaging through the head, unenhanced nature of the scan, and low-dose acquisition technique, there is some evidence of cerebral edema, suggesting that the masses were present at that time.
The major intracerebral vessels including the principal vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and the dural venous sinuses are all patent.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Several intracerebral white matter lesions with very thin rim-enhancement and extensive vasogenic edema; the differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease, or less likely, based on imaging characteristics, an infectious processes, such a pyogenic abscess.
The pending tissue diagnosis of the lung lesion should aid in refining the diagnosis.
Prelim examinations shows extensive lesions and edema consistent w/ prior CT head.
prelim PATH: poorly differentiated lung cancer  Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2132-4-24**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of excessive drowsiness.
There were no significant focal abnormalities to go along with the clinical examination and history.
No seizures were recorded and no interictal epileptic activity was identified.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-4-24**] 11:40 AM IMPRESSION:  Overall stable mass effect from the multiple intracranial lesions causing significant distortion of the midbrain, which continues to raise concern for impending downward transtentorial herniation.
However, the basal cisterns at this stage remain preserved  MRI: Rim enhancing lesions in the right cerebellum, left frontal corona radiata and left post-central region and right parieto-temporal lobes with surrounding edema and mass effect as described above; abnormal enhancement surrounding the right lateral ventricle likely representing subependymal extension.
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease versus infective etiology such as fungal, other etiology etc.
Possible leptomeningeal involvement given the subependymal enhancement.
NS consult/close f/u if no surgical intervention is contemplated   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 112340**] is a 51 yo F with LUL and RUL FDG avid lesions who presented to [**Location (un) 1459**]/[**Hospital3 **] in [**Month (only) 958**] with unintentional weight loss and severe left sided chest and arm pain admitted for expedited workup of lung lesions, now found to have altered mental status and brain masses.
#Non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis complicated by cerebral edema with encephalopathy and motor weakness.
Pt's alterness and interactiveness improved by mid-day [**2132-4-23**], but CT head w/ contrast showed extensive rim enhancing brain lesions and edema as described above, concerning for brain mets versus less likely infection.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and felt that imaging was consistent with metastatic disease, but could not rule out infection.
Given the extent of edema and pt's worsening mental status, Pt was started on dexamethasone 12mg iv x 1, followed by dexamethasone 4mg iv q6h.
Given changes in mental status and marked concern from neurosurgery consult service, discussed with Neuro-onc attending, who transferred pt to neuro-icu for dexamethasone (4mg IV Q6H and mannitol 25g Q4H).
At that point the family understands that the primary issues are to control her symptoms including pain, discomfort, agitation, anxiety.
Over the following 3 days she did not have any substantial improvement in her confusional state and her exam waxed/wanned between acute agitation with yelling, pulling at clothes/hair, and sedation.
Guardianship paperwork was completed as patient cannot make her own decisions and she has no healthcare proxy appointed.
#LUL mass:  Lung biopsy during this admission returned showing poorly differentiated cancer with squamous features.
# Chest pain: patient c/o chest pain on admission, likely related to her lung mass abutting the pleura.
However, pt was not tachycardic, and had no hypoxia so we felt PE was less likely.
ACS was unlikely given ECG with no changes and ongoing nature of chest pain with reproducibility on palpation and position changes.
# RUE, RLE numbness and weakness:  Atrius records suggest RLE/LUE sensorimotor neuropathies, but unable to discern on exam due to lack of Pt participation.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] mother describes that Pt has R upper extremity and R lower extremity numbness and weakness for at least 2 weeks.
Very likely due to multiple brain masses.
# Normocytic chronic anemia: Hct on admission 32, most recent baseline high 20s to low 30s.
Atrius records not c/w anemia of chronic disease or [**Doctor First Name **].
Possibly due to anemia of chronic disease.
Social work also helping with [**Name (NI) 1094**] mother's coping with new diagnosis of brain masses with poor prognosis.
Gabapentin was started a few weeks ago to try and help with her numbness.
