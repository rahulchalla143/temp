Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left partial nephrectomy   History of Present Illness: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 64 y/o F with history of renal cell carcinoma s/p right nephrectomy in [**2108**], subsequent CKD (b/l creatinine 1.6), hypertension and hyperlipidemia, with routine follow-up demonstrating a new mass in upper pole of left kidney, admitted on [**6-4**] for partial left nephrectomy, with post-operative course complicated by significant hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She has had persistently high supplemental oxygen requirements on the floor, and is being transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
During her surgery on [**6-4**], she had an episode of intra-operative SVT.
She was given 2700 cc of IVF during the surgery.
Last evening, she underwent CTA showing bilateral PE without evidence of right heart strain, but with hypoperfused pulmonary parenchyma in her left lower lobe, concerning for early parenchymal infarction vs infectious infiltrate.
On the floor, she reports that she currently does not feel particularly dyspneic at rest, but she feels significantly short of breath with minimal movement, including reaching to her tray to eat.
She denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, leg pain, numbness/tingling, or pain at her surgical site.
She has a good appetite, and denies nausea or vomiting.

# Hypoxia/Pulmonary embolism: CTA revealed clot burden in majority of pulmonary vasculature.
Hemodynamically stable but has evidence of right heart strain on ECG; troponin negative.
Significant A-a gradient on ABG.
Per primary surgery team, pt not a candidate for thrombolysis given recent surgery.
# Renal cell carcinoma s/p resection: No major surgical complications or blood loss.
Pathology consistent with clear cell RCC.
# Anemia: Low-normal MCV with significant hct drop 36 -> 31 in setting of recently starting heparin gtt and surgery on highly vascular organ.
No ecchymoses at surgical site or significant hematuria to suggest active bleeding, and blood pressure stable.
Throughout her ICU course, he had an active type and screen and 2 units crossmatched.
# CKD: Post-operative creatinine remaining stable from pre-operative level, although patient's renal functioning currently operating on one-half of one kidney.
Electrolytes within normal limits and does not have significant acidosis on ABG or chemistry panel.
She received MIVFs in setting of recent IV contrast load.
No hemodynamic instability.
AV nodal blocking agents were avoided to avoid masking tachycardic response to worsening hypoxia or bleed.
Current hypoxia felt most directly related to PE.
Has respiratory alkalosis on ABG, without prior pCO2 available for comparison.
# Gastritis/GERD: Continued omeprazole # Depression/Anxiety: Mood stable.
No adverse intraoperative events were noted (except Anesthesia noted paroxysmal SVT intra-op) but please refer to the detailed operative note.
Her post-operative course was complicated by hypoxia due to bilateral pulmonary embolisms for which she was initially started on a heparin drip and then transitioned to coumadin.
Ultimately she was discharged in stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics.
On exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or infection.
