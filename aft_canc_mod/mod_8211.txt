Per report she had a rigid bronchoscopy which showed that the previously placed silicon stent in her right mainstem bronchus was in good position but the lumen was clogged up with necrotic tissue/ tumor and secretion.
There were no clear operative complications and blood loss was estimated at 5cc.
However while in the PACU the patient had persistent hypotension to the 70s systolic and she received a total of 2.5 liters of fluid.
She was also given 40mg of solumedrol out of concern for adrenal insufficiency (was recently on a short course of prednisone several weeks ago, not currently on steroids).
She was mentating well and oriented X3  Past Medical History: -Depression -Stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma s/p chemo/rads  -Diagnosis [**2166-1-30**]  -Chemotherapy and Radiation in [**State 108**], details not currently available  -[**2166-6-20**] underwent cryodebridement of the RMS tumor and balloon dilatation of the right main stem and right upper lobe bronchus.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion  CHEST CT [**2166-8-1**]: 1.
Near complete right lung opacification is largely due to a combination of volume loss and infection.
The right pleural effusion is small-moderate, extending to the apex.
Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
The aerated left lung is clear with mild emphysema.
Narrowed bronchus intermedius and right upper lobe bronchus terminating abruptly.
Soft tissue encasing the bronchus is likely consistent with known malignancy and is best evaluated with contrast.
12-mm left pericardial lymph node.
Brief Hospital Course: 72F with stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma (diagnosed [**1-/2166**], s/p chemo/XRT) recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right mainstem and bronchus intermedius requiring stenting and multiple IP procedures, with R PleurX catheter in place, transferred to ICU for hypotension post-bronchoscopy, currently off pressors.
TTE showed no evidence of tamponade, but showed a trivial pericardial effusion.
After transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she did not require pressors and her hypotension resolved.
The differential was thought to include sepsis secondary to post-obstructive PNA, but more likely SIRS response post-bronchoscopy.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with normal AM cortisol.
#) Possible post-obstructive pneumonia:  Pt with tenuous respiratory status, spiked fever during ICU stay, and treated presumptively for possible post-obstructive PNA.
#) Dyspnea/Respiratory failure (hypercarbic and hypoxemic): Thought to be likely multifactorial in etiology, in setting of lung cancer, obstructive lesion, RUL collapse, pleural effusion, possible post-obstructive pneumonia, and ?
She has PleurX in place for palliative drainage of her right pleural effusion.
The patient was offered palliative thoracentesis for the left pleural effusion by interventional pulmonary and she has declined.
She has continued O2 requirement of [**3-7**] L NC and desats easily with minimal exertion.
Have discussed with interventional pulmonary and it is unlikely that further procedures would greatly change her course given her end-stage disease (see goals of care below)  We have initiated oral morphine for relief of dyspnea and she feels it does help her symptoms somewhat.
#) Lung Cancer: Stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma.
No further interventions possible by interventional pulmonary for her extensive disease, including right mainstem bronchial lesion.
#) Anemia of chronic disease: currently stable with Hct 23-24.
#) Goals of care: Pt expressed interest in palliative care/hospice options and she was seen by our palliative care team.
If her condition should decline, she should be offered the option of comfort-focused care (rather than transfer to hospital), with the goal of aggressive symptom relief and a focus on quality of life.
She met with SW several times during this stay as well as with palliative care.
She also received Reiki session for relaxation and seemed to benefit from this as well.

You had a complicated course here including low blood pressures and possible pneumonia, and you required care in our ICU.
You have been started on oral morphine to help with shortness of breath, and we encourage you to take this as needed.
