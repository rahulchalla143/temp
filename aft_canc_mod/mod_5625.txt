Admission Date:  [**2134-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14197**] Chief Complaint: High-grade sarcoma, left femur, status post fracture and intramedullary nailing with a locking nail, with extensive soft tissue mass with soft tissue seeding, status post preoperative chemotherapy and resection of presumed lung metastases and a brain metastasis.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2134-5-8**] left occipital craniotomy resection of metastatic brain lesion OPERATION: 1.
Reconstruction with total femoral endoprosthesis using a     GMRS rotating hinge and a bipolar hip (small 65 mm     distal femoral component, 80 mm connection piece), GMRS     proximal femoral component, and [**Doctor Last Name 3389**] polyethylene MRH     tibial-bearing component with a kinematic rotating     hinged knee.
History of Present Illness: Ortho Oncology:HISTORY:  The patient is a 60-year-old woman who sustained a pathologic fracture several months ago and was treated elsewhere with a locked intramedullary nail.
The lesion proved to be sarcoma rather than carcinoma, and it was felt that this was either a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma or an osteosarcoma.
The lesion grew significantly, and she presented to us with a huge soft tissue mass of the distal [**11-23**] of her femur, with tumor growing up to the skin near her biopsy site and along the tracks of the locking screws.
She also had some pulmonary lesions.
We then planned on resecting her 11 days ago, but when she was brought to the preoperative area, she had a field defect and was found to have a bleed and lesion in her occipital lobe.
She underwent biopsy and excision of the metastasis in her left occipital lobe 8 days ago.
It should also be noted that she had a DVT at the time of diagnosis and was treated initially with anticoagulation, but because of her brain metastasis and bleed, an umbrella was placed.
59 yo F with metastatic chondroblastic sarcoma of left femur s/p intramedullary nail fixation and chemo, DVT on lovenox who was scheduled to have resection of her left femur by ortho today however complained of right eye blurred vision and found to have a new likely hemorrhagic brain metastasis.
She reports 3 days of new headache with nausea and vomiting.
She attributed these symptoms to nerves and her glaucoma.
Neurology was consulted immediately and on exam patient was found to have a dense right visual field cut and anomia.
Stat head CT showed a left occipital bleed and patient sent to the emergency room for neurosurgery evaluation.
MRI/MRA/MRV was done and prelim read shows an enhancing lesion in the left external capsule/insular region suspicious for metastasis plus another area within the hemorrhage also suspicious for metastasis, making a hemorrhagic met more likely.
No evidence of amyloid or venous sinus thrombosis.
Serial neurological exams with plan to repeat head CT in the am.
Denies any n/v, headache, lightheadedness, muscle weakness or parasthesias.
No bowel/bladder incontinence.
No cp or sob.

[**2134-5-5**] CT Head W/O Contrast: Left parieto-occipital parenchymal hemorrhage with associated subdural and focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and surrounding vasogenic edema.
The constellation of these findings raises the possibility of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, although an underlying intra-axial mass, representing metastatis, with associated hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
17 mm left occipital and 5 mm left subinsular region rim-enhancing masses are consistent with metastases.
Stable parenchymal, focal subarachnoid, and subdural hemorrhage in the left occipital region, likely reflecting hemorrhagic necrosis of the larger metastasis, perhaps with contribution of Lovenox.
Normal cranial MRA and MRV without evidence of occlusion, thrombosis, stenosis, or aneurysm.
No change in the size or appearance of the left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhagic metastasis.
There is a stable, small amount of associated subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage adjacent to the lesion.
Small hypodensity in the left subinsular region corresponds to the known small non-hemorrhagic metastasis.
Persistent non-occlusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein.
Visualization of the left calf veins is limited, but there is apparent thrombosis of one posterior tibial vein, probable occlusive thrombus within one peroneal vein and non-occlusive thrombus within the second peroneal vein.
No DVT in right lower extremity.
[**2134-5-8**] MRI Head: Left occipital heterogeneously enhancing lesion from surrounding  edema demonstrated for surgical planning.
While the enhancement pattern reflects enhancement related to an evolving subacute hematoma, underlying mass or vascular lesion cannot be completely excluded.
[**2134-5-8**] Head CT: Left occipital postoperative changes with vasogenic edema and pneumocephalus exerting mild mass effect on the left frontal and occipital lobes.
[**5-9**] Brain MRI - residual hyperdensity in surgical bed, stable edema and post op changes  VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) RIGHT	Study Date of [**2134-5-12**] FINDINGS:  Duplex was performed of the right lower extremity veins.
MR THIGH W&W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2134-5-13**] IMPRESSION:  Large known osteosarcoma with multiple areas of fascial breakthrough described above and encasement of the deep femoral neurovascular bundle; increase in craniocaudal extent of mass compared to prior exams.
CT CHEST [**2134-5-14**] IMPRESSION:  New areas of wedge resections with usual postoperative appearance.
There are no new lung nodules.
New subcutaneous hypodensity in the right chest wall could be a seroma.
Liver hypodensity is incompletely imaged.

#Hemorrhagic brain mets: MRI on admission [**Last Name (un) **] 17 mm left occipital and 5 mm left subinsular rim-enhancing masses consistent with metastases, parenchymal/subarachnoid/subdural hemorrhage in left occipital region likely due to hemorrhagic necrosis of larger met in setting of lovenox.
Pt had an IVC filter placed on [**5-7**].
The patient was started on Keppra 1000mg IV BID for seizure prophylaxis.
The patient had a non contrast Head CT following surgery and it was consistent with expected post surgical changes including some minimal pneumocephalas for which the patient was placed on bedrest with the Head of the Bead at 30 degrees or lower and on a non rebeather at 100% Oxygen for 24 hours.
The patient was unable to move the right lower extremity antigravity but was able to wiggle the toes on the bed.
On [**5-9**], the patient complained of headache that resolved with oral Dilaudid.
Her pain was well controlled with oral medications.
