Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Multiple paracenteses   History of Present Illness: 56 year old man with PMH of HCV cirrhosis and HCC with vascular involvement with several admissions recently for hyponatremia and AMS.
He presented to the ED at GSH with presyncope and hypotension while at commode  and was given 3 L NS and 2 g ceftriaxone.
In the ICU, he was given 6.5 L of fluids and required a levophed drip and vasopressin.
He was deemed a poor prognosis and thus not a candidate for liver transplant, and also not candidate for chemo or radiation.
Past Medical History: 1) Hepatocellular Carcinoma - diagnosed in [**9-25**] after f/u labs for cirrhosis revealed an elevated AFP and imaging studies revealed infiltrative HCC with portal vein thrombosis.
2) Hepatitis C - Per pt.
His mother does have asthma and CAD.
He has a brother with heart disease and another brother who died of cirrhosis.
There is no other liver cancer that he knows of in the family.
Physical Exam: VS T 97  BP 118/62  HR 88  RR 16  Glucose 130  Weight 99.5 Kg GENERAL: Intensely jaundiced, having liquid stools, hostile and verbally agressive.
HEENT: Marked scleral icterus, somewhat disheveled CHEST: Crackles at bases CV: RRR, 2/6 SEM ABDOMEN: Very distended, positive fluid wave.
EXTREMITIES: Trace edema MENTAL STATUS: Hostile, verbally agressive.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Cirrhotic liver with poorly defined hypoechoic lesion better seen on prior exam.
IMAGING: [**2173-3-14**] CXR: Evidence of prior granulomatous insult as previously noted.
No focal acute pulmonary process.
[**2173-3-14**] V/Q scan: Low prob for PE .
[**2173-3-14**] CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 56yo M with HCV cirrhosis and infiltrative HCC with portal vein  thrombosis, admitted with AMS and hypotension/syncope.
# SBP: Diagnosed w/ SBP on [**3-14**].
Sensitivities on CNS and enterococcus returned on [**3-20**] and both are sensitive to vanco, so the patient was continued on vancomycin and caspofungin for 14d course but CTX was d/c.
# HCC: Given invasion into portal vein, not a candidate for radiation or chemotherapy.
His prognosis is extremely poor, and his life expectancy one month or less.
# ARF: Concerning for HRS and/or prerenal etiology.
He received 6.5L in the unit and urine Na was <10, so he likely he has hepatorrenal syndrome.
This is likely a trminal stage of his hepatorrenal disease, in spite of medication and optimum fluid management.
# NON-ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: AG of 13 (normal is [**10-4**]), mostly due to his low bicarbonate (bicarb ranged 13-16).
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Pt had no asterixis on exam, but AMS was most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
His mood remained very labile and on one occasion the patient almost hit his wife.
# ANEMIA: Hct remained in the high 20s, and his labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Not transplant candidate [**1-22**] HCC with vascular involvement.
