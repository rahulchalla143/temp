There is minimal subfalcine herniation without evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
----- Head CT [**5-4**]:IMPRESSION: Post-operative appearance to the brain without evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation, and with minimal leftward subfalcine herniation, that was also present on the prior study.
1.8-cm enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal lesion with hemorrhagic component, with edema that partially enters into right side of the splenium of corpus callosum, corresponding to the finding on CT scan.
The finding is most likely representing metastatic disease; however, other differential diagnoses include lymphoma and PNET.
----- Brain pathology: METASTATIC CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA most consistent with METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA.
Blood products are seen at the surgical site with a small area of residual enhancement suspected at the anterior margin of the surgical cavity.
Surrounding edema is again noted, unchanged.
No interval new abnormalities are seen.
----- CT torso:Large, heterogeneously-enhancing, necrotic left renal neoplasm, likely renal cell carcinoma.
Pulmonary metastases as well as a single probable hepatic metastasis are seen.
Filling defect within the left renal vein may represent non- occlusive bland or tumor thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo R-handed man with a history of HTN who presented to the ED with a 5 day history of headaches, clumsiness in his L-arm, and walking into objects on the left.
These symptoms had been fluctuating since onset.
On exam, he was very mildly inattentive, had a L-upper quadrantanopia, a L-parietal drift, and agraphesthesia in the L-arm.
CT head in the ED showed a round mass in the R-parietal region ([**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white junction) with extensive edema.
An MRI with contrast was ordered which showed the mass in more detail.
It was radiographically consistent with a metastasis.
He was then taken to surgery for tumor resection.
This went well without complication.
He then had a torso CT which showed a large 11.1 x 18.3 x 13.1 cm renal mass on the left.
It also showed evidence of bilateral lung metastases and probable liver metastases.
He was seen by social work here for assistance with coping and his new cancer diagnosis.
