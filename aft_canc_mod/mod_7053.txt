Admission Date:  [**2105-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-7-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-6-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: right sided body numbness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left craniotomy for tumor [**2105-7-9**]  History of Present Illness: This is a 58 year old gentleman with history that includes transient ischemic stroke 3 years ago who presented to an outside hospital today after experiencing right foot numbness at 0820 this am.
The numbness progressed quickly up the right leg to the right trunk, down the right hand to the level of the wrist, and further up the body to the right neck, face, and head.
The patient stated that it is difficult to move his left arm and leg due to the numbness and that he felt uncoordinated.
He reported that he had leg and arm weakness on the right, leg worse than the arm.
CT head was done showing a left lesion with hemorrhage.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  No clonus  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger on left difficulty on right due to weakness and decreased sensation, rapid alternating movements.
At Discharge: ________________  Pertinent Results: [**2105-7-3**] CT head 2.5-cm hyperdense extra-axial mass extending from the inner table of the left posterior frontal/anterior parietal bone with small surrounding subarachnoid hemorrhage and possible internal hemorrhage.
At the level of this mass, there is left parietal 4 x 3.1 x 2.4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
This may represent, though uncommon, a convexity meningioma presenting with intracerebral peritumoral hemorrhage.
[**2105-7-4**] MRA brain 2.5 x 2.2 cm extra-axial mass with surrounding meningeal enhancement and associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe with edema as described above.
The extra-axial location and involvement of the adjacent bone is suggestive of a meningioma but other forms of more aggressive extra-axial masses should be considered in the differential diagnosis given the presence of extensive hemorrhage which is somewhat unusual for a meningioma.
If clinically indicated, a hepatic MRI could be obtained for further evaluation as small cystic foci are difficult to differentiate from small solid lesions on CT exam.
Mild wall thickening of the distal terminal ileum which may represent an infectious or inflammatory process.
Nonspecific enlarged left retrocrural lymph node measuring 1.6 cm.
Two indeterminant left adrenal nodules, statistically most commonly adenomas.
14mm left retrocrural lymph node.
Multiple lesions within the liver, which were indeterminate on CT, most likely represent multiple biliary hamartomas or cyst.
No concerning liver lesion.
Two left adrenal nodules likely represent benign adrenal adenomas, but this is not definite as this was not a dedicated adrenal MRI.
MRI Brain [**2105-7-9**] Left parietal mass with invasion of the adjacent dural enhancement indicating meningeal mass, likely a meningioma.
However, hemorrhage would be unusual with a simple meningioma and an aggressive meningioma should be suspected.
Although flow is visualized in the adjacent superior sagittal sinus, thrombosis of an adjacent vein could not be excluded as a cause of hemorrhage.
No acute infarction.
No hydrocephalus.
No large area of hemorrhage.
Small postoperative subdural hematoma.
CT and MRI imaging demonstrated an extra-axial mass with surrounding meningeal enhancement and associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Appearance is suggestive of a meningioma, but given the associated hemorrhage other more aggressive lesions could not be ruled out.
CT abdomen/pelvis and follow up MRI showed no significant abnormalities to suggest malignancy.
5. psyllium     Packet Sig: One (1) Packet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for constipation/hemorrhoid problems.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**5-31**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
