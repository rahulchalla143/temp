51 yo male with DM, HTN, gastric cancer, stage 3C colorectal ca dx [**2105**] with extensive serosal and nodal disease at presentation.
He then had reversal of the colostomy and at that point was considered to be free of his disease but with significant risk given the the amount of disease when he presented.
He presented to an OSH on [**2107-12-18**] with constipation an nausea amd constipation, emesis.
He also had persistent LH which began after hernia repair in [**2107**] and at this time it was found that his cancer had recurred.
No CP.+ Subjective chills but no fevers.
He was admitted to the OSH from [**2107-12-7**] to [**2107-12-14**] for a ?
His abdominal CT on presentation demonstrated a slight increase in ascites, persistent small bowel dilatation and transition to decompressed bowel near the prior ventral incision area.
Possible peritoneal implant seen.
His oncologist thought that his sx were secondary to constipation and not frank mechanical obstruction.
He was treated with an NGT -> suction, IVF, NPO with plans to start chemotherapy and an agressive bowel regimen.
P/w N/V, looking obstructive, seen by [**Doctor First Name **], thought ileus.
In addition to abdominal pain he also feels pressure as though 10 people are standing on his stomach.

Small-bowel obstruction with transition point in right lower quadrant.
Diffuse ascites.
Large left-sided pleural effusion with mass effect on the mediastinum pushing it to the right.
No pulmonary embolism present.
Most Recent CXR ([**2108-2-13**]) - There has been a mild increase in opacification of the infrahilar right lower lobe, but not enough to call as pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion has increased.
On the left, despite the pleural drain is still small volume of pleural fluid but no pneumothorax.
Left subclavian line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins and a right subclavian PIC line passes to the low SVC.
Acute pulmonary embolus in the lingular and right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arteries.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, increased since [**2108-1-16**].
Intra-abdominal ascites.
CT Head ([**2108-2-11**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 51 year old male with DM, HTN, metastatic rectal cancer s/p resection, XRT with recurrence presents to an OSH 20 days prior with sob, abdominal pain, nausea, emesis and was transferred here for further management.
His abdominal pain improved after he started to move his bowels.
His PO intake remained poor secondary to nausea and poor appetite.
He subsequently underwent exploratory laporotomy, with hope of seeing a small obstruction amenable to surgical treatment.
Unfortunately, the ex lap was remarkable for diffuse carcinomatosis, with omental caking and an abdominal mass.
His post-op course was complicated a hospital acquired pneumonia (for which he completed a 14-day course of vanc and zosyn) and worsening ileus, with minimal flatus and bowel movements and no po intake for several days post-operatively.
In the interim, pathology from the ex-lap was noteable for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet cell features.
During the time prior to his transfer to the oncology service, he was also noted to have a large left pleural effusion.
Cytology from this showed cells consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
He was given 1 round of FOLFIRI in an attempt to shrink his tumor burden and improve his symptoms.
He continued to have abdominal pain and nausea, which would worsen when his NGT tube was clamped.
Of note, on [**2108-2-6**], the patient developed an episode of tachycardia, which was initially thought to be SVT.
CTA was performed because he did have a slight oxygen desaturation, and it was significant for a PE.
A CT of the head was performed and showed no acute process.
During this time, the patient was also noted to have a brief episode of neutropenia and fever, for which he was placed on vanc and cefepime for 2 days.
In the early morning of [**2108-2-13**], the patient had vomited and had an aspiration event.
CXR showed no acute changes.
Later in the morning, the patient began to have worsening respiatory status.
He became severely tachypneic and tachycardic and was transferred to the ICU.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) unit Rectal every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Scopolamine Base 1.5 mg Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 72 hr Transdermal ONCE (Once) as needed for secretions.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrent, metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma Malignant pleural effusion Ileus Pneumonia Pulmonary emboli Acute renal failure Hypoxic respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - always Level of Consciousness:Lethargic and not arousable Activity Status:Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital6 3105**] for worsening abdominal pain.
You were found to have progression of your cancer on surgical examination in the operating room.
Unfortunately, your hospital course has been complicated by many other medical issues, including bowel paralysis (ileus), pneumonia, blood clots in lung (pulmonary emboli) with abnormally fast heart rhythm, worsening kidney failure, and aspiration leading to respiratory failure.
Due to your worsening clinical status, the decision was made with your family to transition your care to focus on comfort.
