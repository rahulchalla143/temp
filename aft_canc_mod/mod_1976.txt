History of Present Illness: Mrs [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 74F who presents with a several month history of constipation, diarrhea, occasional nausea/vomiting, and a weight loss of approx 25lbs over the past 6 months.
She first sought medical attention 3 weeks before admission, when her workup, including colonoscopy and CT scan, showed a mass in the transverse colon.
Biopsy showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
She denies black or bloody stools, or dysuria.
Past Medical History: CAD with CABG in [**9-/2172**] Hypothyroidism Recent onset of heartburn symptoms, no formal dx of GERD  Social History: 30-40py smoking history Widowed for 6 years 3 Children  Family History: Mother died of pancreatic cancer, father of prostate cancer  Physical Exam: Physical exam on discharge:  VS: RRR CTAB Abd soft, non-tender with jejunostomy tube in place.
J-tube site free of erythema or induration.
A pre-operative cardiology clearance was obtained with no cardiac intervention required.
A CT scan on [**6-5**] for pre-operative planning was not encouraging, as it showed a metastatic lesion invading the mesentery with likely involvement of the celiac and mesenteric vessels.
She was thus placed in the MICU overnight at the advice of the cardiology service, who felt that in the unlikely event her HR dropped so low she was unable to support her blood pressure, it would be essential to have close monitoring.
On [**6-11**] she began to complain of a suprapubic burning pain, but a urinalysis was negative for UTI, and her pain was deemed post-surgical.
Do not drive while taking a narcotic pain medication such as percocet or vicodin.
Please follow the VNA's instructions for your tubefeeds.
If you develop fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting, cessation of bowel movements or flatus, difficulty flushing the J-tube, severe abdominal pain, or other concerning symptoms, please contact our office or a local emergency room.
