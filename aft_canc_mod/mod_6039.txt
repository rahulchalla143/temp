History of Present Illness: The patient is a 57-year- old female with no history of underlying liver disease who underwent a CT scan of the chest on [**2197-5-24**], for evaluation of chest pain to rule out a pulmonary embolus.
However, the visualized portion of the liver demonstrated an arterial hyper-enhancing lesion measuring 3.2 x 2.9 cm in segment VI of the right lobe of the liver.
On [**6-28**], an MRI demonstrated a 3.5-cm lesion in the posterior aspect of segment VII.
A follow-up MRI on [**2198-10-5**], demonstrated the mass lesion had increased in size, and now measured 7.6 x 6.5 cm.
A chest CT demonstrated a 4- mm, solid, noncalcified nodule in the left lower lobe that is stable since [**2196**], and presumably benign.
There were no other abnormalities.
