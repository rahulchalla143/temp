Admission Date:  [**2125-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-9-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Back pain, RUQ pain, dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right arterial line  History of Present Illness: 55 yo F w/history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the setting of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21344**] Lindau syndrome presented to clinic [**8-8**] she appeared ill and complained of three weeks worsening right lower quadrant and back pain, nausea/vomiting, weakness, fatigue, and inability to rise from a chair.
She also had two episodes of bladder incontinence during over the past two days.
For her hyperkalemia she was given 10 units insulin with 1 amp D50, 1 amp calcium gluconate, 30mg kayecelate.
For her neurological symptoms, she was given 10 mg decadron and head CT, and thoracolumbar MRI were performed to rule out CNS involvement and cord compression respectively.
The patient was having difficulty with word finding and was very sleepy after receiving narcotics.
Per these reports, she noted shortness of breath, dyspnea with exertion preventing her from carrying out activities of daily living, diffuse body aches, diarrhea and fecal incontinence.
Given the incontinence and thoracic pain, she had a neurologic work up for ?cord compression, and subsequently an c, t, l spine MRI which was notable for metastatic disease diffusely and evidence of epidural disease at the L5 vertebral body level, but no compression.
The patient received lasix, insulin, glucose and bicarb as well as kayexalate for electrolyte management, and also received a total of 3L of NS for acute pancreatitis.
She had a progressive O2 requirement with tachypnea and on the morning of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was satting 93% on 5L by nasal cannula.
She doesn't admit to increased shortness of breath overnight but notes that in general, her dyspnea has been worsening over the last few days.
She complains of severe abdominal pain, and admits to LH.
She denies chest pain, headache, weakness, but notes that she has severe chronic pain related to spinal metastasis.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia and volume management.
Past Medical History: Past Oncological History: Initially presented at age 9 with vision changes secondary to hypertensive emergency.
She was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma and underwent left adrenalectomy.
In [**2111**], she underwent a hysterectomy which was complicated by postoperative bleeding.
An ultrasound noted renal cysts leading to a biopsy of the right kidney, which was reported as normal.
She then did well until [**2120**] when she was diagnosed with an L2 vertebral hemangioma after presenting with back pain with radicular symptoms.
-Nexivar was discontinued in [**2125-5-29**] following progression of disease to her liver.
-In [**2121-5-29**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed left flank pain and hematuria.
Left radical nephrectomy on [**2121-6-2**] revealed a polycystic kidney  with five clear cell type renal cell carcinomas ranging in size from 0.6 cm to 9 cm.
There was no tumor invasion of the renal capsule, perinephritic adipose tissue, or large renal veins, and margins were negative.
No lymph nodes were recovered in the specimen.
MRI in [**3-/2124**] was notable for polycystic kidney disease in the right kidney and gradually increasing size of a lesion in the caudate lobe of the liver.
Biopsy of this liver lesion on [**2124-6-29**] revealed metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
MRI on [**2125-4-11**] showed growth of the liver lesion to 6 cm.
In addition, in the polycystic right kidney, there was a 5 cm mass with enhancement in the peripheral margins and septations, raising concern for a slowly growing cystic neoplasm.
The patient went off Nexavar because of progression in the liver and the development of a probable new tumor in the remaining right kidney.
Left adrenalectomy at age 9 and right adrenalectomy at age 18  for pheochromocytomas.
Biopsy-documented metastatic disease in the caudate lobe of the liver in [**2124-3-29**], after which the patient was started on  sorafenib.
Development of progressive disease in the liver and a probable new renal primary (or metastases) in the right kidney in the setting of polycystic disease.

Chest xray: - [**2125-8-16**]: Essentially unchanged chest radiograph with left atelectasis and pleural effusion.
- [**2125-8-15**]: AP chest compared to [**8-13**] through 17: Mild pulmonary edema is new.
Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened, and right infrahilar atelectasis is new.
Moderate cardiac enlargement persists.
Small left pleural effusion may be present, not changed appreciably.
No pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
No evidence of acute congestive heart failure or consolidation .
CT HEAD: - [**2125-8-16**]: There is no significant interval change compared to prior examination from [**2125-8-8**].
However, due to motion artifact, the study is limited and a subtle lesion cannot be entirely excluded.
No acute abnormality including no intracranial hemorrhage is detected.
Although no obvious intracranial metastasis was identified, small isodense metastasis cannot be excluded on this non contrast study.
Small hypodense area in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] might represent a metastasis although it is not a proper location for brain metastasis.
Somewhat limited examination due to the lack of IV contrast however no evidence for abscess.
Extensive phlegmon involving the peripancreatic soft tissues and the mesentery.
Liver metastases and bone metastases unchanged, pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion stable.3.
Multiple cysts in the right kidney with complex lesion in the right lower pole unchanged.
Compared to prior study, there is increased stranding surrounding the pancreas, tracking to the left paracolic space, with mild wall thickening seen in the descending colon.
Findings are concerning for acute pancreatitis.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No RV diastolic collapse.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
Small pericardial effusion without overt tamponade.
No evidence of cholelithiasis.
A mildly distended gallbladder lumen with moderate amount of sludge is not uncommon in an ICU patient.
Reidentification of known hepatic metastatic lesions and complex right renal cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 55 yo F with metastatic RCC in the setting of VHL who presented with acute pancreatitis from hypercalcemia, ARF, mental status changes, respiratory distress and significant back pain.
Respiratory Distress: Mild hypoxemia on 3L NC she was initially placed in a NRB and her O2 sats improved.
In the setting of severe pancreatitis we were concerned about ARDS, however, she never required intubation for airway protection.
Her CXRs on multiple occassions were clear without evidence of a consolidation.
However, she remained hypoxic most likely caused by continued severe LLL atelectasis + small pleural/pericardial effusions, as well as a depressed mental status.
Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine unknown admitted with Cr 2.1, likely compromised by L nephrectomy thus single kidney with polycystic kidney disease in the setting of VHL, >5cm RCC mass in R kidney.
Also in the setting of poor PO intake possibly pre-renal.
- Continued anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to chronic renal failure as pt   had low lactate levels.
- Multiple electrolyte abnormalities during admission including hyperphosphatemia &   hypocalcemia requiring therapy; Initially admitted with hyperkalemia &   hypercalcemia which resolved.
She initially received one dose of Calcitonin on the floor which is possible cause of hypocalcemia.
Another possibility of severe hypocalcemia was her pancreatitis.
Infection/inflammation w/increasing WBC and left shift - Had low grade fevers, however on steroids, at first stress dose then slowly titrated to down, however due to elevated WBC she was remained on stress dose levels.
- Known enterococcus UTI, not VRE colonized; unlikely source of infection.
Other sources of infection included pancreatitis phlegmon & pneumonia/atelectasis.
Abd CT showed large peripancreatic phelgmon with increased fat stranding likely resulting in considerable intra-abdominal inflammation.
Her Vanco was then switched to Meropenem for an abdominal source as noted below.
- Did not actively have any bleeding during admission, but there was concern   especially given known hemangiomas.
Acute Pancreatitis: Potentially [**3-2**] cyst from VHL complex or metastasis.
- Although admitted with elevated amylase, lipase, LDH & alk phos,ALT & AST remained nml.
Initially pt was not given aggressive IVF due to her tenous respiratory status.
She had Increased fat stranding and phlegmon suggests inflammation and likely infection.
Her pancreatitis was resolving but she had persistent abdominal pain with a very large 10cm liver mass.
An U/S was done c/w biliary sludge, however no cholelithiasis.
She was started on Meropenem for an intra-abdominal source of infection on [**8-17**].
Her pain was managed with dilaudid prn as her renal failure prevented use of morphine.
EF >75%, mild diastolic dysfunction.
-->Rhythm: Continued sinus tach (100-120) with frequent APBs, likely due to pain and    infection.
Also with a h/o pheochromocytoma on norvasc, labetolol and valsartan, which were all initially held due to hypotension.
During her course she became tachycardic HR 150s most likely MAT.
HR also controlled with pain control.
-->Ischemia: No wall motion abnormalities or signs of ischemic dysfunction .
Adrenal insufficiency in the setting of bilateral adrenalectomy, home steroid dependence, prednisone 5mg daily.
was placed on stress dose steriods due to hypotension and infection.
Metastatic RCC: CT scans negative for cord compression, however, 10cm liver metastasis, abundant evidence of probable VHL hemangiomas in the cervical, lumbar and thoracic spine.
Pt's pain was controlled with aggressive pain medication.
MS changes: Pt was drowsy and sedated, but appeared to be in pain with movement.
She underwent 2 head CTs which did not show an acute process, however due to movement, and a limited study, a subtle lesion could not be entirely excluded.
Despite no narcotics for several days she was not interactive or responsive.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had known advanced metastatic RCC with diffuse liver metastases in the setting of severe acute pancreatitis with a rising white count and continued MS changes despite electrolyte normalization and being off sedation.
- A family meeting with spouse addressing concerns of worsening status including   resp distress, an elevated WBC despite abx, & metastatic RCC, resulted in change of code status to DNR/DNI and shifting care to comfort only.
- A morphine drip was initiated to ease pain & make her comfortable; prior to CMO   she had adequate pain control via standing pain medications.
