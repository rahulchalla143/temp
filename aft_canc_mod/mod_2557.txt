There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Pulmonary pressures are likely elevated, but cannot be estimated reliably because of moderate to severe TR.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction with markedly depressed forward stroke volume.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with RVEDP 25mm Hg, mean PCWP 34mm Hg.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with mean PA 40mmHg secondary to elevated left-sided pressures with a transpulmonary gradient of 6mmHg.
There was marked respiratory variability throughout tracings.
Severely depressed cardiac output with cardiac index 1.21 with arterial O2 saturation by pulse oximetry 97% on room air and PA O2 saturation of 30%.
Cardiogenic shock with marked elevation in right and left heart filling pressures and low cardiac index.
[**2142-2-1**] portable abdomen: SINGLE FRONTAL SUPINE IMAGE OF THE ABDOMEN: The hemidiaphragms are excluded from the field of view as well as the right lateral aspect of the abdomen.
An electronic metallic device obscures the proximal aspect of the left femur, possibly the patient's mobile telephone.
Prominent hepatic veins, right pleural effusion, ascites, and diffuse gallbladder thickening consistent with the patient's known cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.
Tiny gallbladder polyps / adherent stones without signs of cholecystitis.
[**2142-2-2**] pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male w/ hx of NSTEMI, HIV (CD4 < 200), DMII, CKD, cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), Burkitt Lymphoma and Hodgkin's who presents with failure to thrive and decompensated/acute on chronic biventricular heart failure.
# Hypotension: He became hypotensive the day after admission with repeat echocardiogram suggestive of low-output heart failure.
He was transferred to the CCU for further care after small IVF bolus and broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated.
RHC revealed low CO and CI, and right sided failure primarily due to elevated left sided filling pressures.
He was started on a low dose dopamine infusion and milrinone was initiated which resulted in improvement in blood pressures, excellent urine output 10L net negative and weight loss with improvement in kidney function and liver enzymes c/w fluid overload as cause of both.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: His new TTE showed low-output biventricular heart failure.
He underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated marked elevation in right and left heart filling pressures and low cardiac index consistent with CHF.
Pt became orthostatic day prior to discharge with a rise in creatinine, and thus torsemide was held.
His volume status is difficult to assess on exam as he rarely has peripheral edema and tends to hold extra fluid in his abdomen.
# Chest Pain: Patient originally complained to EMS of chest pain but on admission to floor said it resolved two days prior to admission.
# Pleural Effusions/Burkitts and Hodgkin's lymphoma: Moderate right pleural effusion with a likely subpulmonic component on CXR from ED.
DDx included parapneumonic effusion vs. CHF effusion vs. malignancy (hx of lymphoma).
He underwent thoracentesis which showed no malignant cells and few macrophages.
However, he did have plamcytoid cells and large atypical cells with basophilic cytoplasm and nucleoli c/w immunoblasts.
# Urinary tract infection: He reported dysuria and had a positive UA.
# Diarrhea: Stool studies showed +ve c.diff so pt was started on a 14 day course of flagyl.
# Abnormal LFTs: RUQ u/s showed congestive hepatopathy and ascites.
LFTs improved with managment of CHF as above.
Pt also with oral thrush; he was continued on nystatin given his elevated liver enzymes.
# Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine elevated to 2.5 and pt was oliguric [**12-28**] to poor perfusion from heart failure.
# Type 2 diabetes, poorly controlled, with complications: HA1c 9 most recently.
# Mental status: Pt with no insight into his heart disease or AIDS.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical care  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease AIDS Acute on Chronic Kidney injury Diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: You had some chest pain and diarrhea and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with low blood pressure.
You were put on medicines to help your heart pump better and we changed some of your heart medicines to remove about 16 pounds of fluid that had accumulated in your lungs and abdomen.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
