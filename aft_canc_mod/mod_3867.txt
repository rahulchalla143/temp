Admission Date:  [**2107-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-3-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for tachycardia.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, PVD, among others, who presents with tachycardia, hypotension and respiratory distress.
He had no symptoms today of chest pain, chest pressure, or passing out.
He intermittently would have pain and was given morphine.
Additionally, he had complaints of abdominal pain and possible distension and was given morphine with episodes of pain which helped with the respiratory distress as well.

Squamous cell carcinoma of scalp 8.
Generally the patient was elderly male, somnolent, initially combative, and mildly jaundiced.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Posteriorly, he had diffuse crackles up to apices with high pitched sounds anteriorly and crackles.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops, though was difficult to assess given lung sounds.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and ?mildly distended.
The extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or xanthomas.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
No evidence for small-bowel obstruction or ileus with contrast identified within the rectum.
Small right pleural effusion and trace left effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Recommend advancement 5-10cm for optimal positioning.
Extensive degenerative changes within the lumbar spine without evidence of acute fracture.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left are again demonstrated with difficult comparison to recent portable radiograph due to positional differences, but slight worsening in the left lower lobe and slight improvement in the right lower lobes since the earlier radiograph of [**2107-3-26**].
As reported previously, this may be due to an aspiration pneumonia given the clinical suspicion for this entity.
The linear opacities at right base are not significantly changed.
Minimal apical pleural thickening is unchanged.
Mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.
Patient may have had a hypertensive crisis causing acute pulmonary edema, with resulting aspiration pneumonia.
Also may have had a brewing pneumonia which left him febrile and decompensated, resulting in pulmonary edema.
An echo did not show any new wall motion abnormalities or CHF.
CXRs showed no recurrence of pulmonary edema but persistent lower lobe consolidations.
He had copious secretions, requiring aggresive suctioning and chest PT in the CCU.
He improved over the first 48 hours without requiring intubation and his oxygen requirement steadily decreased.
He received chest PT to help with his secretions as well as an incentive spirometer.
He remained afebrile on antibiotics without white count.
He also had evidence of bronchospasm on exam, likely from the pneumonia, and was treated with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers which were changed to MDIs prior to discharge.
Patient continued to have excellent O2 saturationsm, was afebrile, and was discharged to rehab with levofloxacin/flagyl to finish a course of 10 days for his aspiration pneumonia.
Abdominal distension: On HD#3, developed progressive abdominal distension with initial concern for SBO despite the patient having flatus and passing BMs.
The CT demonstrated contrast reaching the rectum with no evidence of an SBO.
Serial exams revealed improving distension, patient had multiple bowel movements, and patient was tolerating PO diet at time of discharge.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Initially, beta-blocker was held as the patient was NPO with a well controlled rate.
Etiologies for the elevated INR included medication interaction (given levofloxacin/flagyl), decreased gut bacteria in the setting of antibiotics and poor PO given that the patient was initially NPO.
CAD: Ruled out acute MI with serial cardiac enzymes.
Pump: Clinical exam initially consistent with left sided heart failure and has some improvement after aggressive diuresis.
However echo with no obvious ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction with an LVEF >50%.
There is, however, no documentation of that diagnosis.
Elevated Indirect bilirubinemia: There were no signs of cholecystitis on exam or imaging.
Does have history of cholelithiasis.
However given that it is indirect, may be secondary to mild hemolysis in the setting of hydrea.
His hematocrit remained stable throughout and there were no signs of significant hemolysis.
His Tbili trended down throughout admission with normal LFTs throughout and no abdominal pain.
Macrocytosis was felt to be, at least in part, due to hydrea therapy.
Ferritin was elevated with a normal iron and low TIBC; could be partly due to anemia of inflammation.
