1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: Differential diagnosis was originally exacerbation of bleomycin induced lung injury, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, as well as atypical pneumoniaa.
Patient was originally placed on steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a BAL was performed, which was negative for eosinophils or PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan showed diffuse alveolar filling and interstitial fibrosis consistent with bleomycin toxicity.
Over the course of several hospital days, patient developed several acute episodes of worsening hypoxia, mostly with agitation and with movement.
A further workup was performed, which revealed pneumomediastinum seen on CXR, with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum on CT with no abdominal perforation or pneumothorax.
The pneumomediastinum was likely secondary to barotrauma, and resolved with serial CXRs.
An echo was performed to rule out a shunt as cause of hypoxia, and was found to be negative.
A decompression needle was kept at the bedside for acute pneumothorax.
Efforts were made to adjust patient's vent settings and to wean her oxygen to minimize bleomycin lung toxicity, but patient was unable to tolerate weaning with acute desaturations and episodes of hypoxia.
Patient had a surgical tracheostomy placed, with efforts to wean oxygen and perhaps go to rehabilitation.
However, she continued to have high oxygen requirements, and no improvement in her clinical status.
2) Neutropenic fever.
Patient originally had a fever to 105 after the initial BAL, which was thought to be transient bacteremia.
She continued to have fevers intermittently, with persistently negative cultures.
She was then taken off her antibiotics, during which time she became hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring fluid boluses.
She then was placed back on antibiotics, improved initially, but then continued to have hypotension and tachycardia.
4) Anemia/thrombocytopenia/leukopenia: Her pancyopenia was thought to be secondary to recent chemotherapy vs marrow suppression from drugs or from her NHL.
Her blood sugars improved with decrease in steroid dose.
She had an attempted PEG tube placement but had decreased oxygen saturations during the procedure, and it was aborted.
She then had air under the diaphragm, and tube feeds were held for several days.
