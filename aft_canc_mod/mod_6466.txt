The appearances are most suggestive of metastatic disease.
No other foci of abnormal enhancement are seen.
MRI Head [**1-31**]: 1.5 cm enhancing lesion at the frontal left [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction with surrounding edema.
The appearances are most suggestive of metastatic disease.
No other foci of abnormal enhancement are seen.
Functional MRI [**2-6**]: FINDINGS: There is an unchanged left frontal mass lesion with significant associated vasogenic edema previously demonstrated by MRI on [**2177-1-31**].
The functional MRI demonstrates the expected activation areas during the movement of the hands and feet, during the movement of the left hand, there is a possible supplementary area adjacent to the mass lesion versus venous contamination (601B:9).
The functional MRI of the language demonstrates the major activation areas on the left cerebral hemisphere, likely related with dominance.
During the movement of the tongue, there are activation areas surrounding the mass lesion posteriorly (1000:8) and apparently at less than 1 cm of distance from the mass lesion.
The ASL sequence demonstrate avid pattern of perfusion within the mass, suggesting increased vascularity.
During the movement of the left hand, there is a possible supplementary area at the left frontal cortex versus venous contamination.
During the movement of the tongue, there is an area of activation posterior to the mass lesion described in detail above.
The ASL sequence demonstrates avid pattern of perfusion within the mass, suggesting hypervascularity.
CT Head [**2-6**](post-op): NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: The patient has undergone interval left frontotemporal craniotomy, with expected postoperative changes including soft tissue swelling and both intra- and extra-cranial gas.
There is minimal high density overlying the left frontal mass resection site, which could represent small amount of blood products (2:20).
There is also tiny amount of high density remaining in the resection bed (2:21) which could represent either new blood product or hyperdense material remaining from previously seen hyperdense mass.
Large amount of surrounding vasogenic edema has not changed, causing local sulcal effacement but no shift of normally midline structures.
No acute large vascular territory infarction, or hydrocephalus is seen.
There is tiny overlying extra-axial high density which could represent postoperative blood products.
Unchanged vasogenic edema causing sulcal effacement.
Expected post-surgical change status post left frontoparietal craniotomy with mass resection.
No new hemorrhage or enhancing mass.
Vasogenic edema is unchanged.
Small amount of blood product with subtle peripheral enhancement and restricted diffusion at the surgical margin likely represent expected post-surgical change.
L frontal brain met: Pt presented with LOC/seizure and new R arm weakness and R facial weakness with aphasia.
Aphasia quickly improved however, R arm and face weakness remained constant.
ST depressions on admission: Likely rate related.
The patient was taken to the OR on [**2177-2-6**] for a L frontal craniotomy for resection of the mass.
He tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications.
The preliminary path report was positive for metastatic renal cell CA.
Due to the proximity of the lesion to the motor control for the tongue, a formal speech and swallow examination was obtained.
He was also evaluated by Speech/Swallow, due to his difficulty with speaking and swallowing, who changed his diet order to Ground solids and thin liquids.
He attempted to speak on POD 5, which was an improvement from the day before, and he also did have a slight increase in his RUE strength.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Renal Cell CA w/left frontal lobe metastasis   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS WOUND CARE: ??????
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
