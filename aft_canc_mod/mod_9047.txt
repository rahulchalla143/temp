The patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the emergency department because of increased oxygen requirement.
Her MICU course was notable for an ongoing AG and non-AG acidosis attributed to the combination of renal failure/ketosis and diarrhea, which has since improved with HD x 1, lessening diarrhea, bicarb, and lasix.
She also had an ongoing respiratory  acidosis from hypercarbia, likely [**2-22**] underlying poor lung reserve and fatigue.
Her course was also notable for a fluid overload state given evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and exam, requiring agressive diuresis with lasix gtt and IV chlorothiazide.
After her diarrhea, fever, ARF and metabolic acidosis improved, she was transferred to medicine floor for further care with a 5.5 L oxygen requirement.
Fever - resolved after transfer to the medical service.
Surveillance cultures remained negative, patient remained stable without a fever or white count.
Her urine on [**2125-7-6**] also grew out <10,000 Enterococcus senstive to IV vanc but resistant to tetracycline.
Her initial fever on presentation was attributed to a GI source, give negative blood, urine, and stools cx.
Hypoxia - required 6 L -> NRB on admission from her baseline of 2 L NC.
This was all most likely [**2-22**] lymphangioleimeimatosis combined with fluid overload; no sign of pneumonia on CXR.
With diuresis, her pulmonary edema removed and her oxygenation status  returned to baseline of 2 L NC.
On d/c to rehab she was subjectively near her baseline, but allowed to remain on 3L since she is not at risk for oxygen toxicity at that level .
ESRD s/p transplant with ARF - likely intrinsic process as FENa of 1.21% and  FeUrea = 47.8; no evidence of obstruction on U/S; creatinine stable at 4.0 - cont immunosuppressants for now - restrict phosphate and potassium intake - may require HD in the future, patient refusing currently; transplant renal followed during course - need to follow renal function carefully as pt may require HD in the near future .
NIDDM - initially on a HISS during her course, added NPH due to elevated BS on a HISS.
HTN - continued norvasc and metoprolol, BP well controlled .
