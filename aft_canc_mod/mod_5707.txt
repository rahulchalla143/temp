Admission Date:  [**2154-6-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-7-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-5-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Antihistamines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Planned admission for ERCP to dilate post-stent stenosis of CBD  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP Biliary drain procedure by IR X 3   History of Present Illness: 70 year old female with a history of metastatic colon ca to liver and lungs, admitted following ERCP to dilate post-stent stenosis of CBD.
Briefly Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 98372**] was diagnosed with metastatic Colon cancer in [**2148**] and treated with resection and 5FU / Leucovorin.
She has had multiple biliary stents placed in the past for obstructive disease.
Recently her bilirubin has been elevated and she has undergone several ERCP's with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was unable to remove all of the sludge distal to the stents.
Her chemotherapy regimen has been held for the past several weeks due to the elevated bili and it was recommended that she have the percutaneous biliary procedure which was performed on [**6-6**].
Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal right hepatic system.
No f/c/n/v/SOB since recent discharge.
Past Medical History: CVA on plavix, with residual deficit of dysarthria Hypothyroidism Pre-Diabetes HTN Patent foramen ovale .

Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal right hepatic system.
Successful replacement of pre-existing left biliary drainage tube with a 6F nephrostomy catherter for external drainage.
[**6-21**] CXR There is a large mass (4.7 x 5.7 cm) at the left lung apex.
Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.
No acute pneumonic infiltrate identified.
The stomach was normal with no blood within.
There was a small mount of ooze around the previously placed metal stent.
There was no blood draining from the stent.
The ooze was flushed several times and seemed to be originating from the periampullary area secondary to trauma from IR stent insertion +/- metal stent change of position.
[**6-21**] GI Bleeding study: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minuteswere obtained.
Dynamic blood pool images show increased uptake throughout possibly small bowel seen only in the delayed images (60-90).
The precise cause of the increased uptake or the location cannot be determined.
IMPRESSION: Increased uptake possibly in the small bowel seen only in the delayed images (60-90min) likely representing slow upper GI bleeding.
[**6-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis: CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple lung nodules at the lung bases.
A right upper lobe nodule has increased in size and now measures 0.6 x 0.6 cm (series 4, image 1).
There is a small amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
The subcapsular mass in the lateral right lobe which previously measured 2.1 x 2.2 cm is now ill- defined, perhaps secondary to phase of contrast administration, but measures approximately 2.2 x 1.2 cm.
There remains mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, which has decreased and an expected small amount of pneumobilia.
There is evidence of tumor extension up the porta hepatis encircling the left portal vein, decreased compared to the prior study.
Lymph nodes within the porta hepatis, some with mucinous calcification are unchanged.
A cystic lesion in an enlarged spleen is stable.
A new 1.6 x 1.0 cm left adrenal nodule likely represents metastasis.
Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is a small ventral hernia containing unremarkable appearing mesentery.
There is mild sigmoid diverticulosis.
There are no enlarged lymph nodes and no free fluid within the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
New left adrenal lesion suspicious for metastasis.
Enlargement of right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
The right lateral hepatic lesion is more ill-defined but has likely mildly decreased in size as has tumor extending up the porta hepatis.
Smaller apparent size of left apical mass, which may related to technique.
Bibasilar opacities, probably atelectasis  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 70 F metastatic colon ca admitted for for ERCP to dilate post-stent stenosis of CBD.
# Hyperbilirubinemia:  It was never completely clear why we were unable to get her bilirubuin down further than we did.
[**2-15**] paraneoplastic syndrome.
A bleeding scan suggested an upper-GI bleed.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and an EGD was performed which showed a slow bleed from around the site of entry of the CBD into the duodenum, thought to be secondary to prior procedures.
The bleeding had stopped by the end of th EGD.
Vanc/Zosyn were started with concern for biliary source with possible catheter-site infection.
On approximately [**6-27**], Vancomycin was stopped and she was switched to unasyn, based on sensitivities (her biliary fluid grew out enterococcus and K.
She remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course.
- On [**6-26**], IR performed another cholangiogram as her bilirubin was persistently elevated and her drains seemed only to be intermittently draining.
- She is at very high risk for infection given her 2 biliary drains.

# Metastatic colon cancer: tx per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] covering initially and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] took over her care prior to D/c) - her colon cancer does not appear to be very agressive but she likely cannot receive any further chemotherapy [**2-15**] hyperbilirubinemia - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will continue to follow her bilirubin/CBC as an outpatient.
