There is increased mean transit time with matched decreased blood volume and blood flow in the right frontoparietal lobes, with associated mild hypodensity, consistent with an acute infarction in this region.
Chronic left middle cerebral artery infarction involving the M1 segment on the left, with associated hypodensity in this region.
Hyperdense focus in the right occipital lobe is suggestive of hemorrhage or recanalized vessel.
Large right acute MCA territory infarct and left acute on chronic MCA territorial infarct with associated laminar necrosis and hemosiderin deposition.
Multiple smaller acute infarcts in the supratentorial and infratentorial brain suggesting thromboembolic origin.
Left M1 occlusion, right MCA superior division occlusion and moderate to severe narrowing of the M2 segment of the right MCA.
Newly appeared is a complete atelectasis of the middle lobe, causing enlarged right hemithorax basal parenchymal opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt was a 66 yo F with CAD, DVT, L MCA stroke [**2186**] who presented with decreased responsiveness and was found to have new bilateral MCA strokes.
# Neuro: On admission exam, pt did not open eyes to voice or sternal rub.
Her eyes crossed midline R to L and L to R, decreased tone and decreased spontaneous movements in the LUE and increased tone/reflexes in the right hemibody.
Her combined -now bilateral- MCA strokes (one old, one new L MCA stroke) would likely have led to significant disability with increased weakness.
The cause of her stroke was most likely embolic in the setting of a hypercoaguable state secondary to malignancy.
Pneumonia on chest x-ray.
# Cardio: On admission, pt had troponin elevation with peak of 0.54, down to 0.43 today.
# Code: Transitioned to comfort measures only as above.
