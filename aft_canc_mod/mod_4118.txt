Admission Date:  [**2187-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-9-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2146-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NMED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Generalized seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 41 yr old man with known recurrent glioblastoma multiforme that is managed by a Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
According to eyewitnesses, the patient became rigid sitting in his chair watching the baseball game, and was carried out of his chiar by family and friends.
The family was able to tell me that the patient was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme in [**2186-5-2**], and had 70% of the tumor removed last year with a left frontal lobectomy.
His presenting symptom which led to the diagnosis of the tumor was a seizure, and he has had various types of seizures since, including GTC.
Physical Exam: PE:  T-afeb   BP-119/71   HR-95   RR-9 Gen:  lying in bed, intubated sedated Heent: L frontal craniotomy scar Neck: supple, no carotid bruits Chest: clear to auscultation b/l CV:regular rate, normal s1s2, no m/r/g  Neurologic Exam:  MS: The patient is non-verbal and intubated with sedation.
Motor: With the patient on sedatives and neuromusculal blocking agents it is difficult to assess tone.
Reflexes: There are [**3-7**] reflexes present and symmetric Plantar reflexes extensor on left, flexor on right.
He was given 12mg of ativan and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Allowing for the limitations, there is no gross acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a large left frontal mass with extensive associated edema and areas of calcification in the region of the rostrum of the corpus callosum.
There is hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, suggestive of the mass crossing into the right via the corpus callosum.
There is extensive mass effect with flattening of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is likely some degree of mild subfalcine herniation as well.
There is also a focal area of decreased attenuation in the anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe, with effacement of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
The differential diagnosis includes extension of tumor or infarct.
Post craniotomy changes are present in the left frontal region.
There is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.
He remained seizure free.
Dilantin was tapered to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] due to drug-drug interaction which lowers levels of chemotherapeutic agents.
On [**9-14**], he was noted by his sitter to be "shaking", RN notes indicate a post-ictal confusional state.
It is unclear if this event was an electric seizure or his baseline tremulousness.
There is a concern that these new events and worsening of his functional status are due to progression of his GBM.
