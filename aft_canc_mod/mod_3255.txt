There she was diagnosed with the invasive SCC and a potential & vesicovulvar fistula by dye test (but not on cysto).
She was treated for a pseudomonas UTI s/p Zosyn, and was then found to have VRE growing from the vulva ulcer/fistula?
On [**12-11**] she underwent a CT abdomen with iv contrast to evaluate for metastases, which was concerning for possible liver metastases, but could not be confirmed on US and repeat CT without contrast here.
Despite the worsening renal failure the pt was initially continued on Atenolol and Glyburide.

Cardiomegaly without evidence of failure.
Patholgically enlarged left inguinal lymph nodes are concerning for nodal metastases.
These lesions would be amenable to ultrasound guided biopsy.
Bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and anasarca consistent with patient's known CHF.
Large anterior abdominal wall hernia containing a normal appearing loop of transverse colon.
Atrophic kidneys consistent with patient's known renal failure.
Rapidly developed anuria and was transferred from the gynecology service to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Initially urology was consulted for concern of obstructive uropathy playing a role, they were recommending a renal scan.
However after discussion with the family in the ICU the decision was made not to persue dialysis or other invasive treatment and make the patient comfort measures only.
2. hypoglycemia: She developed hypoglycemia in the setting of being on glyburide with rapidly declining renal function.
SCC of vulva: Extensive disease, with evidence of a vessiovulvar fistula.
CHF: Developed increasing CHF as her renal function declined.
