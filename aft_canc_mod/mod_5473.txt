The course thereafter is not entirely clear, however, he presented to OSH again in [**8-22**] with septic left joint at which time he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and repeat arthrocentesis was performed with fluid showing 406,000 WBC with 91% PMNs.
CAD - s/p CABG #.
s/p Left TKA 20 years ago - s/p septic arthritis complicated by sepsis and ARF - required Operative washout and debridement - plan for potential revision of knee replacement after 6 week antibiotic course with CTX and Rifampin #.
DM - Insulin dependent #.
Hypertension #.
Anemia secondary to CKD and MDS  Social History: Occupation: retired school teacher Living situation: lives in 2 story home on [**Location (un) 448**] w/ 12 stairs to enter building, son and daughter-in-law on [**Location (un) **] Key relationships: 2 sons [**Name2 (NI) 1959**] and [**Name (NI) **]) and daughter-in-law [**Doctor First Name 67970**] wife) Smoking, EtOH: [**7-22**] drinks per week, no tob or ilicits   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Tmax: 36.7 ?????
HEENT: Pupils 2mm and minimally reactive but symmetric, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea NECK: No JVD, trachea midline COR: RRR, nml S1, S2, no M/G/R appreciated.
PULM: Lungs CTAB anteriorly, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no masses appreciated EXT: Left leg in knee immobilizer with blood in drain from knee.
SKIN: Pale, intermittently diaphoretic, No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Diffuse pneumatosis intestinalis with superior mesenteric and portal venous gas as well as colonic wall thickening.
Overall, this is very concerning for ischemic/infarcted bowel.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
[**10-31**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild to moderate regional systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior walls.
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation.
The patient additionally developed melana and a CT-scan of the abdomin was performed.
The results were consistent with severe mesenteric ischemia and after lengthy discussion the family chose to defer further treatment.
Anemia:  Chronic and thought to be in setting of CKD and MDS per last admission note.
Now with acute blood loss in the OR.
Acute drop likely due to blood loss from surgery as no other clear source of bleed currently.
# CAD:  As outlined above, clear concern for ischemic event despite no significant EKG changes.
# Respiratory failure:  Remained intubated post op in the setting of hypotension and multiple metabolic abnormalities.
CXR essentially clear so no clear underlying pulmonary process (beyond ?
# Oligo-/Anuria:  Only 100cc out in the OR and 25cc since admission to the ICU.
Differential includes poor forward flow [**2-15**] hypovolemia vs. d/t depressed EF/CO vs. ATN secondary to intraop hypotension vs. contrast injury.
Pt with worsening renal function.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Brief run of a fib with RVR during CVL placement at which time he dropped his BP.
- holding BB for hypotension - holding coumadin given concern for continued bleeding  # HTN:  As above, holding antihypertensive med for hypotension.
Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO Q6H prn pain 16.
