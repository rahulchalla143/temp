Buttressing of intrathoracic anastomosis with     pericardial fat.
He was known to have bulky disease along the gastrohepatic ligament and left gastric artery; he was informed prior to surgery that if these nodes were not resectable then the esophageal resection would not be performed.
He understood the risks and benefits and elected to undergo a minimally invasive esophagectomy.
Past Medical History: C5/6 herniated disc s/p surgery with a metal plate implanted and congenital abscence of his lower arm.
No pneumothorax has developed.
The previously present extensive right-sided chest wall emphysema has decreased.
No new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities are identified.
Barium flowed freely from the upper esophagus beyond the gastroesophageal anastomosis, which by imaging features and the operative report was at the level of the carina.
There was no leak of contrast.
There was no holdup of contrast.
Neuro: Pain was initially well controlled with an epidural.
Pain remained well controlled on oral medications.
CV: Initially he had some episodes of hypotension with systolic BP to the 80's in PACU; epidural was decreased and this resolved.
For the remainder of his hospital stay he was hemodynamically stable with no issues.
He had no cough or shortness of breath.
Of note his chest xrays did demonstrate increasing amounts of subcutaneous air, but there was no other evidence of leak and he remained clinically stable.
After negative swallow study on POD 6 his chest tube was removed and post pull CXR showed no pneumothorax.
CXR on day of discharge showed interval decrease in subcutaneous air from prior day.
His feeds were increased by 20cc/day until he reached goal rate and he tolerated this without difficulty.
He had a swallow study on POD 6 with no evidence of esophageal leak; he was then advanced to full liquid diet.
ID: He remained afebrile; at time of discharge WBC is 4.5; urinalysis had moderate bacteria and so a urine culture was obtained, this has had no growth.
Pain is well controlled on PO meds.
