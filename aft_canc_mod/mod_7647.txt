At baseline, the patient works as an advocate for mentally impaired adults and do jogging every day.
Back in [**Month (only) 205**] he developed DOE and persistent angina.
As per his wife (who meets him every 1-2 weeks) he continued working until 3 weeks ago when he started having some problems at work and concentrating.
Approximately on [**12-23**] he stopped taking all his meds, and he developed insomnia, forgetfulness, his PO intake decreased and his concentration problems worsened.
His symptoms continued worsening, and he then developed progressive nausea, loose stools and stomach cramping.
Per OSH records, the etiology of the patient's delirium remained unclear although there was suspicion for TTP given anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Neurology consult had planned LP but it was never performed in the setting of low platelets.
MRI there was read as multiple foci of signal abnormality consistent with atypical MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] diseases or sarcoidosis.
At [**Location (un) 21541**], the patient remained confused and slightly tachycardic but no focal neurological deficits.
At home, the patient was even more confused and complaining of whole body pain.
At [**Hospital3 **] ED, the patient remained confused and slightly tachycardic but no focal neurological deficits.
Heme/Onc was consulted and felt this was consistent with hemolytic process.

Micro: Blood cultures neg X6 Urine cultures neg CSF cultures neg Bone marrow fungal cultures pending .
Images: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2115-1-2**] No CT evidence for acute intracranial process .
Brain MRI [**2114-12-29**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital Numerous foci of signal abnormality on subcortical white matter with abnormal enhancement.
Possible atypical MS, [**Hospital3 **] disease or sarcoid.
Mild extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No intrahepatic biliary dilation.
These lesions are probably hepatic hemangiomas absence of known intrinsic liver disease.
If there is suspicion for underlying malignancy or risk factors for primary liver lesions, these lesions can be further evaluated with multiphasic CT or hepatic MR. 3.
Multiple sites of osseous metastatic disease as described with no definite primary lesion identified.
In particular, there is a pathologic T12 fracture with small amount of associated epidural soft tissue for which MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Small pericardial effusion.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
Hepatic lesions, as detailed above, one of which represents a hemangioma and are stable dating back to [**2108**] exam.
Colonic diverticula without associated inflammatory changes.
Nonspecific presacral fluid.
Chest x-ray [**1-5**]: There is progression of left lower lobe consolidation concerning for progression of left lower lobe pneumonia.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Echogenic hepatic lesion noted on prior ultrasound of [**2115-1-3**] is consistent with hepatic hemangioma.
Mild ectasia of the distal aorta.
TTE [**1-7**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mildly dilated aortc sinus and ascending aorta.
No significant valvular disease.
Diffusely abnormal bone marrow signal in cervical spine and skull base, in keeping with known bone marrow infiltration of malignancy.
Encephalomalacia in the bilateral inferior frontal lobes could be from prior trauma, correlate clinically.
T11 mild compression fracture and small epidural soft tissue component in the anterior epidural space at this level.
No significant canal narrowing (< 25 % canal narrowing).
Sacralization of L5 with rudimentary disk at L5-S1.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia, HR 112, normal axis, mildly prolonged PR at 142, QTc 402, no ST elevations/ TW inversions.
These results, in combination with the finding of a thyroid nodule noted on imaging studies, strongly suggest metastatic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, although, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma from other primary sites are less likely possibilities.
Thyroid biopsy: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Note:   Tumor cells are dispersed (single cell pattern) and show   nuclear enlargement and irregularity with variably prominent   nucleoli and moderate amounts of cytoplasm.
In the context of a prior bone metastasis (S12-857P; [**2115-1-4**])   in wich tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, the   morphology is consistent with medullary thyroid carcinoma.

# Altered mental status: Initially, differential was quite broad including bacterial vs. viral vs. tick borne infection, TTP, organic brain disease, toxins.
Patient was initially started on acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin for meningitis, though suspicion for bacterial meningitis was low.
Patient then had a bone marrow biopsy, which preliminarily showed a "packed" marrow with carcinoma of unclear origin and was later confirmed to be medullary thyroid cancer.
Most likely, neurological symptoms are likely a paraneoplastic encephalitic syndrome vs. miliary metastases of thyroid cancer.
MRI at OSH showed some white matter changes which were non specific.
Neuro onc suggested that the 2 small lesions on MRI could actually represent foci of metastatic disease and may also account for the altered mental status.
If biopsy + for medullary thyroid ca, would do whole brain XRT with hope that mental status would improve.
Patient was intermittently agitated during the admission, but was stabilized on haldol 2 mg tid (psychiatry team was involved).
CT torso with pathologic fracture at T12, but no clear primary.
MRI spine showed diffuse bone marrow metastases but ruled out spinal cord compression.
MRI brain with no mass at OSH.
Repeat MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] showed nonspecific changes as well as 2 nondescript lesions.
In regards to tumor markers, PSA/AFP/Hcg not elevated, CEA 3000, Ca [**21**]-9 547, calcitonin [**Numeric Identifier 63238**], consistent with medullary thyroid cancer.
Given association of MEN syndromes with medullary thyroid, will consulted endocrine  who recommended testing for plasma metanephrines to rule out pheochromocytoma, but no further testing as patient does not have any children.
# Hypernatremia: Patient with hypernatremia during hospitalization, peak Na 155.
# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: Secondary to bone marrow infilatration from carcinoma.
Checked daily CBCs and tranfused platelets if <10 or actively bleeding and pRBCs if hct <25.
# Renal artery bruit: On exam, auscultated bruit in region of R renal artery.
Differential included renal artery stenosis, or radiation from AAA.
Not due to mass abutting on artery as no mass visualized on CT torso.
Renal US with no renal artery stenosis.
# LFT abnormalities/elevated CK: Initially, significant elevation in AST but only mild elevation in ALT, suggesting most likely a musculoskeletal process.
LDH concerning for myelodysplastic process though uric acid normal.
Abdominal imaging with several hypodense lesions in the liver consistent with hemangiomas.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: -full code -will need frequent CBC, Chem 7 checks to assess for anemia/thrombocytopenia and Na -will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in brain tumor clinic and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for thyroid cancer treatement.
6. haloperidol lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: Two (2) mg Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for agitation.
8. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Metastatic medullary thyroid cancer 2.
On further testing, it was determined that you have medullary thyroid cancer.
You had multiple imaging studies, including that of the brain and the spine.
An MRI of the spine showed that you have a fracture from the cancer but it is not compressing the spinal cord.
MRI of the brain showed that you have cancer involvement of the brain as well.
