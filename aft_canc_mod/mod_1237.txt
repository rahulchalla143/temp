Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - Type II DM - CHF with an EF of 30% - CAD s/p MI - h/o atrial fibrillation on Coumadin - Chronic Renal Insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.3) - Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas s/p Whipple in [**Month (only) **]/[**2158**] with positive margins, currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (about three cycles in); most recent chemotherapy (Gemcitabine) was two weeks ago, per patient .
Past Surgical History: - sinus surgery - (L)LE bypass for nonhealing toe ulcer - ERCP with stent placement - Whipple procedure as above  Social History: Lives in [**Location 13360**] with wife.
Family History: Mother h/o Breast Ca at early age.
[**1-27**] holosystolic murmur at apex Pulm: decreased BS at right base, otherwise CTA Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Skin:  chronic venous stasis changes Neuro/Psych: CNs II-XII intact.
Generalized stranding of the subcutaneous and mediastinal fat may be secondary to hypoalbuminaemia or right heart failure.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderately severe bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old with h/o pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p Whipple [**1-/2159**], a. fib on warfarin, LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF 25-30%, and Type II DM who p/w syncope and concern for GI hemorrhage.
# Pre-syncope: Patient describes a self limiting episode of lightheadedness with reported periorbital cyanosis.
Initial differential included venous thromboembolism, orthostasis, autonomic dysfunction, anemia, hypoxia, and myocardial ischemia.
History is not consistent with seizure activity as no focal deficits, no involuntary movements, no loss of consciousness, no loss of bowel or bladder function.
Given modified [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] criteria score of 4, patient underwent CTA chest which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but did reveal large bilateral non hemorrhagic effusions.
Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated (peak Trop 0.11) though medical record reveals recent troponins that were as high as 0.21.
EKG was without ischemic changes.
GI performed [**Doctor Last Name **], which showed an ulcer at the anastomosis.
Biopsies were performed and were sent for H.pylori and CMV.
The patient may need a repeat [**Hospital1 **] as an outpatient to be sure the ulcer is healing and also because the entire stomach was not visualized on [**Hospital1 **].
# Iron deficiency anemia: Patient presents with hematocrit of 24.8 with recent hematocrits near 27.
Patient had guaiac positive brown stool at the outside hospital.
He denied recent nausea, vomiting, or bloody stool.
He does admit to a history of intermittent black stools since his Whipple surgery in [**1-31**].
The patient will also require optimization of his heart failure medications.
# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: Stage IIB on diagnosis.
Patient with ascites and large pleural effusions.
# Chronic atrial fibrillation: Coumadin was held given GI bleed and procedure.
# Type II DM: Continued basal/bolus insulin.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: UGIB chronic systolic CHF with new ascites and pleural effusions .
Secondary: pancreatic ca s/p Whipple [**2159-1-31**] DMII OSA   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for lightheadedness and near fainting and for your history of dark stools.
No certain cause for your lightheadedness was determined, however, we did rule out many causes such as a blood clot in your lungs.
The GI doctors performed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **], which showed a non-bleeding ulcer at a site where your Whipple procedure closed your small bowel.
Biopsies of this ulcer are still pending to see if there are bacteria or viruses responsible for your ulcer.
