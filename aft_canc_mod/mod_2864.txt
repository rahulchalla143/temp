Admission Date:  [**2153-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Asparagus  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 57 M w/ NSCLCA Stage IIIB s/p 6 cycles [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol (no chest XRT), h/o malignant pericaradial effusions last drained [**1-3**] (600 cc clear initially, then 200 cc bloody)in cath lab well until [**4-3**] d ago, incr dyspnea limiting even sl movement.He cannot walk more than 25-50 ft without dyspnea.
He also has neuropathy in LE from the ankle down to the foot.
Urgent echo at [**Hospital1 **]:  3 cm anterior loculated effusion, RV collapse, no evidence LV collapse, no resp variation.
Thoracics consulted and felt pt high risk for thoracic surgery, preferred drain then ?
Cards consulted for pericardiocentesis, ?
Nonsmall cell lung cancer, stage IIIB -presented in [**1-3**] with pericardial tamponade requiring intubation, 850 cc fluid was removed; right upper lobe mass with mediastinal and hilar LAD -chemo course: [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol 6 cycles, on chemo holiday -CEA 220, decreased from prior, peak 297 in [**2153-3-30**] 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Suspect the anterior loculated effusion has resolved but the views are too limited to be completely sure.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2153-6-1**], the size of the pericardial effusion has decreased and tamponade is gone.
Interval appearance of pericardial fluid, which appears to loculated, and concentrated mostly on the right side of the heart.
There is interval appearance of a small (5 mm) filling defect in proximal portion of right iliac vein (near bifurcation in inguinal region).
This may represent an intraluminal thrombus.
If clinically indicated, a right lower extremity ultrasound may be performed.
Moderate right pleural effusion, with smaller left pleural effusion.
Associated compressive atelectasis.
Increase in size of right upper lobe mass, with stable/slightly worsened nodular pericardial thickening and mixed interval appearance of lymphadenopathy in the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Stable appearance of left kidney lesion.
INDICATIONS: 57-year-old man with lung cancer and question of filling defect in right common iliac vein seen on recent CT.
TECHNIQUE: Right lower extremity venous ultrasound and Doppler examination.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility and augmentation and Doppler flow and waveforms.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
In particular, there is no evidence of thrombus seen at the site noted on recent CT. A small right inguinal lymph node measures 1.7 cm in length.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis at the site noted on recent CT or elsewhere in the right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: This 57 man w/nsclc and recurrent malignant pericardial efussion was felt to be at high surgical risk.
He was therefor taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where balloon pericardotomy and pericardial drain placement were performed succesfully and without complications.
TTE was performed to rule out re-accumulation and was negative.
On review of the radiology report, it was noted that remaining pericardial fluid appeared loculated and that there was a 5mm filling defect in the proximal R iliac vein.
Therefor, the patient's discharge was delayed overnight to allow for careful monitoring and LENI of the R leg, which was negative for thrombosis, notably including the site of visualization on CT. .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion s/p pericardial balloon NSCLC Stage IIIB  Discharge Condition: Ambulating.
