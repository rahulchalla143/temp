Pt states that she developed SOB three days prior to admission.
She denies CP, palpitations, but does endorse DOE with recent difficulty reaching the top of her stairs.
Following dinner on [**4-22**] the pt developed worsening SOB at rest and the pt called EMS.
En route to hospital pt was initally bradycardic, hypotensive and with low sats, BP improved with non-rebreather and the pt became tachycardic in the low 100's.
At OSH pt was given 3L NS and 1u pRBCs for tachycardia and anemia (OSH hct 26), and pt had a CTA PE protocol that revealed a large left main pulmonary artery PE extending to segmental arteries involving all lobes of the left lung, as well as a right upper lobe apical segmental artery PE, and an occlusive embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI Also, patient endorses non-productive, non-bloody cough for three days, constipation (no BM since she was discharged from the hospital [**2172-4-12**]), and abdominal pain at the site of the surgical incision.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
- Illicits: Denies.

Outside Hospital CTA Scan:  massive b/l PE  TTE [**4-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Minimally increase in large pulmonary artery clot burden on the right since 1 week prior.
The pulmonary artery remains almost the same diameter as the aorta suggesting mild pulmonary hypertension.
Left upper lung ground glass opacities may represent infectious etiology, asymmetric ventilation from pulmonary embolus or foci of hemorrhage.
New small, left greater than right pleural effusions.
Small splenic infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on [**2172-4-7**] who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
# Pulmonary embolism (provoked): Per reports from OSH, and per discussion with radiologists at [**Hospital1 18**] and review of the images, pt has diffuse PE's bilaterally, with very little lung perfusion.
-could consider outpt sleep study -pt discharged c therapeutic INR, will need close f/u  # s/p laminectomy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]: Midline incision healing well, pt still having pain in abdomen, low back.
These were obtained and showed no change in alignment.
-pt to f/u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] as outpt  # Pain Management s/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt still having pain in abdomen, low back.
Left back pain perhaps due to small splenic infarct seen on chest CT.
# Depression/Anxiety:  Pt.
was very tearful during admission as she was not expecting this and has had tremendous stress at home (her son is in prison).
Pt able to discuss her anxiety and depression at length with this provider.
# splenic infact: unclear etiology -recommend outpt heme eval  # anemia: iron studies c/w iron deficiency plus anemia of chronic inflammation.
Would recommend starting iron when pt on less opiates (pt had issues c constipation during hospitalization, did not want to start iron at this time).
