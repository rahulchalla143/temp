Admission Date:  [**2102-1-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EVD  History of Present Illness: 34 year old female just diagnosed with PML yesterday, vomited at home this morning, called her husband and said she was not feeling well.
They had just received a phone call this morning informing them that the patient had a critically low platelet count.
When she became acutely sick, [**Hospital1 2025**] was on diversion so she was transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient had no gag reflex according to EMS.
They called neurosurgery after the CT scan showed a cerebellar hemorrhage.
She had no corneals or gag.
Neuro: Mental status: unresponsive No corneal reflex, no gag reflex, no cough.
Motor: Initially, there was a slight contraction in the quads on the left leg and a slight withdrawal from the fingers on the right hand.
When re-examined there was no withdrawal at all.
Toes mute bilaterally   Pertinent Results: CT head [**2102-1-13**]: There is a predominantly left cerebellar hemorrhage with associated edema, measuring approximately 2.9 cm x 3.5 cm in greatest dimensions.
Additionally, there are wisps of high attenuation within the sulci of the left occipital lobe adjacent to the falx, and layering along the tentorium, which may represent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A single punctate focus of hyperdensity in the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white junction in the right superior parietal region is also seen.
In the appropriate clinical setting, this may represent diffuse axonal injury.
There is diffuse cerebral edema with obliteration of the peri- mesencephalic cisterns and encroachment into the suprasellar cisterns, consistent with an upward transtentorial herniation.
There is also evidence of a cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses reveal patchy opacification of the ethmoidal air cells and left maxillary sinus, which is likely related to endotracheal tube placement.
The osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence of an acute fracture.
No soft tissue swelling is identified.
Large left cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
The etiology of this hemorrhage is uncertain and an underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded.
Possible subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sulci of the left occipital lobe, adjacent to the falx and possible layering hemorrhage along the tentorium.
Punctate focus of hyperdensity in the grey-white junction.
In appropriate clinical setting, may represent diffuse axonal injury.
Diffuse cerebral edema with upward transtentorial and cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
Early non-communicating hydrocephalus.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2102-1-13**]: FINDINGS: NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large hematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere, extending to the superior vermis.
There is a crescentic hematoma in the left posterior fossa, deep to the transverse sinus, which is likely subdural.
There is massive edema and swelling throughout the brainstem and the cerebellum, with supratentorial herniation of the vermis and tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum.
There are small hypodense subdural collections along the posterior convexities along the right middle cranial fossa surface of the right tentorium.
There is no contrast in the V4 segments of the vertebral arteries and in most of the basilar artery.
The basilar tip and the posterior cerebral arteries are opacified with contrast, probably via the anterior circulation.
There is no opacification of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, or superior cerebellar arteries.
The intracranial internal carotid arteries and their major branches demonstrate normal contrast opacification.
Large hematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis.
Probable subdural hematoma in the left posterior fossa.
Massive edema of the brainstem and cerebellum.
S/p ventriculostomy with interim resolution of third and lateral ventricle dilatation.
Bilateral supratentorial subdural hygromas.
Occlusion of the distal vertebral arteries and the basilar artery, and their major branches.
The basilar tip and the posterior cerebral arteries are patent.
FINDINGS: Again identified is severe posterior fossa mass effect with downward tonsillar herniation and upward vermian herniation.
The FLAIR images demonstrate extensive hyperintensity throughout the cerebellum, brainstem, and inferior portions of the thalami bilaterally.
A ventriculostomy is in place with edema surrounding the ventriculostomy path through the right frontal lobe.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There are small bilateral subdural hematomas supratentorially.
There appears to be a left posterior fossa subdural hematoma as well.
The diffusion images demonstrate dramatic slow diffusion throughout the brainstem, cerebellar hemispheres, cerebellar vermis, and inferior and medial portions of the thalami bilaterally.
Slow diffusion also extends into the splenium of the corpus callosum on the left.
Similarly, there is minor opacification of the mastoid air cells.
CONCLUSION: Extensive brainstem and cerebellar infarction.
Severe posterior fossa mass effect with brainstem compression.
Her imaging revealed that she had a cerebellar hemorrhage with blood in the 4th ventricle.
It was determined that she had a very poor prognosis.
