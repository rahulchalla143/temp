F. reporting a history of increasing headache which started in cervical spine and slowly progressed to occipital headache then described as a migraine with an intensity of [**8-29**].

No other symptoms have accompanied the headache and ataxia.

No pronator drift.
ca Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 54 year old woman with cerebellar mass, ?
cerebellar mass and hydrocephalus REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o met.
No prior studies available for comparison.
FINDINGS: There is a large, approximately 5.9 x 4.3 cm right middle lobe enhancing mass medially, with occlusion of the distal bronchi.
The mass is in direct contact with the adjacent pericardium, and there is massive lymphadenopathy extending from the subcarinal region cranially, encasing the trachea and the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, extending to the prevascular, superior mediastinal regions, AP window, as well as bilateral supraclavicular regions.
There is an adjacent satellite nodule in the right middle lobe parenchyma which measures approximately 1.7 cm.
There is additionally a paraaortic and small retrocrural nodes at approximately the diaphragmatic hiatus.
No adrenal lesions are appreciated.
No focal bony lesions.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is prominence of the interlobular septa of the lungs, likely due to fluid overload, however, lymphangitic spread of disease is a consideration.
There is no ascites.
There are focal hypodensities within the kidneys bilaterally, too small to thoroughly characterize, but likely benign cysts.
There are no dilated loops.
No pelvic mass or lymphadenopathy.
There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aortoiliac system.
No significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Review of bone windows demonstrates degenerative changes without acute focal lytic or blastic lesion.
IMPRESSION: Large right middle lobe mass with extensive ipsi- and contra- lateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extending to the supraclavicular regions bilaterally.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-9-12**] 12:50 AM  Reason: evaluate cerebellar mass Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 54 year old woman with progressive headache, ataxia x 20 days, CT scan at OSH with cerebellar mass, obstructive hydrocephalus REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate cerebellar mass CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with cerebellar mass with obstructed hydrocephalus.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
FINDINGS: An irregular rim-enhancing mass is identified in the right cerebellar hemisphere indenting and compressing the fourth ventricle.
The mass measures approximately 3 cm in size.
There is surrounding edema seen.
There is somewhat downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils identified due to mass effect.
An additional small 8 mm enhancing node mass is identified in the left centrum semiovale with surrounding edema.
There is mild-to-moderate prominence of ventricles with slightly increased signal in the periventricular region indicative of early obstructive hydrocephalus with mild periventricular edema.
There is no midline shift seen.
There is no definite meningeal enhancement identified.
Approximately 3 cm irregular rim enhancing mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere with mass effect on the fourth ventricle, surrounding edema and mild associated obstructive hydrocephalus.
Small left centrum semiovale enhancing nodular mass.
The most likely diagnosis is metastatic disease.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: RML ENDOBRONCHIAL BIOPSIES FS, CELL  BLOCK FROM FNA/FRAGMENTS...AND CELL BLOCK OF BRONCHIAL BRUSH.
DIAGNOSIS: A)  Right middle lung lobe, endobronchial biopsy:  Positive for non-small carcinoma.
B)  Fragments of core biopsy:  Blood with scattered malignant cells consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma.
C)  Fragments from bronchial brushing:  Positive for non-small carcinoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-9-17**] 3:33 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for post op changes, bleeding - Please perform at 4am s  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 54F s/p suboccipital craniotomy, cerebellar mass excision REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for post op changes, bleeding - Please perform at 4am so that images can be evaluated on rounds.
INDICATION: 54-year-old status post suboccipital craniotomy for cerebellar mass.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is again evidence of occipital craniotomy with a large bony defect over the right cerebellum and a moderate amount of subcutaneous air.
Within the resection bed, there is a persistent small focus of fluid and hypoattenuating material, likely blood.
There is moderate edema within the right cerebellum, also unchanged.
No evidence of herniation.
Ventricular size has decreased slightly, and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Pneumocephalus related to operative procedure has decreased along the posterior falx and frontal cortex.
There is mild opacification of the ethmoid air cells.
Stable post suboccipital craniotomy changes with stable focus of pneumocephalus and hemorrhage within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
Note:  The tumor forms nodules within brain parenchyma and infiltrates leptomeninges.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 54205**] was admitted to Neurosurgery ICU on [**2187-9-11**] for evaluation and treatment of cerebellar mass and hydrocephalus.
Torso CT showed large right middle lobe lung mass.
She underwent bronchoscopy with lung biopsy showed non-small cell carcinoma.
No complication was encounted during surgery and she was successfully extubated post-op.
Her diet and activity has been advanced and she is ambulating without assistance.
Radiology oncology was consulted and offered her WBRT or cyberknife protocol.
She decided to have cyberknife protocol and will follow up with Dr[**Name (NI) **] office to set up the protocol.
She had hypertension during this admission and was started on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] with good blood pressure control.
