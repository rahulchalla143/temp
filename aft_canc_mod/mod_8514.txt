Admission Date:  [**2108-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2024-10-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**] Chief Complaint: N/V/D, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -central venous line, intubation -CPR times 2  History of Present Illness: This is an 83 year old female with PMH of HTN, chronic kidney injury with baseline Cr=1.7-2, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis presenting with 3-4 days of N/V/D and abdominal pain.
She was found by EMS earlier today with SBP in the 70s and was reportedly very dry and unable to take POs.
She reported no fevers or chills, but did endorse non-bloody emesis and diarrhea.
CXR showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Given the concern for cardiogenic shock, a bedside ECHO was attempted by the ED which showed a dilated right ventricle.
She was guaiac negative and the concern for PE was high given these findings so she was empirically started on a heparin drip since her Cr=1.7 and the goal was to avoid a dye load for a CTA.
Cardiology fellow was consulted for bedside ECHO, but had poor windows and during ECHO at around 12:30AM the patient had an acute change in mental status complaining of sudden onset abdominal pain and reported feeling as though she was going to die.
No PE was seen, but diffuse bowel wall edema was noted and surgery was consulted for this.
Of note, she had several failed attempts at a right femoral and left radial A-lines on heparin with a lot of bleeding at the leg site.
She is the sole caretaker for her younger 73 year old disabled brother who also has gastroenteritis and is also in the ED.
She has no other family.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -HTN -Chronic kidney injury with baseline Cr=1.7-2 -Hypothyroidism -Hyperlipidemia -Osteoporosis -h/o Non Hodgkins lymphoma in remission since [**2096**] -h/o NSVT -Remote history of endometrial cancer s/p chemo and radiation -Severe scoliosis .
Past Surgical History: -s/p left radius/right humerus fractures in [**2070**] -s/p TAHBSO and radiation for endometrial CA in [**2072**] -s/p hip surgery [**2106**]   Social History: She has been living with her stepbrother in a historic brownstone on [**Doctor First Name **] street, which is the home she grew up in.
Family History: Non-contributory   Physical Exam: General: Intubated, sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, PERRL but sluggish Neck: supple CV: Tachycardic Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present GU: Foley Ext: warm, no clubbing or edema, massive right thigh hematoma Neuro: intubated/sedated   Pertinent Results: CTA abdomen/pelvis:  1.
Active arterial extravasation in the right proximal medial thigh, likely related to recent arterial puncture.
Differential diagnosis includes low-flow state, hypercoagulability, and tumor.
Pericholecystic fluid, which could be secondary to recent volume resuscitation, but cholecystitis is also a possibility.
Heterogeneous enhancement of the right kidney, which could be secondary to infection or low-flow state.
Bowel wall edema and mucosal hyperenhancement suggestive of recent hypoperfusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 83 year old female with PMH of HTN, chronic kidney injury with baseline Cr=1.7-2, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and remote history of endometrial cancer and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with 3-4 days of N/V/D and abdominal pain with ED course complicated by PEA arrest requiring a round of CPR.
She was brought to the ED for further evaluation of N/V/D and abdominal pain.
She was markedly hypovolemic and hypotensive to the 70s which initially responded to 4L IVFs.
She was given empiric abx and thought to be in cardiogenic shock.
She then developed severe abdominal pain and change in mental status.
Unfortunately, she passed away after 10 minutes of CPR upon admission to the ICU for PEA arrest.
