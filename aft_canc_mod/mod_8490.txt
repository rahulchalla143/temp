New small amount of pelvic fluid and mesenteric stranding, suspicious for malignant involvement.
Increase in paraaortic lymphadenopathy, also consistent with disease progression.
Right ileal conduit, with unchanged parastomal hernia.
Severe osseous degenerative changes.
Increased uptake in the left femoral head and acetabulum is consistent with avascular necrosis.
No definite evidence of metastatic disease.
New asymmetric increased uptake in the right shoulder.
Focal increased uptake in the right knee consistent with degenerative changes seen on prior radiograph.
CXR [**2138-9-13**]: In comparison with study of [**8-19**], there is extensive patchy opacification involving much of the left lung, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of widespread pneumonia.
Left Hip X-Ray [**2138-9-18**]: Limited examination due to body habitus.
Right lower quadrant ostomy projects over the right greater trochanter.
Degenerative changes of the pubic symphysis.
The right hip is not well visualized due to overlying soft tissue structures.
No definite fracture or dislocation on this single AP view.
Subcutaneous emphysema and edema, post-surgical.
CXR [**2138-9-22**]: There has been interval partial clearing of the infiltrate in the left mid lung.
However, there continues to be dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with a combination of both volume loss and consolidation.
Bilateral lower ext vein ultrasound [**2138-9-26**]: prelim read at time of discharge - no evidence of DVT in bilateral lower ext veins  Brief Hospital Course: 81yo female with history of colon cancer and CML who presented with worsening abdominal pain for the past several weeks.
Abdominal pain: Pain likely secondary to worsening tumor burden from known colon cancer that had been seen imaging studies prior to admission.
CT on admission confirmed interval increase in size and number of intraperitoneal metastases, as well as increase in paraaortic lymphadenopathy, consistent with disease progression.
Her pain was controlled with narcotic pain medications during the admission.
Pneumonia: During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, she developed acute hypoxia, and was transferred to the ICU.
CXR showed a left-sided infiltrate, and the patient was started on broad coverage for hospital-acquired PNA vs. aspiration pneumonia.
She was thought to have possibly aspirated in setting of increased sedation while receiving pain control via dilaudid PCA.
She completed a 9-day course of antibiotics for her pneumonia.
At time of discharge, she was afebrile, without chest pain, SOB, or cough, and CXR showed improvement in left lobe consolidation.
# Colon cancer: CT abdomen showed increased size and number of intraperitoneal metastases, as well as increase in paraaortic lymphadenopathy masses throughout abdomen.
CEA noted to be increasing as well.
Her abdominal pain, likely due to to increasing tumor burden, was well controlled at time of discharge.
Her dasatinib was held in setting of pneumonia and hip surgery, and restarted on [**2138-9-24**] at 70mg daily.
There was no evidence of infection at her surgical site, no clinical evidence of pneumonia, blood cultures were negative, and the patient remained afebrile.
She had a decrease in WBC on the day of discharge, from 39.8 to 33.7, in setting of starting dasatinib.
Left hip pain: Pain was secondary to avascular necrosis of the hip, and the patient underwent a left total hip arthroplasty on [**2138-9-18**].
Pain control was difficult, as the patient required high doses of narcotics to control her pain, but was very susceptible to respiratory depression and lethargy in setting of increased narcotic dosing.
Ultimately, her pain was brought under control after a 3-day course of toradol in addition to methadone 2.5mg TID, with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
Her pain also steadily improved following her hip replacement surgery.
Her renal function should be closely monitored in setting of NSAID use.
Diarrhea: The patient did develop some loose stools during her hospital stay.
Given her rising white count and antibiotic use, she was tested for C. diff infection, but testing was negative x2.
Her diarrhea may be secondary to the dasatanib.
Her symptoms improved with Lomotil.
Anxiety: The patient was seen by palliative care during the admission, and per their recommendations was started on olanzapine for increased anxiety.
