Progression of pulmonary opacities in bilateral lower lobes of the lungs with non-enhancing wedge like opacity in the right lung, and nodular opacities in the right upper lobe likely inflammatory or infectious in nature.
Associated likely reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
No acute intrabdominal process.
Mild periportal edema suggesting third spacing.
Bilateral cortical and parapelvic renal cysts.
[**8-8**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No evidence of joint effusion.
Left hip degenerative changes.
[**8-8**] Knee xray: Left total knee arthroplasty without hardware complications.
Small suprapatellar effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 67 year old male with relapsed AML on chemo who presented with septic shock from multiple organisms and who passed away in the MICU.
Septic Shock/Neutropenic Fever: The patient had positive blood cultures with E. coli as well as VRE.
He also appeared to have a severe pulmonary process which was thought to be a progression of his recent pulmonary aspergillosis.
He began to have increased respiratory distress and required intubation.
Refractory AML: Was receiving palliative Dacogen infusions, last dose 8/31 with chronic neutropenia with ANC=0 and blast 88% of WBC.
Respiratory Failure: Grew increasingly tachypneic during his hospital course due to compensation for significant metabolics acidosis from his sepsis with underlying parenchymal disease/infection.
# Acute renal insuffiency:  Creatinine slightly elevated to 1.1 on admission from baseline 0.8-1.0, rose to 1.3 during admission.
This was attributed to low flow state due to sepsis as well as effect of some obligate nephrotoxins with antibiotics.
This was managed with treatment of his underlying sepsis and care to avoid any other unnecessary nephrotoxins.
Abnormal LFTs: Elevated bili to 2.3 with alk phos of 537.
Has had similar abnormalities on prior admissions for sepsis which typically resolved with hydration.
