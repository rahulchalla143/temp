Admission Date:  [**2107-10-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-11-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-2-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20640**] Chief Complaint: Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC [**2107-10-19**] L IJ TLC [**2107-10-20**] L shoulder arthrocentesis [**2107-10-18**] L shoulder washout [**2107-10-20**] R shoulder washout [**2107-10-23**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male with a metastatic renal-cell carcinoma who recently has had acute renal failure in the setting of IL-2 therapy.
He was readmitted today after discharge on the [**10-10**], after he called his doctor's office complaining of neck and back pain, in the context of a recent positive culture from a line tip for MRSA.
Today he relates that his pain is "all over," in "every joint" and is especially bothersome when he moves.
History of pulmonary embolus.
History of migraine headaches.
Oncologic history: (as previously noted, confirmed) In [**2106-8-27**], evaluation for SOB/CP revealed bilateral PE, multiple lung nodules; 3.5 cm renal mass in R kidney, revealed to be extending into R renal vein in hepatic portion of IVC.
Had R radical nephrectomy w/tumor thrombus extraction at [**Hospital1 112**], with pathology reportedly showing clear cell carcinoma.
Also had a number of additional side effects including acute renal failure as well as hyperbilirubinemia, n/v/d, rash, arthralgias, fatigue.
[**8-2**]: Restaging CT scan shows no evidence of disease progression.
Family History: Remarkable for CAD and DM.
Clear oropharynx, slightly dry MM, no scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor, PERRL, EMOI, no cervical or throacic spine spinal tenderness or masses appreciated, neck supple, full ROM CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, S1, S2, no m/g/r appreciated RESP: lungs CTAB no w/r/r ABD: slightly distended, NT, +BS, no HSM appreciated, no tymphany to percussion EXT: 2+ edema bilat.
Accurate assessment is limited due to lack of IV contrast, to exclude abscess or active inflammation in this location.
No evidence of epidural abscess, cord abnormality on the present study.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, with mild neural foraminal narrowing, as described above.
[**2107-10-12**] CXR New bilateral, left much greater than right, and predominantly lower lobe interstitial and nodular opacity; given history of elevated white blood cell count and immunosuppresion raises the concern for an opportunistic pneumonia.
The other consideration given cardiomegaly, fissural fluid and right pleural effusion is "asymmetric" pulmonary edema.
Multiple new lung consolidations and pulmonary nodules are more consistent with infection representing either disseminated pulmonary infection either pyogenic or fungal.
Given the sudden appearance of the abnormality ( less than two weeks, since [**2107-10-4**], metastasis is unlikely).
Resolution of nodular opacities in left lower lobes since [**Month (only) 116**] [**2106**], since some representing inspissated bronchi.
New small bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, most likely reactive.
Given the history of pulmonary embolism, the subpleural areas of consolidation may represent pulmonary infarct.
Severe spleno`megaly may be consistent with ongoing infectious process.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with right ventricular pressure overload.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
The mitral and aortic valves are well seen with no significant regurgitation implying that endocarditis of these valves is unlikely.
Diffuse edema is present throughout the shoulder muscles with relative sparing of the subcutaneous soft tissues.
The finds represent a non-specific myositis.
Moderate glenohumeral joint effusion.
Nonspecific 1.5-cm soft tissue mass superficial to the supraspinatus muscle.
It is unclear if this arrises from the acromioclavicular joint or represents a discrete soft tissue mass in this patient with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer.
[**2107-10-17**] Right Upper ext ultrasound Limited study but no evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
No focal or textural hepatic abnormality.
[**2107-10-20**] Transesophageal Echo No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
[**2107-10-21**] MRI R shoulder w/o Large right shoulder joint effusion with extensive fluid collection to the deltoid muscle, extending inferiorly, anterior to the humerus and also superficial to the deltoid muscle.
Given the history of systemic bacteremia, the fluid may be of infective etiology, although the appearance is nonspecific.
Non-visualization of the right subclavian and right axillary veins, suggesting possible occlusion.
The right internal jugular, right brachiocephalic, and superior vena cava are otherwise widely patent without evidence of thrombus.
Left upper lobe lung consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions .
[**2107-10-23**] CT head w/o No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 56 yo M with metastatic RCC s/p IL-2 therapy admitted with MRSA bacteremia cultured from catheter tip who presented with neck, upper back pain and leukocytosis.
# MRSA bacteremia: cultured from catheter tip s/p IL-2 therapy.
No evidence of vegetation on TTE or TEE but bilateral septic shoulder joints s/p arthroscopy with washout.
Given worsening lungs on imaging and sputum positive for MRSA, Linezolid was initated for a weeks duration.
# Pulm infiltrates: CT chest concerning for septic emboli versus primary pulmonary infection.
Pt without subjective shortness of breath or chest pain, however O2 requirements.
During intubation for respiratory distress & mental status changes in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ET tube with yellow sputum, thus also new possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
# Respiratory distress: with acute mental status changes.
Pt with respiratory alkalosis secondary to tachypnea pt was transferred to the MICU and intubated.
Head MRI did not show any acute CNS process, LENI's were negative and echo without evidence of RV strain making PE unlikely.
Although with MRSA bacteremia undergoing treatment with antibiotics, pt was not septic.
Improved ABG's and resolved tachypnea with resolution of mental status changes over the course of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# Mental Status Changes: s/p general anesthesia for shoulder surgeries; appeared to be possibly toxic in relation to anesthesia also in the setting of with MRSA bacteremia and IV hydromorphone for pain.
Further acute worsening of mental status with delirium and hyperventilation, required transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Concern for meningitis/encephalitis or new brain lesions but CT head without evidence of lesion.
Mental status improved without evidence of fever or leukocytosis, was extubated and did not require lumbar puncture.
# Body/joint pain: Initially admitted with neck & upper back pain, however without focal findings on neurologic examination or point tenderness over spine.
Gradually developed generalized body/joint pains, L then R shoulder pain.
MRI C & T w/o showed increased signal in the prevertebral soft tissues from C2-C4 on STIR sequence which could represent possible edema, inflammation or abscess but limited as no further imaging with constrast due to limited GFR.
Imaging of bilateral joints revealed effusions, arthrocentesis revealed infection thus pt underwent bilateral shoulder washout.
Provided with IV dilaudid for pain control, however pt with delirium, continued on vicodin which controlled his pain.
# Acute renal failure: Poor GFR with Cr 6.0 on admission [**1-28**] IL-2 capillary leak syndrome.
# Anemia: Most likely r/t anemia of chronic disease.
# RCC: s/p IL-2 treatment, No treatment during admission.
# Elevated coagulation studies: INR initially concerning for development of DIC/consumptive process, however were relatively stable in the setting of longterm IV antibiotics & some element of liver dysfunction.
# Elevated LFTs: Liver ultrasound showed no focal abnormalities and resolved over time.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
