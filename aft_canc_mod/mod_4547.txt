On transfer from the recovery room to the floor the patient was noted to have increasing blood in the urine output.
He remained hemodynamically stable without symptoms of blood loss anemia, however given that the bleeding was not relenting he was taken back to the operating room for cystoscopy and fulguration of the bladder mucosa.
Following this, the bleeding was noted to decrease dramatically and he was kept on CBI over the course of the next day to ensure there would be no relapse and that there was not clot formation causing clot retention.
He was out of bed and ambulating without difficulty, tolerating a regular diet, urinating without difficulty, and pain controlled when he was discharged to home on POD 2.
