No evidence of new infection.
[**5-25**] Sinus CT: IMPRESSION: Left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening without bony erosion or destruction.
Asymmetrically enlarged right submandibular gland, but no evidence of abscess within the limits of non-contrast study.
Increased number of small-to-borderline enlarged lymph nodes bilaterally, non-specific, but could be secondary to the AML or reactive to an infection.
Significant centrilobular emphysematous changes in the visualized lung apices.
In addition, there is mild obscuration of fat planes on the left.
This might reflect prior resection of the SMG with post operative changes.
Focal consolidation involving the lateral basal segment of right lower lobe is again seen and appears improved as compared to the last scan.
Enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
Diffuse circumferential thickening involving the terminal ileum and cecum with no signs of bowel obstruction.
In view of the history of fever and neutropenia, this may suggest an infectious or inflammatory/Crohn's etiology.
Mild free fluid in the pelvis.
There is a group of three abnormally spherical lymph nodes in the left IB location (in the expected location of that submandibular gland).
Borderline prominant left level V lymph nodes are also present.
These are non-specific and may be related to infection, inflammation or neoplastic process.
Per conversation with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **], possible oral infection is suspected which may the cause of these enlarged lymph nodes.
Bilateral mastoid sinus fluid, left more extensive than the right.
Please clinically correlate with symptoms of inflammation.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo M with AML s/p recent chemo presenting with febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
# Febrile neutropenia/drug allergies: Given his extensive allergy history, both allergy and infectious disease were consulted.
Source was initially unclear but [**Name (NI) 74311**] did show thickening in the ileal-cecal junction so there was a question of colitis vs. PNA that was seen to be worsening on interval CXR.
# Pneumonia: As described above, the patient continued to have fevers throughout his hospitalization with a worsening PNA on CXR despite treatemnt with Aztreonam, Daptomycin and Flagyl.
He developed an oxygen requirement, requiring 4 L or NRB.
# Chest Pain: Patient developed severe intermittant chest pain during his admission with ST depressions that reversed with nitroglycerin.
Given his multiple comorbidities and contraindication to anti-coagulation, it was decided to manage this symptom medically, with morphine, nitroglycerin SL and a beta-blocker.
# HTN/?CAD: Continued metoprolol .
# GERD: Continued PPI .
Patient was made CMO (Comfort Measures Only) on [**6-15**] when he developed a severe cough that worsened his respiratory status and a new fever.
