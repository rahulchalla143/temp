Malignant pleural effusion and other pulmonary issues: Tentative treatment of the patient's malignant pleural effusion by pleurodesis was delayed secondary to the patient being on Plavix.
She was finally taken to the operating room for a left sided VATS, chest tube placement, and tac pleurodesis on [**2169-5-25**].
The patient remained in the post anesthesia care unit overnight with a prolonged intubated course complicated by bouts of hypotension and low urine output for which she received multiple intravenous fluid boluses.
However, on the evening of the [**5-26**] she had an episode of desaturation to the 80s.
At the time she also elevated systolic blood pressure of 215 and an EKG with T wave inversions and ST depressions anteriorly in V1 through V3 which were new.
She then became hypotensive likely in response to the aggressive blood pressure management, although her EKG changes did resolve with decreased blood pressure and was transferred to the [**Last Name (un) 100649**] Intensive Care Unit on a dopamine drip.
CT angiogram of the chest showed no evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Chest x-ray and examination were consistent with some amount of pulmonary edema likely from the intravenous fluids she had received in the post anesthesia care unit for her hypotension.
Additionally chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with mild ARDS secondary to the talc pleurodesis (the talc embolus syndrome which is a known side effect and complication of the procedure).
Chest tube was discontinued on the 27th and the patient has continued to do well and her O2 requirement has decreased although her chest x-ray remains with bilateral infiltrates and pleural reaction to the talc pleurodesis.
Additionally they were negative for GCBFP, ERN, PR and therefore more consistent with an adenocarcinoma of the lung primary despite the patient's history of breast cancer.
Cardiovascular:  When the patient acutely desaturated and became hypertensive on the evening of [**5-26**].
She had EKG changes anteriorly.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction and EKG changes resolved with control of her blood pressure and heart rate.
It is felt that this is most likely secondary to demand ischemia.
She is continued on her aspirin and beta blocker for her known coronary artery disease.
However, she had several episodes of hypotension during her stay in the post anesthesia care unit as well as briefly on the night of [**5-26**].
Therefore all of her hypertensive medicines were initially held while she was in the Intensive Care Unit on pressor support.
However, her blood pressure has since returned to her elevated baseline and her metoprolol has been restarted and titrated upward so that she is now back on 100 p.o.
During her hospitalization initially the team held a family meeting to speak with the patient, husband and son, [**Name (NI) 8096**] to inform the patient of her cancer diagnosis.
However, before the patient could be so informed the son stopped the family meeting and he revealed that years ago when the patient was informed of her breast cancer diagnosis she became severely depressed for many months.
Therefore, the family did not wish her to be informed of her cancer diagnosis.
