Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: The pt is a 78 yo M with a h/o CAD, HTN, HL, DM who presents from his PCP's office after routine CBC showed 66% atypical white blood cells and low platelets on a routine CBC.
He initially sought care from his PCP after he had noticed that he had noticed increased bleeding from the site of a removed childhood skin tumor which had been severely pruritic, causing him to scratch it with a sharp back-scratcher repeatedly.
The PCP felt the patient had an infected cyst and started abx.
His PCP drew [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CBC which showed 66% atypical white cells and thrombocytopenia with a normal white cell count and hematocrit.
On review of systems, the patient also notes more malaise and dyspnea on exertion over the last month, as well as intermittently blood streaked stools and melena.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have no evidence of bleeding but labs concerning for DIC and tumor lysis.

He was treated with ATRA and subsequently suffered from ATRA syndrome with an acute elevation in his WBC to >50 K. He had significant pulmonary leak.
He was treated with ATRA throughout and received Idarubicin which had to be stopped secondary to elevated bilirubin.
His blasts and WBC subsequently decreased, and on smear [**2174-4-4**] his myelocytes showed differentiation with improving status of his leukemia.
As a consequence of treatment, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome with his uric acid peaking above 10, with a change an increase in creatinine to 2.5 initially and subsequently higher as described below.
# Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial in the setting of pulmonary leak from ATRA and likely alveolar hemorrhage.
His fluid balance reached a peak of 27L positive secondary to his blood product requirement.
Over the course of 10 days he was able to be weaned down with the assistance of CVVH for fluid overload to pressure support of [**5-19**].
# DIC: Due to his APML, he developed DIC evidenced by active bleeding from his ET tube, his OG tube, his stool and urine.
He had acute drops in fibrinogen, increase in LDH and increase in bilirubin.
He was supported through this with massive transfustions requiring 18 units of PRBCs, 35 units of platelets, 5 units of FFP, and 24 units of cryoprecipitate.
He was intubated due hypoxia and increased work of breathing on [**2174-3-26**].
His CXR after intubation showed a fluffy infiltrate suggestive of either ARDS or hemorrhage (likely both).
# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: He started experiencing a decline in mental status 2 days prior to intubation with severe asterixis and confusion.
He had a number of potential causes such as medications, central focus with his SDH, and hypertension to 180 making PRES a less likely, but possible concern.
Also, his uremia given his acute renal failure.
He was treated with dialysis for a uremia over 200.
# Acute renal failure: His creatinine sharply rose from 1.2 on admission to a peak of 4.9.
This was thought to be in the setting of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) and abdominal compartment syndrome.
Also complicated by ATN in the setting of low blood volume and possible microthrombi during DIC.
He was treated allopurinol and Rasburicase for TLS with good resolution as well as with CVVH initially (1 day) for fluid removal.
Shortly after he began autodiuresing He was initiated on dialysis for AMS as described above and a BUN of greater than 200.
He was treated with dialysis with a fall in BUN to 113, however, he had a fever to 100.6 and cultures came back positive for GPC in chains from dialysis catheter [**2174-4-9**].
# Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: In the setting of acute volume overload from large volume transfusions given DIC as above.
He was ~25L positive for LOS fluid balance.
He developed elevated bladder pressures and decreased urine output.
Surgery was consulted and felt that as long as he was making urine there was no need for surgical intervention (as well as given his critical illness, it was not indicated).
# Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter: He developed tachycardia to the 140s with initial EKG most consistent with Afib, and later EKG more consistent with Aflutter vs AVNRT.
He got an extra 150mg of amiodarone on [**3-25**] with minimal effect on tachycardia.
However, [**4-1**] he converted back to rapid a-fib with RVR and required uptitration of his B-blockade and a diltiazem drip which was eventually converted back to PO.
# Right basal ganglia infarct: On repeat scan of his head to evaluate interval change of his subdural hematomas on [**2174-4-4**], a new right sided basal ganglia infarct was noted.
Given the concern for translocation of gut bacteria with his compromised immune system, he was switched to Vancomycin / Zosyn on [**2174-3-24**] for better coverage of gut pathogens.
Micafungin was added to cover for fungal pathogens.
He had a fever to 100.6 on [**2174-4-9**] and cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which were positive for GPCs in chains.
# Pericardial Fat Pad: On echo on [**2174-3-24**] there was concern for pericardial effusion because the echo showed a new anterior pericardial effusion with complex echodensity.
No evidence of tamponade physiology was seen on the echo.
On RUQ imaging for persistent elevation of his bilirubin, cirrhosis was noted.
More than likely his cirrhosis was secondary to alcoholism and he had poor clearance of his bilirubin (from reabsorption from pooled blood).
# Elevated Glucose: He initially had glucose's in the 400?????
His overall clinical status continued to decline over the course of hospitalization, with evolution of multi-system organ failure including increased pulmonary ventilatory requirements, persistant renal failure, LFTs continued to increase and he developed recurrent bacteremia (initially MSSA, then VRE).
He was given 1 dose of daptomycin for VRE coverage.
Given his multiple organ failure, worsening ventilatory requirements and persistent altered mental status, a family meeting was held and decision made to focus efforts on patient comfort beginning [**2174-4-12**] AM.
