In addition, there was initial concern for carotid injury, which was subsequently ruled out by bedside ultrasound.

Bilateral airspace consolidations in a predominantly basilar and peripheral distribution.
No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
Subcutaneous soft tissue stranding anterior to the xyphoid; clinical correlation is recommended.
Umbilical hernia containing nonobstructed, nonstrangulated small bowel.
Catheter of an accessed right chest wall port terminates in the right ventricl   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male with transfusion dependant MDS, severe AS and dCHF per echo in [**2145**], CAD s/p PCA X 2 in [**2139**] who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, as well as two episodes of chest pain, found to be in septic shock with MSSA bacteremia.
# Septic Shock: Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
The presumed source was pulmonary as there was evidence of possible pneumonia on chest CT.
Pt also presented with [**Last Name (un) **], transaminitis and an NSTEMI, all felt to be secondary to sepsis.
# Afib with RVR:  Pt was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rates in the 120's-150's on the first night of the hospitalization in the setting of sepsis.
He was trialed on metoprolol and esmolol gtt, but both caused profound hypotension and bradycardia and were therefore discontinued.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended not treating his atrial fibrillation given his hemodynamic stablility and in the setting of acute illness.
He was not considered to be a candiate for anticoagulation given his severe MDS.
# dCHF and severe AS:  In the MICU pt had hypoxia with bilateral crackles with a chest x-ray consistent with pulm edema.
His oxygen requirement improved by the day of discharge and currently is satting 88-92 on room air and 97% on 1L nasal cannula.
He continues to have bilateral crackles 1/3 up from bases.
At that time, please reassess and if appears euvolemic consider down-titrating dose to 40mg daily (home dose prior to hospitalization) and may consider uptitrating as well if still volume overloaded.
# Chest pain/dyspnea While on the floor, he had intermittent brief episodes of chest pain and dyspnea, particularly when receiving anitbiotics.
The chest pain is thought to be stable angina or possibly anxiety.
While he was never given SLNG in the hospital as his chest pain resolved spontaneously, would offer it to him if this recurs at facility.
Drainage is moderate serosang without odor.
There is no erythema, induration or fluctuance."
Wound care recommendations are: Irrigate ulcer with wound cleanser set to stream and pat dry No Sting barrier wipe to periwound tissue, allow to dry fill wound with aquacel ag rope followed by dry gauze secure with Medipore H soft cloth tape change daily.
