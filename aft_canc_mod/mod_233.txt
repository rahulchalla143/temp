History of anus squamous cell carcinoma, status post     chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Echocardiogram in [**2-6**], showed some mitral regurgitation, 6.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Mediastinal seminoma in [**2095**], that was treated with     radiation and chemotherapy.
Testicular hypofunction.
Atrial flutter.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had increased shortness of breath over more than the week.
He was seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 7750**] office on [**2109-9-26**], for hemoptysis that was half blood and half sputum.
Initially, the chest x-ray may have shown left pneumonia for which he was treated with ten days of Levofloxacin 250 mg per day.
The patient says that during the course of antibiotics he had decreased hemoptysis.
CT on [**2109-10-8**], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but did show increased pulmonary nodules with a ground glass appearance.
The patient denied any chest pain but did feel that he had increased pulsations in the neck over the last few days.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has positive constipation since radiation therapy for his anal cancer.
He also complains of pain in his legs and scrotal area from lymphedema post radiation therapy for his cancer that has lasted over the last two months.
He denies any fever, chills, sweats, diarrhea or dysuria.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of an inner ear cancer.
Father had diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and brother has alcohol abuse.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, the patient was afebrile at 98.4, blood pressure 106/72, respiratory rate 28, pulse 120.
He has no Kaposi lesions.
Respiratory- He had good air entry bilaterally but he had bilateral fine crackles at the bases and some bronchial breath sounds at the right upper lobe.
Cardiovascular examination - harsh III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the base and left sternal border.
The abdomen has positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no organomegaly.
CT of the chest on [**2109-10-8**], showed multiple pulmonary nodules, associated ground glass opacities, new lung nodules at the bases compared to [**2109-7-30**], minor scarring at the right apex.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was put on respiratory precautions for his increasing shortness of breath with hemoptysis.
He was ruled out for tuberculosis and multiple induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage from his bronchoscopy sent for cytology and bacterial and fungal viral infection.
Essentially, his bronchoalveolar lavage had negative cytology for malignant cells.
Three sets of acid fast bacilli and cultures were negative.
Nocardia negative.
He had some right ventricular hypertrophy with mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and at least some mild pulmonary hypertension.
Because all his laboratories were essentially negative for an infectious disease workup, the patient was scheduled for a VATS procedure and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram while under general anesthesia.
The patient's VATS had demonstrated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
The Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, left atrial dilatation, 2+ aortic regurgitation, no mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and no pericardial effusion, and a prosthetic mitral valve.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] spoke with the patient about his diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the lung.
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the lung.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
