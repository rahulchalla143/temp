A CT angiogram was performed to evaluate his aorta and iliac arteries, and a 2.7 cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver was noted incidentally.
On [**2148-6-7**] a CT-guided biopsy of the lesion demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma in the background of cirrhosis.
During a myocardial stress test with nuclear imaging on [**2148-6-26**], he was noted to have 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in leads V5 and V6.
The IV dipyridamole stress test was negative for chest pain and the nuclear imaging demonstrated a large size, moderate intensity, anterior wall, septal wall, apex and inferior wall perfusion abnormality, with mild to moderate improvement on resting images involving the mid septal and basilar inferolateral walls.
He underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated a right dominant system.
The LAD had a long, 90%, mid stenosis just after a large diagonal branch.
The left circumflex demonstrated a 70%, ostial stenosis and there was a large obtuse marginal 2 branch which had 80% stenosis.
There was an additional, nonspecific, arterial-enhancing, 4 mm lesion of the dome of the liver that is likely focal vascular shunt, but will be assessed at the time of surgery with intraoperative ultrasound.
Please refer to operative note for complete details.
Postop, he had a decrease in hct requiring transfusion and T wave inversion in leads V1-V3.
JP drain had bilious drainage with a bilirubin level of 31.5.
The incision was intact without redness or drainage.
CXR demonstrated bibasilar atelectasis with linear opacity in the retrocardiac region.
He had low grade temps to 100.
