No free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.
Small type 1 hiatal hernia.
Evaluation of the intrapelvic large bowel is limited due to respiratory artifact but appears within normal limits.
No free fluid or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present.
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
Bilateral healing rib fractures are noted as well as post-surgical changes from prior posterior fusion spanning from L2 to L4 where there is also laminectomy.
Wedge compression deformity involving L2 with mild grade 1 retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 is of indeterminate age.
IMPRESSION: No etiology for leukocytosis or abdominal pain identified.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory failure.
Initially described to have seemingly hypoventilatory failure with low respiratory rate; in ED patient with increased respiratory effort but distressed.
Differential initially included COPD exacerbation or other cause of acute bronchospasm (allergic reaction/anaphylaxis from ?CT contrast), pneumonia (no infiltrate on CXR), mucous plugging, ACS or CHF exacerbation (elevated BNP with small increase in troponin).
After bronch appeared to be related to airway edema and obstruction of trach tube.
Then on [**2134-1-18**] his sputum grew GPCs in clusters and he was started on vancomycin.
He was continued on the steroid taper for inflammation per interventional pulmonology recs as well as prn bronchodilators and benadryl to decrease airway edema and treat a possible COPD exacerbation.
# Leukocytosis and fever.
T 103 with leukocytosis and bandemia at OSH.
On arrival here had neutrophil predominence without bands and after receiving steroids had a leukocytosis.
Blood, urine, and sputum cultures (endotracheal) were obtained and the sputum grew GPCs as above.He had a CT abd without evidence of source.
# Elevated troponin.
No chest pain or concerning ECG findings, ?demand in setting of hypoxia/acute respiratory failure.
# Hypernatremia: Repleted with IVF as patient unable to take POs  # Diabetes type II: Insulin sliding scale with QID FSG  # FEN: IVFs for now, replacing free water.
