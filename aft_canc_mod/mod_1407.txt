Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course outlined by problem below:  # Respiratory failure- multifactorial.
Has restrictive (charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragmatic weakness s/p plication, right upper lobectomy, on CPAP at home at night) and obstructive (COPD) components.
Also has had two recent consecutive aspiration pneumonias.
At [**Hospital1 18**], sputums only grew out oropharyngeal flora.
He was continued on levo, and vancoand showed imporovement in respiratory status.
He was extubated on  [**3-5**] however he showed progressive resp distress over the next 2 days requiring reintubation.
CXR showed worsening left sided pneumonia and he had a leukocytosis.
Flagyl was added and he responded well with decreasing WBC and decreased respiratory distress.
He underwent tracheostomy and was able to tolerate minimal pressure support by the time of discharge on PSV 5/5 for period of time and allowed to rest on higher pressure support.
He received steroids for his COPD and which has now been tapered off.
Given his reestrictive disease (charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragm disease, and new right lobectomy) he will liklely need longterm support with ventilation.
This may be stopped if he tolerates his trach without aggitation.
# Hypotension - he was received on pressors, but these were rapidly titrated off and he maintained good blood pressures.
He was given a short course of stress dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg qid both for his hypotension at the OSH and his COPD exacerbation).
Liekly was demand ischemiea in the setting of his hypotension.
His echo, albeit of poor quality shows a normal EF and no WMA.
