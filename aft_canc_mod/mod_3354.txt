Admission Date:  [**2136-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-9-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-4-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Antihistamines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Admitted from OSH after having seizure at home and found to have left frontal lobe and cerebellar hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 78 y/o man with recent diagnosis of intracranial mass admitted from OSH after having seizure at home and found to have left frontal lobe and cerebellar hemorrhage.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he had MR head revealing a large left frontal intraparenchymal lesion that is predominantly hemorrhagic in nature.
There is significant edema associated with this lesion.
There is also a lesion seen involving the cerebellum, also hemorrhagic in nature.
These findings are consistent with metastatic disease.
He had a CT chest which revealed a dominant spiculated nodule in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe highly suspicious for a neoplasm.
Additional scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules noted as well.
Additional scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules as above.
Cystic enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the spleen and the stomach.
Large 3.9 x 2.7 cm left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with severe vasogenic edema.
Resultant 7 mm rightward subfalcine herniation and mass effect on the left lateral ventricular body.
Given marked vasogenic edema and second lesion in the cerebellum, hemorrhage is likely secondary to underlying neoplasm, probably metastatic.
2.7 x 1.6 cm hyperdense lesion within the cerebellum, likely representing hemorrhagic metastasis, causing mass effect on the fourth ventricle, with no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
There is a large left frontal intraparenchymal lesion that is predominantly hemorrhagic in nature.
There is significant edema associated with this lesion.
This is concerning for metastatic disease as noted on prior report from the CT scan from [**2136-9-12**].
There is also a lesion seen involving the cerebellum, also hemorrhagic in nature.
These findings are consistent with metastatic disease.
There are no other enhancing lesions identified.
CT large multi IPH with edema, mild MLS, no hydrocephalus.
# Intracranial lesions:  Neurosurgery recommended an operation for fluid evacuation and debulking given mass effect from the tumors.
Decadron and Dilantin were started IV to decrease edema in setting of tumors and to prevent seizures, respectively.
He remained stable on bipap despite marked discomfort from the mask and on [**9-13**], he was transferred to the MICU team for further management.
At this time, his breathing became labored and a morphine drip was begun at his and his family's request.
