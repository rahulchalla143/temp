Admission Date:  [**2200-5-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-5-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-1-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Afib/flutter with RVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 79 year old woman with recent diagnosis of carcinoid lung mass with mets, atrial fibrillation on lovenox, idiopathic cardiomyopathy (EF 45%), recently hospitalized for initiation of chemotherapy (with carboplatin/etoposide, day#1 [**2200-5-7**]) [**Date range (1) 40354**], now presenting from rehab with afib with RVR.
She was noted to be in rapid Afib with rates 150s.
Cancer was diagnosed when TTE showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7388**] vs external compression.
Subsequent CT showed large mediastinal mass.
Afib has been difficult to control since middle of [**Month (only) 404**], thought to be related to mass effect from tumor.
She has been flipping in and out of atrial fibrillation frequently in the last few months but notes improved control of afib since that hospitalization.
She was transitioned from dabigatran to enoxaparin during that hospitalization in setting of biopsy and was kept on enoxaparin in case she might need a repeat procedure.
During ED stay, systolic BPs ranged 87-104, appeared to have lower systolics with elevated HRs.
She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath.
ECG showed Afib with NA NI, new ST depression lateral leads; repeat EKG unchanged.
CXR with stable right effusion vs elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath beyond her baseline.
Her cough is unchanged from baseline, no sputum production.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - Patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation in beginning of [**2200**], initial TTE showed slightly depressed LVEF of 45%, initially thought to be due to her chronic alcohol use.
Her atrial fibrillation worsened despite uptitration of medication (sotalol and dronedarone)  and her repeat TTE showed a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] vs. extrinsic mass compressing on LA.
She was admitted for evaluation and her biopsy showed neuroendocrine tumor consistent with typical carcinoid.
- CT scan showing metastases to bone, lymph nodes and possibly liver.

The mass measures approximately 7 cm in its long axis and 5 cm in its short axis.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate bileaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo F with atrial fibrillation and lung carcinoid tumor with neuroendocrine features, presenting with palpitations, admitted to ICU for control of rapid Afib/Aflutter.
# Atrial fibrillation/ Aflutter: Hemodynamically stable with HR in 70s-80s and SBPs 90s on arrival after IV Diltiazem and IVF were administered.
She will be fitted with a cardionet device for arrhythmia monitoring while at rehab (prescription sent and address of rehab noted).
# Hypoxia Mild hypoxia on presentation with 2L O2 requirement, perhaps in the setting of receiving IVFs in the ED.
A CXR showed a significant mass present in the right lung with a small effusion present.
# Lung carcinoid tumor with neuroendocrine features: Followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10351**].
She had a repeat TTE that better clarified her cardiac sequelae from this tumor; she is noted to have a normal EF but could have compression of the pulmonary veins.
# Neutropenia- On admission the pt's ANC was 130.
She did not have any signs of acute infection.
By the time of discharge, her counts had recovered for many days.
Transitional Issues:  - readmission on [**5-27**] for chemo/radiation - cardionet measurements/fitting and delivery to rehab (to be worn while at rehab) - requests a [**Hospital1 18**] PCP and cardiologist; appointments not made due to her planned readmission in a few days, at which point follow-up appointments should be made.
