He began having nausea and vomiting on the evening of [**11-14**] shortly after returning to [**State 531**].
He then developed diarrhea and a bright macular papular rash on the trunk extending to the feet on [**11-18**] and was admitted to an OSH on [**11-19**] and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with  pancytopenia and suspicion of GVHD vs. C. diff colitis or other infection.
He presented to an OSH on [**11-19**] nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a maculopapular rash.
He ran a low grade fever and was found to be pancytopenic with a WBC 0.4, Hct 29 and plt 27.
On the 16th he spiked a fever in the setting of receiving a transfusion and was pan-cultured.
TPN was initiated on [**11-21**] due to poor PO intake.
Per the patient's wife, he spiked a fever to 103 on this date.
There was reportedly also a question of a cavitating mass in his lung.
After conversations with the BMT fellow on [**11-22**] he was started on vancomycin, zosyn (they did not have cefepime on formulary), micafungin, and flagyl (unclear if he received all of these) and received a unit of platelets and solumedrol 30 mg IV for presumed GVHD.
He reported some intermittant lightheadedness earlier in the day as well as some lower abdominal pain in a band like pattern similar to his prior C. diff abdominal pain that had since passed.

There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pleural effusions.

In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
CT Head [**1-23**]: No acute intracranial pathology, especially no evidence of a new infarct detected.

PATHOLOGY: SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: [**2145-12-17**] DIAGNOSIS: MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE  INVOLVEMENT BY THE PATIENT'S PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED ACUTE MEGAKARYOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (FAB M7).

# AML - History of relapsed AML after allo transplant.
Neutropenic throughout his stay with a brief increase in counts and an ANC that peaked at 1700.
A BM biopsy on [**12-17**] was done and showed recurrence of AML.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**1-13**] showed hypercellular bone marrow with persistent involvement by patient's known acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
Patient became increasingly somnolent, though arousable and non con CT head was negative for bleed.
He developed generalized pain and weakness attributed to his disease.
Further work up with MRI and LP was not pursued as goals of care were shifted towards comfort given the refractory nature of the patient's disease and his multiple infections.
# N/V/D: Patient was positive for C diff.
His diarrhea was persistent, and because of his risk factors he was increased to 500mg PO Q6H.
The first week of [**Month (only) **] his abdominal pain increased to [**2145-4-8**], and he began having [**2-6**] large volume watery bowel movements.
[**12-10**], he spiked a fever to 101, and a CT abd/pelvis was done.
It showed thickening of the ileum concerning for infection vs. GVHD.
He also had a new RUL opacity on chest x-ray.
On [**12-10**] he respiked a fever with possible sources being his abd and lung based on imaging studies.
He continued to have fevers approx Q48 hours from [**Date range (1) 85919**].
It was initially thought that the fevers were in part due to recurrence but mycolytic blood cultures were positive for malessezia furfur (believed to be associated with TPN and his central line) and patient was treated with line removal and ambisome transiently (stopped secondary to fevers), and then voriconazole/posaconazole.
GVHD: Patient presented with a sandpapery maculopapular rash on arms and legs thought to be GVHD.
He also continued to have loose stools while on the PO Flagyl and vancomycin.
GI was consulted and wanted to do a c-scope to evaluate for GVHD of the gut, but held off because of his neutropenia.
Repeat imaging showed thickening of the ileum that was concerning for GVHD or infection.
A repeat abdominal CT on [**12-28**] showed resolution of the ileum thickening and colitis.
# RUL lung lesion - Patient has history of +PPD that has been treated with INH for 4 months which was discontinued because of liver toxicity.
He was also at risk for invasive fungal infection.
He was ruled out for TB, and in the setting of a positive B-glucan he was thought to have a fungal pneumonia, which was treated with voriconazole.
On repeat chest CT [**12-24**], the pneumonia had decreased in size.
Senna 8.6 mg PO BID PRN constipation 10.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Catskills Area Hospice Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute myelogenous leukemia C. difficile sepsis Malessezia furfur fungemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 467**],  You were admitted to the hospital with sepsis related to an infection called C. difficile.
You also developed a fungal infection in your blood and were treated with antibiotics and line removal.
