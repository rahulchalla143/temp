**FINAL REPORT [**2147-5-14**]** URINE CULTURE (Final [**2147-5-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
Ground-glass opacities at the right mid lung concerning for infectious process, or aspiration.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, with stable minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles.
Slight enlargement of right upper lobe ground-glass nodule, with development of adjacent opacities that could represent either infection/inflammation, or progression of indolent malignancy such as bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.
Marked bladder distension and new hydronephrosis, without evidence of obstructing stones.
Mild questionable left sided bladder wall thickening.
Nonemergent evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT, MR (as renal function allows) or ultrasound is recommended.
Per resident report, patient had incorrect Foley placement, and revision yielded a large amount of fluid with associated pain relief.
**TTE ([**5-12**]): Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2142-9-3**], aortic sclerosis has progressed to mild stenosis and pulmonary pressures are higher.
[**Last Name (un) **] due to obstructive uropathy: Mr. [**Known lastname 38030**] was admitted to MICU for increasing confusion, elevated Cr to 6.7 (baseline <1), fever, leukocytosis.
CT had demonstrated large volume of urine in bladder, and foley was placed, draining urine (roughly 650ml).
Pt PSA was found to be 33.6 (from 34.5 in [**1-/2147**], 7.8 in [**10/2146**]), raising concern of obstructive uropathy [**12-20**] prostate ca enlargement.
A few days after ICU discharge pt was given a voiding trial which he failed with >1L in the bladder on bladder scan.
Atrial Fibrilation with Rapid Ventricular Response: Upon arrival in MICU Pt was noted to have rate of 130, found to be be in Afib w RVR, started on a dilt gtt and converted back to SR.
On the general [**Hospital1 **] he again was intermittently in afib with RVR and multiple diltiazem IV pushes were needed to control his rate.
Each night for the next couple evenings pt has asymptomatic bradycardia in the 30-50s.
His rate continued to be adequately controlled and he continued to have normal rate during the day and mild, asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping on this regimen.
Aspiration Pneumonia: A chest CT in the past had indicated RUL nodule, and CXR on admission showed right lung opacity possibly consistent with infectious process.
When his WBC quickly came back to normal after foley placement and bladder drainage, the ICU service decided that the elevated WBC wsa more likely due to stress from the bladder obstruction.
CXR was obtained that showed some ground glass opacifications in the RML which would be consistent with an infectious process.
He were started on metronidazole and levofloxacin to treat suspected aspiration pneumonia with plans to complete an 8 day course if responsive.
Hypertension: Pt was intermittently hypertensive after ICU discharge with a couple isolated pressures >200 systolic for which IV hydralazine was given.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing, dyspnea.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Acute Kidney Failure due to Obstruction  2) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response  3.
Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted to the hospital with kidney failure due to obstruction of your bladder, most likely by your prostate.
When we put a new urine catheter in your bladder, you were able to make a large amount of urine immediately and your kidney failure quickly resolved.
When after 8 hours you were unable to do so and your bladder contained a large amount of urine, we replaced a urine catheter.
While you were here you had intermittent rapid heart rate due to your atrial fibrillation.
An ultra sound of your heart was obtained which showed no serious abnormalities.
However, you should continue taking this medication at the perscribed doses as you have no symptoms with the slower heart rate while asleep.
Finally, you developed an elevated white blood cell count during your hospitalization and a chest xray showed a possible pneumonia in your right lung.
Followup Instructions: 1) Consider f/u CT of chest in [**12-21**] weeks in order to evaluate resolution of infiltrate seen on CXR 2) Speech Eval for swallowing ability and aspiration risk 3) CBC in 7 days to evaluate WBC 4) K and Cr in [**3-24**] days to evaluate renal funct w/ Losartan 5) INR in [**1-20**] days with goal range 2.0-3.0  6) Follow up with Dermatology in their clinic for treatment of the Bullous Pemphagoid.
