Admission Date:  [**2135-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-10-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal tenderness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP ([**9-30**]) Central venous line placement ([**10-1**]) Arterial line placement ([**10-1**]); removal ([**10-2**]) ERCP for stent replacement ([**10-10**]) ERCP for stent replacement ([**10-12**])   History of Present Illness: The patient rpeorts that he symtpoms began yesterday when she began to experience nausea and had several episodes of vomiting.
The patient has no history of gallbladder or liver disease that she knows of.
She has not experienced and hematuria or dysuria.
There she was brought in with complaints of LLQ pain and jaundice.)
In the Emergency Department, a CT scan showed "Severe intra/extrahepatic biliary dilatation; severe pancreatic duct dilatation with pancreatic atrophy; nodular enhancement at ampulla suggests possible malignancy.
Distended gallbladder with wall edema and perihepatic ascites, likely [**2-23**] severe biliary dilatation.
L spigelian hernia contains a colon loop and free fluid, but no obstruction is seen at the level of the hernia, and no bowel wall thickening.
AVN of L femoral head again seen."
The Emergency Department had discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and arranged direct admit to surgical floor and possible ERCP evaluation, but then they noted that she was in AFib RVR 120's.
Also has [**Apartment Address(1) **] mm in lead III, and ST depressions in V [**2-27**], worse since prior EKG.
Has had a silent NSTEMI in past.
Cardiology saw the patient and felt that negative stress from 8 months ago made Mi very unlikely.
On the floor, the patient was tired but denied any specific abdominal pain.

Imaging: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There is marked intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation, as seen on recent CT.
There is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
There is trace fluid in Morison's pouch, without generalized ascites.
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation, as seen on recent CT. Further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommended.
Distended gallbladder, likely reflecting biliary obstruction, without cholelithiasis or son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
There was copious thick mucin extruding out.
There was some thick mucin extruding out.
- Immediately below the minor papilla there was a small opening suspicious for fistula.
- A diffuse dilation was seen at the CBD and intrahepatic ducts with the CBD measuring 15-16 mm.
- Spyglass cholangioscope showed large amount of mucin in CBD and no discrete lesion was found.
There was one filling defect in the proximal main PD suspicious for intraductal neoplasm.
There was one filling defect in the proximal main PD suspicious for intraductal neoplasm.
- Because of the severely dilated CBD and large amount of mucin, a 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully in the CBD.
KUB ([**10-3**]):  IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction with a large amount of gas in the bowel which may be indicative of ileus.
CXR ([**10-4**]):  FINDINGS: There is progressive increase in diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, consistent with rapid accumulation of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
More focal areas of opacity including within the right apex may represent asymmetric edema versus superimposed aspiration/consolidation.
Elevation of the right minor fissue is suggestive of volume loss/atelectasis in the right upper lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present and appear progressed with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There are calcifications of the aortic arch.
Echo ([**10-3**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral valve prolapse is seen.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artrery hypertension.
There was some thick mucin extruding out.
There was some thick mucin extruding out.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome.
A diffuse dilation was seen at the CBD and intrahepatic ducts with the CBD measuring 15-16 mm.
Because patient developed obstruction with plastic stents and patient and family agreed with the metal stent placement, a 8cm by 10mm Wallflex fully covered biliary stent (Ref: 7054; Lot: [**Numeric Identifier 81030**]) was placed successfully in the CBD.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter.
Because patient has failed plastic stents and FCSE metal stent, a 8cm by 10mm Uncovered Wallflex biliary stent (Ref: 7065; Lot: [**Numeric Identifier 81031**]) was placed successfully in the CBD.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 y/o F with Hx dCHF, recent NSTEMI ([**6-1**]) presents with cholangitis and new-onset A fib with RVR, found to have signs of IPMN and adenocarcinoma.
Biliary obstruction/cholangitis: The patient's CT and RUQ ultrasound both suggestive of biliary obstruction.
She was evaluated via ERCP on [**9-30**], which revealed substantial obstruction of the bile ducts secondary to copious mucin.
One week following the procedure, she was found to have rising LFTs and increased abdominal distension.
Adenocarcinoma:  The findings on the ERCP, combined with the papillary mass found on CT, were highly suggestive of IPMN.
Cytology brushings revealed adenocarcinoma cells, likely malignant.
The patient indicated prior to the ERCP that she would not wish to undertake therapy for any cancer found as a result of the procedure.
There may be chemotherapeutic options.
New onset atrial fibrillation: On admission, the patient was found to be in Afib with RVR.
Cardiology was consulted and attributed her symptoms to demand ischemia.
The patient was found to be somnolent and hypotensive on [**10-1**] following an episode of coffee ground emesis.
Following immediate management, she was maintained in NSR with metoprolol and had no recurrence of the hypotension.
Diastolic heart failure:  The patient has a history of diastolic HF, but at home required no oxygen support.
On admission she was found to have some demand ischemia with troponin 0.4-0.5.
Her hypoxia responded to diuresis, indicating heart failure as the etiology.
She also experienced visual hallucinations.
If there is an increase, or if her abdominal exam worsens, call the ERCP team for follow-up as stents may have slipped.
The patient does not have obstructive disease at baseline.

Please call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 1730**] P. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19980**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  obstructive cholangitis  Secondary:  adenocarcinoma (likely pancreatic), atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
A CT scan showed dilated bile ducts, most likely due to an obstruction.
You were transferred to our [**Hospital 86**] hospital for ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) to investigate the cause of this blockage and to relieve it.
During your recovery from the ERCP, you experienced a rapid, irregular heart rate.
You were given medications to control your heart rate, keep your blood pressure in the normal range, and reduce any extra fluid in your body.
During your stay on the medical floor, you were found to be confused at times and to have some visual hallucinations.
