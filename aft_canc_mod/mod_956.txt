son has been helping him at home, but Father has become difficult to control with violent and emotional outbursts.
ABD: Soft, diffusely tender Ext: no edema/clubbing or cyanosis.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
Biliary Tree: Many stones ranging in size from 2mm to 8mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
There was post-obstructive dilation to 1.5 cm.
Given suspicion for cholangitis, detailed cholangiogram was not obtained.
No obvious strictures were noted.
Impression: Periampullary diverticulum, Stones at the lower third of the common bile duct with post-obstructive biliary dilation - a biliary stent was placed.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypo to akinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the aortic valve.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0 cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a very small mobile echogenic mass on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (0.3 x 0.4 cm) which is may represent a torn chordal structure; however, cannot fully exclude small mitral valve vegetation (clips 4, 17 ).
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-5-30**], a very small echogenic mass is seen on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve which may represent a torn chordal structure; however, cannot exclude small vegetation with certainty.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for valvular vegetations given diffuse valvular thickening.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower.
There is an increased velocity across the aortic valve consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.
He became hypotensive post procedure requiring fluids and levophed.
His labs on [**11-29**] were not consistent with DIC as his fibrinogen was elevated and he did not have increased fibrin split products.
He did not have any complicaitons after extubation.
A TTE was obtained as patient has enterococcal bacteremia and has known valvular disease.
His creatinine levels did not improve with fluid boluses, suggesting that his renal failure is not pre-renal, but rather an intrarenal process such as ATN.
HEMATEMESIS: hematemesis was reportd at outside hospital prior to transfer.
he did not develop hematemesis while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
ST DEPRESSION NOS: Patient developed SDT depressions and elevated troponins in setting of hypotension post ERCP.
He was not begun on aspirin, IV heparin, or a beta blocker given his history of GI bleeding.
CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: His digoxin, [**Last Name (un) **], and diuretics were held in seting of hypotension and acute renal failure.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Given history of GI bleed, and prior discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**], patient is to continue ASA alone.
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE: Probable underlying lymphoma in one of the gastric ulcers, stable on PPI, no further work-up planned at this time.
ENTEROCOCCAL BACTEREMIA AND MITRAL VALVE ENDOCARDITIS: Given enterococcal bacteremia a known structural heart disease, a surface echo was obtained.
This revealed a very small vegetation on the mitral valve, which is likely not endocarditis, but must be treated as such.
Because his enterococcus is pan-sensitive, ampicillin is the drug of choice, however, given his compromised renal function, and the lack of a high pretest probability of ABE, I elected not to give an aminoglycoside for synergy.
