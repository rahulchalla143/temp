(1) Altered Mental Status:  His head CT shows increased hemorrhage around known glioblastoma multiforme.
It is not clear whether his symptoms on presentation are secondary to this hemorrhage, increased edema from his tumor, possibly a new ischemic stroke, or the UTI.
Patient's known intracranial lesion also raises concern for seizure activity though this is less likely given his seizure prophylaxis and clinical history.
There was no evidence of intoxication or other metabolic etiologies to explain his lethargy.
Throughout the day of admission, the patient's mental status improved without intervention.
He has baseline confusion and at times seems that he did not fully comprehend certain questions despite being A&O x3.
(2) Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  Patient with acute mental status change found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage at site of glioblastoma multiforme on CT scan.
There was no history of recent head trauma or use of anticoagulation, except for aspirin 325 mg daily.
Serial neurological exams were done and there was clinical improvement.
It is believed that the intracranial hemorrhage has stabilized and the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the floor.
(5) Elevated Cardiac Enzymes:  Patient has known history of CAD s/p IMI.
Patient denies symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
His elevated cardiac may be due to demand in the setting of hypertension as patient has a history of poorly controlled blood pressures and atrial fibrillation.
He was not started on treatment for ACS as it was not believed that this was the cause of his elevated troponins.
In addition, given recent bleed heparin and aspirin would be contraindicated in this patient given recent cranial bleed.
Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or diaphoresis during his admission on the floor.
Labetolol was decreased during ICU stay due to persistent sinus bradycardia; pressures remained in the 140s-160s.
(7) Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:  Patient with significant history of multiple intubations for dCHF exacerbations.
Patient denied SOB during admission after receiving several gentle IV fluid boluses.
His lower extremity edema was stable during admission.
