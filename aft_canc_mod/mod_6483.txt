She last received chemo last tuesday and now presents with one day history of fever to 100.4.
She denies any chills or rigor.
No cough, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea.
In ED, she was febrile to 99.7 and physical exam revealed no focal source.
Past Medical History: She first developed left posterior rib pain in [**2111**] and was found to have multiple destructive rib lesions.
Work-up at the time revealed a modest IgG kappa and a question of light chain in the urine.
Bone marrow showed a modest increase in plasma cells without clear evidence of clonality.
She had a bone bone marrow biopsy, which showed 10% plasma cells with abundance of kappa staining and evidence of plasma cell aggregates and plasmablast.
The patient underwent a repeat skeletal survey, which showed new punched out lesions in  the skull as well as a calcium of ~10.4-10.9.
At [**Hospital1 18**], bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cells accounting for approximately 20% of the cells with kappa restriction.
In [**2114-3-21**] the patient had acute diplopia and was found to have a CNS plasmacytoma and underwent radiation therapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Irregular menstrual cycles (one per year), found to have an ovarian cyst.
No oral lesions, no sinus tenderness Neck: No LAD, full ROM Car: RRR, no murmur Resp: mild rhonchi bilaterally, speaks in full sentences Abd: s/nt/nd/nabs Ext: No LE edema Neuro: a/o, CN II-XII intact, no focal deficit.

Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance in the anterior portion of the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days ago, could represent inflammatory or early infection.
Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib, right scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of multiple myeloma.
Limited study due to low tracer count on the ventilation study.
Left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%).
Very small posterior pericardial effusion.
No evidence of active or inactive tuberculosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 54F with multiple myeloma s/p cytoxan, revlimid, velcade, decadron admitted for febrile neutropenia.
Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.
Acute Renal Failure: On admission she was noted to have an elevated creatinine from her baseline.
It was originally thought that there may have been a pre-renal component due to reduced PO intake following chemotherapy.
She had a large amount of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein in her urine and ultimately her renal failure was felt to be due to progression of her multiple myeloma.
She started hemodialysis without complication, and also underwent 5 sessions of pheresis with no signs of renal recovery.
Multiple Myeloma: Her initial presentation and renal failure were felt to be due to progression of her multiple myeloma.
She underwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis and her IgG levels decreased significantly.
She then developed respiratory distress thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload with probable cardiac component (EF 40%, though this was poor quality on echo).
On her final CXR, there was no evidence of volume overload.
Her confusion was likely multifactorial including uremia in the setting of renal failure and ICU delirium.
Tachycardia: She had sinus tachycardia during this hospitalization.
Initially it was felt to be related to hypoxia and improved with diuresis.
Other possible etiologies for tachycardia included possible infection and known malignancy.
Patient was started on metoprolol but this was discontinued due to low blood pressures.
VQ scan showed low probability for PE and bl LENIs were nonrevealing for DVTs.
