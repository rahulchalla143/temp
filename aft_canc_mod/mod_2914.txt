Admission Date:  [**2146-10-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-10-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-12-29**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Hepatobiliary  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  This is an admission for a head of the pancreas mass.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old healthy gentleman who presented to an outside hospital in [**2146-7-26**] with cholangitis and gram-negative bacteremia.
After he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**], later in his hospital course, workup with an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a smooth stricture in the distal common bile duct and a subsequent computed tomography noted no evidence of a pancreatic mass; however, later evaluations did reveal a pancreatic mass.
He is currently asymptomatic without fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, dark urine, or loose stools.
He is here for elective resection of the pancreatic mass which was shown on the [**9-29**] computerized axial tomography.
Transient ischemic attacks.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
His postoperative pain was initially controlled with a Dilaudid epidural which he tolerated until day four, at which time he started to complain of hallucinations.
However, he did have some problems with tachycardia and some atrial ectopy which presented itself on postoperative day six.
These tachycardic episodes were controlled with Lopressor, and a Cardiology consultation was obtained.
The Cardiology team decided that anticoagulation was not necessary as it was neither was it atrial fibrillation nor what they considered to be a chronic  or continuing process.
An echocardiogram was performed on postoperative day six which showed a normal left ventricle, with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, and a moderately dilated left atrium, and mildly thickened aortic and mitral valves.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient did have some postoperative atelectasis which was controlled with incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet.
Of final note, one complication of this procedure was a wound infection.
The patient was maintained on oxacillin for several days postoperatively for erythema surrounding the wound.
Eventually, the erythema got a little bit worse.
This was packed open, and the patient defervesced and any signs of fluctuance relieved themselves.
At the time of discharge, the patient had been afebrile for greater than 24 hours.
Finally, the patient's pathology from the surgery revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma, with a TNM classification of T3 N1 MX.
The margins of the resected mass were not involved by carcinoma, and there was no lymphatic vessel invasion.
On the day of discharge, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The abdominal wound from the surgery was open with a wick in it with no signs of continued infection.
He still had some slight pedal edema.
Hemodynamic monitoring with central venous catheter.
Postoperative atelectasis.
Atrial fibrillation.
[**Hospital6 407**] was sent to assist with wound care, drain education and blood glucose monitoring.
