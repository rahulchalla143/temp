No family history of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
LABS/STUDIES EKG:  First degree AV block PR 280ms, sinus rhythm, left sided axis, ST elevation in V1 (2mm), V2 (2mm) and AVR, peaked T waves in V2 and V3, no reciprocal changes .
LCx had 90% stenosis which was not intervened upon  Cath [**2146-3-9**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
The right coronary artery demonstrated a widely patent stent in the mid portion of the vessel.
The left main demonstrated a 30% lesion in the distal portion of the left main coronary artery.
The left anterior descending artery demonstrated a long calcified 70% lesion in the proximal to mid portion of the vessel.
The large first diagonal branch had a 70% ostial lesion.
The left circumflex demonstrated a discrete 70% lesion in the distal portion of the vessel.
Pressure wire interrogation of the long lesion in the LAD demonstrated a resting FFR of 0.78 which dropped to 0.67 with maximal hyperemia.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis in the LAD and 30% stenosis in the first diagonal with TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Successful PTCA and stenting of the obtuse marginal with a bare metal stent.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow obstruction.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric LVH with even more severe hypertrophy of the upper septum.
Abnormal resting LVOT flow without obstruction.
No regional wall motion abnormality.
Mild aortic and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Short E-wave deceleration time.
This constellation of findings could be consistent with an infiltrative process such as amyloid.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo male with a history of questionable CAD, first degree AV block s/p pacer placement presents with an anterior wall MI.
# STEMI:  Pt had evidence of anterior wall ST elevation MI on ECG and in the cath lab.
Patient also continued with mild 2/10 chest pain after his cath.
He also had BMS placed in LCx as well as POBA of first diagonal.
He refused high dose statins and thus was started on rosuvastatin 20mg every other day.
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: On TTE patient had evidence of septal RV and LV wall thickening consistent with an infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
There was no outflow tract obstruction.
# First Degree AV Block:  Per last EP note, the patient is not pacer dependent.
The other 20% was split between atrial pacing and ventricular sensing and atrial and ventricular pacing.
The patient had persistent prolonged PR during the hospitalization, however was only atrial pacing at times.
# Carotid Stenosis s/p left sided endarterectomy: Continued aspirin and statin as above.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: ST elevation Myocardial Infarction .
Secondary Diagnoses: First degree AV block Low-grade lymphoma Diverticulitis Degenerative joint disease Squamous cell carcinoma Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on discharge.
You were found to be possibly having a having a heart attack although there was no evidence of permanant damage.
You continued to have mild chest pain following these procedures, which was thought to residual pain from your procedures.
If you experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, fevers, chills or any other worrisome symptoms please seek medical attention.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you notice any bleeding, increasing bruising or pain or any other unusual changes in your groin.
