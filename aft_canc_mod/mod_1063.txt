Admission Date:  [**2105-8-27**]       Discharge Date: [**2105-9-6**]   Service:  Acove  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year old man with a history of nonHodgkin's lymphoma and delirium transferred from [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital with febrile neutropenia and worsening dementia.
He was in [**Hospital3 **] for several days and was determined to only have soft tissue damage.
He recovered physically completely, but he showed his first signs of depression and began to experience nightmares.
In [**2105-1-10**], the patient experienced substantial vomiting.
In [**2105-2-10**], the patient experienced syncopal episodes at home, he went to [**Hospital6 **] Medical Center and ended up staying in a hospital 57 days.
He was anticoagulated with heparin and subsequently had a massive gastrointestinal bleed which sent him to the Intensive Care Unit.
The bleed was not found on colonoscopy, although the procedure ended prematurely when the patient showed electrocardiogram changes.
He subsequently ruled out for myocardial infarction.
At this point he experienced a deep vein thrombosis in his left leg which was treated conservatively with Ace wraps.
One week later, the patient experienced high fever and was diagnosed with biliary sepsis.
It was at this time that he first showed evidence of hypercalcemia and change in mental status.
The patient showed cardiac instability with hypertension and low heartrate.
At home he was mentally depressed and has not been back to baseline since this time.
He had a fall in the Psychiatric Unit, experienced a frontal laceration and broke his nose.
He was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and a calcium up to 13.
There he had the Haldol and Ativan and again demonstrated a sensitivity to those medications.
He also showed signs of parkinsonism with increased rigidity.
On the day of admission, the patient was found to have febrile neutropenia as well as hypercalcemia and was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] for management.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass graft; 4.
History of gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulation; 8.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 11.
Major depression disorder with psychotic features; 14.
He had bibasilar crackles bilaterally.
His abdomen was mildly distended and he had Foley catheter tube.
Neutropenia - On admission the patient's white count was 1.7.
The patient's neutropenia was felt to be drug-related due to its rapid decline and improvement.
Fever - The patient had a maximum temperature of 100.0.
His urine grew out Pseudomonas greater than 100,000 colonies as well as enterococcus.
Hypercalcemia - The patient has a history of persistent hypercalcemia with mental status changes.
Gastrointestinal bleed - On [**2105-9-1**], the patient had five episodes of melena and bright red blood per rectum.
The gastroenterologist saw the patient and did an upper endoscopy which showed no defects.
After discussing the situation with the patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**], it was determined that colonoscopy would not be useful, as colonoscopy had been done in a prior episode and no source of bleed was found.
Anemia - The patient is slightly anemic which is thought to be multifactorial anemia of chronic disease as well as gastrointestinal bleed.
Change in mental status - The patient has been treated with Remeron, Seroquel and Trazodone.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan was done which was negative and demonstrated only small vessel disease, unchanged from prior studies.
Nevertheless, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**], the patient's oncologist believes that a lumbar puncture would not be useful considering that there are no new neurological symptoms.
On [**2105-9-5**], the patient developed right leg swelling from his hip down to his toes.
Hypernatremia - On the patient's return to the floor from the Intensive Care Unit he was hypernatremic to 156.
KUB was negative for obstruction.
At the time of this dictation the patient is tolerating 70 cc/hr of FS Ultracal feeds which provide 1.4 liters of free water.
NHL - The patient had a computerized tomography scan prior to this admission which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**], the patient's oncologist related to us was not concerning for worsening NHL.
Computerized tomography scan done here demonstrated a large dependent left pleural effusion with associated pathologic atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Also interthoracic lymph node enlargement was prominent within the aorticopulmonary window and left hilar region was observed.
Also observed was an enlarged heterogeneous spleen completely imaged on the study.
Small pericardial effusion was seen, as well as groundglass opacity and patch consolidation predominantly in the right lower lobe, also involving small pressure in the right middle lobe, mainly due to pulmonary infection.
The patient's pleural effusion was tapped.
Pleural effusion - The patient's pleural effusion was tapped and 1.8 liters were removed.
Acute renal insufficiency - The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.8.
The creatinine on admission is 2.2, considered likely prerenal secondary to dehydration.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient has been diagnosed with intermittent atrial fibrillation since [**Month (only) 958**].
He is not anticoagulated secondary to his risk of gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient did not seem to demonstrate rapid ventricular response, heart rate has been between 70s and low 100s.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient has been maintained during his hospital stay on q.i.d.
The patient's code status is Do-Not-Resuscitate and Do-Not-Intubate.
