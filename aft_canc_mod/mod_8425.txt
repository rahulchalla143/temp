Admission Date:  [**2123-8-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-10-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / hydrochlorothiazide / Enalapril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**] Chief Complaint: Coffee ground hematemesis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD -- [**8-10**] ***pending***  History of Present Illness: 78F w/ h/o small cell lung ca s/p radiation and chemo in [**2116**], gastric AVMs, left CVA w/ residual R hemiparesis and aphasia who presents from nursing home w/ abdominal pain and coffee ground emesis.
Of note, patient has h/o gastric AVMs noted in [**2-/2121**] at [**Hospital1 3278**] when she was admitted for GI bleed.
During that admission she underwent EGD which showed four areas of AVMs in body of stomach and fundus which were anticoagulated with Argon beam.
Also w/ h/o cecal mass s/p right hemicolectomy in [**2111**].
During this hospitalization it was noted that patient had elevated LDH as high as 611, concerning for recurrence of her small cell ca and outpatient follow up at [**Hospital1 3278**] was recommended.
Patient triggered for hypotension and was bolused 1.5 L NS.
Exam was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness w/o peritoneal signs and melanotic stools in diaper.
Potassium was 5.9 with slightly peaked T waves on EKG, for which she received D50, insulin and calcium gluconate w/ improvement to 4.7.
PEG tube lavage was performed and notable for coffee grounds, which cleared after 350 ccs.
She empirically received cipro and flagyl for concern for colitis as well as zofran and morphine 6mg total.
KUB was performed which showed normal placement of PEG and CXR with worsened R pleural effusion.
Patient underwent CT Abd/Pelvis which was notable for new large retroperitoneal mass engulfing aorta, SMA, celiac, and renal arteries, as well as IVC and left portal vein thromboses.
Past Medical History: - L capsular CVA with right sided hemiparesis and aphasia - Small cell lung cancer s/p XRT to RUL and 4 cycles cisplatin in [**2116**] - Gastric AVMs on EGD in [**2-/2121**] - HTN - HL - Depression - Hypothyroidism - s/p R hemicolectomy for h/o cecal mass in [**2111**] - Osteopenia - s/p PEG placement for failed speech and swallow in [**5-29**]   Social History: Lives in nursing home.
No alcohol or illicit drug use.

Increased small right pleural effusion.
Possible right hilar mass.
Persistent right upper lobe collapse or, depending on surgical history, apical pleural collection after upper lobectomy.
Large 5 x 12 cm soft tissue mass engulfing the aorta, SMA, celiac and renal arteries and extending into the IVC which is thrombosed.
With a history of lung cancer this may represent metastasis.
Moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation and infiltrative lesions.
Thrombosis of the left portal vein.
Diffuse anasarca, moderate right pleural effusion.
Decreased aeration at the right base compatible with increased pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Persistent right upper hemithorax opacification, which could represent upper lobe collapse or post-surgical/post-radiation changes.
Discharge Labs: [**2123-8-17**] 07:45AM WBC-8.7 RBC-3.11* Hgb-8.1* Hct-26.0* MCV-84 Plt Ct-346 Glucose-121* UreaN-29* Creat-0.6 Na-136 K-4.4 Cl-108 HCO3-17* Mg-2.1   Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo F w/ h/o gastric AVMs, cecal mass, small cell lung ca s/p radiation and chemotherapy now p/w hematemesis and found to have a  retroperitoneal soft tissue mass as well as IVC and left portal vein thromboses.
# UGIB - The patient presented with coffee ground emesis, melanotic stools, and coffee grounds on G tube lavage suggestive of UGIB.
The patient has a known history of gastric AVMs s/p argon laser in [**2120**].
She remained hemodynamically stable with no signs of poor perfusion.
GI was consulted and an EGD was performed on [**8-11**] which revealed an ulcer around the G-tube.
# Retroperitoneal mass - A CT Abdomen and Pelvis performed on admission showed an impressive RP mass engulfing the aorta, SMA, celiac and renal arteries.
This was concerning for metastasis given the patient's history of small cell lung cancer.
The CT also showed IVC and left portal vein thrombosis of unknown chronicity.
Vascular surgery was consulted and determined that there was no possible surgical intervention.
Per discussion with the patient's sister (her HCP), this was actually not a new mass but had been discovered by her oncologist at [**Hospital1 3278**] [**Hospital1 336**].
# Leukocytosis - On presentation the patient was found to have leukocytosis to 12.4, but with no left shift.
There was no fever or cough, and CXR showed only chronic right pleural effusion.
# Diarrhea - She was noted to have diarrhea during her hospitalization.
# Positive UA/urine cx:  Pt was noted to have bacteria and pyuria in UA.
# Metabolic acidosis - On presentation the patient had a metabolic, non-gap, acidosis.
This was thought to be due to GI loses as well as some uremia and resolved.
# Anemia - She presented with acute on chronic anemia given current GI bleed.
Her baseline anemia is consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Hypernatremia - She was noted to be hypernatremic during her hospitalization.
# h/o CVA - her aspirin was held.
If she continues to tolerate lovenox without any evidence of recurrent GI bleeding, would consider adding back her aspirin.
