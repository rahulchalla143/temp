Found to have multifocal PNA, likely parainfluenza in origin.
ACUTE ISSUES: # PNA/Bronchitis: Pt presented with acute onset SOB and cough and had CXR findings c/w multifocal PNA.
Due to low suspicion for HCAP, his antibiotics were subsequently changed to aztreonam and Levaquin based on the patient's history of anaphylaxis with penicillins.
Rapid viral testing was sent which came back positive for parainfluenza virus.
Multiple blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn, all of which returned no growth.
He spiked a new fever on [**6-13**].
He was wheezing on presentation which improved with nebulizers.
# Pulmonary Edema/CHF: On [**6-12**], patient was given IVF due to low urine output of prerenal etiology (FENa 0.28%).
He developed acute SOB with wheezing and rales on exam and dropped his O2 sat to 88% during the episode thought to be due to diastolic CHF.
The patient's most recent echo in [**12/2156**] showed preserved EF but moderate AS with LVH.
His respiratory status and SOB improved with Lasix and doses of IV morphine.
The patient had no other issues of pulmonary edema after this episode.
# Mouth pain: Patient with significant mouth pain during hospitalization, attributable to his known osteonecrosis of the jaw.
He used his home chlorhexadine mouthwash, cephasol and also lidocaine-containing mouthwash for symptomatic relief.
The patient was evaluated by the oral and maxillofacial surgery team during the admission, who deferred surgical or aggressive management until outpatient, but did advise on symptomatic control.
He required no more fluid boluses after arriving on the OMED [**Hospital1 **].
# Decreased UOP: The patient initially presented to the ICU with dysuria, dribbling stream and difficulty urinating.
He was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-7**] where he reportedly had a positive UA and was started in Cipro.
Pt's residual volumes were 182-183 on bladder scan and it was determined that he Most likely required more fluids in the setting of insensible losses [**1-13**] fever and general decreased PO intake over the past few days.
He was given 500cc of crystalloid and developed pulmonary edema as described above.
Cultures here were negative but he is covered for urinary pathogens with Levaquin (which he received for a total of 7 days during this hospitalization).
A Foley was placed to monitor urine output during diuresis after pulmonary edema developed, which was succesfully discontinued prior to his discharge.
# Multiple Myeloma: Pt.
Patient to follow-up with primary community oral surgeon regarding symptomatic treatment of his jaw osteonecrosis.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 932**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: bilateral influenza, parainfluenza  Secondary Diagnosis: multiple myeloma osteonecrosis of the jaw   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for low blood pressure and evidence of pneumonia.
It appears that you had a viral pneumonia that was severe.
You should continue to take all of your medications you had previous to your hospitalization, EXCEPT: - ADD caphasol (Saliva solution) mouthwash - ADD tylenol for pain control - ADD Peridex mouth wash twice daily  ** You were on a higher dose of Warfarin a couple weeks prior to the hospitalization.
