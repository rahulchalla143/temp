HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, blastic variant, who presented on [**2173-3-11**] with fevers and a white blood cell count of 1.2.
The patient initially presented in [**2172-11-7**] when he noted pallor and fatigue.
A laboratory workup at that time showed him to be anemic with mantle cells in his peripheral smear.
A computed tomography scan showed diffuse mediastinal, axillary, retroperitoneal, and deep pelvis lymphadenopathy.
In [**2172-12-7**] the patient [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a cycle of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy which was complicated by febrile neutropenia.
In this session, the patient was noted to develop atrial fibrillation which spontaneously reverted to a sinus rhythm.
After the second cycle of hyper-CVAD therapy the patient developed a cough productive of blood/green sputum.
The patient had this cough two days prior to presenting to his oncologist.
The patient presented for a computed tomography scan for further workup of a nodule noted on chest x-ray.
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Attention deficit disorder.
History of left ventricular thrombus.
History of cerebrovascular accident without residual deficit.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and coronary artery disease.
Mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 53.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed perioral lesions, multiple buccal lesion.
Chest examination revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally.
There was a very mild 1/6 systolic murmur heard best at the apex.
The abdomen revealed a minimally enlarged spleen and nontender.
There was no rebound or guarding noted on examination.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There was no lymphadenopathy appreciated; no cervical, inguinal, or axillary.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service with a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia.
Sputum was sent for culture.
The impression was new development of diffuse patchy and nodular alveolar opacification.
These were noted to be confluent in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe.
The differential diagnosis included viral, bacterial, fungal, or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Further complicating the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was a persistent nose bleed.
An Ear/Nose/Throat consultation was obtained, and the nose bleed was well controlled by keeping the patient's platelets above 50 and his hematocrit above 30.
Specimens from the lavage were negative for acid-fast bacilli.
No Pneumocystis carinii were noted.
In addition, multiple blood cultures obtained from the patient during fever spikes remained negative for bacteria.
The sputum culture was negative for respiratory pathogens.
On [**2173-3-17**], he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for his worsening pulmonary function and for persistent atrial fibrillation (as described below).
The patient remained in a normal sinus rhythm and appeared to be in very mild congestive heart failure.
His lungs had crackles at the bases, and his jugular venous pressure was minimally elevated.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed atrial fibrillation.
However, he persistently had episodes of tachycardia to the 150s.
