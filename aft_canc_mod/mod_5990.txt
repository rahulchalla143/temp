# acute renal failure: etiology of ARF was unclear but was likely multifactorial, with post-renal, as patient voided 1L after placement of foley in ED; prerenal, as dry on exam at admission, has increased volume loss with ostomy and had volume-responsive hypotension; and intrinsic, as creatinine was slightly elevated at 1.6 3 weeks pta.
Foley removed on [**8-23**] and patient able to avoid with no post-void residual.
This suggested that obstruction was only one, perhaps more minor, contributing factor.
Of note, the renal ultrasound the patient had was after decompression with Foley catheter and given possibility of post-XRT scarring may not have shown hydroureter.
# altered mental status: likely secondary to uremia; avoided benzos and initially held antidepressants, but added them back without significant sedation or delirium.
At discharge she was noted to have a flat affect, with cogwheel rigidity, raising the question of Parkinsonism secondary to ziprasidone (Parkinson's disease less likely as patient does not have tremor).
Alternatively flat affect may be due to schizoaffective disorder.
# lactic acidosis: lactate 6.5; normotensive without leukocytosis or overt signs of infection; suspect most likely due to metformin use with marked decrease in renal function.
Metformin held during admission and should not be restarted at rehab given impaired renal functinon.
# colorectal cancer: s/p one cycle Xeloda, last before [**8-2**] appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] per patient.
Discussed with surgery, who confirmed that patient's GI tract is intact, with anastomosis; ileostomy was planned to temporarily decrease stool passing new anastomosis.
# depression: initially held outpatient Effexor, Geodon, & Klonopin.
Restarted effexor and geodon after mental status cleared, but holding klonopin as patient became very sedated after receiving single dose of this.
# diabetes: Bld glc mildly elevated (258) on admission, with no ketones in urine, so not c/w ketoacidosis.
Briefly on insulin drip for euglycemic control, transitioned to sliding scale insulin.
Holding metformin given lactic acidosis in the setting of elevated creatinine; can re-evaluate and likely restart this after renal function has normalized.
# HTN: now normotensive, likely due to dehydration.
Currently does not need from a HTN point of view, but would be helpful from a diabetes standpoint.
Likely from recent chemo.
K is slightly elevated at 5.2 at discharge.
Mild hyperkalemia may be due to diabetic hyporeninemia and hypoaldosteronemia.
- hyponatremia: improved with volume resuscitation, c/w hypovolemic hyponatremia .
OSA: patient with labored breathing and snoring during sleep, but does not carry diagnosis of OSA.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: acute renal failure stage 3 rectal cancer depression .
Secondary: Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute renal failure, which is resolving after placement of a Foley catheter to decompress your bladder.
