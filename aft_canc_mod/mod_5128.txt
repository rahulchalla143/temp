Admission Date:  [**2176-11-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-11-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2136-4-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 40 year old man with a history of depression who is transferred from the [**Hospital3 **] ED with hemoptysis.
Since that time he has had severe pain on his right side, particularly with movement or respirations.
He has also had hemoptysis since that time.
He has had persistent pinkish sputum.
He initially presented to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where CXR showed dense RLL and RML consolidation and patchy RUL infiltrate.
By verbal report from the ED, this was felt to be likely hemorrhagic consolidation of R lung and possible RLL bronchus clot.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care of pulmonary hemorrhage.
CXR revealed RLL and RUL opacities, and he was given doses of levofloxacin and flagyl.
His OSH CT was reviewed by radiology here and was read as intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the R, but no RLL bronchus clot.
IP was [**Name (NI) 653**], and they recommended admission to the ICU for bronchoscopy.
Works in sales for a paving company (recently sold his own paving/masonry business).
Family History: FH: Father had a valve replacement.
Markedly decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion [**12-25**] way up on the R. No wheezes or rales.
Heart: RRR, no m/r/g Abd: +BS, soft, mild TTP in the RUQ which is mainly over the lower ribs.
CXR: Consolidation of right lower lobe.
Opacities in right upper lobe also seen; which may reflect multifocal pneumonia or developing contusions.
WBC-32.6* RBC-2.86* HGB-8.5* HCT-26.0* MCV-91 MCH-29.7 MCHC-32.5 RDW-13.9 LACTATE-1.0 GLUCOSE-92 UREA N-16 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-135 POTASSIUM-4.8 CHLORIDE-96 TOTAL CO2-29 ANION GAP-15  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 70747**] is a 40 year old man with a history of depression who presents with hemoptysis and dense RML and RLL consolidations in the setting of chest wall trauma.
1) Pulmonary hemorrhage: Pt with history of chest wall trauma, imaging concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage.
Also with possible RLL bronchus clot on CT read at OSH, radiology here does not agree.
Differential diagnosis of consolidations also includes infection.
However, hematocrit continued dropping at outside hospital following admission, concerning for continued bleeding.
The patient had an elevated white count and was treated for possible pneumonia (given fever, WBC) with levo/flagyl x 7 day course.
Pain controlled initially with dilaudid pca, changed to MScontin with MSIR for breakthrough pain.
Likely blood loss anemia secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage based on imaging, history of trauma.
3) Fever/Leukocytosis: Here, WBC 32 with left shift but no bands.
Treating possible pneumonia as above with levofloxacin/flagyl.
Patient was afebrile with downward trending WBC at time of discharge.
4) Thrombocytosis: Marked thromocytosis both at OSH and here, with unknown baseline.
Most likely this is reactive thromocytosis in the setting of hemorrhage/infection.
5) RUQ tenderness: Mainly tender over the lower ribs (likely either secondary to bruising from the fall vs. muscular strain from coughing).
CT abd/pelvis at OSH was reportedly negative for evidence of subacute GI bleed.
At that time, he was deemed to lack capacity for his own medical decision-making as he was experiencing some delirium and risk of medical sequelae was considered to be high.
Patient has no further episodes of self-injurious behavior and Psychiatry consultant felt there was no contraindication to discharge home.
Pneumonia 5.
Depression 6.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were found to have bleeding in your right lung after a traumatic injury you sustained.
Your bleeding has been well-controlled over the past few days.
You were also treated for pneumonia during this hospitalization.
You still have some evidence of healing injury in the right lung, but your oxygen levels are adequate to go home.
