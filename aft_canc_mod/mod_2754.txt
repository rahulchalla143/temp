Pt c/o increasing edema R>L, +orthopnea, denied bloody/black stools, but dark urine, feeling very weak with standing, "near syncope" at home.
Per OSH notes, "exam worrisome for PE given large swollen leg, but already anticoagulated with INR 3.2".
Also received Factor IX for unclear reasons, no frank BRBPR or signs of sanguination.

Hypoxia: Pt initially felt to be a vasculopath with poor pleth and inaccurate peripheral O2 sat [**Location (un) 1131**] resulting in likely premature intubation.
CXR c/w pulm edema which may have improved with BiPAP.
No signs of PNA on CXR.
On HD#2 pt with increased sputum production, with sputum cx positive for GNR.
He was continued on vanco/ctx empirically for ?sepsis as below, however CTA was negative for consolidation or PE.
Pt extubated [**10-5**], without difficulty, though had been some concern regarding periods of sinus pauses (up to 10 seconds) with coughing on the vent, felt [**3-1**] increased vagal tone.
EP consult obtained, as below, felt pauses were [**3-1**] pulmonary disease and vagal tone, without intrinsic conduction disease.
Given emphysema seen on CXR may continue to need O2 chronically but should reassess as edema/CHF continues to improve.
GIB: pt with melena per OSH records in setting of supratherapeutic INR, unclear hx of GIB or colonoscopy done.
Serial HCT were stable 27-28 throughout MICU stay, no recurrence of melena.
We continued to hold coumadin and anticoagulation as risk of variceal bleed remains considerable, balance is of risk from GIB versus several week risk of stroke from atrial fibrillation; GIB risk appears at this point to be more severe and immediately worrying.
Hypotension: admit SBP 74/55, etiology unclear, ddx sepsis vs volume loss [**3-1**] GIB vs some component of pump failure (RV vs LV).
pt initially covered with vanco/clind for concern for cellulitis.
he was started on dopamine gtt HD#1, switched to levophed given excess tachycardia on dopa gtt.
TTE revealed severe RV dysfunction raising concern for PE, however LENI's and CTA were unremarkable.
on HD#2, pt initially doing well after ~1L diuresis overnight (pt felt to be in RV failure, significantly volume overloaded, and with poor starling physiology).
We started him on less than his prior home dose (100 mg daily), at 37.5 [**Hospital1 **]; rate and pressures remained within good control without hypotension or bradycardia.
Pt with elevated dig level on admission (2.1).
**PUMP- baseline EF, however moderate pulm edema on CXR.
TTE obtained which showed EF 40-50%, no new [**Male First Name (un) 4746**], 1+MR, and severe RV dysfunction concerning for PE.
CTA negative for PE, but showed severe COPD, which is likely chronic cause of RV strain.
**RHYTHM- h/o AF on anticoagulation, initially in NSR, found to have supratherapeutic dig level (2.1), dig was held.
over coarse of HD#[**1-31**] of MICU stay pt with frequent episodes of bradycardia, initially attributed to vagal effects from coughing while on mechanical ventilation.
on HD#2, pt brady to 20s, inciting event unclear, received 0.5 mg atropine x 2 with rapid and appropriate HR response to 160s, SBPs dropping slightly during event from 100s to 80-90s.
EKG shows afib, with IVCD, but otherwise no evidence of dig toxicity.
Pt seen by EP, who felt sinus arrest / asystole was [**3-1**] pulmonary disease only, and no intrinsic cardiac conduction disease was present.
Pt was placed on extrinsic cardiac pacing pads, with intermittent episodes of bradycardia with coughing requiring pacing.
Some concern about bradycardia with extubation, however pt extubated without complication on [**10-5**].
His episodes of bradycardia resolved after extubation, rather pt had persistent episodes of his chronic afib (rates 130s-140s); per EP consult, there were no plans for pacemaker presently.
Rather the pt was started on diltiazem gtt and transitioned to PO diltiazem for rate control.
** ISCHEMIA - unclear h/o CAD s/p MI, EKG without evidence of active ischemia, low voltage, cardiac enzymes unremarkable (peak trop 0.03), TTE without focal WMA.
ASA held [**3-1**] GIB, BB held [**3-1**] hypotension initially.
ARF: Unclear Cr baseline, initially elevated most likely [**3-1**] poor forward flow [**3-1**] total body volume overload, no obvious recent contrast loads or other periods of hypotension though although ?recent episode of syncope.
Cellulitis: pt initially with diffuse erythema, warmth and edema of LE R>L, not diabetic but extremeties appear to have chronic venous stasis changes with LE ulcers, dopplerable pulses b/l.
Per pt's pcp felt to have bilateral le cellulitis, and was initially started on vanco/clinda, broadened to vanco/CTX to give additional empiric pneumonia coverage, however later felt cellulitis unlikely, perhaps more likely to be chronic edema changes, and d/c'd vanco after 5d course.
# FEN: pt given TF while intubated, then seen by speech & swallow [**10-8**], and advanced to regular diet 9/12 per S&S recs.
# ACCESS: L IJ TLC placed on admission [**9-30**], d/c'd on [**10-9**] after pt found to have superficial cephalic vein clot (no need for anticoagulation).
