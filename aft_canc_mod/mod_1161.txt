Admission Date:  [**2164-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Fever, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial Line Placement PICC placement and removal Central Venous Line Placement x2 PEG tube placement Midline placement Stoma Intubation  History of Present Illness: 85 y.o.
Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough.
Via translation with pt's family member 2 days ago pt felt "unwell", fatigued with some chills and subjective fevers.
Pt also noted some abdominal discomfort, rt sided chest pain, dizziness.
He also endorses several episodes of BRBPR for the past 2 days.
Per his son he has had problems with BRBPR over the past few months.
Prior to transfer to the floor pt was noted to have desaturations and was intubated through his stoma.
Levophed was also initiated due to an SBP in the mid 90s following Versed and Fentanyl for intubation.
Past Medical History: Anemia Metastatic Lesions to the bone Prostate Adenocarinoma on Lupron s/p thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation for Papillary Thyroid CA([**12/2156**]) Total laryngectomy w/ right modified radical neck dissection for SCC of the larynx ([**2-/2156**]) h.o.
He used to work as a business man and would travel to [**Country 3992**] for his business.
Cardiac: S1 S2, tachy (100), irregularly irregular Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Extremities: No edema, 2+ radial, DP pulses b/l Neurologic: Able to relate history through son who was translating.
Followup to resolution is recommended to exclude underlying malignancy.
TTE ([**2-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Occlusive thrombus also noted within a second left brachial vein.
Moderate-sized right rectus abdominis hematoma corresponding to palpable abnormality as discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34732**] at the time of dictation.
Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with patchy opacities consistent with infectious process within the right middle and lower lobes.
Lingular opacity reflects infection and/or atelectasis.
New hypoattenuating lesions within the liver are not well evaluated on this non-contrast enhanced study however consistent with new metastatic disease.
Progression of sclerotic metastasis within the spine without evidence of spinal canal encroachment.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo M, Cantonese-speaking only with PMH of tracheostomy s/p laryngectomy, met prosate CA, thyroid CA, who presented with fever, hypoxia and new A-fib with RVR.
# Sepsis: On admission to the ICU the patient was septic meeting SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of >104, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia with a suspected pulmonary source, pneumonia.
# Pleural Effusions: Pt's CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions, following completion of pt's antibiotics regimen and wean to minimal ventilatory support, diuresis therapy was initiated to aid with pleural effusion resorption.
# Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the mid 70s, pt was started on Levophed therapy, hypotension was likely secondary to sepsis.
Pt and pt's family gave a history of a lower GI bld from hemorrhoids.
During hospitalization pt was noted to have a tender RLQ abdomen a CT abdomen was obtained which showed a large 12 cm craniocaudal x 6.5 cm transverse x 2.8 cm anterior- posterior rectus sheath hematoma.
# Pneumonia: Admission chest x-ray in ED notable for severe RLL and RML PNA, pt was also noted to have volumous secretions from his trach requiring suctioing.
Prior to discharge pt was able to be weaned to minimal pressure support.
# New onset A-Fib: Pt was in the ED to be in new A-fib with RVR in the rate of 200s, pt's heart rate reverted to sinus rhythm following Diltiazem 10mg IV x 2, fluid administration and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO x 1.
Pt's A-fib most likely secondary to pt's hypovolemic, septic state.
An echo was obtained following admission and showed mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and biatrial enlargement.
Did not anticoagulate as pt risk of bleeding outweigs the benefits of anticoagulation.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt's Creatinine noted to be elevated upon admission to a maximum of 3.0 from a baseline of 1.1-1.2.
Urine electrolytes reflected [**Last Name (un) **] to be pre renal most likely secondary to his sepsis.
# Upper extremity thrombus: On [**12-17**] the patient's left upper extremity was noted to be swollen and an ultrasound showed a near complete occlusive thrombus surrounding the left PICC line in the left brachial and axillary veins.
Occlusive thrombus also noted within a second left brachial vein.
His PICC was removed, however anticoagulation was not started given a rectal sheath hematoma which was diagnosed the same day as well as bleeding around the site of a recently placed central line.
Long term anticoagulation was discussed and with his comorbidities, bleeding risk, and presentation of GI bleeding, it was decided not to start him on anticoagulation at any time in the future as the risk of bleeding is so high.
Given his poor nutritional status after discussion with the family a PEG was placed and tube feeds were ordered.
# Cancer: Pt has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma s/p thyroidectomy and radiocative iodine ablation ([**2156**]), squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy ([**2156**]) and recently metastatic prostate cancer (Extensive osseous metastatic disease on PET scan in [**2163-9-22**]).
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sepsis Pneumonia Respiratory Failure  Secondary: Metastic Prostate Cancer Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis Acute renal failure Anemia Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Fair, vitals stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a severe pneumonia.
In the Emergency Room you had a lot of difficulty breathing and you needed to be intubated.
Whilst you were in the intensive care unit you were able to be weaned down to only minimal support on the ventilator.
