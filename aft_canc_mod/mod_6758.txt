RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderately depressed free wall contractility.
There is a 1.5-2.0cm echogenic filled space anterior to the right ventricle and left ventricle which appears similar to the pre-operative images of [**2158-2-28**] and likely represents epicardial fat.
Post-op, she was taken to the ICU on neosynephrine drip for BP support.
Initially, she required some blood products & IV fluids for labile BP, she was placed on inotropes for cardiac index.
Her pressors & inotropes were also weaned off during those days.
On POD # 6, a speech/swallow evalutaion was obtained due to some apparent difficulty swallowing.
