The patient had gone to oncology clinic for scheduled chemo (CD40 inhibitor study drug), when found to have new right-sided chest/shoulder pain, hypoxia to high 80s/low 90s on RA, tachycardia to 120s, and hypotension to 83/58.

In the clinic, he was given heparin bolus 5000 units for concern of PE given increased lymphedema on right side and risk factors, and sent to ED.
CXR showed persistent right mid lung patchy opacity likely representing resolving pneumonia, with slightly enlarged right- sided pleural effusion.
CTA showed no PE but showed increased R effusion and ground glass opacity likely persistent resolving infection, LLL opacity increased from prior.

No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic pathology.
Slightly increased right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Persistent ground-glass airspace opacity in the right lower lobe likely represents resolving infectious process.
Increased nodular density adjacent to the left lower lobe suture line, which is a nonspecific finding and may represent inflammatory changes, although an infectious etiology cannot be excluded.
Resolution of left lower lobe mucoid impaction seen on prior study.
No change in axillary adenopathy.
Unchanged pre- existing right basal parenchymal opacities, with small ventral opacities that have newly occurred and most likely correspond to healing infection or atelectasis.
No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
No pleural effusions.
No recent pneumonia.
No evidence of lymphoma in the abdomen.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed systolic function (more precise assessment is limited by poor acoustic windows).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Loculated pleural effusion anteriorly is decreased in size although demonstrates enhancement and empyema can therefore not be excluded.
Unchanged appearance of infiltrative soft tissue mass involving the root of mesentery and retroperitoneum.
Left pelvic side wall and right peri-psoas lymphadenopathy is also unchanged.
Stable mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation with no evidence for acute cholecystitis.
CT Chest [**2135-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: Mild interval decrease in right pleural fluid.
Specifically, no evidence of new parenchymal infectious process  DISCHARGE LABS: WBC: 13.4/9.2/28.1/347 CHEM 7: 136/4/96/25/29/1.3/97  Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male with refractory Non hodgkins lymphoma on trial anti CD40 chemo protocol with a complicated medical history including COPD and M. xenopi infection as well as multiple recent pneumonias who presented with sepsis requiring brief ICU stay in the setting of a MRSA pneumonia.
Developed C. diff and was treated with oral vancomycin starting [**2135-5-21**], total duration of treatment should be 2 weeks every 6 hours.
MRSA Pneumonia, sepsis:  Given the patient's hypoxia and right-sided pleuritic chest pain upon presentation, a CTA was done which failed to find a PE.
The patient completed a 14 day course of vancomycin during which his clinical status as well as his pleuritic chest pain improved dramatically.
By the end of his treatment course he was able to ambulate on room air without desaturation.
On [**5-21**], a CT abdomen was done to investigate diarrhea but ended up noting a loculated effusion at the lung base.
Pulmonary was consulted and given than effusion was deceasing in size, no acute intervention was necessary as he was clinically improving.
# C.Diff: On [**5-20**] the patient began to complain of multiple loose stools with associated abdominal pain.
Given his persistent bandemia and recent antibiotics, a C. diff culture was sent and returned positive.
Once his clinical status improved however, he was persistently tachycardic and orthostatic.
Every attempt was made to maintain euvolemia without third spacing in the setting of hypoalbuminemia.
He was started on [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 55852**] with slight improvement.
A TTE was repeated and showed decreased LV and RV function.
A cardiology consult was called and recommended uptitrating beta-blockage in the setting of a multi-factorial atrial and multi-focal atrial tachycardia from deconditioning, COPD, and progressive failure to thrive.
While in the hospital, the patient noted a new, right-sided supraclavicular lymph node.
CT head and neck were done without contrast to evaluate for progression of disease and did not show any obvious progression.
Unclear cause of aspiration, likely secondary to overall poor conditioning.
He was evaluated by speech and swallow by bedside and video swallow at which time he was noted to be aspirating all types of foods and liquids.
He was kept NPO except for sips of tea as patient was insistent on drinking tea and unwilling to be entirely NPO.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to your difficult breathing and low blood pressure.
You were found to have a MRSA pneumonia for which you were treated with 14 days of an IV antibiotic named vancomycin.
[**Name2 (NI) **] completed that course with improvement in your breathing status but then developed worsening diarrhea and were found to have an infectious diarrhea called C.diff.
Additionally, you developed conjunctivitis (and eye infection) and were started on an anti-bacterial ointment four times a day.
If you have any shortness of breath, fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, arm swelling, severe pain, headache, blurry vision or any other concerning symptom, please seek medical care immediately.
