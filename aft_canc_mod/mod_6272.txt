Slight decrease in pericardial effusion post-placement of a pericardial catheter.
Increase in right greater than left pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Peri-bronchovascular ground-glass opacity may represent pulmonary edema.
At least one subcentimeter nodular opacity which was not previously identified; recommend continued CT followup to exclude recurrence, and if possible IV contrast.
TTE [**3-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion anterior to the right atrium.
Viral titers were not c/w acute infection.
Pt had repeat TTE after pericardial effusion removed (see above).
Etiology of pericardial effusion was ultimately idiopathic.
Renal Insufficiency: Thought to most likely represent gemcitabine induced HUS.
Pt had renal biopsy which showed TMA (by prelim path) which would be c/w HUS.
# b/l LE edema: Lower extremity u/s negative for DVT.
Pt treated c teds, elevation of LE and lasix 40 mg daily.
HTN: thought secondary to new renal failure.
Pancreatic cancer: Stage IIB s/p Whipple, radiation, capecitabine and recent gemcitabine course.
Pt to f/u c outpt providers after discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: gemcitabine induced hemolytic uremic syndrome, pericardial effusion secondary: pancreatic cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] because of fluid around your heart.
We also noticed that you were having hemolysis (red blood cells were bursting) and an injury to your kidneys that was new.
With all of the information that we have we think you probably had a rare side effect of gemcitabine called gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome which causes hemolysis and kidney injury.
It is also possible that the fluid around your heart was unrelated and was caused by a virus or by TB (the TB test is still pending).
The good news is that there were not any cancer cells in the fluid around your heart.
