Sinus rhythm.
Short P-R interval.
T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-11-27**] no significant change.
Reports: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2166-1-15**] 1:07 PM IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Gross distention of the distal esophagus, as well as small and large bowel.
No small bowel obstruction and no definite large bowel obstruction is seen, suggesting generalized ileus.
Although nondistention of large bowel past the sigmoid may represent physiolgic process, peritoneal spread of tumor or nondistention from chronic inflammation, with obstruction at this level cannot be entirely excluded.
No significant interval change in size or degree of local invasion of the pancreatic head and neck mass.
Occlusion of the portosplenic confluence with venous collaterals, unchanged since [**10-31**].
Bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases, unchanged since [**10-31**].
Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions/atelectasis, as well as perihepatic and perisplenic ascites since [**10-31**].
Mild intrahepatic biliary dilitaion.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with bilateral lower lobe volume loss.
There is no pneumothorax.
CT Head [**2166-1-27**]: No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
No abnormal enhancing lesion identified.
Area of encephalomalacia involving the right cerebellar hemisphere.
Changes suggestive of chronic microangiopathic change.
CXR [**2166-1-28**]: Slight increase in pulmonary edema; similar appearance of bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 79F with locally advanced pancreatic CA on Xeloda and oxaliplatin (C2D1 [**2166-1-8**]) admitted with diarrhea.
After cdiff was negative x 1, she was given symptomatic treatment of her diarrhea with loperamide.
She continued to have nausea and profuse diarrhea, and she was given tincture of opium as well as octreotide.
# Sepsis: After several days in the hospital, she became acutely hypotensive, tachycardic and hypoxic.
She was intubated for airway protection given concern for aspiration pneumonia.
Cause of patient's acute decompensation was unclear.
The team considered infection from bowel source (microperforation, SBP), aspiration event, or possible PE.
Patient remained intubated and on pressors for several days.
Antibiotics were selected to cover possible bowel pathogens given concern that she could have had microperforations or perhaps SBP given new finding of ascites on imaging.
# Acute renal failure - Oliguric on arrival to ICU.
# Pancreatic CA - Metastatic to lungs, although with fairly good functional status prior to admission.
# Coagulopathy: Patient's INR increased during admission despite holding coumadin.
UTI: There is a postive UA and bandemia.
She was afebrile and had no urinary symptoms.
