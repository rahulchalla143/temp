Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] senior life  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper gastrointestinal bleed   Discharge Condition: Stable in good condition   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of upper gastrointestinal bleeding that had manifested as red/dark stools.
In the Emergency Department you were noted to have a very low red blood cell count, likely because of this bleeding.
Because of this concern for gastrointestinal bleeding you were admitted to the Medical ICU for observation.
While in the ICU, you were seen by the Gastroenterologists who did an upper endoscopy which showed some erosions in the mucosa of your stomach but no active bleeding or deep ulcers.
Because your red blood cell count was low, you were given 5 units of red blood cell tranfusion.
You did not have any further bleeding or decreases in your red blood cell count and were deemed stable for discharge on [**8-18**].
The culture grew out a bacterial MRSA.
You will be treated with bactrim for this bacteria for a full 14 day course.
Call your primary doctor or go to the Emergency Room if you have any persistent fevers, any sudden weakness, any blood in your stool or very dark/black stools.
