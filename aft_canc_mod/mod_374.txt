Admission Date:  [**2123-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-5-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: NMED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Tonic-Clonic seizures and left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic placement of jejunostomy tube  History of Present Illness: 60 yo M w/ h/o CLL and CNS lymphoma admitted on [**2123-7-26**] s/p seizure x 3 at rehab.
The patient initially presented in [**2117**] with an increased WBC found during a pre-op workup for a hernia repair.
The patient was doing well until [**11-29**] when he presented with mild ataxia and memory problems.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11003**] biospy of his right parietal lesion revealed a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with evidence of demylination though was not diagnostic of lymphoma.
This was c/b ARF and the onset of seizures.
An attempt was made to wean his Decadron post-tx but was c/b L focal motor seizure.
The morning of [**2123-7-26**], he suffered 3 generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was brought to the ER.
During this admission, the patient continued to have seizures involving his left side.
An EEG in the ICU showed no evidence of seizure acitivity and then he was transferred back to the floor.
CLL: dx '[**17**] when he was noted to have an elevated wbc on preop labs for a hernia repair, 1st tx in [**8-28**] w/ chlorambucil and prednisone for NS, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly 2. hypercholesterolemia 3.
He is divorced w/ 3 children (2 daughters in [**Name (NI) 620**], 1 son in [**Name (NI) **], CO)   Family History: F w/ cancer (unknown primary), M w/ lung cancer (h/o tobacco)  Physical Exam: VS T98.5 P82 BP119/68 RR20 O2Sat93% HEENT: Some crusting inside mouth, but no lesions suggestive of thrush or mucositis.
Neck: No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Normal S1, S2, Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation (anterior exam) Abdomen: Hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound, no guarding.
Extremities: Warm, no clubbing cyanosis, or edema.
Erythema resolving.
Neuro: No longer rousable to voice or responding to commands.
Increasing extent of enhancement of the mass lesions present at the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles and splenium of the corpus callosum, with mass effect producing a mild right to left shift.
There is massive surrounding edema with mass effect on the ventricles and right to left mid-line shift.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage in the interval.
There is a small amount of air at the biopsy site.
CONCLUSION: S/P biopsy of multiple bilateral deep white matter masses.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
Again identified are numerous masses with massive edema and right to left mid-line shift.
There has been a slight increase in right hemispheric edema since the prior study.
-------------  EEG Study Date of [**2123-7-30**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background rhythm in the delta frequency range with generalized bursts of delta and theta frequency slowing.
Mixed theta and delta frequency slowing was also noted to be more prominant at times over the right peri-central region.
This finding suggests subcortical dysfunction in the right posterior frontal and parietal regions.
No epileptiform activity was seen during the recording.
-------------  EEG Study Date of [**2123-7-31**] This is an abnormal discontinuous 24-hour bedside telemetry.
There were generalized bursts of delta frequency slowing and at times the slowing appeared more prominent in the right parietal region.
The findings are suggestive of encephalopathy and there may also be a subcortical region of dysfunction in the right parietal region.
As the record progressed, the background rhythm did increase in frequency at times reaching the upper theta frequency range.
There was a brief period of delta frequency slowing in the right parietal region that did have some sharp features.
This suggests a subcortical dysfunction in this region and could reflect a breach rhythm.
Numerous masses with massive edema, minimally increased from the prior study, and consistent with a known history of CNS lymphoma.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
-------------  MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2123-8-6**] 7:09 PM No significant interval change in extent and appearances of the enhancing component of the lesion involving the splenium and periatrial region of both lateral ventricles compared with the prior study of [**2123-7-26**].
No new lesions are identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 60M CLL, CNS lymphoma diagnosed in [**2122-11-26**] status post multiple treatments now with progressive disease and increasing seizure frequency.
Following rituxan and high-dose AraC therapy, patient began to experience twitching of his left lower extremity, which he and his family thought were the prodromal effects of seizures.
Dilantin was titrated to a serum level of 19-20, and Lamictal was continued and no further seizures were noted.
Cerebral edema was managed with standing dexamethasone with intermittent increases as needed.
Although patient was initially able to respond verbally with full-length sentences, at the time of discharge, patient was completely unable to respond to verbal stimuli and was only able to respond to noxious stimuli.
Since there was no gross change on repeat MRI, it was thought that patient's disease continued to progress on a microscopic level that was not visualized by MRI.
At the time of discharge, patient's prognosis was poor given the progression of his disease despite chemo/biological therapy, and it was felt that patient would benefit from hospice care.
Patient's family was instructed to contact the hospital if they needed further assistance with management of palliative medications.
