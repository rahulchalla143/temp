is a 68 year-old right-handed woman with recently diagnosed carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the brain who presented with seizure.
At approximtely 2:30 this afternoon, she was found lying on the ground by her grandchildren with shaking movements of her limbs, apparently having a seizure.
EMS found the pt to have clonic activity of her right upper and lower extremities and with forced eye deviation to the right.
Past Medical History: -non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with multiple hemorrhagic metastases to brain in both frontal lobes and right temporal lobe -renal cell carcinoma: resected in [**2103**] with a left nephrectomy -thyroid cancer, papillary type, with insularfeatures diagnosed in [**2102**] that was removed surgically in [**2105**] with extracapsular extension, and vascular invasion.
In [**2108-8-24**], a persistently elevated thyroglobulin prompted retreatment with radioactive iodine.
-HTN -type II diabetes mellitus c peripheral neuropathy -hypothyroidism -Hx of positive PPD, (exposure to pt w/Tb when working as nurse's aide), s/p rx w/INH.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: supple, no nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Fundoscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Tone slightly decreased throughout.
The pt did not move her right upper or lower extremity to noxious stimuli but did localize to pain on the left.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Note is made of slightly increased hypodensity adjacent to the anterior most right frontal hemorrhage compared to the head CT of [**2111-1-3**].
However, this difference may be secondary to volume averaging and no new hemorrhage is identified in this area.
There is no new mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
A calcified right frontal meningioma is again noted near the vertex.
Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are remarkable only for a small amount of aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid sinus.. .
[**1-22**] CXR: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Again seen is small left lung volume with diffuse nodular thickening of the pleura compatible with the patient's known metastatic disease.
Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm has slightly increased compared to the prior examination and may represent increasing subpulmonic or subdiaphragmatic fluid collection/mass.
Note is again made of laminectomy defects of the cervicothoracic junction.
In ICU developed Klebsiella bacteremia thought [**2-26**] urinary source, MRSA PNA.
Developed urinary retention following removal of Foley catheter; Foley reinserted and 1 L urine drained.
Noted to have low free T4 on [**2111-1-29**] labs.
Infections - Likey etiology of Klebsiella bacteremia is UTI.
WBC elevated though likely leukocytosis [**2-26**] present dexamethasone use.
Chronic pain - - oxycontin 10 [**Hospital1 **] - morphine IV 2 mg q4h .
Low free T4 - low suspicion for ICU-related hypothyroidism.
Discussed c attg --> plan to maintain regular out pt synthroid dose and recheck thyroid levels after stable regimen of synthroid - continued synthroid .
HTN - well controlled on lopressor, lisinopril.
DM - On Lantus 40u qhs with improving FSG; likely will require decrease in dosing if not on steroids.
Sacral decubitus ulcer: Duoderm dressing applied to sacral ulcer.
Bacteremia 3.
Pneumonia Secondary 1.
Non-small cell lung Cancer 2.
Brain Metastases   Discharge Condition: Fair   Discharge Instructions: You should return to the ER or contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any further fevers, shakes, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, abdominal pain, or bony pain.
