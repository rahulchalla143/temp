HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old former anesthesiologist, who has a history of anaplastic oligodendroglioma which was picked up in [**2166-3-24**] by screening MRI of the head for an infertility workup.
The initial abnormalities were in the right temporal and right insular cortices with later involvement of the corpus callosum.
He had generalized tonic-clonic seizures shortly thereafter and was started on anticonvulsants.
He also was noted to have a leg abscess and hypotension and was seen by neurology and neurosurgery in consultation.
At that time, he was on Lamictal but because a rash on the chest was noted, Lamictal was stopped and Depakote was increased because the level was subtherapeutic.
He was readmitted from [**2168-4-6**] to [**2168-4-14**] with encephalopathy from a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, narcotics, and also a few seizures, although I do not know which type these were.
He was observed on long-term monitoring, during which he did have some subclinical brief electrographic seizures.
This was questionable for muscle artifact at the same time, which was fairly atypical appearing.
He was then readmitted on [**2168-4-24**] for increased seizure activity.
A head CT showed no new changes and a chest x-ray showed a persistent right middle and right lower lobe infiltrate, thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia.
Oligodendroglioma, status post Antineoplaston treatment    with temozolomide and whole brain radiation.
History of recent C-diff colitis and pneumonia.
His mother has a history of depression.
EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  GENERAL:  He is an ill-appearing man in no apparent distress.
No carotid bruits.
CHEST:  Lungs revealed some decreased breath sounds at the right lower lobe.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema or rashes.
MENTAL STATUS:  He was inattentive and extremely abulic.
;  There initially was a left pronator drift and upon sustained extension of the arms, the left drops more rapidly than the right.
It was not clear whether this was due to motor weakness alone, however.
SEIZURES:  The patient was admitted to the neurology [**Hospital1 **]    service with suspected increased seizure activity.
The previous recent medical    illnesses including the C-diff colitis as well as the    pneumonia were thought to be the exacerbating factors for    those episodes of increased seizure activity, but it was    not clear that these were acute issues upon this    admission.
Although he was on Neurontin and Keppra, as    well as Depakote, he was having at least two to three    clinical seizures a day on the neurology [**Hospital1 **], which    mainly consisted of right gaze deviation with some    twitching of the right side of the face.
He    remained fairly encephalopathic for the majority of the    hospital course, which was thought to be multifactorial,    in part due to poor seizure control, and potentially    sedating effects of Keppra.
He did not have any    significant metabolic or toxic abnormalities.
He also did    not have any significant systemic infections to account    for this.
Around the fifth hospital day, it was decided    to load the patient with phenobarbital orally as efforts    to increase his Depakote were still not making his    frequency of clinical partial seizures reduced.
He    appeared to be again more sleepy initially with a question    of the sedative effect from the phenobarbital, but an EEG    done on the day of initiation of phenobarbital did show    continuous 1 Hz discharges in the right parietal or    temporal regions.
In general, the rest of the background was very    slow and low voltage.
Because it was felt that the patient was extremely encephalopathic and that the goal of the admission was to try to improve his encephalopathy, an attempt at aggressive seizure control was made and the patient was sent to the Neuro ICU for intubation and loading with I.V.
He was monitored with extended EEGs throughout this course and again showed the same persistent pattern of epileptiform activity at about 1 Hz of spike and slow wave, which did not change whenever the patient had a clinical event that was thought to be a partial seizure, for example facial twitching on one-half of the face, usually the right side.
phenobarbital, the patient did not appear to have any more twitching events, and his phenobarbital level was brought up to a range of between high 20s and mid-30's.
He was again transferred back to the general neurology floor, where he remained more responsive to questions, albeit answering in short phrases but usually appropriately in response to orientation questions to place.
It was decided at this point that the Keppra should be tapered in the event that it was having a sedating effect on the patient.
Again, he is rather abulic and there appears not appear to be much increase by way of spontaneous motor activity.
ANEMIA:  The patient had a baseline anemia with a    hematocrit hovering in the 29 to 31 range.
They recommended a pureed diet    with nectar-thickened liquids.
It was felt that the    patient could enjoy an oral diet, but that the gastrostomy    tube would be there for backup nutrition needs, as well as    a reliable means of administering critical medications    such an anticonvulsants.
HISTORY OF RECENT C-DIFF COLITIS:  The patient did not    appear to have any more issues with his C-diff colitis and    has finished his course of Flagyl.
He felt particularly that the Dilantin should not be tried    again because of the patient's history of a possible    leukopenic reaction to the Dilantin.
With regard    to neuro-imaging and the status of the oligodendroglioma,    the most recent MRI of [**2168-3-14**] compared with an MRI in    [**2167-12-24**] showed some considerable reduction in the    diffuse flare hyperintensities present throughout the    right temporal, frontal and occipital lobes.
In [**Month (only) 404**],    it was felt that the tumor was infiltrating even further    and that there was extension of the tumor across the    corpus callosum, both anteriorly and posteriorly.
There    was also thought to be infiltration of now the left    hemisphere and the left medial temporal lobe.
Of note, an MR spectroscopy was done in    [**2167-10-24**], which showed progressive infiltrative    tumors centered in the right temporal lobe, but also    involving the right frontal and parietal lobes.
As    mentioned a CAT scan was done initially on admission at    [**Hospital1 **] - [**Location (un) 620**], and this showed no    changes consistent with hemorrhage.
to empirically    treat for potentially any mass effect that would have been    creating seizures that were difficult to control.
