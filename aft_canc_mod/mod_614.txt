The patient reports that over the past 2 months he has had dizziness described as imbalance in the setting of tapering off Effexor (per the patient's request to discontinue this medication).
He also noticed lightheadedness when getting out of his car or going from sitting to standing.
He also noticed a buzzing sound in his head, but this was not unilateral in his ears.
He denied weakness, numbness, diplopia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
He was evaluated by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2113-9-15**] and was found to be orthostatic on exam at that time (laying 147/75, standing 113/68).
He returned to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2113-11-15**] for tinnitus and vertigo when moving his head "from front to back".
He had stopped his Flomax because of these symptoms, and his Effexor continued to be tapered.
He denied any paraphasias, but reported that he felt "in a fog".
On ROS, in addition to above, he denies any shaking of his arms or legs, urinary or stool incontinence, or foul tastes/smells.
He denies any headaches.
He denies any weight loss or night sweats, but has been fatigued recently.

Enhancing mass centered in the left parietal lobe, with surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity and extensive local infiltration.
The most likely diagnosis is a high grade glial-based tumor, such as glioblastome multiforme.
Other neoplastic processes, such as metastatic disease and lymphoma are considered less likely given the extensive infiltrative behavior.
Similarly, tumefactive multiple sclerosis/demyelination or an area of infection are highly unlikely, again due to the infiltrative pattern.
Normal MRA of the head and neck without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection or aneurysm.
No definite findings of malignancy in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Multiple renal hypodensities, many too small to accurately characterize but not substantially changed compared to [**2112-10-5**] MRI, and the largest representing cysts, without abnormal enhancing focus seen on the current study.
Coronary artery calcifications.
Prostatic enlargement.
[**2114-1-11**] fMRI: Successful functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the expected activation areas during the different algorithms, few areas of activation are demonstrated adjacent to the left parietal mass lesion.
During the movement of the right foot, right hand and also during the movement of the tongue, the areas with high signal within the mass lesion, possibly represent venous contamination, however clinical correlation is needed.
Gas as well as curvilinear high density is seen within the right parietal resection bed as well as slightly more anteroinferiorly along the left temporoparietal region.
Some of the high density within the resection bed may represent [**Month/Day/Year **]-existing blood products in addition to perhaps some new blood products.
Overall, surrounding edema and sulcal effacement is not changed.
Expected post-operative findings after left parietal mass resection and left parietal craniotomy.
[**2114-1-13**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15046**] sequela with limited evaluation of the operative bed due to presence of T1 hyperintense blood products.
Stable probable infiltrative neoplasm in the left parietal lobe, thalamus, and splenium of the corpus callosum which does not enhance.

Please contact the pathology department, [**Name (NI) **] [**Numeric Identifier 1434**] PATHOLOGY # [**Numeric Identifier 15047**] FS left parietal tumor,    Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course on Neurology The patient is a 65 year old male who presented with lightheadedness, vertigo, and intermittent word-finding difficulties.
Imaging revealed a left parietal bleed and suggested an underlying mass, likely high-grade glioma.
CT torso did not reveal other neoplasms.
EEG was normal but the patient was started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis given his risk for seizures with the bleed and mass.
the prelim bipsoy results showed malignant glioma but the final result was still pending.
Aspirin and Plavix were held on admission due to the intraparenchymal bleeding and in preparation for neurosurgery.
He was started on keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **] which was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] at discharge for prophylaxis for seizures.
At DC, the neuro exam was notable for conduction aphasia but no other motor sensory deficits.
