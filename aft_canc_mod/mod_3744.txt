Patient is status post left occipital craniotomy with a regional osseous defect and overlying metallic mesh.
Soft tissue in the posterior left occiput overlying this region demonstrates edema and subcutaneous emphysema, as expected post-surgically.
Post-surgical pneumocephalus is also identified within the left occipital region as well as within the suprasellar cistern, in the left temporal, left frontal, and right frontal regions.
Left CP angle mass resection bed demonstrates a small amount of low density fluid layering along the left posterior fossa, with mild deviation of the posterior fossa contents to the right.
Mild effacement of the quadrigeminal plate cistern and fourth ventricle are present on the left, but decreased as compared to prior mass effect exerted by the meningioma pre- surgically.
Supratentorial cerebral parenchyma appears normal without evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift.
No osseous defect in addition to surgical defect as described.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute post-surgical intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a postoperative collection in the left lateral posterior fossa extending into the CP angle cistern with mass effect on the brainstem and cerebellum as well as shift of midline to the right.
There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
There is also mild leptomeningeal enhancement within the cerebellar folia, which is again post-surgical.
A minimal amount of enhancement is noted along the inferior most aspect of the left petrous ridge, image 22 series 9, which could represent venous sinus, but recommend attention on followup imaging.
There is tonsillar herniation, which is unchanged compared to the preoperative study.
There is question of the neural hypointensity within the spinal cord on the T1-weighted images.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes status post resection of left CP angle mass.
No large area of residual neoplasm is seen.
Question of linear hypointensity in the cervical cord.
No evidence for acute ischemia.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the dependent portions of the bilateral frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and occipital horns, and tracking inferiorly to the third ventricle and fourth ventricles.

There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Scattered opacification is noted in the ethmoid sinuses.
No interval worsening hydrocephalus.
No midline shift.
Small intraventricular hemorrhage in all ventricles, unchanged.
Interval removal of the extra-axial hemorrhage at left CP angle.Hypodensity in the left brachium pontis likely secondary to post surgical changes although ischemia is not entirely excluded.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**] As compared to most recent prior study, craniotomy and post-surgical changes in the left posterior fossa, with mildly decreased air and fluid collection with stable small amount of hemorrhage and maybe hyperdense post-surgical material.
Intraventricular hemorrhage extending from the lateral ventricles into the third and fourth ventricles with subsequent hydrocephalus is again noted.
There has been interval decrease in size of right lateral ventricle and third ventricle.
Tonsillar herniation and obliteration of the basal cisterns persists.
Mildly hyperdense material in the left frontal lobe (2A:22) may represent small amount of subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
No new areas of hemorrhage are seen.
There is a right transfrontal ventricular drainage shunt with the tip approximately at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**], unchanged in position.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the intracranial carotid arteries and vertebral arteries are noted.
Imaged mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable.

Slightly improved post-surgical changes in the left posterior fossa, status post recent evacuation of left subdural hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of right frontal approach ventriculostomy without evidence of hydrocephalus.
A focus of hyperattenuation adjacent to the catheter tip is unchanged, likely sequela of catheter passage.
Stable left posterior fossa post-surgical changes with persistent crowding of foramen magnum and mild low lying tonsils.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
NCHCT [**3-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate degree of new intracranial hemorrhage tracking along the catheter tract after catheter removal, with extension into the ventricular system, distending the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and tracking into the third and fourth ventricles.
No new hemorrhage.
No significant mass effect, edema, midline shift, or herniation LENIS [**4-1**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
MRI HEAD [**4-2**]: FINDINGS: When compared to the most recent head CT, there has been no significant change in the volume of intracranial hemorrhage, with the majority of residual hemorrhage remaining within the occipital horns bilaterally.
There are persistent blood products along the course of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter tract.
Within the dorsal pons, left middle cerebellar peduncle and anterior left cerebellar hemisphere, there is a focal region of hemorrhage with associated abnormal slow diffusion, with corresponding FLAIR signal abnormality.
The ventricles are mildly prominent and unchanged in size.
No significant interval change in the volume of intracranial hemorrhage, with the majority of blood layering within the occipital horns bilaterally, as well as along the resection cavity.
Abnormal slow diffusion centered within the left middle cerebellar peduncle is associated with small hemorrhage, and it is unclear to what extent the abnormal diffusion is related to the blood products and/or underlying true ischemia.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.

She was observed for 2 days in the ICU where she remained neurologically at baseline with left facial and left hearing loss.
She had decreased mental status on postop day number two.
She was scanned and noted to have bleeding into the resection cavity wiht effacement of the basilar cysterns.
She was kept intubated for approximately two days post-operatively due to a poor gag reflex.
Late in the evening, she was found with a GCS 3, reintubated, and sent for an emergent head CT.
Given her deterioration and CT scan, the EVD was replaced.
3% HTS @ 30cc/hr was started, with close monitoring of her labs.
However, on [**4-4**], after the HTS was discontinued, her NA again dropped to 128 and it was restarted in conjunction with sodium tablets.
Her left tibial vein displayed some "venous slowing" that was concerning for early DVT development.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
