Admission Date:  [**2186-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-4-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:  PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: Mrs [**Known lastname 81165**] is a 86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis who presents for evaluation for possible AVR.
Patient presented to the hospital in [**3-13**] with shortness of breath, fluid overload, and hypotension.
She was found to have critical aortic stenosis.
Her edematous legs and pulmonary edema has made it impossible for her to be independently mobile.
She was seen by her physician who recommended hospital admission for aggressive diuresis and a complete preop evaluation.
She thinks her shortness of breath has been stable since her recent discharge but is unsure because she has not been as mobile.
She admits to significant increase in bilateral lower extremity edema.
She denies chest pain, nausea, lightheadedness or diaphoresis.
She denies any recent illness with the exception of 1 day of diarrhea last week.
The patient denies palpitations or syncope, claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or transient neurologic deficits.
No change in weight or urinary symptoms.
No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, myalgias, headache or rash.
Past Medical History: # HTN # CHF # COPD: recently diagnosed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 656**] at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] # stable goiter # afib on coumadin # ?
aortic stenosis # GERD # osteoporosis # basal cell under left eye # s/p resection of childhood tumor "behind heart"  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 **].
Smoking: quit 40 years ago, but had 10 pack year priot to that   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.9 BP 104/66 HR 104 RR 24 SpO2 95% 4L Gen: NAD, comfortable HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, NCAT, mmm NECK: large nontender goiter on R, no JVD visible CV: holosystolic murmur with loss of S2 consistent with severe AS, no delayed upstrokes LUNGS: bibasilar crackles, good air movement ABD: + bs, Soft, NTND EXT: BLE 3+ pitting edema Skin: warm, dry, weeping edematous BLE Neurologic: no focal deficits, CN 2-12 grossly intact   Pertinent Results: [**2186-4-11**] Na 138 / K 3.5 / Cl 89 / CO2 42 / BUN 35 / Cr 1.2 / BG 118 ALT 13 / AST 27 / LDH 269 / Alk Phos 74 / TB 1.8 Alb 3.5 / Ca [**87**].2 / Mg 2.1 / Phos 2.8 WBC 7.9 / Hct 30.8 / Plt 222 INR 5.7 [**2186-4-13**] CXR - Marked widening of right superior mediastinal contour is consistent with intrathoracic extension of a goiter as reported on recent CT. Heart remains enlarged.
Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and new perihilar haziness are likely due to congestive heart failure.
Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in the left mid and both lower lungs favor atelectasis.
Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
[**2186-4-14**] Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild LVH with moderate global systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild valvular mitral stenosis.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old female with a history of HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty was admitted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.
Aortic Stenosis: She was diagnosed with critical stenosis during a prior admission.
Given her limited other medical options, she was not interested in additional therapy.
Congestive Heart Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 81165**] was in acute on chronic systolic heart failure upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] likely worsened related to her severe aortic stenosis.
Hypoxia Her hypoxia was likely multifactorial and related to her congestive heart failure, valvular disease, kyphosis, and her thyroid enlargement.
Atrial fibrillation She has chronic atrial fibrillation and was maintained on a beta blocker for rate control with coumadin for anticoagulation.
She was continued on her beta blocker and warfarin for symptomatic control of her symptoms secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO four times a  day as needed for fever or pain.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 2.5-5 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Congestive Heart Failure 2.
Aortic Stenosis s/p valvuloplasty 3.
Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
She is alert and can speak clearly intermittently throughout the day   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
This was thought likely related to your heart failure and severe valvular disease.
Given that your symptoms will likely not improve significantly without surgery, you were not interested in further treatment of your medical problems in a hospital setting.
- morphine - this is a medication you can use as you need for pain control or shortness of breath.
- seroquel - this is a medication to help you sleep at night.
