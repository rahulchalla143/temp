Admission Date:  [**2135-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-10-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2135-8-12**] Right frontal craniotomy resection of right frontal mass   History of Present Illness: As you will recall, he is a very pleasant, right-handed 31-year-old male who presented with a seizure about a week ago.
He had another episode in the hospital, which consisted of focal motor seizures involving his left upper extremity.
CT scan and MRI scan had revealed a right frontal lesion.
He has difficulty in moving his right shoulder secondary to the injury sustained at the time of the seizure.
His MRI scan of the brain which was consistent with a cystic lesion in the right frontal area anterior to the motor cortex.
I would think that there is a significant possibility that this is a low-grade astrocytoma and an excisional biopsy is warranted.
Functional MRI showed activation area for motor activity involving the left hand in close proximity posterior to the mass lesion.
This resulted in loss of consciousness, which was treated as a concussion, and shrapnel in his elbow.
Fundus shows no papilledema.
There is no Babinski.
Fundus shows no papilledema.
There is no Babinski.
Pertinent Results: MRI brain (WAND) [**8-12**] - 3.3 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm right frontal lobe mass, involving the ipsilateral pre-central gyrus, unchanged over the short-interval and likely a low-grade glial neoplasm (by previous imaging characteristics).
CT head [**8-12**] - Expected postoperative changes following right frontal craniotomy and mass resection, without acute intracranial abnormalities.
Brain MRI [**8-13**] post op - Fluid and blood products in the right frontal surgical bed  without associated edema or mass effect.
Appears to be a gross total resection.
Post operative CT showed post-operative changes within the surgical bed without evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
PT/OT recommended acute rehave vs. home.
Patient's pain is well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet or tubefeeds.
Pt's incision is clean, dry and intact without evidence of infection.
Allergies to sulfa, which causes a rash and increased LFTs.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg PO BID anxiety patient may refuse   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: right frontal lesion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-7**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
