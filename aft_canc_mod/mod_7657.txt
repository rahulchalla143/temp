At [**Hospital3 20284**] Center, he was noted to have fever of 104, blood cultures positive for pansensitive E. Coli bacteremia thought to be due to cholangitis based on RUQ showing intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and elevated liver enzymes.
CT abdomen on [**2153-2-11**] showed a 3.1 x 3.5 cm encasing common hepatic artery and 50% of SMV concerning for malignancy along with resultant extra and intrahepatic bile duct and pancreatic dilation.
Post-ERCP, he was noted to have significant pause while having a bowel movement but it was not recorded as the leads had fallen off.
Later that day, he was noted to have another significant pause, only a single complex over 22 seconds during which he was unresponsive requiring transvenous pacer wire placement by cardiology.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for another ERCP to treat his cholangitis and evaluate for the pancreatic head mass.
On the floor, he does not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria or itchiness.
On further review of system, he has had weight loss of [**10-31**] lbs for the past six weeks along with progressive weakness/fatigue and imbalance which has led to two falls with loss of consciousness or head trauma.
He had a transvenous pacer placed at [**Hospital3 20284**] center which was pulled as EP consult felt his episodes of sinus arrest were vagally mediated and he did not use his transvenous pacer.

Imaging Abdominal Ultrasound ([**2153-2-8**]) Intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with gallbladder sludge and tiny stones and a trace pericholecystic fluid.
The cause of obstruction is not visible with the pancreas is entirely obscured by bowel gas.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT Abdomen ([**2153-2-11**]) Pancreatic head mass (3.5 x 3.1 cm) encasing the common hepatic artery and 50% of SMV with resultant moderate intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The pancreatic duct is severely dilated and there is atrophy of the pancreatic body and tailed.
Left axis deviation vs possible left anterior fascicular block with QRS borderline at 96.
The partially imaged lungs show left greater than right pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
No nodules or consolidations are noted.
There is dilation of the pancreatic duct up to 1 cm terminating in a possible lesion in the head of the pancreas which is not definitely visualized.
Mild soft tissue is noted around the hepatic artery as well as a replaced left hepatic artery (4:35 and 4:45).
The liver shows small hypodensities that are too small to accurately characterize (4:24).
Pneumobilia in the left lobe is expected and unchanged.
No abdominal free fluid or free air is present.
The visible osseous structures show anterior osteophyte formation in the lower thoracic and mid lumbar spine.
No fractures, suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are noted.
Pancreatic Tumor Table: I: Pancreatic tumor present: Yes.
e) Remaining pancreas: Atrophic with pancreatic ductal dilatation.
b) Necrosis in lymph nodes: No.
c) Size of gastroduodenal artery node, "node of importance": No definitely seen.
Metastatic disease, definitely present: Yes.
e) Portal vein involvement: Yes, it is mildly attenuated with no thrombus noted.
IMPRESSION: 25 x 34 mm pancreatic head tumor as described above with soft tissue along the hepatic artery and left aberrant hepatic artery as well as encasement of the superior mesenteric vein and narrowing of the portal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: CHOLANGITIS / LIKELY NEW DIAGNOSIS OF PANCREATIC CANCER / E COLI SEPTICEMIA / BILE DUCT OBSTRUCTION: e coli is pansensitive, the patient was initially on broad spectrum antibiotics, narrowed to oral cipro for a 14 day course.
CA19-9 very elevated.
