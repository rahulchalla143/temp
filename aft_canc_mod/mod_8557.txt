The patient in the emergency department was complaining of distal radius and ulnar fracture.
She also had a right pubic ramus fracture.
Her chest x-ray revealed a left pleural effusion which was taped with a chest tube placed.
Chest tubes had poor drainage.
The patient went into unexplained respiratory arrest which required intubation.
The first two failed due to thick secretions and hypoxia.
The third attempt at extubating failed due to a stridor that failed to respond to steroids or racemic epinephrine.
On the [**9-4**] the patients clinical status deteriorated and a portable chest x-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions.
She remained pain free until her discharge on the [**9-6**] to hospice care.
She appears in no acute distress.
No apparent pain.
Her mucous membranes were moist.
Her neck showed no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
She does show decreased breath sounds, increased rales and rhonchi to the lower half of both lobes bilaterally.
No murmur, gallops or rubs.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with bowel sounds.
Her extremities showed +2 edema, no cyanosis or clubbing.
The patient had multiple radiographic studies while in the hospital.
Her last chest x-ray was performed on [**2145-9-3**], it showed that increased pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
There were parenchymal opacities in the left upper lobe as well as the left base which increased in comparison to the previous chest x-ray.
A chest CT performed on [**8-30**] showed a left loculated effusion;  a smaller right effusion;  a nodular left sided pleural thickening consistent with metastatic disease; persistent left hydropneumothorax;  extensive secretions in the left bronchial tree with partial left lower lobe collapse.
The catheter tip was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On the 12th the aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The sputum on the 12th and 13th were both positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The cytology for her effusions showed rare atypical cells insufficient for diagnosis.

The nodularity of the pleura was concerning for malignancy however, there is no definitive cancer cells seen on cytology of bronchial washings or pleural fluid.
On the [**9-3**] the patient suffered a clinical downturn along with what appeared to be effusions on the chest x-ray.
The patient had a left pleural effusion.
Cytology showed some atypical cells and the Interventional Pulmonology Team although not definitive, felt that this was a malignancy.
