At home he measured his temp to 102.9, describes diffuse myalgias, right frontal HA (worse than usual HA), and cough productive of a yellow sputum.
He has a cardiac history significant for mitral valve prolapse, status post mitral annuloplasty in [**2199-6-16**].
His course was c/b RV dysfunction (which seemed to resolve per notes but he remains on lasix 20 mg QD).
His CXR showed inreased interstitial markings but no cephalization, effusions or focal infiltrates.
Past Medical History: - Mitral Insufficiency s/p MVR with 28-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band in 7/99.
Postoperative course was c/b progressive dyspnea with bilateral effusions as well as an admission for right ventricular failure of unknown origin that was transient and may have been [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21160**]-like  syndrome.

Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring with increased gradient and mild mitral stenosis.
Moderate puomonary artery systolic hypertension.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-10-24**], the transmitral gradient is lower, but with smaller estimated mitral valve area.
FINDINGS: There is mild cardiomegaly, stable.
There is no focal consolidation, effusion or large pneumothorax.
There is slight increased fine reticular interstitial prominence which may be chronic.
Bilateral pectoral stimulator devices with the leads extending off the film are unchanged in position.
IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation identified.

Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory status seemed fairly stable when initially admitted, within the first day of admission ([**11-20**]) he had to be intubated for respiratory fatigue.
His respiratory failure seemed due to a primary pulmonary process (his PNA), rather than a cardiogenic process, as he had fever and there is no evidence of heart failure on exam or pulm edema/congestion on CXR.
He was called out to the floor with persistent O2 requirement and continuation of IV antibiotics.
Vancomycin, in particular, was started due to the patient's copious brown secretions while intubated and resulting concern for MRSA pneumonia.
However, it was eventually thought that after multiple negative blood cultures, sputum cultures, and even a negative BAL that pt perhaps never had a PNA and rather had a DFA negative severe influenza pulmonary infection.
His O2 requirement resolved with aggressive pulmonary physical therapy and incentive spirometry, and nebs.
The pt also did not seem volume overloaded and therefore lasix was discontinued.
Anxiety was found to be a significant component of the patient's occasional episodes of respiratory distress 4after extubation, and were managed successfully with prn morphine IV (as well as prn nebs and lasix).
Pt was found to have some delerium overnights, which may have been multifactorial with his baseline Parkinsons, NG tube, Foley catheter, tele, waking up pt to give sinemet (which he apparently never took at night at home).
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for Cough.
Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) community acquired pneumonia, 2) respiratory failure  Secondary: 1) Parkinson's disease 2) Anxiety  Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath and were found to be in respiratory failure and transferred to the intensive care unit for intubation and continuous respiratory support.
Your respiratory failure was initially thought to be due to a severe pneumonia but after multiple negative cultures and x-rays, it was thought more likely that you had a severe influenza virus infection of your lungs.
We have made the following changes to your medications, which are mainly aimed at clearing the residual mucous build-up in your lungs from your recent infection:  -START Acetylcysteine 20% 1mL every two hours as needed for secretions.
-START Ipratropium bromide 1 inhalation every 6 hours as needed for wheeze  -START Albuterol 1 inhalation every 6 hours as needed for wheeze   -START Guaifenesin 5-10mL by mouth every 6 hours as needed for cough  -START Benzonatate 1 capsule by mouth every 6 hours as needed for cough  It is also important that you use a walker until you regain your strength back after physical therapy.
