There is resulting mass effect and compression of right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is no erosion or definite hyperostosis identified of the adjacent bone.
There is mass effect resulting in compression of the right perimesencephalic cistern, and leftward displacement of the fourth ventricle, which still appears patent.
There is evidence of tonsillar herniation.
Overall, the ventricles have a slightly enlarged appearance, which could reflect a mild degree of outflow obstruction.
However, the tumor effaces the sigmoid sinus within its groove at the level of the fourth ventricle.
Elsewhere, there is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures or evidence of major vascular territorial infarcts.
There is no fracture.
Mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Large right posterior fossa extraaxial, enhancing, heterogeneous mass resulting in tonsillar herniation, compression of the right perimesencephalic cistern and displacement of fourth ventricle, likely causing a mild degree of outflow obstruction.
The imaging findings are most consistent with a large meningioma.
MRI head [**2124-4-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with a prior examination, again on the right side of the posterior fossa, there is a large apparently extra-axial mass lesion, measuring approximately 5.0 x 4.5 cm in transverse dimensions x 4.5 x 4.5 cm in the coronal MP-RAGE projection.
This lesion demonstrates mild hyperintense signal in comparison with the rest of the brain parenchyma on T1 without contrast.
Several heterogeneous signal areas are visualized on the FLAIR sequence within this mass lesion, possibly related with punctate calcifications and hyperintensity signal areas on T2, possibly related with small areas with cystic transformation.
With gadolinium contrast, this lesion enhance avidly, mild vasogenic edema is identified and significant mass effect and shifting of the fourth ventricle towards the left.
The prepontine cistern apparently is preserved, mild effacement of the inferior right collicular cistern is demonstrated.
Supratentorially, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement and both cerebral hemispheres are grossly normal, no diffusion abnormalities are detected.
Multiple areas of hyperintensity signal are visualized in the periventricular white matter, likely consistent with chronic areas of gliosis or small vessel disease.
Normal flow void is identified in the major vascular structures, the right posterior fossa mass lesion lesion is in close contact with the right trasverse sinus.
The coronal and sagittal images demonstrate right tonsillar herniation, approximately 1.5 cm of tonsillar herniation is demonstrated on the sagittal image.
Large extra-axial right posterior fossa mass lesion, with significant pattern of enhancement and areas of heterogeneous signal, more likely consistent with a large meningioma, resulting in right tonsillar herniation, mass effect, and compression of the fourth ventricle as described in detail above.
Multiple areas of hyperintensity signal are visualized in the periventricular white matter, likely consistent with chronic areas of gliosis or small vessel disease, however, nonspecific.
No other lesions or areas with abnormal enhancement are demonstrated.
CT Torso [**4-13**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: No pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are appreciated.
There is no hilar, mediastinal or axillary adenopathy.
No breast masses.
Bone windows show no abnormalities.
Initial wet read to raised the question of a filling defect involving the left pulmonary artery which is felt to be extrinsic to the artery or due to partial volume effect.
Note of a cyst involving the left pericardium.
The liver is unremarkable with a patent portal vein, no focal mass lesions, and no dilated ducts.
The kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, and visualized loops of large and small bowel appear normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: The visualized loops of large and small bowel appear normal.
There is no free fluid, no adenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic change.
No findings to suggest a primary source of this patient's intracranial pathology.
No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 71	160	110	386/405	47	22	48  MRI [**4-15**]: FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of right-sided posterior fossa meningioma.
Mild surrounding edema is identified.
No acute infarcts are seen.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The previously noted subtle periventricular signal abnormalities are unchanged.
Of concern is filling defect within the right transverse sinus extending from torcula to the region of the sigmoid sinus.
Inferior position of the cerebellar tonsils is again identified and is unchanged.
Postoperative changes in the posterior fossa with blood products, air, and surrounding edema unchanged with a downward position of the cerebellar tonsils as before.
Mass effect on the fourth ventricle is seen without hydrocephalus with a mass effect decrease since the previous study.
Filling defect is seen in the right transverse sinus concerning for thrombosis within the sinus.
CTA/V of Head [**4-16**]: CTV OF THE BRAIN WITH CONTRAST HISTORY: Suspected venous sinus thrombosis right transverse sinus.
There is a post-operative cavity in the right cerebellum with a hemorrhagic focus along its margins.
There is a mesh cranioplasty at the operative site.
Corresponding to the findings seen on the MRI, there is lack of normal flow in the mid to distal transverse and sigmoid sinus concerning for thrombosis.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of right distal transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q 1 hour neuro checks due to the large size of the posterior fossa mass and due to the mass effect on the 4th ventricle.
She was symptomatic such that she was experiencing headaches and difficulty with balance.
The patient was scheduled to have a craniectomy with resection of the mass which occurred on [**2124-4-14**].
Her neuro exam was stable without any focal deficit.
