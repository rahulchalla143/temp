New infection predominantly involving the right lower lobe and the right middle lobe, but with some involvement of right middle lobe and left lower lobe, radiologically consistent with mycoplasma haemophilus influenza or viral infection.
Right apical and upper lobe findings which might represent post-radiation changes, correlation with clinical history is recommended.
Several adjacent smaller subpleural pulmonary nodules are seen, 4:76, 4:79, all stable since the same period of time.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with past medical history of refractory follicular lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant complicated by GVHD of the skin and CMV viremia, who presented with worsening cough and CT findings.
# Cough, CT chest findings: Given the CT chest findings and his long-standing immunosuppressive therapy, there was concern for infectious process, or GVHD of the lung.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, and had recently completed a course of azithromycin, so no antibiotics were started until after the pt could undergo bronchoscopy.
This procedure was performed and an in doing so the pt became transiently hypotensive, hypoxemic and tachycardic.
