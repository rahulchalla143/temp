HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 43 year-old man with a newly diagnosed leiomyosarcoma involving the soft tissues anterior to the right tibia.
He was sent for an ultrasound, which revealed a solid area of 2.6 by 1.0 cm that was nontender to touch.
He did not seek any further evaluation for this until [**2127-8-25**] when he began to awaken in the night with pain in the area of the lump.
He then received an MRI scan, which noted to be a slightly increased interval in size to 3 cm and he was at this point referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for orthopedic evaluation.
The bone scan did show some mild increase uptake in the right tibia and the distal left femur.
The plain film of the left distal femur showed evidence of an enchondroma.
A CT and MRI were significant for a periosteal reaction in the bone adjacent to the small subcutaneous mass of low signal abnormality, which did enhance diffusely and measured approximately 6 to 7 cm.
He was taken to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2127-11-17**] for an incisional biopsy.
Final pathology report indicated a malignant spindle cell neoplasm consistent with a leiomyosarcoma.
The tumor was moderate cellular with moderate cytologic atypia and rare mitosis.
Flow cytometry revealed poly clonality to the B cells and mature lineage antigens from B cells and T cells indicating no evidence for a hematologic origin for this malignancy.
The surgical plan of treatment was to take the patient to the Operating Room for wide local excision of his leiomyosarcoma of the right tibia followed by immediate reconstruction by the Plastic Surgery Service with a gracilis free flap and split thickness skin graft to cover the wound.
The operation went well without any apparent complications and he was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
He had an excellent flap signal in the PACU, which was checked with doppler and a V.A.C.
The flap checks continued q one hours for a total of 48 hours without any complications and he was started on a diet on postoperative day two, which he tolerated well and was advanced without any apparent complications.
He remained afebrile in his postoperative course with a stable hematocrit and stable chemistry panel.
His pain control was managed initially with an epidural by the Acute Pain Service, which infused until postoperative day three when he was found to be tolerating po well at which time he was switched to OxyContin 20 mg po b.i.d.
with Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
He was made touch down weight bearing With crutches and mobilized by physical therapy on postoperative day number six, which he tolerated well without any apparent complications.
On postoperative day number seven the patient was found afebrile ni good condition without any complaints of pain and he was cleared by the plastics team for discharge with follow up in one week and for daily dressing changes with Xeroform and a Kerlix wrap to the site of his flap and split thickness skin graft.
From an orthopedic perspective Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] cleared the patient for weight bearing as tolerated to his right lower extremity and the patient will follow up with outpatient physical therapy to regain strength in his right leg.
The patient was instructed to call his physician or return to the Emergency Department if he developed any fevers or chills, temperature greater then 101.5 degrees, redness, swelling, discharge from the surgical site or if he is unable to eat or drink.
Leiomyosarcoma of his right lower extremity.
Status post wide local excision of a leiomyosarcoma of the right leg With prophylactic plate fixation, gracilis free flap with split thickness skin graft on [**2128-2-16**].
