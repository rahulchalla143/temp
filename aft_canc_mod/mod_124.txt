No increase in fatigue.
No f/c/s, n/v, d/c, abdominal pain, chest pain, or pain with inspiration.
Past Medical History: 1) CAD 2) HTN 3) Dyslipidemia 4) PVD s/p PTCA, RCI/LCI/LEI stenting, and fem bypass 5) Arthritis 6) h/o CVA while on ASA/plavix 7) BPH 8) Early Parkinson's Disease .
Onc History: subcarinal LAD noted on bronchscopy in [**1-23**] which was negative for malignant cells.
Referred by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] to heme onc for enlarged lower lobe lung mass.
Mediastinoscopy was performed in [**11-22**] which was suggestive of atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Lung biopsy performed revealed a large Bcell NHL.
The differential diagnosis includes an atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (with subset loss of CD23).
Unchanged size of left lower lung lobe mass measuring approximately 7.4 cm in greatest axial dimension.
Small pulmonary nodules in the lower lobes bilaterally are unchanged.

The aorta is calcified and tortuous without focal dilatation.
There has been interval worsening of right upper lobe, left upper lobe, and left retrocardiac airspace opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
There is a likely small left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Worsening of the multifocal pneumonia.
Interval increase in patchy ground glass opacities bilaterally, predominantly in the upper lungs, consistent with worsening multifocal pneumonia.
Unchanged appearance of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right middle and lower lungs, consistent with infection.
Severe consolidation in the left lung and in the right lung apex more significantly since [**5-8**].
Pleural effusion, moderate on the left and small on the right is stable.
Findings could represent worsening of either asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: Briefly pt is a 79 M with [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] syndrome (transformation of CLL to large B cell NHL) s/p 3 cycles of CHOP who originally presented here for multifocal PN on [**4-18**] and started on levofloxacin.
Pt then became hypoxic on NRB and CXR w/ worsening multifocal infiltrates.
He also developed diarrhea, a rising WBC, and a lactate up to 5.7.
He was tx'd back to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated.
He was noted to have an NSTEMI on [**4-29**] with peak MB 64 and Trop 1.08.
His volume status was managed, he was aggressively suctioned and extubated with a plan for no reintubation after extensive discussion with the family and pt's son and HCP(ie: DNR/DNI).
He became tachypneic and desaturated to an O2 sat of 79% on RA.
Prior to transfer to ICU, the patient was confused and in respiratory distress and did not reliably answer questions.
