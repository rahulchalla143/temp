Large heterogeneously enhancing anterior and middle mediastinal mass which is compressing and nearly occluding the superior vena cava.
The most likely causes are a primary thymic tumor such as thymic carcinoma or lymphoma.
Associated pericardial and left pleural effusions.
No additional masses or adenopathy identified.
Due to suboptima technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic  regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small, anterior pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a prominent left pleural effusion.
LIVER ULTRASOUND:  The liver is normal in size and without focal lesions.
The gallbladder is unremarkable without wall thickening or stones.
There is no pericholecystic fluids.
While the common bile duct is not visualized as the patient was unable to roll on to her sides, there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
IMPRESSION:  Common bile duct could not be visualized, however no evidence for intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No liver lesions.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DVT STUDY:  Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
There is normal flow, compressibility, and augmentation of these vessels.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 76215**] is a 46 year old lady who was admitted with progressive dyspnea.
Her work-up revealed a 13x8cm mass in mediastinum with pericardial infiltration, SVD compression and bilateral pleural effusion.
Pathology established the diagnosis of primary mediastinal B-Cell lymphoma.
Pan-CT studies and bone marrow biopsy did not show any evidence for other organ/marrow involvement.
Furthermore, the patient was diagnosed with a left subclavian thrombosis and was started on a heparin drip.
Initially it was thought that the patient also had lower extremity deep vein thromboses but multiple subsequent ultrasound studies of the legs did not show any clots.
A CT-angiogram on day of admission was negative for pulmonary emboli.
After establishing the diagnosis of lymphoma we started therapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristin, doxorubicin, prednisone, Day 1= [**2175-8-31**]).
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 105351**] developed some tachycardia and O2-desaturation to 88% after the rate of rituxan was increased to 150mg/h, but after reducing the rate to 100mg/ml and supportive therapy she improved rapidly and received the whole dose of rituxan (375mg/m2).
Serologies for hepatitis as well as an ultrasound of the liver were negative.
Furthermore, the liver function tests improved with treatment, so the initial elevation was attributed to compression of the superior vena cava and congestion of the liver.
Upon therapy, left pleural effusions as well as left atelectasis improved on chest Xray.
Two days before discharge the patient complained of pain in her left gluteal region.
Since she had a left femoral line placed, we performed repeated ultrasound of her legs to rule out deep vein thrombosis.
Since the site of the pain also was different from the site of her bone marrow biopsy and the patient had no redness of the skin, we attributed the pain to effects of prolonged bedrest and uncomfortable position due to the femoral line.
At discharge the patient was able to walk and pain was controlled with oxycodon.
Disp:*30 * Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Primary mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma 2) Hypercholesterolemia 3) Psoriais 4) Endometriosis   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, has some pain in left leg when walking.
Please call the BMT doctor on call or go to the emergency department in case of fevers>101.0, new bleeding, worsening pain, or new onset of symptoms like diarrhea, urinary burning or worsening shortness of breath.
