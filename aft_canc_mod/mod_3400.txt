Admission Date:  [**2111-7-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-4-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Intracranial Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**7-22**]: Left Craniotomy for resection of intracranial mass   Social History: He is divorced with 2 children.
Heterogeneously hyperintense mass, 2.9 x 4.5 cm with surrounding vasogenic edema, in the left frontal lobe, with effacement and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle is redemonstrated for surgical planning.
Mild shift of the midline structures to the right side by few millimeters is noted.
No other abnormal areas of enhancement are noted in the visualized brain parenchyma.
There is pneumocephalus and marked persistent vasogenic edema.
There are tiny areas of focal high density at the periphery of the surgical bed, which likely represent tiny foci of hemorrhage.
There is an extraaxial fluid collection underlying the craniotomy site.
There are T1 hyperintense blood products in the operative bed, which limit evaluation for residual neoplasm.
There does appear to be a small focus of enhancement along the inferior aspect of the resected mass.
This could represent a small amount of residual neoplasm and recommend attention on short-term followup imaging after resolution of blood products.
No new foci of hemorrhage are seen.
There is mild amount of subfalcine herniation to the right which is unchanged compared to the preoperative imaging.
There is slightly increased edema in the left parasagittal frontal lobe, which may be postoperative in nature.
On the diffusion-weighted images, there is a small focus of slow diffusion along the medial aspect of the operative bed, which is likely secondary to hemorrhage.
