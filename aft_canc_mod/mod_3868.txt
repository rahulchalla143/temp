She states that her anginal chest pain has become worse over the past several months.
In the past week, she has anginal CP roughly twice per week, associated with SOB, relieved by SL NTG with attacks occuring usually with light walking around the house, though sometimes at rest.
On friday, she had three episodes of CP in a several hour period.
She was seated after recently eating a tuna [**Location (un) 6002**] had dull pain across the chest associated with fatigue and SOB.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: Petechia RLE, no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Echo [**2106-6-17**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokiesis of the interventricular septum.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small posterolateralpericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient revealed three vessel CAD.
The LAD had a 90% lesion distal to the two previously placed stents.
Limited hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension with pressures of 191/64 with HR 60 in sinus.
The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
Systemic hypertension 3.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 89F CAD c 3vd s/p stenting, mesenteric ischemia, EF 30%, ppm for sss, thrombocytosis p/w worsening angina for elective cath .
She now presented with worsening of stable anginal symptoms for elective catheterization.
The patient required CCU transfer after the catherization after developing SOB during the catheterization requiring NRB mask.
The SOB was suspected due to a combination of volume overload and dye reaction given her known history of shellfish allergy.
CXR showed CHF and she was diuresed and her volume status and creatinine improved to her baseline.
Her symptoms of chest pain remained inactive during the hospital stay.
#) Rhythm: SSS s/p pacer  #) Pump: She became volume overloaded after the catheterization as noted above and then was subsequently diuresed until she reached euvolemia.
She was continued on her beta-blocker, though the ACE was held for renal protection .
#) CRI: Cr bumped in the setting of her clinical decompensation after the catheterisation although this subsequently returned to near baseline 1.5.
Hem/Onc consultants followed along during the hospital stay and in their assessment, the platelet elevation from her previous outpatient baseline was likely due to acute illness.
She will need to follow-up with heme/onc to continue to monitor WBC and platelet counts on hydrea.
