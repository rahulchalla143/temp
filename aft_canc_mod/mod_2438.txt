She was noted to have significant ascites on exam, but otherwise unchanged.
On her lab work, she was noted to have significnant leukocytosis, no bands, and thrombocytosis.
She had a CTA torso which showed no PE, but marked ascites and worsening of her metastatic disease.
Transplant surgery evaluated the patient for purulent discharge from her biliary drain, but this was felt to be unchanged.
The patient was given vanco/zosyn for empiric coverage.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: *per Heme/Onc note Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 37-year-old, who has a long history of cholelithiasis since more than 20 years ago.
Post-partum day 3 ([**2104-11-11**]) she underwent IR drainage and pigtail catheter placement into her gallbladder with fluid consistent with carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
She was discharged on [**11-15**] with an indwelling cholecystostomy tube; however, she was  readmitted a week later due to abdominal pain.
[**2104-11-21**] Abd CT noted multiseptate lesion and progression in dilation of gallbladder.
On [**2104-11-27**] CT guided bx of the lesion showed positive malignant cells, consistent with carcinoma.
[**2104-11-25**] octreotide scan showed exophytic component of the multiseptated segment III  lesion displays very avid octreotide uptake, compatible with neuroendocrine tumor.
Discussed her case on GI tumor conference  and it was determined that she has unresectable gallbladder small cell cancer.

An abdominal paracentesis was planned but not performed because of the patient's inability to remain motionless and comfortable during the procedure.
# Hyponatremia:  The patient's hyponatremia was thought to be hypovolemic hyponatremia.
# Anemia:  The patient was found to have a microcytic anemia, likely secondary to anemia of chronic inflammation.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has metastatic cancer and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Clinically, she has significant ascites and undergoes frequent paracentesis.
Her cause of death is unclear but likely related to her metastatic cancer.
