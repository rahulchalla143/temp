Admission Date:  [**2165-4-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-5-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-9-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ONCOLOGY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old African-American male with stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer and asthma who was requiring 2 liters of oxygen at home for the past year but started complaining of dyspnea and increased oxygen requirement of 4 liters.
The chest pain does not radiate and is not associated with any other symptoms.
He has noted some productive cough with clear phlegm for the past year.
He has also noted some diarrhea for the past week without any evidence of blood.
His shortness of breath is better with standing but worse with activity like walking.
He denied any fevers, chills, sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, dysuria, or TB exposure.
Chest x-ray done showed a left pneumothorax so a chest tube was placed by the Emergency Department.
Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2150**] with bilateral disease without extrathoracic disease, status post carboplatin and Navelbine times five cycles which led to seizure-like activity, status post IREFFA chemotherapy times two months, status post Taxotere treatment beginning on [**2164-11-15**] times five cycles.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No evidence of lung cancer.
Normal S1, S2, no murmurs or thrills heard.
Chest:  Decreased breath sounds, increased tympany on the left side.
Extremities:  There was +2 pitting edema in the lower extremities bilaterally.
Chest x-ray revealed a large left pneumothorax and minimal right tracheal shift.
After chest x-ray showed that the pneumothorax had mostly reexpanded with leaving only a small left apical pneumothorax, his chest tube was put off of suction and put on water-seal.
Unfortunately, there was a continued leak in the chest tube.
However, on [**2165-4-30**], the patient had increased oxygen requirement to 6 liters oxygen nasal cannula from 95% on 2 liters and his chest tube fell out.
A CT of the chest on [**2165-4-30**] showed no evidence of pulmonary edema, increase in size of left upper lobe mass, moderate right pleural effusion with compression, atelectasis of the right base.
Chest x-ray also showed increase in left lower lobe and lingular infiltrate with a question of pneumonia.
In the ICU, the patient was also ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Unfortunately, on the night of [**2165-5-1**], the patient began to have desaturation in his oxygenation so he was transferred back to the ICU where possible etiology of pulmonary embolism was ruled out with a negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound study.
It was believed that mucous plugging caused his desaturation.
The patient was then transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] with a chest tube that was still having an air leak.
He will finish up his one week levofloxacin for pneumonia and Cardiothoracic Surgery is continuing to follow for the pneumothorax.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient started having change in mental status in the evening likely due to sundowning.
Change in mental status secondary to sundowning.
