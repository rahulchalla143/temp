Admission Date:  [**2113-2-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-2-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2047-8-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old woman with recently-diagnosed metastatic colon cancer, admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2113-2-10**].
The patient described vague prodromal symptoms of "flu-like symptoms" for two to three weeks, which included weakness, lethargy, occasional watery diarrhea, no melena.
In the Emergency Department, she was noted to have an elevated white blood count of 48, with a right upper quadrant ultrasound suggesting liver metastases.
Abdominal CT scan confirmed liver metastases with a right colonic mass.
At that time, she had elevated transaminases and elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated bilirubin.
Her urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection, and she was started on a course of Levaquin.
Her stool was subsequently found to be positive for C. difficile, and she was started on a course of Flagyl.
With failure of her diarrheal symptoms to resolve and a persistently elevated white blood count, the patient was also treated with oral vancomycin per the Infectious Disease Department's recommendations.
On [**2113-2-6**], the patient underwent a colonoscopy which revealed a mass in the distal ascending colon and diverticulosis of the descending colon/proximal sigmoid colon.
Cytology was positive for poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Her peripheral blood smear was thought to be consistent with a reactive leukocytosis.
On [**2113-2-6**], the patient developed bloody stool.
On [**2113-2-8**], the patient had persistent bright red blood per rectum with decreased blood pressure to the 90s systolic.
The Gastroenterology service was reconsulted regarding the gastrointestinal bleed, and they felt that the bright red blood per rectum was likely secondary to a bleeding colonic mass vs. bleeding diverticula.
The patient got 5 mg of intravenous vancomycin x 2 for an elevated INR.
Surgery was consulted regarding question of acute abdomen and possible infarcted bowel.
They felt that, given the patient's absence of abdominal pain and nontender abdomen, that no surgery was indicated.
From [**2-10**] to [**2-11**], the patient began to complain of increased shortness of breath.
Her lungs remained clear, and her respiratory rate was noted to be increased secondary to compensation for her worsening lactic metabolic acidosis.
A PICC line was placed that day, complicated by two seven-beat runs of ventricular tachycardia secondary to instrumentation of the atrium or ventricle.
For low blood pressure, the patient was bolused with normal saline 500 cc x 2 that afternoon.
Later that evening, the patient complained of increased shortness of breath when lying flat.
While in the CT scanner, she complained of increased respiratory distress and was ultimately intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds, normal S1, S2, no appreciable murmurs.
Abdomen:  Obese, distended, with difficult to assess tenderness secondary to sedation, with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Chest x-ray showed no acute process.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed evidence of an umbilical hernia, but no evidence of free air, obstruction, or abdominal perforation, no evidence of biliary dilatation or cholangitis.
Stool cultures were positive for C. difficile on [**2113-2-6**].
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented hypotensive, in hypovolemic vs. septic shock.
Over the course of her hospitalization, the patient became increasingly pressor-dependent.
Dobutamine was later added for inotropic support, and vasopressin for additional blood pressure support.
The patient became increasingly hypotensive, with no evidence of intra-abdominal bleed.
Although CT scan had initially been negative for abdominal perforation or free air, the patient's belly became increasingly distended, and it was thought that she most likely developed sepsis and acidosis from intra-abdominal perforation.
She ultimately coded, developing a rhythm consistent with complete heart block, and was flat lined.
Pulmonary:  The patient presented with respiratory failure, initially thought secondary to inability to compensate for her worsening metabolic acidosis from lactate accumulation.
The patient's pH remained low secondary to her metabolic process.
Renal:  The patient presented in acute renal failure and eventually became anuric in the setting of her sepsis.
She had a worsening lactic acidosis, which was thought secondary to ischemic bowel vs. liver failure vs. generalized hypoperfusion and a low-flow state with acute liver and renal failure.
She had been treated earlier in the admission for a urinary tract infection with a six day course of Levaquin.
Urine cultures just prior to her death were positive for enterococcus.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was found to have a large colonic mass with metastases to the liver.
The patient also had developed a gastrointestinal bleed while on the Medical floor following colonoscopy, thought secondary to bleeding colonic mass.
Her hematocrit remained stable, without any recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She was also treated while on the floor for C. difficile colitis with Flagyl and later with oral vancomycin.
The patient had gradually worsening liver function tests, consistent with a cholestatic picture.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound and CT scan showed no evidence of ductal obstruction or abscess.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible abdominal vs. biliary process with ampicillin, gentamicin and Flagyl.
Hematology:  The patient was noted to be having microcytic anemia, likely secondary to iron deficiency secondary to chronic gastrointestinal bleed from her colonic mass.
Her persistently elevated white blood count was attributed to her C. difficile colitis vs. leukemoid reaction vs. sepsis.
She had an elevated INR, reflecting liver failure-induced coagulopathy.
Peripheral vasodilation unable to support, and we were unable to support her blood pressure with fluids or pressors.
There had been active communication between the Medical Intensive Care Unit team and the patient's brother, who became her spokesperson.
