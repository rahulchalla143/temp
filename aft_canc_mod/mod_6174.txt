[**2157-4-5**] Colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyp in the proximal ascending colon Polyp in the sigmoid colon (15cm) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 year-old female with a history of diverticulitis who presents with lower GI bleed.
#GI Bleed, lower, with acute anemia from blood loss: History notable BRBPR, no abdominal pain, and negative NGL.
Given the presence of diverticulosis on colonoscopy, although without active bleeding visualized, this was most likely a diverticular lower GI bleed.
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU, but she remained hemodynamically stable and no further bleeding was noted, and so she was transferred to the floor where she remained stable.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.7 on admission, improved to 1.2 with hydration.
The patient had pre-renal acute renal failure due to dehydration and hypovolemia in the setting of GI bleeding.
She also has chronic kidney disease due to DM and HTN, with baseline [**Last Name (STitle) **] 1.2-1.6 according to her PCP.
# H/o coronary artery disease: Patient with history of CAD s/p 3 stents placed ~4 yrs ago.
3 sets of cardiac markers were negative in the setting of nonspecific TWIs on EKG.
# Bipolar d/o: Continued outpatient wellbutrin and lamictal.
# HTN: Norvasc and lisinoril were held initially in the setting of GI bleed.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: gastrointestinal bleeding, diverticulosis Secondary Diagnosis: diabetes type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with a GI bleed.
You likely had bleeding from diverticulosis, but this resolved on its own.
You also were found to have polyps, which were not removed because you were recently on plavix.
If you have recurrent rectal bleeding, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
