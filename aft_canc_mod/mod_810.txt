Admission Date:  [**2137-6-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-10-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: fever and chills with headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonscopy Transjugular liver biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple myeloma nonsecretory type with free light chain disease, kappa predominating, who came to ED because of fever, chills.
He also had diarrhea in the hospital, which was C diff negative.
He recently has been noted for a positive EBV viral load and BK virus in the urine.
He has been having intermittent fever, chills over several weeks and has been followed by oncology as outpatient for those problem.
[**Name (NI) **] recently has been noted for a positive EBV viral load and BK virus in the urine.
Given his increased EBV viral load, he was started on Valcyte 50 mg twice per day.
Last night, he developed fever up to 101.6F.
Diagnosed in [**10/2129**] with non-secretory multiple myeloma with vertebral collapse and rod placement.
Bone marrow biopsy showed ~ 40% plasma cells and the presence of a hypogammaglobulinemia.
He was also found to be mildly anemic with hematocrit of between 35 and 40.
Received intermittent doses of Cytoxan followed by high-dose Cytoxan on [**2131-7-4**] with stem cell mobilization and collection and status post high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant in 10/[**2130**].
Increasing back pain during this time but noted for new herniated disc and underwent surgery in 09/[**2133**].
Begin Revlimid with dexamethasone but developed a rash at higher doses of 25 mg daily, then restarted a three-week cycle with increasing doses as of [**2135-9-8**].
Second Cycle on [**2136-11-9**], Day 11 Velcade held due to low counts.
Third cycle on [**2136-12-4**] with Day 11 Velcade held due to low counts.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy from [**2136-12-24**]: Normocellular erythroid dominant marrow with persistent involvement by patient's known plasma cell myeloma.
The plasma cells comprise 7% of aspirate differential and 10-15% of the bone marrow core biopsy by CD138 immunohistochemical staining and are kappa restricted.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy from [**2137-3-18**] shows a normocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with trilineage ematopoiesis with persistent involvement by known plasma cell myeloma.
Plasma cell distribution is variable on the aspirate smear ranging from 10% to focally as high as 30%), with cytologically typical forms.
By immunohistochemistry, CD138 positive plasma cells ccount for 20-30% of marrow cellularity, and are kappa restricted by kappa and lambda light chain staining.
Multiple myeloma as outlined above 2.
Question seizure history dating back to [**2126**] with 2 syncopal episodes.
However most consistent with vaso vagal reaction.
He was thoroughly evaluated and there was no evidence for seizures on EEG.
His Neurontin was tapered to 100 mg three times per day with no evidence for any seizure activity.
H/O DVT in the setting of initial spinal surgery.
Family History: No clear history of lymphoma, leukemia, or myeloma in the family.
Vague history of cancer on father's side Mother: COPD  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99 HR 99, BP 128/80 RR 20 98%RA Gen: well nourished comfortable man in NAD HEENT: anicteric eyes, OP clear with no lesions, no cervical or axillary [**Doctor First Name **] Chest: CTA b/l Heart: RRR no m/r/g Abdomen: soft, NT, ND +BS Extr:no edema 2+DPs Skin: no lesions Neuro: A+Ox3 CNs intact.
Involvement by lambda-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia, [**Last Name (un) **] immunoreactive, worrisome for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (Note:  Immunohistochemical stains show increased CD138-immunoreactive plasma cells, singly and in small clusters, occupying 10-15% of marrow cellularity.
Of note, the patient's prior marrows showed kappa restricted plasma cells.
The differential diagnosis includes post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder versus recurrence of his myeloma with the phenomenon of isotype switch.Given the increased numbers of [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Virus encoded RNA ([**Last Name (un) **]) positive cells in this patients marrow, the former is favored.
Additionally, scattered histiocytes with ingested hematopoietic precursors are also seen (hemophagocytic histiocytes).
Hypercellular bone marrow for age with dyserythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old gentleman with a history of multiple myeloma nonsecretory type with free light chain disease, kappa predominating who is s/p a matched unrelated double cord blood nonmyeloablative transplant with conditioning regimen of ATG, Fludarabine, Melphalan, and methylprednisolone.
Peripheral smear was notable for blasts and plasma cells, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed involvement by lambda-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia, [**Last Name (un) **] immunoreactive, worrisome for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and hypercellular bone marrow.
- Hct decreased during admission and was difficult to maintain with transfusions.
The anemia was thought to be due to low grade bleeding from thrombocytopenia, melena that pt experienced later during the admission, and some hemolysis.
There is a possibility that the anemia and thrombocytopenia are due to PTLD / hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
GvHD remained a possibility, but was unlikely given colonoscopy results.
It was felt to be at least in part due to pt's low platelets and liver dysfunction leading to bleeding diathesis.
Tube feeds were begun for nutritional support, but stopped as pt began to have frankly melanotic stools.
Pt's hematocrit trended down as the frequency of melanotic stools increased.
Pt was admitted in renal failure which responded to fluids.
Pt became anasarcic, anuric and required intermittent hemodialysis for fluid removal.
However, with intermitten hemodialysis pt could not tolerate the abrupt shifts of fluid and electrolytes and became very tachycardic (HR 130-170s) and hypertensive, often reaching into the 180s and 190s systolic.
Acute Hepatitis: Biopsy showed diffuse involvement by large B cells consistent with PTLD.
Pt showed signs of low-grade bleeding.
Increasing O2 demand and respiratory failure: Pt had increasing O2 demand in the context of bilateral infiltrates on CT and diffuse infiltrates.
Bronchoscopy showed lambda restricted B cells believed to be consistent with pulmonary involvement by PTLD.
The situation is complicated by ARF and fluid overload.
Pt was placed on intermittent hemodialysis, then on CVVH for fluid removal.
Pt had lactic acidosis and compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
Pt improved from respiratory perspective enough to be placed on Pressure support however was not extubated due to concerns for what to do should re-intubation be necessary.
Admitted with very high titers of BK in the urine with severe urinary urgency.
The urinary urgency was treated only barely effectively with oxybutinin.
