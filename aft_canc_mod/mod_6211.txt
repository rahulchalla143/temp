Admission Date:  [**2197-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-8-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-5-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Morphine / Augmentin / lisinopril / Aldactone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Hyperglycemia after starting dexamethasone  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-8-4**]: LEFT FRONTAL CRANIOTOMY FOR MENIGIOMA RESECTION   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 60843**] is a 76 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI in [**2188**] (subsequent normal cath in [**2193**]), CVA w/o residual defecits, sCHF, DMII, OSA (nonadherant with bipap), who is admitted for preoperative hyperglycemia management prior to meningioma removal scheduled for [**2197-8-4**].
Per the patient and patient's family, he was in his usual state of health until this spring when he and his family noticed headaches and generalized cognitive decline.
He began forgetting dates and mixing up his medications.
He then went to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2197-6-15**] where an MRI revealed a large frontal meningioma.
He then established care here with neurooncology who noted RLE edema and obtained an U/S which revealed a DVT.
He was started on dexamethasone and Keppra for his meningioma but he has developed hyperglycemia as a result.
Also denies focal weakness, visual problems.
CAD s/p MI in [**2188**].
Diabetes 5.
Hypertension 6.
Dyslipidemia 7.
Bilateral LE blood clots 10.
[**Name (NI) **] is a retired sheet metal worker, and had asbestos exposure in the shipyard.
NECK: Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits.
Bibasilar crackles.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
1+ edema on RLE.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
NEURO: Awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-11**] throughout UE/LE flexion/extension with subtle RLE weakness on knee flexion and extension, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait but with limp favoring right and + rhomberg sign.
A moderate amount of pneumocephalus is noted in the left frontal region.
Trace amount of dense material is seen layering in the resection cavity, compatible with subarachnoid blood.
The sulci of the left frontal lobe are mildly effaced as is the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Subtle left-to-right shift of midline structures is seen, with the maximum displacement measuring 3 mm in the transverse plane (2; 15).
Otherwise, there is no large subdural collection, hydrocephalus, or intraventricular hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Immediately status post resection of left frontovertex extra-axial mass, with moderate post-procedural pneumocephalus and trace subarachnoid blood at the operative bed; mild effacement of sulci and the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], with 3 mm rightward shift of midline structures, is unchanged from the pre-operative studies.
[**2197-8-5**] MRI  FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy, with post-surgical changes in the left frontal region as well as the adjacent parenchyma of the left frontal lobe.
There is moderate surrounding FLAIR hyperintense signal that is not significantly changed from the preop study.
Areas of increased signal intensity are noted on the DWI sequence in the periphery of the resection cavity with decreased signal on the ADC sequence, which may relate to blood products/areas of ischemia or infarction in the adjacent tissue.
No areas of abnormal enhancement are noted elsewhere in the brain.
Small fluid collection is noted in the left subdural space, in the frontal region.
There is also soft tissue swelling with fluid collection in the soft tissues overlying the left frontal and the parietal bones (series 6, image 21) along with blood products.
Mild enhancement of the overlying dura in the left side.
Multiple FLAIR hyperintense foci are also noted in the cerebral white matter, likely related to small vessel ischemic changes.
There is mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, with mild rightward shift of the midline structures and subfalcine herniation measuring approximately 5 mm.
The major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted, with a diminutive distal vertebral and Basilar artery with a fetal PCA pattern.
There is increased signal intensity in the mastoid air cells on both sides and in the petrous apices from fluid/mucosal thickening.
Surgical changes in the left frontal region and in the left frontal lobe parenchyma with presence of blood products as described above.
Interval development of an area of decreased diffusion surrounding the blood products, which may relate to infarction/ischemic changes in the parenchyma.
Assessment for infarction is limited given the presence of blood products adjacent.
While there is no significant abnormal enhancement to suggest an obvious residual tumor, followup evaluation can be considered to assess residual tumor, after resolution of the post-surgical changes.
Mucosal thickening/fluid, in the mastoid air cells on both sides and in the petrous apices.
Persistent mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and mild rightward shift of midline structures not significantly changed.
Brief Hospital Course: 76M with CAD s/p MI, chronic diastolic CHF (EF 50%), T2DM, h/o CVA and recently diagnosed DVT who was admitted for pre-operative glycemic control in the setting of dexamethasone.
#Meningioma - Patient noted having gait instability and difficulty with his memory, was diagnosed with a left frontal meningioma by MRI at an OSH.
Was started on dexamethasone and Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
This was done without complication.
By the day of surgery, his sugars remained elevated but were improved from prior to admission.
His sliding scale insulin and Morning Lantus doses were adjusted and weaned [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] consult in the setting of steroid taper.
#CAD s/p MI - Had cardiac cath in [**2193**] which did not show any significant lesions.
There were no clinical signs of volume overload, was given gentle fluids on the day of surgery while he was NPO.
Pain was well controlled, tolerating a PO diet, voiding without difficulty and ambulating independently.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Meningioma s/p resection Hyperglycemia  Secondary diagnoses: CAD Diastolic CHF OSA  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-16**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
