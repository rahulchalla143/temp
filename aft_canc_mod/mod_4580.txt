Admission Date:  [**2181-4-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-4-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7015**] Chief Complaint:  S/P Fall   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with a past medical history of CAD s/p CABG, hypertension, recent diagnosis of dementia, multiple recent falls at home presenting from OSH s/p fall at home.
He apparently fell out of bed at 5 am, and a home health aid noticed abrasions on his head this morning, and thus took him to the ED.
In the OSH ED, he had a CT scan showing a SDH without mass effect.
Repeat CT Scan confirmed SDH without mass effect, CT C spine was negative.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and recommended repeat CT scan in the AM, control of SBP < 160, along with frequent neuro checks overnight.

On Discharge: Vitals: 98.3  149/82  92  20  97%RA General: Alert, oriented x 1 (to person), no acute distress HEENT: Large scab over the right forehead, Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, surgical lens in the left eye Neck: No LAD, no elevated JVP, large right lobe of the thyroid visualized and soft at the base of his neck.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular, normal S1 + S2, III/VI blowing crescendo/decrescendo murmur with mid peak heard best at the Left and right upper sternal border.
Abdomen: firm, non-tender, distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Neuro: A+O X 1, does not know president, cannot say months forwards or backwards, CN II-XII grossly intact (left eye surgical pupil) Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ radial pulses, 1+ PT and DP pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2181-4-25**] 07:10PM BLOOD WBC-4.8 RBC-4.12* Hgb-12.3* Hct-34.9* MCV-85 MCH-29.7 MCHC-35.1* RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-124* [**2181-4-25**] 07:10PM BLOOD PT-12.8 PTT-26.7 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2181-4-25**] 07:10PM BLOOD Glucose-127* UreaN-20 Creat-0.8 Na-139 K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-27 AnGap-11 [**2181-4-25**] 07:10PM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-3.8 Mg-2.0 .
Left parafalcine subdural hematoma, stable.
Right tentorial hyperdense extraaxial mass which most likely represents a meningioma.
CT Scan C spine: Degenerative changes and demineralization without evidence for acute fracture or malalignment.
No significant mass effect.
Unchanged right tentorial extra-axial mass lesion arising from the right tentorium, consistent with a meningioma 3.
EKG: Sinus bradycardia with A-V conduction delay.
Left atrial abnormality.
Low lateral precordial lead QRS and T wave voltages are non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Subdural Hematoma: Currently no major focal neurologic findings, stable on CT scan.
Patient is on full dose aspirin at home, likely increasing risk with trauma.
Overnight, neuro checks were WNL with no focal findings.
I spoke with neurosurgery and they recommended MRI in the outpatient setting to evaluate meningioma and follow up in clinic within 1 month.
Possible Meningioma on Head CT: Neurosurgery recommended MRI with and without contrast for further classification.
Patient was monitored on tele, which showed no events overnight.
He is also legally blind, which could be contributing to his unsteadiness and falls.
# Dementia: At baseline.
As per family, there were no changes in mental status as related to his fall and intracranial hemmorhage.
No evidence of acute ischemia currently.
# Code: DNR/DNI .

Secondary Diagnosis: - CAD s/p CABG - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Prostate Cancer   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
