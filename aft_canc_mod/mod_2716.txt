Admission Date:  [**2117-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-9-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-8-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Right sided clumsiness and heaviness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 61229**] is a 50 yo RH M with a h/o melanoma with known mets to spine (s/p neck surgery 9 mos ago) enrolled in an experimental chemotherapy protocol, who presented to OSH last night with weakness (R > L) and clumsiness.
Mr [**Known lastname 61229**] reports no changes in his health prior to the onset of weakness last night, denying HA, NVD, visual changes, hearing changes, vertigo, falls, trauma, difficulties with memory, speech, or language comprehension or production.
Per the pt's family, the pt has moderate clumsiness of his left hand at baseline, thought to be related to spinal metastases of his melanoma and the surgeries performed on his spine.
Per the pt and his family, he does not have the R sided weakness with which he presented at his baseline.
In [**2-/2113**], he underwent biopsy of a right clavicular lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing a 0.45 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level III melanoma.
In [**6-/2114**], he had biopsy of a left mandible skin lesion revealing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10834**] level III, 0.51 mm thick melanoma with three mitoses per mm2.
On [**2114-7-23**], he underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] with no residual melanoma at the primary site, but one of three lymph nodes showed a microscopic deposit of melanoma.
He underwent modified left neck dissection on [**2114-7-30**] with no melanoma noted in seven additional nodes.
In [**2115-6-4**], he underwent biopsy of a new right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing metastatic melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component and two mitoses per mm2.
It was unclear whether this represented an in-tranist metastasis from his right clavicle melanoma or an epidermatrophic metastasis.
There was no evidence of residual melanoma in the chest or in the sentinel lymph node.
Torso CT in [**9-11**] revealed new small bilateral pulmonary nodules and an abnormal right kidney.
Therapy was held on C1W4, [**1-12**], due to visual problems, fatigue and anorexia.

There is a large area of hyperacute and acute intra-axial hematoma identified in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Small fluid level identified within the ventricle indicating intraventricular extension.
There is no midline shift.
No definite area of acute infarct identified.
Restricted diffusion visualized within the hematoma secondary to blood products.
Following gadolinium, there is no distinct enhancement identified within the region of hematoma in its lower portion, but there is subtle nodular enhancement seen in the superior portion, series 28, image 21.
Additionally, there is a 5-mm focus of enhancement identified in the left frontal lobe anterior to the hematoma.
No other foci of abnormal brain enhancement identified.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Note is made of a T1 hyperintense fluid within the pneumatized bilateral petrous apex air cells.
Large intra-axial hematoma in the left parietal lobe with blood products suggestive of hyperacute/acute hematoma.
The hematoma measures approximately 6 x 4 cm.
Surrounding edema and mass effect is seen.
Small nodular enhancement at the superior aspect of the hematoma and an additional 5-mm focus anterior to the hematoma in the left frontal lobe are suggestive of underlying metastatic disease.
MRA HEAD:  Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation without stenosis, occlusion, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
T1 hyperintense area adjacent to the carotid arteries on the source images are secondary to pneumatized petrous apex air cells with high protein content and T1 pre-gadolinium hyperintensities.
There is a 6-mm protuberance seen in the left subclavian artery proximal to the origin of left vertebral artery, which likely due to a small aneurysm.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of carotid stenosis or occlusion on neck MRA.
7-mm protuberance in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery origin could be a subclavian artery diverticulum or aneurysm.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: A 6.2 x 3.7 cm left parietal hemorrhage with peripheral zone of edema appears similar in configuration as compared to [**2117-8-27**].
There is extension of blood products into the left atrium and bilateral occipital horns, new since prior CT.
There is no significant increase in the extent of sulcal effacement as compared to before.
There is no new focus of hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of left parietal hemorrhage with mild peripheral zone of edema, without increased mass effect as compared to [**2117-8-27**].
No new focus of hemorrhage.
