His wife called his oncologist today with complaints of n/v and inability to tolerate POs and GTube feeds.
There has been no change in his n/v, but notes that he is not receiving much of his tube feeds.
The main reason he presented was for the acute onset of left sided pleuritic chest pain yesterday.
He is unsure if it is exertional, but he denies radiation and reports it is unlike cardiac chest pain he has had in the past.
No temperature has been taken since his discharge.
He has chronic copious secretions related to his SCC and XRT and over 1 month of dysuria, but he denies diarrhea or focal skin infections.
CTA showed multiple subsegemental PE and large LLL PE and an opacity in the RLL and LLL possibly infarct vs pna.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with difficulty swallowing pills for alopecia in late [**Month (only) 216**], then developed throat irritation, which was felt like "sticks" in his throat.
He was evaluated by his primary care doctor who noted that his left tonsil was inflamed and he was treated with amoxicillin, then Cipro, and then acyclovir with gradual improvement.
Although the inflammation of his tonsil had resolved, he still noted a similar throat discomfort.
This prompted a CT scan of his neck, which was performed on [**9-13**] and this showed a 2.4 x 2.4 x 1.6 cm right base of tongue enhancing mass as well as a 4.5 x 3.3 x 2.5 cm left thyroid mass.
He then underwent an FNA of his thyroid with cytology being nondiagnostic and this was again repeated under ultrasound guidance on [**10-2**] and the results from cytology were suboptimal cellularity, but features suggestive of a microfollicular lesion.
He also underwent an endoscopy under anesthesia performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] on [**9-22**] at which time a biopsy of the right base of tongue mass showed squamous cell carcinoma with foci highly suspicious for invasion.
The PET scan was performed on [**10-3**] and shows roughly 1.7 x 1.2 cm mass in the right base of tongue with increased FDG avidity with an SUV max of 11.
There was also a cyst asymmetrically increased FDG avidity involving the left greater than right of palatine tonsil.
There were several left-sided station to lymph nodes that were subcentimeter in size.
The large left-sided thyroid nodule, which is measured at 2.8 x 2.3 mm, did not demonstrate any increased FDG avidity.
Squamous cell carcinoma as noted above.
Coronary artery disease status post an MI with two stents placed several years ago.
He had an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but has essentially maintained a regular rhythm and is not on any anticoagulation.
Past Surgical History: 1. s/p ORIF R leg fracture 2. s/p L knee menisal repair 3. s/p L partial testical resection for benign tumor 4. s/p L4-L5 disc operation x 2  Social History: Social History (confirmed with patient): The patient is married and lives with his wife.
He has had an inhalation exposure to PVC and glue in the early 80s, which led to acute irritation of his upper airway esophagus and stomach.
His father died at age 66 from complications of coronary artery disease.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck with skin changes c/w xrt, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: mild diffuse rhonchi, > LLL.

A lateral view of the chest may be helpful for further characterization.
There is also a larger lobar pulmonary embolus in the left lower lobar pulmonary artery.
Scattered ground-glass nodular consolidations throughout the basilar part of the left lower lobe, most likely associated with abnormal perfusion given the presence of a large essentially occlusive pulmonary embolism serving this area.
Less likely considerations are an additional inflammatory or infectious process.
Chest CT surveillance is suggest in three months to show resolution, particularly given the history of malignancy.
Small hypodense renal lesions, probably cysts, but not entirely characterized.
KUB: There is a G-tube balloon projecting over the left upper abdomen.
The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific with air and stool seen throughout colon.
No dilated loops of small bowel is identified.
There are some degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process identified.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo male with SCC of the tongue recently finished chemo and undergoing XRT, who presents with chronic n/v related to his G-tube and PE.
PE: Patient presented with fevers and left sided pleuritic chest pain.
However, patient developed tachycardia and tachypnea so was sent for CTA.
CTA showed bilateral PE's with large PE in LLL territory.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to ongoing tachycardia.
EKG showed no evidence of right heart strain.
Head CT was done upon arrival to ICU and did not show any intracranial process concerning for causing bleeding.
Patient was started on warfarin, as recommended by his oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], since pt likely developed PE [**1-7**] immobilization and not disseminated cancer.
N/V: Patient had been chronically having difficulty with G-tube, with N/V and reflux.
Given his gastric emptying problem, he was also recommended to start with very small volumes of PO food and slowly increase the volume of PO as he can tolerate.

Discharge Condition: Mental status: Alert and oriented Ambulatory status: Ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: The two major issues that were addressed during this hospitalization were 1) Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism and 2) Advancing your feeding tube into the jejunum.
You had nausea and vomiting likely from poor emptying from your stomach.
Decreasing METOPROLOL dose from 50mg once daily down to 25mg once daily because of having lower blood pressure.
