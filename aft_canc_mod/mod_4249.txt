Admission Date:  [**2153-10-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-10-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-1-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nasogastric tube placement PICC placement   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 84781**] is a 25 yo male with severe cerebral palsy, non-verbal at baseline who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] where he was being evaluated for Left foot swelling and incidentally found to have Hct of 20.
There was concern that his stools were melanotic.
For evaluation of his GIB, his NG lavage was negative, stool dark & guiaic positive but not obvious melena.
His abdomen was rigid on exam so general surgery was conulted and a CT of the abd/pelvis was performed which showed a large mass in the right proximal colon and possilby a partial bowel obstruction.
GI felt that surgery was not necessary urgently and requested that the patient have either a barium enema or a colonoscopy.
The mass was noted to be obstructing the ureter and causing hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
In conversation with his caregiver he had a change in behavior approximately 3 months ago when his mood seemed to become more labile.
Per [**Hospital3 4107**] ED notes, he had 2 abd CT scans there without acute change, a bone marrow bx w/o myeloproliferative findings and pan cultures were persistently negative.
He developed diarrhea 2-3 weeks ago.
He has had a significant weight loss over the past few months despite a good appetite.
He currently reports pain in his right foot and his belly.
He has had intermittent fevers for the past few weeks.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain, headache, visual changes, lightheadedness, syncope, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, shortness of breath, wheeze, chest pain or tightness, palpitations, orthopnea, PND, abdominal pain nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dark tarry stools, BRBPR, changes in bowel or bladder habits, dysuria, hematuria, increased frequency, arthralgias, myalgias or rash.
Past Medical History: # Severe Cerebral Palsy - non-verbal at baseline.
# GERD # development delay # Leukocytosis - The patient was found to have a chronic leukocytosis of unknown baseline at this time is currently being evaluated for hematologic malignancy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Surgery on R and L leg for contractures   Social History: FAMILY HISTORY: unknown  Family History: SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's 2 parents are involved in his care.
Yes = shake fist, No=will wave index & middle fingers.
HEENT: NCAT No scleral icterus.
no dullness to percussion.
rigid abdomen with contracted abdominal muscles.
no masses appreciated.
no RLE edema wwp.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2153-10-1**] L foot plain film FINDINGS: AP, lateral, oblique views of the left foot are obtained.
There is no fracture or dislocation.
Marked soft tissue swelling is seen without soft tissue gas or foreign body.
No significant degenerative changes are present.
IMPRESSION:  Soft tissue swelling, without evidence of underlying bony injury.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.
There is dilation of the distal esophagus which is filled with oral contrast.
Fecalized material is noted within what appears to be the cecum or distended terminal ileum.
There is marked abnormality within the proximal right colon, extending from the cecum to the mid-ascending colon.
Within the mid-ascending colon, there is a large mass with circumferential involvement of the ascending colon with enhancement and frond- like projections extending into the lumen.
Overall, findings are concerning for tumor in the proximal right colon, causing with proximal bowel obstruction.
There is also hydronephrosis of the right kidney with dilatation of the ureter to the level of the right colonic mass.
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear unremarkable.
The venous structures are suboptimally assessed; however, note is made of a small 12-mm filling defect within the IVC, at the level of the right renal hilum (301B:23, 2:33).
Multiple prominent mesenteric nodes are noted, measuring up to 11 mm in short axis (301B:17).
Ill-defined lesion is noted along the right paracolic gutter, inferior to the liver tip, measuring approximately 1.5 x 3.1 x 2.7 cm (2:38, 301B:25).
This lesion has apparent linear densities extending to the right colonic mass region.
While its etiology is not clear, findings are suspicious for peritoneal deposit.
Assessment for ascites is very limited due to increased density of this cachetic patient's subcutaneous and mesenteric fat.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the pelvis is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying right leg, due to contractures.
Aside from bowel findings mentioned above, no free air or adenopathy is definitely noted in the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
Findings concerning for tumor in the ascending colon with associated small bowel obstruction and obstruction of the right ureter, with right hydronephrosis.
Multiple borderline enlarged mesenteric nodes.
Indeterminate lesion along right paracolic gutter, inferior to liver tip, suspicious for peritoneal metastasis.
Small filling defect in the IVC, at the level of the right renal hilum, consistent with thrombus.
Dilated distal esophagus, filled with oral contrast.
There is normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all of the vessels.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.
[**2153-10-2**] Abdomen plain film IMPRESSION: Dilated small bowel loops consistent with small-bowel obstruction.
No free air or extraluminal contrast.
Findings concerning for a mass in the ascending colon with associated small-bowel obstruction which has slightly increased since the prior examination as described above.
No evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
Scattered ground- glass opacities in both lungs may represent infection, inflammation or sequelae of aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: Abdominal mass - Treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible ruptured appendix with periappendiceal abscess formation.
Subsequent CT scan showed progressive enlargement of the mass with worsening obstruction.
Given his poor nutritional status, and that surgery was unlikely to be curative if the mass were malignant, operative therapy was deferred.
GI bleeding signified likely colonic invasion with a poor prognosis.
Aspiration pneumonia - Treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, as above, and oxygen therapy.
IVC thrombus - Treated with heparin IV until recurrent GI bleeding led to its discontinuation.
Right hydroureteronephrosis - The consulting IR and urology teams did not recommend percutaneous nephrostomy due to a poor overall prognosis.
