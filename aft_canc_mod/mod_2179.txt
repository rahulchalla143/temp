Lung Cancer Synopsis   MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Wedge resection.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main bronchus).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Gross:  Part 1 is received fresh labeled with "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]" and the medical record number and "right upper lobe wedge" and consists of a 5.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm wedge of lung with a red and smooth pleura.
The specimen is sectioned to reveal a nodule measuring up to 1 cm with a red maroon cut surface.
A portion of the nodule is frozen, and frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is "non small cell, favor squamous process."
The pleural surface is inked black and the specimen is bread-loafed to reveal a hemorrhagic appearing lung parenchyma, without discrete lesions identified.
The bronchus resection margin is frozen and frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9885**] is: "Bronchial margin: squamous metaplasia with focal atypia.
No invasive carcinoma seen".
The specimen is represented as follows: F = frozen section remnant, G = deeper sections through bronchus, H-I = representative sections through collapsed appearing area of lung lying 4 cm from the bronchial resection margin, J = sections adjacent to the stapled area corresponding to site of prior biopsy, K = sections through normal appearing lung.
Part 5 is additionally labeled "level 4R" and consists of multiple lymph node fragments aggregating 2 x 2 x 2 cm entirely submitted in cassettes L-M.    Part 6 is additionally labeled "level 7" and consists of a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm aggregate of lymph node fragments entirely submitted in cassette N.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
The right-sided pleural effusion is improved as well.
There is no left pleural effusion.
Decrease in the right pleural effusion is also noted.
However, due to the hematocrit drop and the chest x-ray finding, it was not possible to rule out a possible intrapleural bleed.
A chest CT scan was obtained and there was a fair amount of lung collapse on that CT scan, but it was not entirely possible to distinguish between what was consolidated or collapsed lung, and what possibly was pleural effusion or hemothorax.
It was found that he did not have much clot intrapleurally and instead there was mucus plugs and atelectasis.
He failed three voiding trials but each time it seemed to be due to low urine in his bladder rather than a functional problem so on the day of discharge his bladder was infused with saline and then his foley was taken out.
