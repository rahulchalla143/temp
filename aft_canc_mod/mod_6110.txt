The patient has reportedly had 2 weeks of confusion and lethargy.
She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for altered mental status and increasing unresponsiveness within the past week.
She was found to be hypokalemic with severely depressed mental status.
She received a 1L NS bolus with return of sbp to 107.
The patient also became bradypneic with this episode.
The decision was made for no further invasive tests or imaging studies.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic breast cancer.
Initially presented in [**2119-11-14**] with a lytic lesion in the left leg and a breast mass.
Biopsy revealed infiltrating carcinoma.
Likely leptomeningeal spread on MR brain [**2120-4-30**].
- Multiple episodes of severe malignancy associated hypercalcemia and altered mental status.
- Surgery for ectopic pregnancy in [**2090**].
Family History: Half-sister with breast CA at age 63.
No distention or organomegaly.
Ext: Trace left lower extremity edema.
No right lower extremity edema.
Neuro: Unresponsive to commands or painful stimulus.
Unable to ilicit reflexes at the patella.
Micro: Blood culture ([**2120-6-24**]): No growth.
Urine culture ([**2120-6-24**]): No growth.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 77692**] is a 59 yo woman with history of metastatic breast cancer presenting with two weeks duration of confusion and icreasing lethargy.
Ms. [**Known lastname 77692**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for subacute, progressive unresponsiveness and a hypotensive episode likely due to volume depletion.
Her unresponsiveness was likely secondary to progression of her widely metastatic breast cancer, including possible leptomeningeael spread.
Also, considered was seizure activity with post-ictal state and toxic-metabolic mediated altered status in the setting of hypercalcemia and hypocalemia.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initially, the goals of care were discussed, and it was decided not to pursue further chest x-rays, MRI brain, EEG or lumbar puncture.
The MRI showed no evidence of leptomeningeal disase with stable CNS disease.
Continous EEG was obtained which showed evidence of encephalopathy.
The patient was noted electrolyte abnomalities suggestive of non anion gap metabolic acidosis which improved on IVF.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-20 mg PO q1hrs as needed for pain, discomfort, agitation, shortness of breath.
Ativan 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO q2-4hrs as needed for agitation.
