Admission Date:  [**2104-2-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-3-13**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old gentleman with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2101**], hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, history of congestive heart failure, hypercholesterolemia, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] for respiratory distress, status post intubation.
Per the outside hospital, the patient had been doing poorly over the last several days with an upper respiratory tract infection type symptoms.
The patient had also reported increased worsening orthopnea for the past few days.
On the day of admission, the patient had an acute decompensation with marked shortness of breath.
At that time, his blood pressure was 190/90 with a heart rate of 120 and a chest x-ray demonstrated florid congestive heart failure.
Hematuria was noted at that time and Heparin drip was discontinued.
On arrival from the outside hospital, the patient was without complaints and breathing more comfortably without any current chest pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2101**].
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic mesenteric ischemia.
Left cerebrovascular accident.
Distal aortic occlusion.
Blindness secondary to ischemic optic neuropathy.
Chest - crackles at the bilateral bases with expiratory rhonchi.
Cardiovascular - decreased heart sounds, S1 and S2 normal, S4 present, soft systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, diffuse bruits, positive bowel sounds.
Electrocardiogram ([**Hospital1 2025**]) showed sinus tachycardia at 110 beats per minute, primary AV block, premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions, ST depressions in V4 through V6, Q wave in V1 and V2, T wave inversions in leads I and aVL.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis, first degree AV block, Q waves in V1 and V2, T wave inversions in leads I, II, aVL, V4 through V6, ST depressions of 1.0 millimeter in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 78 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, mesenteric ischemia, diabetes mellitus who presented with acute respiratory distress.
Differential diagnoses at the time of admission included congestive heart failure, pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and pulmonary embolism, with a question of whether a viral illness could have contributed to the patient's symptoms.
Cardiovascular -  The patient was known to have a history of coronary artery disease and was continued on Aspirin and Coreg.
His cardiac enzymes remained flat and electrocardiogram without changes, and therefore it was felt that the patient did not experience an acute ischemic event that triggered his congestive heart failure and therefore his Heparin drip was discontinued.
Over the next few hospital days, the patient underwent continuous diuresis with intravenous Lasix with significant improvement in his subjective feelings of shortness of breath.
for afterload reduction in the setting of congestive heart failure.
The patient diuresed effectively over the first four hospital day with a decreasing oxygen need and was therefore slowly restarted back on his home diuretic of Demadex.
The patient had no further cardiovascular issues over the remainder of the hospital stay.
The patient's hypoxia was thought most likely secondary to his florid congestive heart failure and therefore he underwent aggressive diuresis.
However, the patient responded to this change with tachycardia, tachypnea and hypertension with a systolic blood pressure in the 200s.
However, thirty minutes following extubation, the patient demonstrated significant respiratory distress with hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
In addition, a CT scan of the chest obtained at that time also demonstrated partial collapse of the left upper lobe secondary to an obstructing [**Location (un) 21851**] as well as bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement, enlargement of both adrenal glands concerning for metastatic disease, and evidence of previous asbestos exposure with pleural plaques.
Therefore, given the combination of the patient's failure to wean off the ventilator, as well as the left upper lobe lung mass, a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed partial bronchial stenosis distally without intervention required as well as a left middle lobe and left lower lobe mass of which brushings and endobronchial biopsy were taken.
In addition, a thoracentesis was offered to the patient given the pleural effusion seen on CT scan, however, this was refused by the patient until he could discuss it further with his wife.
The patient continued to have persistent secretions which were felt to likely be contributing to the patient's failure to wean.
It was unclear exactly why the patient tolerated this wean poorly but was thought secondary to a component of segmental collapse behind the obstructing lung lesion, as well as his persistent secretions, as well as a cardiac contribution.
At this time, the patient's left upper lobe mass biopsy returned as squamous cell carcinoma and this diagnosis was discussed with the patient and family.
Given the patient's failure to wean after nearly a week of intubation, a tracheostomy was placed on [**2104-3-11**].
Renal - The patient's creatinine was followed closely given his history of chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of approximately 1.0 to 1.3.
The patient had no difficulties with urine output.
The patient was noted to have a persistent metabolic alkalosis which did not seem to vary with his hydration status and did not respond to Acetazolamide treatment.
It was therefore felt that the patient likely had a baseline with a bicarbonate of 30, possibly secondary to his known asbestos exposure and emphysema.
Infectious disease - The patient was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count as well as persistent secretions at the time of admission and therefore was started on Levofloxacin for a community acquired pneumonia.
Once the patient was found to have an endobronchial lesion, it was felt that his pneumonia was likely secondary to postobstructive lesion.
The patient's white blood cell count remained within normal limits and he remained afebrile at the time of discharge.
Gastrointestinal - The patient has a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia but had no complaints of gastrointestinal pain or discomfort during the hospital stay.
He was kept on Prevacid via his gastrostomy tube for gastrointestinal prophylaxis and had no further complaints.
The patient had no further hematological issues over the remainder of the hospital stay.
Oncology - The patient was noted to have a mass in the left upper lobe on CT scan at the time of admission.
When the patient underwent bronchoscopy secondary to failure to wean and failure at extubation, an endobronchial lesion was seen and bronchial washings and biopsy were obtained.
Pathology of the biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma and, given that the CT scan showed a mass in the bilateral adrenals, it was felt that this was likely metastatic.
A hematology/oncology consultation was obtained who suggested that given the patient's underlying poor function, he was not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy and given that the patient's family did not want to investigate the extent of the metastasis, there was no further metastatic workup performed.
Therefore, x-ray therapy was consulted who suggested that the patient's lesion was not likely significant enough to be contributing to his failure to wean and also suggested that given the duration of knowledge of the mass as well as slow growth, it was not likely to respond to palliative treatment.
Once the patient was awake and alert enough, the patient was told of the left lobe mass and of the diagnosis of squamous cell cancer.
Endocrine - The patient was known to have a history of hypothyroidism and was continued on his Synthroid supplementation.
He was noted to have an elevated TSH and therefore his Synthroid dose was increased to 150 p.o.
In addition, the patient's diabetes mellitus was controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale as well as NPH with sugar ranging between 120 and 200.
Prophylaxis - The patient was maintained on Heparin subcutaneous as well as Prevacid per his gastrostomy tube for prophylaxis during the hospital stay.
