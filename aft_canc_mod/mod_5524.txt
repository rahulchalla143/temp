Mediastinal nodal dissection.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a delightful 78-year-old gentleman with severe COPD who was noted to have a small right upper lobe nodule in [**2189**] and has been followed with serial imaging since.
At that time, a PET/CT scan showed no evidence of FDG activity within the lesion.
In addition, there has been the appearance of a new second nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, which has also grown with time.
These nodules were separated by about 3-4 cm and normal lung tissue.
A recent PET/CT scan obtained in [**2193-6-25**] demonstrated FDG uptake within both right upper lobe nodules as well as two small lymph nodes adjacent to the left parotid gland.
There is no uptake within the mediastinal lymph nodes or of elsewhere within the body of concern.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2193-7-16**], which showed no endobronchial lesions, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was nondiagnostic.
He subsequently underwent a CT-guided fine needle biopsy on [**2193-8-2**], which confirmed the presence of an adenocarcinoma consistent with bronchoalveolar type.
He is able to walk approximately three blocks without much dyspnea.
He  specifically denies chest pain, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, recent pulmonary infection, weight loss,  anorexia, or new neurological or new musculoskeletal complaints.
Past Medical History: 1. severe COPD 2. spontaneous pneumothorax in [**2184**] on the right 3. prostate cancer treated with radioactive seed in [**2189**] 4. hemorrhoidectomy 5. decreased hearing.
Family History: COPD and lung cancer in siblings.
Physical Exam: T 98.8  P 78  BP 114/58  R 20  SaO2 95% RA Heent - pupils are equal, round, and reactive, sclerae are anicteric, no supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
Heart - regular without murmur.
Skin - no rashes or skin tumors near the future operative site abdomen - benign without masses or tenderness.
Extrem - no clubbing or edema.
Lymph - no axillary or groin adenopathy.

Otherwise, the right lung volume loss, pleural thickening, and mediastinal shift remain stable.
There are now asbestos- related pleural calcifications and aortic calcification.
CONCLUSION: Minimally increased right apical pneumothorax, likely insignificant and related to projection.
Severe emphysema.
Calcified pleural plaques.
Small residual right pneumothorax.
3.1-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
Small hypodense lesions in the liver are incompletely characterized but may represent cysts or hemangiomas.
This was placed to suction with a leak present.
On post-op day 1, the patient had an episode of repiratory distress with SaO2 in the 80s on 3 liters O2 via nasal cannula.
An ecg showed no acute changes.
On post-op day 2, the patient had another episode of respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
In the ICU, the patient also developed atrial flutter.
Serial ABGs were obtained to ensure that the patient was not becoming hypoxemic or hypercarbic.
He had an episode of destauration in the ICU that reslved after bronchoscopy suctioned out a lot of thick secretions.
