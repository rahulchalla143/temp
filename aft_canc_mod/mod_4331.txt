Was noted to have a complete opacification of left lung field on CXR with minimal lung markings.
A broad differential was entertained given 20 year history of HIV and smoking history: left side lung mass and associated malignant pleural effusion, lymphoma, post-obstructive pneumonia and resulting parapneumonic effusion.
This was supported somewhat by leukocytosis and bandemia of 6%.
Chest CT on [**7-1**] showed mass (BAC) that was "head-sized", invading the left hilus, mediastinum, bronchus and PA.
The patient was treated empiraclly with volume replacement with subsequent checks in sodium and urine lytes/osms.
Resolved with volume replacement.
HIV antibodies and viral load were taken to assess disease state.
CD4 count of 7, not enough blood for viral load.
Patient was started on azithro for MAC ppx and bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
These were held intermittently when the patient seemed overly sedated.
Upon arrival, she was sedated, had a respiratory rate of 44 and coarse breath sounds.
Exam revealed nonreactive pupils, no respirations or heart sounds, no Babinski, and no response to pain.
