Endoscopists removed prior biliary stent and noted frank bleeding which appeared to emanate from tumor eroding into biiary vasculature.
As per admit notes, patient had been admitted from clinic earlier this month with fever and shaking chills.
He was noted to have obstructive jaundice and underwent ercp which demonstrated common bile duct obstruction managed with stent placement.
On discharge he did not complete his course of cipro and flagyl due to bad taste.
He has not noted any hematochezia or melena.
Metastatic melanoma--as per onc notes: "Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially diagnosed w/ melanoma when he underwent left upper lobectomy in [**2185-5-16**] for a lung nodule discovered incidentally.
PET scan showed uptake in the left neck but surgical exploration showed no evidence of melanoma, and no primary site was identified at that time.
A CT scan in [**Month (only) 216**] [**2186**] revealed a small nodule in the area of the left kidney, and resection in [**2186-11-15**] revealed a perirenal soft tissue mass consistent with melanoma.
F/U CT scan documented a soft tissue density behind the left lobe of the thyroid gland which was resected on [**11-18**].
Pathology revealed evidence of metastatic melanoma.
Follow-up torso CT scans from late [**2188-2-16**] revealed several soft tissue masses within and around the head of the pancreas, consistent with metastatic disease.
The study was discontinued on [**2188-10-30**] when the patient's CT scan showed evidence of disease progression with significant growth in the pancreatic metastases.
In [**12/2188**], he developed biliary obstruction requiring ERCP and stenting complicated by pancreatitis.
He had initial disease regression, but scans after cycle 3 showed mild disease progression evidenced by enlarging porta hepatis mass.
CAD s/p MI 3.
Prostate ca s/p radical prostatectomy 4. s/p L pulmonary lobectomy 5.
Biliary obstruction [**12-20**], stent placed, then removed [**3-/2190**], recurrent obstruction [**2190-6-30**] with placement of new stent 8. hypothyroidism  Social History: Married with no children.
He has 10 siblings, of which one brother passed away secondary to leukemia at the age of 80.

Liver span approx 3cm below costal margin with palpable mass noted.
ext: trace edema neuro: A&O x3, CNIII-XII grossly intact, no focal motor or sensory deficits.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2)RUQ ultrasound ([**7-10**]): Liver architecture is abnormal, distorted by a very large heterogeneous mass in the porta-hepatis that is consistent with known large metastases from metastatic melanoma.
No definite intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is visualized.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is no free fluid within the abdomen.
Gallbladder is not distended, but there is a small amount of layering sludge within dependent portions of the gallbladder.
There is mild gallbladder wall thickening and mild gallbladder wall edema.
There is a filling defect in the CBD extending in to the intrahepatic biliary tree.
Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with coronary disease or focal myocarditis.
No obvious vegetations identified to suggest endocarditis.
Very small pericardial effusion located posterior to the atria.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69yo male with metastatic melanoma s/p 5 cycles of Taxol and recent biliary stent placement now p/w fever and elevated bilirubin concerning for blocked biliary stent and possible cholangitis.
1)Cholangitis/bacteremia: Patient's initial symptoms of fevers, chills and elevated LFTs were thought to be due to blocked stent and possible cholangitis in the context of not completing his antibiotic regimen at home.
He underwent an ERCP the following day which was complicated by bleeding as the stent was removed.
Cultures had been growing Serratia and Coag + staph aureus.
Patient remained afebrile during the rest of the hospital stay and his LFTs slowly improved.
2)Anemia: Secondary to blood loss during ERCP.
His ASA and beta-blocker had been stopped in the setting of bleeding but was restarted at time of discharge.
4)CAD: Patient remained asymptomatic during this hospital course.
Statin was held in setting of elevated LFTs.
5)Thrombocytopenia: Patient was noted to have drop in platelet count within 1 week after being admitted to the OMED service.
