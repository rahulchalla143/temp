She was treated for CHF exacerbation with nitro gtt and diuresis, despite no known history of heart disease.
EKG at OSH notable for T-wave inversions v2-v4, II, avF which later normalized.
She was also noted to have a leukocytosis with WBC 15k and 5% bands.
Soon after this, pt reportedly requested intubation for increased work of breathing.
The conclusion of the MICU team was that her recent respiratory failure was primarily of an infectious rather than CHF etiology.
She further denies abdominal pain, diarrhea/constipation, blood in bowel movements, pain with urination, or other complaints.
COPD - no PFT testing 3.
Hypertension  Social History: Lives alone with 24hr nursing care.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67 F with a history of SCLC and previous PNA presneting with a large (complex appearing) RLL consolidation, leukocytosis w/ left shift, and respiratory distress requiring intubation, all of which suggest a significant RLL pneumonia.
#  PNEUMONIA: Large RLL consolidation, white count, and increasing O2 requirement all c/w PNA.
Not displaying septic physiology currently although UOP on admission was the lower end of normal.
On Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin, and Vancomycin for possible cavitary pneuomonia.

No obvious abnormality, besides a large mucous plug was found.
The night of [**2130-8-13**] the patient had a temperature spike of 101F.
She also underwent a thoracentesis on [**2130-8-17**] for drainage of a right sided pleural effusion that was suspicious for empyema.
Drainage showed no frank pus, likely a complicated parapneumonic effusion.
Air seen on CT prior had decreased, this was thought to be a bronchopleural fistula that has since sealed.
MS changes - patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status initially, now stable, although still has baseline dementia.
Likely intravascular depletion in the setting of third spacing from significant infection.
Iron studies sent consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.

Pneumonia is an infection of your lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or other organisms.
Because of your pneumonia, you also had a collection of fluid next to your lung.
This has improved somewhat, however we are very concerned for your continued safety once you leave the hospital because of your propensity to become confused.
Finally, while you were in the hospital, you developed a rash that was itchy and was likely due to an allergy to something that your skin touched.
If this worsens a great deal or you begin to have difficulty breathing, please contact your primary care doctor or go to the nearest emergency department.
If you begin to have trouble breathing, have chest pain or start having fevers greater than 101.4, please contact your primary care provider or go to the nearest emergency department.
