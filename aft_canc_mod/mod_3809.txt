Admission Date:  [**2131-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-10-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy w/ biopsy  History of Present Illness: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 916**] is a 62-year-old woman with a history of myelodysplasia, DVT, cellulitis, GVHD (diarrhea)presents with worsening diarrhea.
She was admitted on [**2131-1-11**] for allogenic stem cell transplant per protocol DF05-279 and her conditioning regimen consisted of photophoresis, pentostatin, and TBI.
[**Doctor First Name **] did very well in her early posttransplant period; however, just after day 100, was admitted with grade 3 GVHD of her GI tract.
Per the pt, she has [**3-4**] semi-formed, soft bowel movements per day, non-bloody, no mucus, with mild cramping prior but otherwise no abd pain.
Pt denies any change or worsening of diarrhea in the past several weeks.
Cytogenetics-->Initial bone marrow showed deletion 7 associated with a poor prognosis.
However, repeat cytogenetics performed on [**2130-12-28**] at [**Hospital1 18**] show no such deletion.
Flow--> CD34-positive blasts are estimated at 5-6% Biopsy/Aspirate-->From [**2130-12-28**]: The blast count on the aspirate is 6%, and by CD34-immunostains is 6-10%, consistent with a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1) by WHO criteria.
While the cellularity was difficult to estimate due to the aspiration artifact, the overall cellularity appears decreased, which may be consistent with an hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome.
Had sibling reduced-intensity Allogeneic Transplant [**2131-1-17**] that she tolerated well with minimal transfusion requirements.
Bone marrow on [**4-27**] showed it was mildly hypocellular.
There were minimal dysplastic changes but of uncertain significance.
Patient recently admitted to hospital (discharged on [**2131-6-10**]) with severe diarrhea from GVHD.
Diarrhea improved with increased immunosuppresents .
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Her brother has a history of hypertension and an abdominal aneurysm that is being watched; her sister has hypothyroidism and a history of vascular surgery.
She had a maternal aunt with breast cancer, and another maternal aunt with uterine cancer.

Pathology of Nasal Turbinate [**2131-9-14**]: Respiratory mucosa with mild chronic inflammation and fungal forms consistent with aspergillus (GMS stain) seen.
[**2131-9-12**]: 1) Cholelithiasis without definitive evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2) Unchanged small intra-abdominal ascites and right-sided pleural effusion.
3) No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
[**2131-9-10**]: No evidence of bowel obstruction or ileus.
Mildly increased renal echogensicity and evidence of cortical thinning suggestive of underlying medicorenal disease.

There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
An  eccentric, posterolaterally directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation  is seen.
The timing of the mitral regurgitation is late systolic.
No evidence of right-sided DVT.
A similar extent of left-sided DVT extending from the right common femoral vein to the popliteal fossa with a slight reconstitution of flow within the right superficial femoral vein.
MICRO: blood cx this admit NGTD [**2131-8-6**] wound cx: pseudomonas C diff neg x3 since [**8-20**] [**7-12**] urine w pseudomonas (cipro, tobra, gent res) and e coli   Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old female w/ allo SCT +>200 days, hx recent CMV infection and GVHD diarrhea admitted for worsening diarrhea.
Concern for cellulitis vs. necrotising fascitis.
The patient had a prior history of pseudomonal cellulitis on her left leg.
On hospital day 6 she was developed fevers to 101.8, rigors and became hypotensive to 70/40 which did not respond to fluid boluses.
Her left leg was noted to look markedly cellulitis with erythema and tendernss.
There was concern that her leg infection might represent necrotising fasciitis.
CT scan of the left leg revealed extensive muscle edema but no clear evidence of necrotising fasciitis but it was unclear what type of inflammatory response the patient would mount given her neutropenia.
Her cellulitis slowly improved with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Sepsis: On hospital day 6 the patient developed rigors, fevers to 101.8 and became hypotensive to the 70s systolic which was not responsive to fluid boluses.
At that time her leg was markedly cellulitis with erythema, warmth and tenderness.
CXR at that time showed no evidence of infiltrate.
It was felt that her sepsis was most likely secondary to her leg wound.
She required pressors for blood pressure support.
She received aggressive volume resucitation with IVF, blood and albumin.
She was weaned off pressors after the initial 24 hour period but became hypotensive for a second time and was placed back on pressors for an additional 72 hours.
She completed a 21 day course of meropenem and vancomycin for her leg wound with slow clinical improvement.
Despite further aggressive care, she later developed both aspergillosis in lungs and CMV viremia.
Renal Failure: During her MICU course the patient developed acute renal failure with her creatinine increasing from a baseline of 0.4 to a peak of 1.3.
Urine electrolytes were not consistent with a prerenal etiology and her urine output was not responsive to fluid boluses.
Her urine sediment had many granular casts.
It was felt that her renal failure was most likely secondary to ATN induced by her long period of hypotension and pressor requirement.
The patient was oliguric for approximately one week and subsequently became severely volume overloaded ultimately leading to intubation for respiratory distress.
In the last 24 hours of her life, however, she had a rapid decline related to her overwhelming sepsis and not renal function and never required HD prior to death.
Invasive Fungal Infection: The patient was noted to have aspergillus growing in her sputum on two samples.
CT of the chest did not reveal a clear fungal pneumonia.
She underwent MRI of the brain which showed an air fluid level in the sphenoid sinuses.
ENT biopsied a small ulcer in her middle turbinate which ultimately came back positive for aspergillus infection.
She underwent debridement of her nasal septum and turbinate on [**9-20**] and pathology results showed evidence of angioinvasive fungal infection.
Her beta-glucan and galactomanan levels were consistently monitored for signs of decreasing infection.
Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on [**9-3**] for respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema.
Chest CT showed bilateral pleural effusions but no clear evidence of infection.
Sputum cultures revealed aspergillus in two samples (non fumagatus/[**Country 11730**]/flavus species).
BAL with minimal mucous, cultures negative.
Despite aggressive diuresis she continued to have poor NIFs and RSBIs.
She ultimately underwent trachestomy on [**9-20**] for prolonged respiratory failure.
GVHD of the GI tract:  The patient was originally admitted with diarrhea felt to be secondary to GVHD.
She underwent colonoscopy which showed granularity consistent with GVHD.
She did have evidence of CMV reactivation but CMV cultures from the colon were negative.
When she presented with sepsis her cellcept was discontinued and the doses of her other immunosuppresives were reduced.
For much of her MICU course she had no evidence of stool production and hypoactive bowel sounds.
She also had persistently elevated liver enzymes indicative of ongoing GVHD.
Thrombocytopenia:  Throughout her MICU course the patient has had significant thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions.
The etiology of this is unclear but has been felt to be secondary to marrowsuppressive effects of her medications including gancyclovir and cyclosporin.
She was transfused as needed for platelet counts less than 30 or when she developed oozing from her trach or sinuses after debridement.
Anemia: The patient was also noted to have anemia throughout her MICU course.
She was found to have a decreased reticulocyte count and an elevated ferritin consistent with an inflammatory anemia.
Embolic vs. Watershed infarcts:  Patient noted to have three small acute to subacute infarcts involving the right superiour fontal lobe and right inferior cerebellum.
Concern that these represent fungal infection.
She underwent TTE which was inconclusive for fungal endocarditis.
She had a repeat MRI on [**9-23**] which was limited secondary to motion, but ultimately read by Neuroradiology as no progression.
Sinus Bradycardia: Postoperatively the patient was noted to have sinus bradycardia of unclear etiology but felt to be secondary to post-operative sedation causing increased vagal tone.
This resolved for almost 10 days until the last 24 hours of her life, when she progressively had bradycardia until asystole.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response during this hospitalization.
She was not anticoagulated given her thrombocytopenia and elevated IRN.
Originally she was felt to have liver function test abnormalities secondary to hypotension her transaminases were never dramatically elevated.
Her transasminases have since normalized with a persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.
Multiple RUQ ultrasounds have been negative for cholecystitis and portal venous thrombosis.
There was also concern that her LFT abnormalities might be secondary to medications (caspufugin/voriconazole/ambisome) or GVHD of the liver.
Her fungal coverage was switched from voriconazole to posaconazole for decreased hepatic toxicity.
Her LFTs and Tbili continued to rise, concerning for worsening GVHD, so her steroids were increased.
CMV: Patient has had evidence of CMV infection throughout her MICU course.
Her post-transplant course has been complicated by GVHD of the GI tract and CMV infection.
Additionally, anticoagulation was held due to her thrombocytopenia, anemia and oozing from multiple wound sites.
Goal per Heme/Onc is for patient to be borderline hypoglycemic.
