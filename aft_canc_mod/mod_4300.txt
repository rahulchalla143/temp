Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD WBC-17.6* RBC-4.48 Hgb-13.5 Hct-39.1 MCV-87 MCH-30.2 MCHC-34.6 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-387 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD Neuts-84.9* Lymphs-11.4* Monos-2.6 Eos-0.4 Baso-0.6 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD PT-11.7 PTT-24.6 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-13 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-4.7 Cl-105 HCO3-24 AnGap-15 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-3.2 Mg-2.5 [**2151-2-7**] 02:39AM BLOOD Phenyto-10.0  IMAGING: Head CT [**2-6**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large 3.5 x 4.8 cm intra-axial right frontal lobar hemorrhage, with surrounding edema and associated mass effect.
There are no other foci of intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Aside from mass effect from the hematoma, the ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are unremarkable in appearance.
There is no evidence for acute large vascular territory infarction.
Visualized bones demonstrate no abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Large right frontal lobar hemorrhage.
MRI is recommended for further evaluation to exclude underlying mass lesion.
MRI Head [**2-7**]: FINDINGS: Again identified is a large right frontal hematoma.
The overall size of the hematoma appears unchanged since the prior CT scans.
Again identified is extensive surrounding edema with local mass effect and mild right to left midline shift.
There are numerous other areas of deep white matter hyperintensity in a predominantly periventricular pattern.
Although this could be a consequence of chronic small vessel ischemia, the possibility of demyelinating disease should be considered.
These findings raise the possibility of an underlying vascular malformation as the etiology of the hemorrhage.
Thus, the significance of the enhancement and edema depend on the time elapsed between the hemorrhage and these images.
Early appearance of enhancement and edema implies an underlying lesion that could produce both, such as a neoplasm.
After several days, the combination of enhancement and edema may represent reaction to the hematoma itself, and are thus of little diagnostic significance.
There are no prominent feeding vessels or draining veins, thus a CT angiogram is unlikely to be helpful.
CONCLUSION: Right frontal hematoma again seen with surrounding edema and a thin rim of enhancement.
There may be a small vessel coursing through the substance of the hematoma.
The aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcifications with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a somewhat hypoenhancing lobulated mass in the left posterior mid-lower hemithorax adjacent to the vertebral body and inseparable from the medial pleural space and the left hilum measuring approximately 5.9 x 4.8 cm (3:25).
There are adjacent atelectatic changes as well as interlobular and intralobular septal thickening.
Severe emphysema is noted.
There is a 2.4 x 3.2 cm spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (3:22).
There is no pneumothorax.
Atelectatic changes of the left lower lobe are noted.
There is no bowel obstruction or bowel wall thickening.
Abdominal aorta and iliac vessels demonstrate atherosclerotic calcifications with no aneurysmal dilatation.
There is no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: Small amount of air within the urinary bladder is likely secondary to instrumentation.
There is moderate amount of urine in the urinary bladder.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a probable bone island measuring 4 mm in the left femoral head (3:113).
No lesion to suggest malignancy or infection is identified.
Spiculated right upper lobe mass concerning for malignancy.
Hypoenhancing mass in the left mid-lower hemithorax (possibly necrotic) is pleural-based with adjacent post-obstructive pneumonia or lymphangitic spread of cancer.
Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
Fibroid uterus.
Severe emphysema.
MRI Head [**2-11**]: Post-surgical changes are noted in the right frontal lobe and in the adjacent bone and external soft tissues, with blood products, and moderate vasogenic edema.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are unremarkable except for effacement/mass effect on the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] by the edema in the right frontal lobe.
Post-surgical changes in the right frontal lobe and in the right frontal region, with some enhancement in the dura and in surgical bed.
Mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and leftward shift of the midline structures with mass effect on the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as described above.
RIGHT FRONTAL MASS PATHOLOGY: REPORT PENDING RIGHT FOOT BIOSPY PATHOLOGY: REPORT PENDING   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after OSH imaging revealed a signifcantly sized right frontal hemorrhagic mass.
CT torso was also done, which was significant for pulmonary and adnrenal lesions.
Preliminary pathology was consistant with metastatic melanoma.
She was maintained overnight in the ICU for frequent neurochecks, and SBP control.
She had no events overnight.
On the morning of POD #1, she had very mild LUE/LLE weakness (constistent with pre-op), but otherwise doing well and neurology intact.
She was seen again by Dermatology, who did a biopsy of a suspicious looking lesion on the bottom of her right foot, that was once previously diagnosed as a dysplastic nevi.

You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**9-16**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
You will need to have those sutures removed within two weeks.
