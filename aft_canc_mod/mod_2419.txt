Admission Date: [**2193-2-18**]        Discharge Date: [**2193-3-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-10-6**]        Sex:  M  Service:   HISTORY:  This was a 54-year-old male with past medical history significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma status post chemotherapy and status post mini-allogeneic BMT complicated by graft versus host disease for skin, liver, GI, and lungs.
He was originally admitted on [**2193-2-18**] for shortness of breath, increasing edema, and change in mental status to the Medicine Service.
His hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and new flutter status post DC cardioversion on [**2193-2-22**].
The patient had recurrence of his aflutter on [**2193-2-26**] on amiodarone associated with hypertension and was transferred to the CCU.
The patient had aflutter ablation done on [**2193-2-27**] and a right- and left- sided cardiac catheterization on [**2193-2-28**] revealed hemodynamics consistent with constrictive pericarditis.
The patient was started on Natrecor and Lasix with minimal diuresis complicated by hypertension and Natrecor was discontinued.
On [**2193-3-4**], the patient had a cardiac MRI which post MRI was complicated by a respiratory arrest requiring intubation, transferred to the MICU.
The patient was eventually extubated on [**2193-3-7**] and placed intermittently on BiPAP for hypercapnia and fatigue.
Due to the patient's constrictive pericarditis possibly secondary to his graft versus host disease, a pericardial stripping was performed on [**2193-3-12**] for improvement in hemodynamics by cardiothoracic surgery.
The patient was transferred to the CCU for further diuresis after his pericardial stripping.
The patient occasionally needed BiPAP for respiratory fatigue and hypercapnia.
The patient was complaining of some difficulty swallowing and sore throat on [**2193-3-17**] and his tube feeds were held due to his difficulty swallowing and his need for BiPAP.
The patient was noted on [**2193-3-18**] to have a desaturation in the morning to 70 percent on 40 percent facemask, suctioned and blood with some thin secretions were suctioned and the patient's O2 saturations increased after suctioning.
It was felt that the patient may had an aspiration event and was started on Flagyl and a speech and swallow evaluation was ordered.
The patient required emergent intubation in the evening of [**2193-3-18**] for respiratory distress.
A stat echocardiogram was obtained which showed no evidence of tamponade.
The patient expired at 12:34 a.m. likely from sepsis from aspiration event.
