On [**2188-7-19**] presented to the ED with increased SOB, rapid atrial fibrillation, hypotensive and diarrhea.
Chest X-Ray showed bilateral pleural effusion right > left.
leukocytosis WBC 51, and BUN/Cre 36/1.3, hyperkalemia K 5.4 He was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn for possible pneumonia which has was discontinued per ID.
ID felt the elevated WBC is possibly secondary to his cancer and steroid use.
He was seen by Endocrine who recommended low-dose steroids for hypopituitarism for possible pituitary involvement.
Past Medical History: Acute Respiratory failure secondary to malignant pleural effusion.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on amiodarone started [**2188-7-19**] Elevated Cre Pk 2.2, now 1.3 base 0.8 Thrombocytopenia Hypertension Hyperlipidemia New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus Morbid obesity   Social History: etoh [**3-12**] drinks per day cigarettes 30 pack year history, no current smoker  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission:  Vitals: T- 97.1, HR- 74, BP- 117/92, RR- 13, SaO2- 93% on 6L GEN: NAD.
No LAD CV: Irregularly irregular.
No m/r/g PULM: Decreased bs at bases (L > R).
There is no interval change in large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema and basilar atelectasis.
Echo:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M, with recent diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
The patient underwent 2 recent therapeutic right thoracenteses at [**Hospital3 **]with 1.5 L removed on [**2188-7-16**] and 1 L removed yesterday which both resulted in symptomatic improvement.
A chest ultrasound also revealed left pleural effusion which was planned for another thoracentesis on the next hospital day.
HD2: Due to difficulty in obtaining IV access and labs, PICC line placed for access.
Patient also developed worsening renal failure - Cr 2.8 likely pre-renal with hyperkalemia.
Patient developed hypotension this afternoon (down to the 70s systolic).
There was concern for pericardial effusion so STAT bedside ECHO was performed.
Preliminary results demonstrated no effusion, small LV, mildly hypertrophied LV, and pleural effusion.
Given hypotension and possible need for pressors, patient was transferred to the MICU for further management.
The patient's blood pressure initially improved with IV fluids, however on the evening of [**7-24**] the patient became anxious from a sensation of shortness of breath.
An ABG was performed which was re-assuring, showing a chronic respiratory alkalosis.
On the morning of [**7-25**] however, the patient became acutely short of breath again and was intubated.
He became hypotensive requiring administration of multiple pressors.
