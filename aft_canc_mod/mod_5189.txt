[**2171-10-15**] for a partial gastrectomy and open cholecystectomy by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**].
The procedure went well with no complications.
Following his surgery, the patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative hypovolemia and low urine output.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable overnight.
He was begun on aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and a central venous line was placed as well as a Swann Ganz catheter.
He continued to make adequate urine and his acute tubular necrosis was determined to be resolving.
Later that day, the patient began wheezing severely and went into acute atrial fibrillation.
He was later transferred to the intensive care unit for his respiratory distress, thought ot be due to fluid overload.
A CT scan was ordered to rule out an occult cause of sepsis, as the patient had a fever of 101.2.
The scan was unable to exclude an area of stenosis of the afferent loop at the level of the gastroenteric anastomosis.
It also showed a small amount of fluid around the liver, between bowel loops and in the pelvis and bilateral small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, as well as cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcifications.
Cultures were taken, which later revealed coagulase negative Staphylococci in the blood, gram positive cocci in the sputum, and mixed flora from his catheter tip.
The renal team said that the patient had total body fluid overload and intravascular hypovolemia.
On postoperative day thirteen, his abdomen and his wound looked good.
On postoperative day fourteen, TPN was started because the patient was not taking adequate PO and he failed his swallow evaluation.
An ultrasound showed an AV fistula in his right internal jugular vein and right carotid artery.
The vascular surgery team saw and examined the patient and opted for no intervention at this time as the patient was stable.
On postoperative day fifteen, his Lopressor was increased because he was tachycardic and hypertensive.
He failed a swallow evaluation.
They recommended aggressive diuresis (negative 2-2.5 liters) and heparinization for his atrial fibrillation.
