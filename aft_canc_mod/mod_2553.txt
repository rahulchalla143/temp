Admission Date:  [**2175-3-1**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2111-5-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, status post nephrectomy, alcoholic cirrhosis, right MCA cerebrovascular accident with dense left hemiplegia.
The patient is a nursing home resident who presents with change in mental status and fevers to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room.
The patient was noted to have a change in mental status at the nursing home and they brought him into the emergency room.
Subsequently, the patient had a witnessed seizure in the emergency room.
CT of the chest was obtained, which was consistent with bilateral bibasilar infiltrates, possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient also had a head CT, which was negative for any evidence of bleed or any pathology.
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU, where abnormal labs were significant for an alkaline phosphatase of 1.043, GET of 951, calcium 12.6 and albumin of 2.3.
Abdominal CT was obtained, which showed evidence of a new liver mass likely to be hepatocellular carcinoma.
There was also evidence of ascites, which was tapped in the ICU and negative for SBP with SSG gradient of 0.8.
There was a question for portal hypertension on abdominal CT, so ultrasound was obtained, which was negative for any evidence of Chiari.
The patient's newly diagnosed possible hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as his poor neurological function, was discussed with the family and secondary to the poor prognosis, the family is in agreement that the patient should be DNR/DNI with no aggressive procedures or interventions.
They would like pain release as primary goal, but would favor treatment of his infections and treatments of abnormal electrolytes.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis.
History of seizure disorder.
Renal cell carcinoma status post nephrectomy.
Esophageal varices.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Aortic stenosis.
Vitamin C.  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light; evidence of cataracts bilaterally.
There is now tenderness diffusely.
EXTREMITIES:  Without any clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Bilateral cataracts.
Occasional eye deviation to the left for a few second, but not sustained or jerking.
However, reflexes slightly more brisk at the left bicep.
Knee jerks normal and symmetrical, no ankle jerks.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with a history of renal-cell carcinoma, alcoholic cirrhosis, status post right MCA, cerebrovascular accident with dense left hemiparesis, nursing home resident, who presents with change in mental status, fevers, and recently transferred from the Intensive Care Unit with workup, which likely revealed hepatocellular carcinoma, probable portal vein thrombosis and hypercalcemia.
As described in the history of present illness, the chest CT showed evidence of a bilateral bibasilar pneumonia, which is likely to be aspiration pneumonia.
Sputum was obtained and revealed gram-positive rods, 3+ gram positive cocci, and 3+ yeast.
The patient will likely need a full 14-day course for his aspiration pneumonia.
The finding of his liver mass was suspicious for horizontal cleavage component.
There is a question of a portal vein thrombosis on the abdominal CT.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained to rule out portal vein thrombosis and there was no evidence of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
An AST was obtained, which was significant for gross elevation at 5,259.
Liver service consultation was obtained and they agreed that the description on the CT, as well as the elevated AST was consistent with the hepatocellular carcinoma and the patient would likely not benefit from a biopsy at the time.
The patient's hypercalcemia was thought to be likely secondary to a perineoplastic syndrome in the setting of multiple carcinomas.
The patient's anemia was also worked up with iron studies, which were significant for TIBC of 138.
No evidence of B12 or folate deficiency.
The patient's labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient had no evidence of blood loss during this hospital stay.
It is felt that the patient's change of mental status was likely secondary to multiple factors including hypercalcemia, seizure disorder, increased narcotics, infection including pneumonia.
The patient had a head CT, as stated above, which showed no evidence of an acute bleed.
It is unclear whether it was the Dilantin, antibiotics, or the decrease in calcium, which contributed to the improvement in mental status, but it is likely a combination of all of the above.
At the time of this dictation, the patient is being screened for a place to go for acute nursing facility.
Bilateral bibasilar pneumonia, likely aspiration.
Likely newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma.
History of renal cell carcinoma.
