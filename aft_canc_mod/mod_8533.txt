An EGD was performed on admission  showing varices in the lower third of the esophagus, an ulcer on the posterior duodenal bulb.
Patient was hypotensive to the 60's systolic and was having fresh bleeding in the stool.
He was taken emergently to the OR with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and upon opening the abdomen, the pylorus was opened longitudinally onto the duodenum whereupon the team encountered arterial pulsatile bleeding from the base of a 1- cm ulcer in the posterior part of the 1st portion of the duodenum.
All 4 corners of the ulcer were over sewn with big 2-0 silk sutures to control the bleeding.
On [**1-8**] patient underwent Gastrografin study of GI tract which demonstrates JP drain in the right upper quadrant and tip of NG tube within the stomach.
Gastrografin contrast was administered via NG-tube, showing contrast passing promptly from the stomach into the duodenum without evidence of leak.
Note is made of narrowing of the first portion of the duodenum, likely related to postoperative edema.
