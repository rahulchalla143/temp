Application of allograft for fusion augmentation   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 61229**] is a 49-year-old male who was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in [**2104**].
Since that time, he has been diagnosed with multiple metastases including skeletal metastases.
Recently, he developed neck pain which was progressive, and then associated with weakness of his left arm in the C5 distribution with deltoid and also biceps weakness.
He underwent an MRI as recommended by his medical oncologist, which demonstrated an infiltrative lesion within C4, causing spinal cord compression as well as severe nerve root compression.
CSF space was obliterated and there was spinal cord signal change.
There was considerable instability within the C4 vertebral body.
Due to the nature of this disease, in concert with the severity of symptoms, pending spinal instability and spinal cord compression, he elected to undergo surgical treatment to help accomplish the goals of anterior cervical spinal cord decompression with interbody reconstruction and fusion.
In [**2-/2113**], he underwent biopsy of a right clavicular lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing a 0.45 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level III melanoma.
In [**6-/2114**], he had biopsy of a left mandible skin lesion revealing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10834**] level III, 0.51 mm thick melanoma with three mitoses per mm2.
On [**2114-7-23**], he underwent wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] with no residual melanoma at the primary site, but one of three lymph nodes showed a microscopic deposit of melanoma.
He underwent modified left neck dissection on [**2114-7-30**] with no melanoma noted in seven additional nodes.
In [**2115-6-4**], he underwent biopsy of a new right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing metastatic melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component and two mitoses per mm2.
It was unclear whether this represented an in-tranist metastasis from his right clavicle melanoma or an epidermatrophic metastasis.
There was no evidence of residual melanoma in the chest or in the sentinel lymph node.
Torso CT in [**9-11**] revealed new small bilateral pulmonary nodules and an abnormal right kidney.
Therapy was held on C1W4, [**1-12**], due to visual problems, fatigue and anorexia.
No nodes, elevated JVP, or thyroid swelling.
Lymphatics:  No generalized lymphadenopathy.
No mass, tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly.
Neurological examination showed some weakness in the left upper limb, 4+/5, associated with some numbness with pinprick and touch sensation.
No other cranial nerve, sensory, motor, or neurological dysfunction.
Refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
Patient was scheduled for lumbar spinal decompression and fusion but the surgery was cancelled due to persistent fever and on the advise of Oncology team.
