Admission Date:  [**2176-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-8-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia, pulmonary HTN  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right heart catheterization Swan Ganz catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 59 yo F with PMH cirrhosis and tobacco admitted at OSH on [**6-25**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion.
She also developed a mild cough productive of white frothy sputum as well as a sensation of lightheadedness when extremely dyspneic.
On admission to OSH, she was afebrile with RR 26 and breathing 94% on room air.
Work-up at the OSH included an elevated d-dimer, a V/Q scan that was low probability for PE, a LE US negative for DVT, a CT-angiogram that was negative for PE with incidental finding of RUL infiltrates, and TTE which revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with mild R heart dysfunction and TR.
Follow up high-res chest CT showed progressive ground glass infiltrates in upper lobes bilaterally.
She reports improvement of her dyspnea but continued cough with green sputum production throughout the hospitalization.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and pulmonary consultation.

Right axis deviation.
Non-specific ST segment depressions in leads V5-V6 accompanied by low amplitude T waves in these leads.
T wave inversions in leads III and aVF possibly related to right axis deviation.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right-sided pressures with a RVSP of 90 mm Hg and PASP of 95 mm Hg with a mean of 58 mmHg.
There was also evidence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with an elevated wedge pressure of 16 mm Hg.
Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-7-3**] IMPRESSION: -No evidence of interstitial fibrosis.
-Ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes has improved from CXR of four days ago, consistent with an acute process.
-Shrunken liver associated with mild splenomegaly.
ECHO [**2176-7-3**] IMPRESSION: Small secundum atrial septal defect with right-to-left flow at rest and with maneuvers.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with severe free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and globa/regional systolic function.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: Pulmonary hypertension: Diagnosed by TTE at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where chest CT showed no evidence of PE, only mild interstitial lung opacities R>L.
Testing for secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension included HIV, which was negative, scleroderma, which was weakly positive (see below), pulmonary function tests for COPD, which did not show any significant obstructive disease, and doppler abdominal ultrasound, which showed normal portal venous flow, making portopulmonary HTN unlikely.
She underwent right heart catheterization with Swan-Ganz cath placement on hospital day#3, which confirmed elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PASP 98, mean 58).
Following this, she was transferred to the MICU with a PA catheter for a monitored two-day sildenafil trial, which showed minimal response in PAP but more impressive symptomatic response in her exertional dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
Bubble echocardiagraphy demonstrated right to left interatrial flow at rest and with maneuvers, c/w Eisenmanger's syndrome through an apparent secundum ASD, thus implicating congenital heart disease as the most likely etiology of her pulm HTN.
Cirrhosis: She presented with elevated LFTs, coags, low albumin, and a nodular liver on imaging, all consistent with cirrhosis.
Hepatology was consulted, and testing for other causes of liver disease besides past alcohol use included hepatitis A, which was positive likely from prior infection, hepatitis B, which showed no evidence of prior exposure, and hepatitis C, which was positive with a viral load of 28,500.
Other tests recommended by Hepatology included [**Doctor First Name **], soluble liver Ag, and ANCA, which were negative, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies, Scl-70, and ACE, which were mildly positive.
She also had elevations of IgG,IgM, and IgA.
Per Hepatology, she is not currently a good candidate for interferon treatment given its toxicity and the severity of her lung disease.
Interstitial lung opacities: In addition to DOE, she presented with cough productive of white followed by green sputum.
Consecutive CTs at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital revealed progressing ground glass opacities bilaterally.
Sputum and urinary testing did not show any evidence of bacterial or legionella infection.
She remained afebrile with a normal white count through her hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
Oropharyngeal lesions: Initial oropharyngeal exam revealed non-painful, non-tender, white lesions on the soft palate that did not scrape off.
These lesions spread over several days across her oral mucosa, and then had nearly resolved by the time of discharge.
She was completely asymptomatic throughout, and these lesions were thought most likely due to a viral syndrome.
This was attributed largely to her lung disease (splenomegaly, thrombopoietin, etc), with possible contribution from a viral syndrome.
No evidence of HIT was observed while on prophylactic heparin.
Vaginal spotting: She reported occasional vaginal spotting during this admission, secondary to her known cervical HGSIL.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation QID (4 times a day) as needed for dyspnea.
