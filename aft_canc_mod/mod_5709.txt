The patient was seen by her oncologist on [**7-11**] for c/o diarrhea in clinic and was given 1L IVF, given immodium and imaging was deferred given improvement in symptoms.
Over the weekend she states that her diarrhea improved and did not have any further episodes.
She reports that today she had 2 more episodes of loose stools, yellowish in color.
She also reports SOB and labored breathing.
The patient underwent CT-head that did not show brain mets or hemmorhage and was started on heparin gtt.
The CT torso also showed abnormal bowel wall thickening with bowel wall edema involving a long segment of jejunum.
The DDx being likely angioedema in the setting of chemo, but also possible infectious vs ischemic (although SMA/[**Female First Name (un) 899**] and SMV are patent).
The patient also had an episode of hypotension thought to be a syncopal episode with SBP dropping to 50's, but improved to baseline without intervention.
Currently, the patient states that her abdominal pain has resolved and no further episodes of diarrhea.
She denied and SOB and states that her breathing was comfortable.
No history of travel or recent surgery.
Of note, pt was on levoflox on [**2121-6-30**] by her oncologist for neutropenia and dysphagia/hoarse voice and also given neulasta.
ROS: + 10lbs weight loss since starting chemo in [**Month (only) 547**].
The patient denies any fevers, chills, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Her father had diabetes and died of an MI at age 70.
She has two brothers with no medical problems.
She had a paternal grandmother with throat cancer.
There are no other cancers in the family.

No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2121-7-15**]):       NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
Non-specific T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-6-18**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Newly developed saddle pulmonary embolism since examination from [**2121-5-14**].
Extensive metastatic disease with multiple subcentimeter cavitating pulmonary nodules and hypodense liver lesions.
Abnormal bowel wall thickening with bowel wall edema involving a long segment of jejunum.
There is associated focused mesenteric fluid adjacent to abnormal loop of small bowel.
No evidence of obvious masses or hemorrhage.
Note that only post-contrast images are provided and this limits the detection of subtle areas of hemorrhage or enhancement due to lack of precontrast images.
MRI has a much greater sensitivity for the detection of intracranial metastasis and can be obtained as clinically indicated.
Stable appearance of sclerotic focus in the right frontal bone with nonaggressive features, again differential most likely includes fibrous dysplasia; however, in the context of known primary malignancy, osteosclerotic metastasis is a consideration and can be correlated with bone scan as indicated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2121-7-15**] 4:46 AM IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of the left-sided Port-A-Cath.
No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Study Date of [**2121-7-15**] 9:09 AM IMPRESSION: Acute DVT involving the mid and distal right superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein and peroneal veins.
Massive Central Pulmonary Embolism, Deep Venous Thrombosis: - Pt had CT-chest that showed saddle PE, and a LENI was performed which showed an extensive DVT in her leg.
An echocardiogram was performed and also did not demonstrate cardiac compromise so no need for IVC filter at this time.
Diarrhea/Abdominal Pain: Patient with intermittent episodes of diarrhea/ abdominal pain.
CT-abd showed likely angioedema from chemotherapy, but also infectious or ischemic.
The feeling is this is most likely due to the small bowel neoplasm.
Lesions slightly smaller on repeat CT. See above for GI complaints possibly related to chemo.
