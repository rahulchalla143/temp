<u>Treatment:</u> s/p lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by XRT and then Arimidex which was stopped after 2 months because the patient developed chest pain which was determined non-cardiac.

CXR [**9-15**]: - marked deterioration of the radiographic image.
- preexisting lung nodules have increased in size - neralized reticular pattern that was previously invisible is seen,   together with newly appeared small bilateral pleural effusions - pattern suggests the presence of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
- Despite the multiple lytic bone lesions seen on the CT examination from [**2124-8-24**], none of these lesions is detectable on the chest radiograph.
Worsening of interstitial and bilateral ground-glass opacity in a perihilar and upper lobe distribution, given rapid interval progression, may represent pulmonary edema or multifocal bronchopneumonia.
Recommend short term follow-up to document resolution given known underlying metastasis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Unchanged diffuse osseous, hepatic and pulmonary metastases.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxia: The patient was tranferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hypoxia requiring a non-rebreather to stabilize her oxygen sats.
She had a convincing story for a viral infection as her and her husband had URI symptoms and cough for the past few weeks.
Induced sputum was sent to rule out PCP as she had recently been weaned off steroids in the setting of undergoing whole brain irradiation.
Sputum was negative for PCP.
EKG had no ichemic changes and cardiac enzymes were negative for MI.
She underwent a CTA showed no evidence of PE, but did show a marked worsening of interstitial and bilateral ground-glass opacity in a perihilar and upper lobe distribution.
LENIs were also negative for DVT.
On exam she did not appear volume overloaded.
A TTE was done and showed and EF of 75% and no evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
Her hypoxia slowly improved and she was satting in the mid 90's on 6L NC.
She was discharged on zofran, ativan, compazine for possible post-chemotheraphy nausea.
Upon discussion, she was willing to be intubated for acute pneumonia but specifically states that she does not want to be on a ventilator long term.
