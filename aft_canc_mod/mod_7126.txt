MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2116-5-18**]):    No MRSA isolated  CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2116-5-9**] 1:37 PM IMPRESSION:  1.
No bilateral lower extremity DVT.
Persistent severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis.
DIAGNOSIS: Skin and subcutaneous tissue, right leg (A-P):  1.Skin and subcutaneous tissue with fibrosis, acute and chronic inflammation, focal necrosis, focal calcification, and foreign body giant cell reaction consistent with prior procedure / treatment effect.
Opacification of the base of the left hemithorax is probably a combination of severe left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
There is unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette but the diameter of the vasculature in the lungs has decreased, reflecting decrease in pulmonary edema.
Moderate atelectasis at the left lung bases.
No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-15**] 4:09 AM FINDINGS: Mild and hazy opacities in right lower lung is either atelectasias or combination of small effusion and atelectasis, unchanged over last 24 hours.
Pleural effusion if any is minimal on the left side and stable.
Mildly increased retrocardiac density, reflecting atelectasis, is similar.
Retrocardiac opacification persists.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-16**] 4:36 AM IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-9**] through [**5-15**]: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion and small right pleural effusion have worsened.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is relatively unchanged, following extubation.
Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 M with CHF, afib, WPW s/p ablation, high grade right LE sarcoma s/p XRT and multiple excisions, hemochromatosis c/b cirrhosis, hypertension, left atrial thrombus seen on TEE in [**2111**], who was admitted [**5-7**] after elective debridement and split thickness skin graft reconstruction of radiated sarcoma defect.
Immediately post-op, his course was complicated by severe pain for which he had a sciatic nerve catheter placed by the acute pain service and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
After several liters of fluid and better pain control, his rates returned to the low 100s with metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] (double home dose).
He was taken back to the OR on [**5-11**] for a large skin graft and flap surgery.
He was also agitated and received haldol and ativan, with improvement in his mental status.
On [**5-15**], he continued to have afib with RVR into the 140s, with a Hct drop to 19 and a developing flank/bacl hematoma.
He was taken back to OR for hematoma evacuation, transfused 2 units PRBCs.
His persistent tachycardia was noted to be vagally responsive.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Maristhill Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: non-healing leg wound, atrial fibrilation with rapid ventricular response, successful skin flap, surgical site infection  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted on [**2116-5-7**] for surgical debridements of a chronic right lower extremity wound followed by repair with a free right latissimus flap to your clean wound site with skin graft coverage on [**2116-5-11**].
You also experienced atrial fibrilliation with a rapid ventricular rate during this admission as well.
Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**] for management of your right lower extremity flap repair.
