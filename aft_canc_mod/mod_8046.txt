Admission Date:  [**2148-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim Ds  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Flash Pulmonary Edema, Hypotension, NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line   History of Present Illness: 81F hx of anterior STEMI in [**9-3**] s/p thrombectomy and BMS x 2 to proximal LAD, EF 55% to 60% ([**1-5**]), also with distant hx of Non-Hodkins Lymphoma and is currently undergoing her third cycle of Gemzar/Cisplatin for Bladder CA (most recent treatment [**8-15**]) that presented to the ED this evening with SOB and later hypotension.
During the admission the pt had nausea, without any CP or SOB.
ECG at that time revealed new ST elevations anteriorly and the pt was subsequently taken emegently to the cath lab.
The pt took Compazine and later Zofran without effect.
The pt went to sleep from 6pm to 9pm this evening when she awoke acutely SOB and thus was brought to the ED.
Pt noted to have elevated JVP and diffuse rales on exam.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
She had a prior workup for hematuria in [**2143**], which was reportedly negative.
She underwent cystoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which revealed diffuse disease of the bladder.
Biopsy performed on [**2147-9-4**] revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the lamina propria present in the left lateral and right lateral walls.
There was low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma without lamina propria invasion seen in the trigone.
Staging CT torso performed on [**2148-1-11**] revealed no evidence of visceral disease.
She then went for repeat cystoscopy with TURBT on [**2148-2-20**], with biopsy showing a focus suspicious for muscularis propria invasion identified in the deep biopsy of the tumor bed.
There was also a rare focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
Tumor at present on the left lateral wall did show high-grade urothelial carcinoma invasive into the muscularis propria.
She met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] this time for consideration of a bladder resection, however, given the complications of her recent heart attack, she was felt to be a nonoperative candidate.
However, she has had progressive right greater than left knee pain over the last 3 to 6 months, which prompted a visit to the rheumatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1667**], on [**2148-4-9**].
Plain films of the knees were obtained on [**2148-4-16**] revealing multiple sclerotic foci involving bilateral femur and proximal tibia, highly concerning for metastasis.
She then underwent MR of the right knee on [**2148-4-17**], which revealed markedly abnormal marrow signal in the distal femur and tibia, with areas of pathologic fracture along the medial epicondyle and medial condyle associated with soft tissue extension given this appearance is highly concerning for extensive metastases with pathologic fractures.
She then met with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] of orthopedics, who proceeded with a [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 500**] biopsy on [**2146-5-2**], pathology consistent with metastatic carcinoma, consistent with urothelial origin.
The pt succesfully underwent XRT which provided pain relief and began her first dose of gemzar/cisplatin on [**6-18**].

The basal inferolateral and lateral apical segments have relatively preserved function.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-1-22**], wall motion abnormalities are new.
CXR [**8-17**]- IMPRESSION: Mixed response with improved aeration of the left mid lung field and increased opacity in the right lower lung field, for which positioning differences might be contributing.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate basal antero-septal hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the LV.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
This change is consistent with resolving stress cardiomyopathy.
Stress test [**8-22**]- IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or significant ST segment changes.
MIBI [**8-22**]- No evidence of perfusion defects.
LVEF:51% representing an interval decrease in function from 71% in [**2146**].
Decreased wall motion when compared to the previous study.
Brief Hospital Course: # Shortness of breath- Patient admitted to CCU with shortness of breath and hypotension.
Shortness of breath and hypoxia improved.
Diuresis was stopped as patient is potentially septic.
By [**8-20**], lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no complaints of shortness of breath.
# Rhythm- Patient in sinus tachycardia on admission.
She then experienced some chest tightness with elevated cardiac enzymes.
Question of isolated ST elevation in lead V2.
Did not experience any more chest pain/palpitations that night.
It broke spontaneously and then recurred for about a minute with a similar BP drop.
Did not have any more episodes of SVT that evening/morning.
On [**8-18**], patient again had 26 beat run of SVT at 3pm, which resolved spontaneously.
Patient experienced no other runs of SVT while in-house.
Given patient's pneumonia and UTI, it is thought the patient had Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy.
# Coronaries: Pt with known 1 vessel CAD and is s/p thrombectomy and placement of two bare metals stents after STEMI in 9/[**2146**].
On admission, cardiac enzymes were positive, and EKG showed questionable ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
DDx at time included strain vs. acute plaque rupture.
Trended down afterwards with no more chest pain.
Stress MIBI showed no evidence of perfusion defects.
LVEF:51% representing an interval decrease in function from 71% in [**2146**].
Decreased wall motion when compared to the previous study.
No episodes of chest pain while in hospital.
# Pneumonia/UTI:  Patient presented with questionable RLL pneumonia on CXR.
There was concern of sepsis so lasix drip was stopped.
# Hematuria- Patient had gross hematuria on every urination after foley d/c'd around 2 pm on [**8-22**].
Urology consulted regarding hematuria they recommended follow-up as an outpatient if hematuria has not resolved in a week.
# Hyponatremia - Presented with sodium of 131.
Thought to be related to hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting of CHF exacerbation.
# Metabolic acidosis - Bicarb 17 and lactate 3 on admission.
Acidosis was most likely related to poor forward flow in setting of volume overload and CHF exacerbation.
# Acute renal failure - Baseline Cr 0.8 but up to 1.4 on admission.
# Hypertension-  Hypotensive on admission.
Discharged on metoprolol 75mg PO TID  # Hypothyroidism - continued home dose synthroid.
# Metastatic bladder cancer - received third cycle of Gemzar/Cisplatin (most recent treatment [**8-15**]).
# Distant hx of Non-Hodkins Lymphoma - lymphoma in [**2115**] with a large axillary mass, status post MOP chemotherapy and mantle radiation.
# Osteoporosis - Continued fosamax, as per home regimen.

You were found to have a pneumonia and urinary tract infection which were causing stress on your heart leading to decreased heart function.
You developed blood in your urine prior to discharge and will follow-up closely with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] urology clinic if it does not resolve in one week.
Please seek medical care if you experience any concerning symptoms such as fevers, chills, dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or continued blood in your urine.
