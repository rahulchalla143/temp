Admission Date:  [**2144-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-7-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-9-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Cardiac tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 83057**] is an 83 yo female with IDDM, HTN, dyslipidemia and h/o lung cancer s/p XRT and RLL resection who was taken to an OSH by her family for increased SOB and found to be hypotensive with a large pericardial effusion and RUL opacity on CT. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and management of the pericardial effusion.
Per family, she has had progressive SOB over the past month.
She has had a cough for several weeks, which has sounded wet but not been productive of sputum or blood.
She has had decreased appetite but no weight loss.
On further review of systems, the family denies any prior history of MI, syncope, stroke or TIA.
At the OSH, she had negative LENIs and no PE on CTA.
Bedside U/S showed a large effusion with RV collapse and tamponade physiology.
She was intubated due to increased agitation and progression of her acidosis which was thought to represent lactic acidosis.
Past Medical History: CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: IDDM, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia No past cardiac history  OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -h/o lung cancer (patient declined treatment upon diagnosis) -Depression (no current meds) -Parkinson's Disease with dementia -hypothyroidism -Anxiety -s/p shoulder fracture [**2138**] -s/p arm fracture [**2139**] .
Social History: Worked in a light bulb soldering and packaging factory for many years.
Sclera anicteric.
Diffuse, loud rhonchi and wheezes throughout.
No crackles appreciated on left lat decubitus exam.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abd bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Cardiac tamponade- On arrival, the patient was noted to have a large pericardial effusion on bedside echo.
Fluid was sent for chemical and cytological analysis, and showed no malignant cells.
However, etiology of pericardial effusion is most likely malignant, as patient has lung cancer diagnosed over 1 year ago for which she preferred no treatment.
Home BP meds (ACE) were held for borderline blood pressures.
A repeat echo on [**6-30**] showed no evidence of pericardial fluid reaccumulation, with normal RV chamber size and wall motion.
RUL PNA- CXR at admission showed right upper lobe pneumonia, likely post-obstructive due to right upper lobe mass, and small right pleural effusion.
Blood cultures were pending, sputum cultures showed rare yeast and urine Legionella antigen was negative.
Patient remained afebrile throughout course and WBC trended down to normal range.
She was initially intubated post-pericardiocentesis for agitation and increasing anion gap metabolic acidosis, thought to be lactic acidosis.
Family and patient were consulted regarding possible pulmonary intervention (bronchoscopy +/- stenting) but they declined in favor of non-invasive care moving towards palliative care.
R pleural effusion- Etiology may be malignant or infectious.
Therefore, diuretics would likely not be helpful, and were held in light of tenuous blood pressure.
UTI- Urinalysis on admission showed 21-50 WBCs and moderate bacteria.
Likely due to underlying COPD and lung pathology, as well as post-obstructive PNA.
Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade, this likely reflected lactic acidosis along with respiratory alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
CAD/HL- No prior history of CAD and no CP during this episode.
A component of prerenal ARF was likely given hypotension in setting of tamponade.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Secondary diagnoses: - Primary lung cancer - Pneumonia - Pleural effusion - Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
You were found to have a build-up of fluid around your heart, so this fluid was drained.
You also had pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics, and fluid in your lungs.
All of these problems were most likely caused by the cancer in your lungs.
