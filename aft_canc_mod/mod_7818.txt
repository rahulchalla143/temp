Admission Date:  [**2167-1-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-2-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Known firstname 3276**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 93447**] is a 46 year old man with a hx of stage IV NSCLC and remote Hodgkin's disease who presented to the ED at an OSH with hemoptysis on [**1-20**] where he was observed overnight, discharged home, then represented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED the morning of [**1-21**] with recurrent hemoptysis.
The patient reports 3 episodes of hemoptysis since 7pm yesterday, each with 1-2 tablespoons of blood.
He underwent CTA which showed bilateral PEs with a post-obstructive PNA.
The CT also showed a small intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the lung but IP felt it was small and was okay with starting heparin.
Five hours latter he developed an additional episode of cough and hemoptysis of approximately [**12-6**] cup and he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
On arrival, he reports mild shortness of breath which is unchanged in the past 4 days.
He denies fevers or chills.
He denies dypnea on exertion, chest pain or palpitations.
He denies dizziness or lightheadedness.
He has no calf tenderness or swelling.
s/p splenectomy as part of staging laparotomy.
He underwent CXR [**12-14**] and CT scan on [**2166-12-18**] revealed extensive new thoracic adenopathy centered at the right hilus involving both adjacent and remote nodal stations in the mediastinum with atelectasis, consolidation, and possible mass involving most of the right upper lobe, particularly the anterior segment.
A destructive T10 spine lesion with possible invasion of the spinal canal was also noted, and bilateral thyroid nodules were observed.
An endobronchial core biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of 4L, level 7, and 4R lymph nodes revealed no suspicious cells.
A PET scan on [**2166-12-24**] revealed confluent FDG uptake surrounding the right upper lobe bronchus and right main stem bronchus, felt to be related to an infiltrating mass versus post-bronchoscopy change (SUV max 14.1).
Marked narrowing and irregularity of the right upper lobe bronchus and adjacent pulmonary vessels was noted, suggesting an underlying infiltrative lesion.
Additional involvement includes a left adrenal nodule, a right mandibular lesion, a distal sternal lesion, the left sacral body, a lytic lesion in the left femoral head, the right lesser trochanter, and destructive lesions of the T10 and L1 vertebral bodies, which demonstrated possible spinal canal extension.
An MRI of the brain demonstrated no evidence of brain lesions.
Family History: The patient's mother is 75 years old and has diabetes and obesity.

Bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Right upper lobe likely post-obstructive pneumonia.
Multiple spiculated masses in the right lower lobe concerning for malignancy.
Left lower lobe greater than right lower lobe, and lingular ground-glass opacities may represent pneumonia vs edema vs hemorrhage.
[**2167-1-22**] Bilaterally LE US; IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
[**2167-1-26**] Bilaterally LE US: IMPRESSION: Thrombus in a left posterior tibial vein.
More proximal veins of the left lower extremity and the veins of the right lower extremity are patent.
There is no free air.
Unremarkable esophagram, without evidence of stricture, narrowing or filling defect within the esophagus.
Mild delayed transit of contrast from the distal esophagus in to the stomach.
Large right hilar mass is noted on the scout examination, consistent with the known lung carcinoma.
Unchanged narrowing of the right upper lobe segmental bronchi with post obstructive changes likely representing pneumonitis.
Multiple new peripheral ground glass opacities in both lungs predominantly seen in the right lower lobe demonstrate mild FDG uptake, may represent post-radiation changes or an inflammatory/infectious process.
Interval decrease in the FDG uptake of the diffuse bony metastatic lesions.
A single focus of increased FDG uptake in the region of the right pterygoid process is new since prior study.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There appears to be some degree of depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2167-2-13**]: MRI T and L spine: IMPRESSION: Limited lumbar spine study demonstrates no obvious change on the sagittal images.
L2 and sacral metastases are again noted.
Extensive hilar and mediastinal adenopathy similar in appearance with marked narrowing of right upper lobe pulmonary segmental artery and bronchi and SVC narrowing.
Multiple filling defects similar in burden, but slightly different locations (and now more proximal) - i.e.
less PE in left lower lobe segmental branches, however new, small filling defects in left main pulm artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 93447**] is a 46 year old man with remote h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma, s/p splenectomy, with new stage IV NSCLC with bone mets s/p 1st round of chemo [**2167-1-7**] who presents with hemoptysis, found to have bilateral PEs and post-obstructive pneumonia.
Hemoptysis: Patient underwent LENIs to assess for clot, and read was negative for DVTs bilaterally.
However, overnight, patient had further episodes of hemoptysis ~1 cup size.
His heparin was stopped given concern for further bleeding.
IP urgently bronched patient and observed active bleeding from airways but unable to identify source.
Pt then developed recurrent hemoptysis and interventional radiology and radiation oncology were consulted and pt underwent radiation therapy.
Pt continued to have tachycardia and fatigue and so a repeat CTA was done to evaluate for PE on week 4 of hospitalization.
# Post-obstructive Pneumonia - On admission pt felt to have postobstructive pneumonia.
Pt reevaluated for postobstructive pna later in his hospital course [**1-6**] FUO and recieved CT chest followed by repeat bronch.
On bronchoscopy, pt not observed to have post-obstructive pneumonia.
# Occasional fevers: Pt developed fevers to 100-101 in 3rd week of hospitalization.
Pt initially started on vanc/cefepime for potential pulmonary source.
Pt was evaluated for recurrent pneumonia with both CT chest (which could not exclude pna) and bronch (which did not show any evidence for pneumonia.)
Given this information vanc/cefepime were discontinued and fever curve remained constant (temps of 98 c occasional spikes to 100 to 101).
CT chest did show ggo which could be consistent with fungal pna, COP as well as many other etiologies.
Ground glass opacities (ggo) were discussed c pt's oncology attg who felt that they could be watched with consideration for pulm f/u in the future (ddx includes COP, resolving pna, opportunistic infection) etc.
Low grade fevers thought to represent PEs and/or tumor fever.
# NSCLC - Recent dx in [**2166-12-5**] with lesion on right upper lobe and mets seen on PET scan to a left adrenal nodule, a right mandibular lesion, a distal sternal lesion, the left sacral body, a lytic lesion in the left femoral head, the right lesser trochanter, and destructive lesions of the T10 and L1 vertebral bodies.
# leg weakness: Pt had worsening lower extremity weakness.
Differential felt to include progression of known spinal mets versus deconditioning versus [**1-6**] increased edema.
Based on limited info, seems same as prior (T10 lesion c mild cord compression).
CONSIDER REPEAT SCAN IF ANY CONCERN.
Pt noted to have extensive clots bilaterally distal to filter.
Pt was seen by vascular surgery who recommended conservative management with thigh-high teds.
# elevated LFTs: Pt has had uptrending LFTs.
Could also be portal v thrombosis however, this would not alter the decision to anticoagulate so we did not do RUQ ultrasound.
# sinus tachycardia: Felt to likely be [**1-6**] PEs as bedside echo shows evidence of elevated RH pressures without RV dilation.
Pt does not have pericardial effusion and pt remained in sinus tach even when afebrile and asleep.
# SIADH: Pt noted to have SIADH likely related to NSCLC versus chemo adverse effect.
# Vomiting and dysphagia: Temporally related to radiation.
Pt instead had barium swallow whcih did not show stricture.
Pt felt to have likely radiation esophagitis, he was started on sodium and baking soda as instructed by rad onc as well as magic mouth wash and symptoms subsided.
# GIB: Pt had guiac positive stool on week 2 of hospitalization and was started on protonix.
# hematuria: Pt noted to have hematuria, which may have been [**1-6**] prior foley placement.
#Anemia: Has had melena, hemoptysis and chemo during this admission.
# Insomnia: pt experienced insomnia and was started on trazadone and mirtazapine at night.
When heparin gtt discontinued, pt encouraged to use pneumoboot on the leg that did not have a DVT, however, pt refused pneumoboot on multiple occasions.
Initially pt and family were certain that they wanted aggressive treatment for his cancer and any potential complications of his cancer.
However, as his hospitalization progressed both pt and his wife began to have mixed feelings about the length of his stay and the discomfort he was enduring by being hospitalized far from his family.

You were found to have blood clots in your lung.
You were then found to have clots in your leg and you had a filter placed in your vein to prevent any more clots going to your lungs.
This resulted in a large amount of swelling in your legs which can You were also treated for pneumonia that was caused by your lung mass.
You were continued on your chemotherapy treatment and also recieved a small amount of radiation therapy.
