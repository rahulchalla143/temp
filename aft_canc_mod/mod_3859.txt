CT head ([**2133-6-30**]) hypodensities c/w old infarct/contusion in right and left frontal lobes.
right parietal hypodensity likely secondary to subacute (but old) infarct.
no enhancing lesions seen, however, MRI is more sensitive in evaluation for subtle lesions and in patient with HIV, MRI would be recommended if there is any clinical concern .
MRI L spine ([**2133-6-30**]): no abnormal enhancement within epidural space or within thecal sac.
small amount of free fluid within pelvis and likely fibroid uterus.
MRI head w/ and w/o contrast ([**2133-6-30**]) No areas of abnormally restricted diffusion to suggest acute brain ischemia.
No areas of abnormal enhancement within brain parenchyma.
High FLAIR signal in the right parieto-occipital and right frontal regions likely relate to prior infarct or contusion.
CXR([**2133-6-30**]) Multiple small nodules in the right lung consistent with the findings on prior CT. No definite evidence of pneumonia.
Mild cardiomegaly with mild CHF.
Small left-sided pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Mild cardiomegaly.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20 percent).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (>12mmHg).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 yo female w/PMHx sx for HIV, hepatitis C who p/w episode with legs buckling under her, as well as lethargy.
Patient was found to have UTI as well as old infarct on MRI.
Etiology of patient's lethargy and fall was likely from infection with inability to take good pos, and resultant dehydration.
Her EKG did not show any acute ST-T changes, and overnight telemetry showed no events.
She was noted to have an old infarct on MRI, but no new infarcts to explain her initial lethargy.
Patient was noted to have severe iron deficiency anemia, and was started on iron replacement and given a transfusion of pRBC, during which she developed pleuritic chest pain and tachycardia.
An EKG was performed, which showed sinus tachycardia.
Her CXR did not show any acute changes, and patient was given nitroglycerin with symptomatic relief.
She had cardiac enzymes and a D-dimer checked as well, with negative cardiac enzymes but with an elevated D-dimer.
Patient was scheduled for a CTA at the time to assess for pulmonary embolus.
She then proceeded to finish her blood transfusion without incident.
Prior to receiving the CT scan, patient developed acute SOB, tachypnea with RR 30s and tachycardia again, and a code was called due to suspicion for massive pulmonary embolus.
She was found to be tachycardic, tachypneic and diaphoretic, still complaining of L sided pleuritic chest pain.
CTA did not show evidence for a PE so the heparin gtt was stopped.
Her CT chest showed ground glass opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema, and the etiology of the acute episode of chest pain was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
An echo was obtained and showed an EF of 20% with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but she had no prior echos here for comparison.
Patient's dilated cardiomyopathy was thought secondary to cocaine use and HIV.
A cardiology consult was called to evaluate if patient would need acute inpatient workup for ischemia as a cause of her cardiomyopathy.
Cardiology consult recommended that patient undergo an evaluation for endocarditis given her degree of valvular regurgitation.
She had a TEE performed, which was negative for vegetation.
Decision was made not to start her on standing furosemide and aldactone as well given her low systolic blood pressures.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was maintained on telemetry with no events seen.
Patient was also foudn to have a positive urinalysis, and was started on levofloxacin given her history of enterococcal UTIs.
She had a renal ultrasound performed with persistent hydronephrosis.
Patient's pain was controlled with her home doses of amitryptylline, morphine, and trazadone.
Patient had lung nodules seen as well on CT scan, which were stable from prior imaging.
Iron deficiency anemia 2.
Urinary tract infection with nephrolithiasis 3.
Dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 20% 5.
Flash pulmonary edema 6.
Severe mitral valve and aortic valve regurgitation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, increased confusion, or fevers or chills, call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
You were admitted with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection and weakness.
You were also found to have a low blood count, and you were given a unit of blood.
You had an episode of chest pain, thought to be related to acute fluid buildup in your lungs.
You were found to have severe heart failure on echocardiogram.
You were started on medications for heart failure.
You have iron deficiency anemia, and will need an outpatient colonoscopy.
At that time, she can add other medications for your heart failure including Lasix and Aldactone, which we did not add as an inpatient due to concerns for your blood pressure.
