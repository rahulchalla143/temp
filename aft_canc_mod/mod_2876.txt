In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47yo with metastatic RCC who has failed sugen and most recently 1 month of sorafenib therapy that was discontinued [**12-4**] [**3-16**] increased left sided pain, constipation, general fatigue.
Over the last week, he has also developed increasing abdominal girth which he attributes to gas, and bilateral LE edema, which he has never had before.
CT in ED showed increased interval increase in size of metastatic lesions, R sided pleural effusion, and new ascites.
He was tapped 2.5L of serosanguinous fluid, exudative by light's criteria, likely malignant.
Did have some diarrhea o/n yesterday, likely [**3-16**] kayexylate and po contrast.
Past Medical History: metastatic RCC as noted in Oncologic History CAD s/p CABG [**2091**] HTN hypercholesterolemia DVTs   Social History: lives upstairs from mother, divorced with 3 children, girlfriend [**Name (NI) 1258**], + [**Name2 (NI) **], no etoh   Family History: nc  Physical Exam:  Afebrile o/n now T: 96.2 BP: 109/85 HR: 110, RR:20 02 sat 96% on 4L Gen: tired, ill appearing man, breathing comfortably, no retractions, able to speak full sentences.
R side clear without wheezes, crackles Abd:: Soft, moderately distended, no focal TTP, though has some gneralized discomfort when palpated.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally, R>L edema, no calf tenderness.
CT torso: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a markedly enlarged left pleural effusion occupying the majority of the left hemithorax, causing shift of the mediastinum rightward.
This limits detailed evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is compression of the distal left pulmonary arterial vasculature given large left pleural effusion.
There is a large pericardial lymph node, increased in size compared to prior study, today measuring 21 mm in shortest axis, previously 8 mm.
Surrounding the pancreas are multiple metastatic lesions also encasing the celiac axis, SMA and periportal regions which overall appears increased in size and extent compared to [**2102-10-30**].
There is no overt demonstration of vascular occlusion.
The left adrenal lesion previously seen today appears slightly larger in size and little more hypovascular, which could represent necrotic change of a metastatic lesion.
The left retroperitoneal aggregate of soft tissue density consistent with metastatic mass is similar in size today, measuring 81 x 53 mm, previously 86 x 45 mm.
The retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extending along the course of nearly the entire aorta is also similar in size.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder wall is slightly thickened, as demonstrated on prior studies.
BONE WINDOWS: There are mixed sclerotic and lytic changes seen within the L4 vertebral body, similar in appearance compared to prior study, concerning for metastatic focus.
There are no new suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Large dense left pleural effusion with significant rightward shift of the mediastinum.
Interval progression of metastatic disease manifested by a large left pleural effusion and new-onset ascites.
Overall, slight interval increase in size of soft tissue metastatic lesions within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Bilateral LE, no signs of DVT  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 47 yo male who was initially admitted with worsening shortness of breath.
He was first admitted to medical services and then after repeat thoracentesis and pleuradesis on [**12-14**] with prolonged hypotension he was transferred to the ICU.
ICU Issues included hypotension, hyponatremia and thrombocytopenia as well as management of pleural effusions.
Hypotension was managed with fluid boluses, hyponatremia improved with saline.
Thrombocytopenia was thought secondary to splenic squestration as HIT antibodies were negative.
Despite medical management, the patient continued to have dyspnea as well as poor liver and kidney function and worsening of mental status.
Given that the CT done on [**12-11**] showed significant worsening of his metastatic disease and that the patient had failed multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, the decision was made to direct the care towards comfort after discussions with family and the patient.
