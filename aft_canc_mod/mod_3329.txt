He began to have dysphagia with solid food in approximately [**2100-1-28**], which progressed over the next 6 months.
EGD and biopsy on [**2100-9-22**] revealed adenocarcinoma arising at the GE junction without Barrett's metaplasia seen, and  possible adenocarcinoma versus contamination at 25 cm.
Chest CAT scan on [**2100-9-27**] revealed mild fullness of the distal esophagus, scattered nonspecific small lymph nodes, and a  punctate nonspecific right lung nodule.
Hepatic steatosis and diverticulosis were also noted.
PET CT scan on [**2100-9-30**] revealed a small focal hypermetabolic area in the distal third of  the esophagus, without CT correlation with the biopsy of the area  of concern for malignancy.
There was  no definite evidence of extra esophageal FDG-avid metastatic disease.
Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma at the GE junction, infiltrating the muscularis propria, however, the esophagus at 25  cm was consistent with a squamous epithelium only.
Past Medical History:  - Barrett's esophagus, esophageal ca s/p chemo/radiation.
- Left lower extremity injury in [**2062**] with resultant left lower extremity foot drop with a brace.
He had a bypass at the femoral artery and a bone graft.

He owns his own business with his wife.

- F: CAD s/p MI & CABG, currently in good health in his 90s.
Physical Exam: GENERAL:  The patient is a well-appearing male in no acute distress.
Pharynx with small scattered ulcerations.
Lymphatics:  There is no appreciable cervical, supraclavicular, Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There is no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Wet-to-dry dressing lateral abdominal incision.
Minimal erythema without purulent drainage.
Neuro:  There are no focal abnormalities.
The bilateral chest tubes are shown, the right one terminating in the right apex and the left tip being located in the left posterior pleural space.
Small left apical and lateral pneumothorax is demonstrated with possible basal component.
Small amount of left subcutaneous emphysema is noted.

Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is new, could be due to atelectasis.
Pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged.
Distal atelectasis in the left base is stable.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity.
Compared to prior study of [**2101-1-15**], this could be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
pt s/p esophagectomy with hypoactive bs and no return of bowel function.
also with inc burping INDICATION: 56-year-old man status post esophagectomy with hypoactive bowel sounds and no return of bowel function, evaluate for abnormal gas patterns.
SUPINE AND UPRIGHT ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPHS: Dilated gas-filled large bowel to the level of the mid descending [**Year (4 digits) 499**].
IMPRESSION: Dilated large bowel consistent with ileus; if clinical situation worsens recommend a followup radiograph to evaluate for possibility of obstruction.

[**First Name (STitle) 5432**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]     Brief Hospital Course: Patient underwent an esophagectomy, pyloroplasty, and reduction of incisional hernia with primary repair on [**2101-1-10**] as planned (for operative details, please see dictated report).
He was subsequently transitioned to PCA Dilaudid and eventually transitioned to PO meds once he was able to take POs.
He did not have any adverse cardiac events during his hospitalization.
He did complain of chest pain after extubation.
EKG was normal without acute changes and he had negative cardiac enzymes x3.
This pain subsequently improved and was thought to be [**1-29**] surgery.
CXR was stable and showed no pneumothorax.
Left chest tube was removed on POD4 without complications.
GI: Post-operative course was complicated by post op ileus and slow return of bowel function.
He had a bedside grape-juice swallow on POD 7 that did not show leak into neck JP drain.
He is discharged to rehab facility on tube feeds and a full liquid diet  ID: Patient developed erythema with purulent drainage from midline wound.
Subsequent examinations revealed erythema overlying the hernia repair left of midline.
U/S examination showed a thick-walled fluid collection within the subcutaneous tissues measuring 7x3 cm.
This wound was opened and revealed old hematoma with no obvious purulence.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] on Thursday, [**1-27**] with a barium swallow evaluation.
