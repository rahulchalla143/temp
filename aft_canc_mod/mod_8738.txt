Admission Date:  [**2191-1-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-5-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: s/p cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. intubation and extubation 2. cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation 3. central venous line placement 4. cardiac catheterization with stenting   History of Present Illness: 71-year-old male with past medical history of stage IV prostate cancer with 2 syncopal episodes in the last 2 weeks who presents with cardiac arrest.
Starting today, the patient was shoveling snow/snowblowing when he developed chest discomfort.
He did not report radiation, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, other pain to his family.
He underwent CPR for PEA arrest.
A rhythm check showed VFib rhythm and the patient was shocked.
With sedation the patient developed hypotension with MAPs in 50s and levophed was intiated (through "sterilly" placed femoral TLC).
At other times, atrial fibrillation/flutter rhythm with rapid ventricular response developed with diffuse ST depressions.
This was thought to be demand ischemia in response to a rapid rate.
All EKG were evaluated by interventional cardiology attending and were not thought to be consistent with acute myocardial ischemia.
There was some concern for pulmonary embolus.
Due to this TTE was done which by report showed mildly dilated RA and RV with normokinesis and normal left ventricular function.
The patient had a CT Torso with contrast which was negative for pulmonary embolus or other acute event.
CT head was done which was negative for acute process as well although could not rule out mets.
+ non-productive cough x3 months, lightheadedness.
- chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, PND, orthopnea or other problems.

Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
Slight tenderness to palpation of chest wall.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
MICRO: [**2191-1-6**] MRSA SCREEN No MRSA isolated.
[**2191-1-6**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING INPATIENT [**2191-1-6**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING INPATIENT [**2191-1-6**] URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL:  NO GROWTH.
No intracranial hemorrhage or fractures.
Nonspecific left parietal and basal ganglia hypodensities, likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
If the patient has focal neurologic signs or suspicion for intracranial metastases, however, MR can be obtained.
Moderate ethmoid sinusitis and pharyngeal secretions secondary to intubation.
No pulmonary embolus or acute traumatic injury.
Diffuse atherosclerosis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (in some views the id infero-lateral wall appears hypokinetic).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Minor atelectasis has developed at both lung bases.
Cardiac cath [**1-7**]: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 103551**] to proximal ramus intermedius FINAL REPORT PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 71-year-old male with past medical history of stage IV prostate cancer with 2 syncopal episodes in the last 2 weeks who presented s/p cardiac arrest, likely [**1-12**] ACS.
s/p cardiac arrest: Initial evaluation did not suggest STEMI, PE, effusion, structural heart disease or infection.
He was evaluated by post cardiac arrest team and decided not to be a cooling protocol candidate due to purposeful movements.
CEs were elevated and pt was started on full dose ASA, heparin gtt.
Pt tolerated procedure well with no recurrence of chest pain.
ECHO with good EF, no free wall abnormalities.
He remained chest pain free on the floors.
Hypotension: Likely related to cardiac arrest.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable.
Intubation: Secondary to PEA/VFib arrest.
No complications.
No evidence of liver lesions on imaging.
# Atrial fibrillation: First episode, in setting of acute illness.
CHADS2 score 0 (no CHF, HTN, <75yo, no DM or stroke).
He was monitored on telemetry without events.
Stage IV Prostate Cancer: No active issues.
# Anemia: Hct on initial presentation was 25.
Most likely secondary to known cancer.
Hemolysis labs negative.
