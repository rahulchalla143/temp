[**2164-4-3**]: Esophageal stent placed for possible fistula (fluid draining from esophagus seen on EGD [**2164-4-2**], but no tract found on EGD or bronchoscopy).

No new lesion.
[**2164-6-20**]: CT abd/pelvis: No metastatic disease seen.
[**2164-7-13**]: CT chest: Improvement of bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggests resolving infectious/inflammatory process.
New GGO in right upper lobe likely represents aspiration pneumonia.
Stable 6 mm right upper lobe and 7 mm left  upper lobe nodules.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] is a 60 yo male with history of metastatic esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy but with recurrence as well as brain metastasis, recurrent pneumonias and thromboemboli on lovenox who presented with esophageal stent migration into right lung and septic shock with afib RVR.
His initial presentation of hypotension with elevated lactate and relative increased work of breathing was due to sepsis from the stent migration.
His esophageal stent had likely eroded through the cancer since it had been seen to be quite necrotic on prior EGDs.
Unfortunately, it eroded into his right lung and pleural space creating collapse of lung parenchyma on that side and hypoxemic respiratory distress.
There was significant air leak (4+) on the chest tube, thought to be due to the open esophagus.
He required vasopressors as well to maintain his [**Known lastname **] pressure and an esmolol drip for afib with RVR.
They did not feel that there would be any worthwhile outcome from surgery given the scope of the procedure it would require and the baseline metastatic cancer.
