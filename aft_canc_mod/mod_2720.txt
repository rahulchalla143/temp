Right apical opacity may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or pulmonary infarct.
There is no effusion on this frontal view.
Right apical opacity is a non-specific finding, may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia, or pulmonary infarct.
Right infrahilar consolidation slightly worse today compared to [**10-6**].
Right suprahilar mass noted.
Right pleural effusion is small if any.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old male with multiple medical problems including diastolic HF, [**Name (NI) 7792**], CVA in [**5-20**] with baseline L hemiparesis and limited vocalization, Alzheimer's dementia, and hx of multiple resistant infections, recent admission in [**8-21**] with similar presentation, admitted from nursing home with fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia found to have sepsis/PNA.
Hypovolemic Shock and Sepsis:He was originally admitted to the medical ICU with leukocytosis and tachypnea.
He was noted to have a right apical infiltrate and enlarging right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray.
This was most consistent with post-obstructive vs. health-care associated pneumonia.
Given his history of MRSA and ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, he was started on vancomycin and meropenen for a total course of 14 days.
Despite this, he became hypotensive and Levophed was started.
A few hours after Levophed initiation, he became bradycardic with a heart rate in the 30s and systolic blood pressure noted to be as low as 65.
Hypernatremia: He had persistent hypernatremia after fluid resuscitation and antibiotic initiation.
He was felt to be hypovolemic and his hypernatremia improved with free water boluses via his G tube and D5W administration.
Leukocytosis: He had a leukocytosis on admission that was likely secondary to pneumonia.
He had stool cultures negative for C Diff.
He also has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer which did not appear infected but was considered as a possible cause of his leukocytosis.
His leukocytosis has trended down consistent with resolving infection in the setting of successful antibiotic therapy.
These were initially held due to hypotension on presentation.
CAD: EKG initially showed TWI in V4.
The heparin drip was discontinued in the MICU as it was not believed he had an ischemic event.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommons  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia Sepsis  Secondary Diagnosis: Chronic diastolic heart failure Alzheimer's dementia Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure Hypernatremia Hyperglycemia Hypertension Bradycardia   Discharge Condition: Good, vital signs stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to difficulty breathing and low blood pressure.
You were found to have a pneumonia and you are being treated with IV antibiotics.
You also have a mass in your lung that could have caused you to have pneumonia.
Changes to your medications: ADDED vancomycin 1000 mg IV twice daily through [**2191-10-19**] ADDED meropenem 500 mg IV four times daily through [**2191-10-19**]  If you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, worsening cough, or fevers greater than 101 degrees, you should call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.
If you have abdominal pain or constipation, you should call your primary care doctor.
