He has also noticed a growing mass on his left side, numbness & weakness on the right during the same time period.
He also reports weight loss, night-sweats, voice changes and difficulty swallowing.
His family brought him to [**Hospital3 10960**] where he had a CT-scan that showed a nasopharyngeal mass invading the skull base.
Past Medical History: EtOHism on probation for 4th DUI HTN COPD  Social History: Lives in a half-way house.
- Tobacco:  40year history of smoking unfiltered cigarettes - Alcohol:  Extensive hx- no use in last 5 months - Illicits:  None  Family History: -Father died of lung cancer  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.5, BP: 90/54, P: 84, R: 13 O2: 100% on MV General: Intubated.
Per ENT exam: "NC: copious clear mucous without purulence, no significant septal deviation, + turbinate hypertrophy, unable to pass scope through NC to examine NP as obstructed OC/OP: Poor dentition, tongue and FOM soft, soft palate with symmetric elevation, no obvious masses or lesions Larynx/HP: Could not assess [**12-26**] inability to pass scope Neck:  Large, non-tender L > R nodes, FROM, supple Lungs: Clear to auscultation anterolaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Arousable, follows commands.
Nasopharyngeal mass with probable associated skull base invasion though this would be better assessed with cross-sectional imaging.
Assessment for esophageal compression would be more effective with contrast fluoroscopy or cross-sectional imaging.
4-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule as seen on [**2181-6-3**].
Persistent bilateral small pleural effusions.
Small perihepatic ascites.
Nonobstructing 2mm left renal stone.
[**2181-6-4**] - Tissue immunophenotyping: Non-specific T cell dominant profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
[**2181-6-3**] - Right sided UE US: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
Massive soft tissue infiltrate at nasopharynx and nasal passage, extending superiorly to the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses.
Otherwise, no acute intracranial process.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or definite vascular territorial infarction.
There is extensive infiltration and bone destruction of the central skull base by a large mass centered in the nasopharynx, as above.
However, though the ill-defined and vaguely hyperattenuating material in the region of the left aspect of the prepontine cistern likely represents a "tongue" of tumor, thrombus at the left vertebrobasilar junction is not excluded.
There is no definite evidence of infarction at the pontomedullary junction.
[**2181-6-2**] - Nasopharyngeal mass pathology: Invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, moderately to poorly-differentiated.
There were no immediate complications and the patient was extubated in the PACU.
It was also noted that he had some agonal breathing.
About twenty minutes later he was unresponsive and apneic.
Anesthesia gave him two doses of narcan with no response.
He was sent to CT scan but became agitated so he was lightly sedated again with propofol.
CT head was negative for acute bleed.
Pathology of the biopsy showed keratanizing invasive squamous carcinoma.
It was also to involve the placement of a PEG for nutritional support given the anticipated side effects of treatment, including severe mucositis.
A multidisciplinary meeting was helding involving care providers and health care professionals from Medical-Oncology, Radiation-Oncology, Ethics, Case Management, Social Work, Ethics, and Nursing, as well as the patient's son, who is his proxy.
# PEG tube placement: Prior to the interdisciplinary meeting discussed above, the patient was scheduled for placement of PEG in preparation for chemoradiation therapy.
Interventional radiology attempted to place the PEG twice, but were unsuccessful due anatomic abnormalities prohibiting sufficient exposure of the stomach radiographically.
The patient recovered without complication from both attempts.
# Hypercalcemia: The patient developed hypercalcemia during this hospitalization, peaking at 11.0.
The hypercalcemia was managed with lasix diuresis and NS IVF repletion and ultimately with pamidronate.
# Leukocytosis: Admitted with a leukocytosis concerning for an infection; was treated empirically with Vancomycin and Unasyn in the setting of his nasopharyngeal biopsy.
# COPD: Was found to have intermittent bouts of wheezing on admission but not on any home medications for COPD.
# Right hand swelling: Developed mild right hand swelling following the infusion of vancomycin.
Right upper extremity ultrasound was NEGATIVE for thrombosis.
# Diarrhea: Had several bouts of diarrhea early in the hospital course.
Medications on Admission: none  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: cooliage house  Discharge Diagnosis: Invasive squamous carcinoma of the neck   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were hospitalized for a new neck mass found to be invading the base of your skull at an outside hospital.
You underwent a biopsy in the hospital performed by our ENT specialists; the biopsy showed that you had an invasive squamous cancer.
Radiation oncology and medical oncology made recommendations for very aggressive treatment of your tumor, with a small but definitive possibility of cure without recurrence, and with the expectation of significant treatment side effects, including irritation of your mouth and throat to the point requiring a feeding tube to maintain your nutrition.
