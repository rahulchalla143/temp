Admission Date:  [**2127-4-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-5-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-12-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ativan / Prochlorperazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: DLBCL, inability to keep up with transfusion requirements  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma status post six cycles of R-CHOP between [**6-/2126**] and [**10/2126**], status post five cycles of high-dose methotrexate and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate, and s/p 3 cycles of ESHAP chemotherapy and two doses of intra-thecal ARA-C.  His last cycle of ESHAP was [**Date range (1) 79455**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is well known to the [**Known lastname 3242**] service, his last admission being from [**2127-2-23**] to [**2127-4-25**] and complicated by fever and neutropenia secondary to clostridium difficile infection (stool C. diff negative prior to discharge), typhlitis, VRE urosepsis, upper and lower extremity DVTs, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
He was discharged to [**Hospital3 105**] and returns because of a falling platelet count and inability to keep up with his transfusion needs while maintaining anticoagulation with lovenox.
Since discharge the patient reports that he has had difficulties with episodes of dry heaves and was started on marinol the day prior to transfer.
He has also had some mild abdominal discomfort intermittantly that improves somewhat with eating.
He has had a few episodes of diarrhea as well.
He states he was placed on oxygen 2 days ago, but has not had any shortness of breath.
In addition, he notes no upper respiratory symptoms (runny nose, sore throat), cough, reflux, shortness of breath, chest pain, blood per rectum, dysuria, rashes, arthralgias.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented to an outside hospital in [**6-25**] with a 30-pound weight loss over the prior 6 months.
He was worked up and found to have a soft tissue mass in the cardiac ventricles involving the myocardium and extending into the interatrial septum.
He was also noted to have multiple pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions, a pericardial effusion, large bilateral adrenal masses, and diffuse soft tissue masses involving both kidneys.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by the development of tamponade physiology, and the patient ultimately underwent a pericardial window.
A renal biopsy on [**2127-7-23**] confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Stage 4B), and a pericardial biopsy on [**2127-7-25**] also was consistent with large B-cell lymphoma.
CT abdomen on [**2-11**] showed evidence of new liver lesion concerning for disease recurrence.
CT guided liver biopsy on [**2127-2-26**] was positive and on further evaluation was found to have involvement in his heart, chest wall and retropharyngeal space.
No discrete hepatic lesions were noted on CT abdomen on [**3-21**].
Flow cytometry showed indefinite evidence of lymphomatous involvement of the CSF.
He was followed by neuro-oncology in-house who recommended no further IT ARA-C and to follow his neurologic symptoms clinically, and to re-refer him back to his outpatient neuro-oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79456**] if he had any worsening confusion or neurologic symptoms.
Given that he had received 3 x IT chemo and 3 cycles of high-dose Ara-C, it was felt to be sufficient for CNS prophylaxis.

There is interval development of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
There is also increased opacity in the right upper lung that is seen in addition to the known cavity demonstrated on [**2127-3-21**] chest CT. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present that appears to be increased since the prior study.
Overall unchanged appearance of right upper extremity DVT extending through the subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins.
Occlusive thrombus in the basilic vein, not well visualized previously, but likely unchanged.
Persistent respiratory variability of the left subclavian vein indicates the SVC remains patent, without occlusive central propagation of right subclavian thrombus.
Possible biatrial enlargement.
Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V4.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes diffusely.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-4-25**] there is no diagnostic interval change.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including left ventriculomegaly.
The lung volumes are unchanged, slightly decreased compared to more remote prior studies.
The known severe emphysema with bibasilar opacities, pleural effusion and known right upper lung consolidation appears to be unchanged as well.
There is no evidence of interval development of pulmonary edema.
[**2127-5-6**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-4**], there is again evidence of chronic pulmonary disease with bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes at the bases.
New moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
There is no new consolidation within the lung parenchyma to suggest presence of pneumonia.
Unchanged appearance of right upper lobe consolidation with central cavitation.
Previously identified left chest wall mass and cardiac masses are not visualized on the current study, consistent with continued interval improvement in lymphoma.

Unfortunately, no lateral view has been obtained which could identify the presence or absence of remaining pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior sinuses in this patient in standing position.
Significant interval decrease of bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple small focal nodularities, consistent with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance, predominantly in the right lung but also seen in the left lung, concerning for infectious process.
Unchanged surgical sutures and apical scar in the right lung.
No acute changes in the abdomen compared to the CT torso performed 10 days ago.
Unchanged gallstones without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Slightly prominent pancreatic duct.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p multiple cycles of treatment, most recently his third cycle of ESHAP chemotherapy with a history of upper and lower extremity DVTs, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and recent C. difficile colitis who was admitted with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and inability to keep up with his transfusion requirements.
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma - The patient is s/p multiple cycles of chemotherapy, including several cycles of intrathecal chemotherapy that were felt sufficient for CNS prophylaxis.
The patient had a CT scan on [**2127-5-7**] that demonstrated a dramatic remission of his formerly bulky disease.
Repeat CT scan on [**5-18**] failed to identify recurrent lymphoma.
However, when the patient developed hypercalcemia and delerium it was felt that his Diffuse large B cell lymphoma had likely recurred.
In discussion, with the patient and his family, it was decided not to pursue additional diagnostic studies such as a lumbar puncture or a bone marrow biopsy.
#  The patient had multiple other medical issues that required treatment during this admission.
He was neutropenic secondary to his most recent ESHAP therapy.
He was placed on neutropenic precautions while he remained neutropenic.
The patient had a history of RUE DVT and was noted to have a thrombus in his right iliac artery aneurysm.
During this hospitalization, he completed treatment for his previously documented Afib and his symptoms resolved.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR - The patient has a history of intermittant afib with RVR, particularly in response to lasix.
After a couple of days in the hospital the patient had a rising oxygen requirement and was given several small doses of lasix to remove extra fluid from his multiple transfusions.
On [**5-10**] the patient was in afib with rvr, assymptomatic and hemodynamically stable, for multiple hours and did not respond to 50 mg PO metoprolol.
Pt had sustained afib with RVR and required transfer to ICU on [**5-26**].
Chest x-rays and CT-chest showed no evidence of infection, but did show new bilateral pleural effusions compared to imaging from his prior admission in addition to his previously known lung disease.
Pulmonology was consulted Repeat x-ray showed improvement in the patient's effusions, and his oxygen requirement resolved on its own, likely a delayed effect of diuresis, requiring several days for fluid shifts to transpire.
The patient also underwent pulmonary function testing due to concern for emphysema based on CT scan and prior smoking history and need for such testing if stem cell transplant were to be considereed.
The patient was noted to have a very low DLCO.
It was felt that this was most likely multifactorial, arising from emphysema, underlying lung disease and scar from his prior pneumonia, and possibly chronic thromboembolic disease given his known DVTs.
