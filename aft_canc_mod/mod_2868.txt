HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with Human Immunodeficiency Virus and hypertension, who presents to the Emergency [**Hospital1 **] by [**Location (un) 86**] Emergency Medical Services.
Of note, the patient describes dark stools that he has experienced for several days.
He denies other ingestions of objects including razor blades or other toxins.
In the Emergency [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to be tachycardic and found to have a hematocrit of 14.8.
He received two liters of intravenous fluid; nasogastric lavage was positive for small amounts of coffee grounds which cleared after 100 cc.
Serum toxicology was negative, but a urine toxicology was positive for cocaine.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 15501**] [**Name (STitle) 48530**], which was significant for a Grade II esophagitis in the lower [**12-9**] of the esophagus.
There were also linear erosions in the antrum and the stomach body compatible with nasogastric tube trauma.
There was erythema and edema in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis; could not exclude an underlying ulcer.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus:  CD4 count and viral load unknown.
History of suicidal ideation/suicide attempts in the past.
GoLYTELY preparation for a colonoscopy.
In general, the patient is an ill appearing male in no acute distress.
The patient notes his last auditory hallucination was several days prior to this admission.
He does note visual hallucinations in the past.
Neck with no lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
Skin:  Chronic changes in the lower extremities.
Abdomen supine and erect demonstrated no evidence of free air, ileus or obstruction.
PA and lateral chest film on [**2186-5-2**], demonstrated mild cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature without evidence of failure.
No consolidation or pulmonary nodules.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
CT scan of the head without contrast on [**2186-5-4**], demonstrated no intra or extra axial hemorrhage, with no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There were no enhancing lesions identified after contrast administration.
There was mild prominence of the soft tissues of the nasopharynx.
IMPRESSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, hypertension and depression, who was noted to have a hematocrit of 15 after a suicide attempt with Dapsone, pyrimethamine, and a history concerning for gastrointestinal bleed.
[**Name2 (NI) **]L BLEED:  The patient's symptoms were consistent with an upper gastrointestinal bleed but an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was noted to be negative as above.
The findings of gastritis and esophagitis would not account for his level of blood loss.
Iron studies were added on to the patient's admission labs and were not significant for an iron deficiency anemia.
The patient's reticulocyte index was inappropriate and some of his anemia may relate to chronic decreased production.
Also noted were multiple non-bleeding diverticula with small opening seen in the transverse colon and ascending colon.
Other flat 1 to 3 centimeter verrucous appearing lesions were seen in the rectum and sigmoid, of which cold forceps biopsies were performed for Histology and the biopsy results were pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient had a small bowel follow through on the day of discharge, which was preliminarily unrevealing.
The CT scan was negative for any intracranial mass or bleeding.
His findings demonstrated some white matter changes, which was consistent with HIV leukoencephalopathy.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was also noted to have depression in his past but was not on any medications prior to this admission.
The likely etiology of his mental status fluctuations was related to his HIV leukoencephalopathy, psychosis, and depression.
There were no former records in the computer and a CD4 count and viral load were obtained.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
