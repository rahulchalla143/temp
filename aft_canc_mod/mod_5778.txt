Admission Date:  [**2169-3-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-3-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Hydrochlorothiazide / Codeine / Fluvastatin / Metrolotion  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Change in mental status, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 97172**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p MI, CHF (EF 50%), aortic stenosis (area 0.8cm2), dementia, MDS who was admitted on the afternoon of [**3-6**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with change in mental status.
EKG on admission with sinus tachycardia, RBBB, no ST or TW changes.
There was question of a pneumonia on CXR and Vanc/Levo were started empirically.
Overnight on [**3-7**], nursing became concerned due to increased ectopy on telemetry.
Check of vital signs at the time revealed hypoxia to 88% on 6L NC.
Her only complaint was back pain which had been present since admission.
CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema bilaterally with bilateral pleural effusions.
She notes right sided back pain which is stable from prior.
She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea or diaphoresis.
Review of symptoms is limited by patient's dementia.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: - Diverticulitis s/p colectomy - h/o c diff colitis - depression - myelodysplastic d/o - chf, EF 50%:  Echocardiogram done on [**2164-9-3**] revealing ejection fraction of 45 to 50%, mild global hypokinesis, more pronounced on the inferior and posterior segments.
Mild to moderate MR. - aortic stenosis, per report valve area of 0.8cm2 - h/o falls - CAD h/o MI - dementia - hyponatremia - Paroxysmal Afib   Social History: In nursing homes/rehab since colectomy in 3/[**2168**].
Sclera anicteric.
Left eye with yellow discharge.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Difficult to characterize secondary to breath sounds.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bibasilar crackles halfway up, +wheeze, no rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: Trace LE edema bilaterally.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is prominence of the pulmonary hila with central congestion, more apparent on the left.
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis along with anterior and anterolateral hypokinesis.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p MI, CHF w/ EF 45-50%, [**Hospital 90129**] transferred to CCU with respiratory distress, elevated troponins and ?STEMI vs. LV strain pattern with plan for medical management as patient is too high risk for catheterization.
1) Respiratory Distress: New oxygen requirement on presentation and increasing pulmonary edema on CXR.
EKG showed ST elevations in anterior leads.
These changes may be related to LV strain given likely LVH vs ischemic.
Patient was tachypneic on exam, question if there is some component of anxiety contributing to tachypnea.
Given EKG changes, CXR and elevated BNP on admission, patient is likely in decompensated heart failure due to infection +/- recent d/c of lasix and metoprolol.
Now appears to be dry by labs and exam so respiratory distress was likely a flash pulmonary edema but not total body volume up.
Pulmonary edema resolved on CXR - Surface echocardiogram->EF 30-35% with inferior and anterolateral hypo/akinesis.
- Initial "pneumonia" seen on CXR may have been pulmonary edema, however MRSA growing in [**3-7**] sputum but not present on repeat sputum gram stain, likely colonization given absence of fever elevated WBC and or clear infiltrate on CXR.
No signs of infection.
2) CAD/Ischemia: Developed ST elevations initially, possibly related to strain from tachycardia.
Given age and comorbidities, patient was too high risk for catheterization.
3) Rhythm: Originally sinus tach, likely compensation decrease CO. Then had episode of a.fib with RVR and hypotension at 8pm [**2169-3-7**].
No surgery or valvuloplasty .
