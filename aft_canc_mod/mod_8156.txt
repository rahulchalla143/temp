He had a screening colonoscopy on [**4-15**] showing two 3 to 4 mm distal sigmoid polyps with diverticulosis of the sigmoid, ascending, and descending colon.
He had electric prostate biopsy due to evidence of prostate nodule and elevated PSA on [**2144-4-16**], which was uneventful.
On [**4-17**] he had evidence of lower gastrointestinal bleeding with bright red blood per rectum after the prostate biopsy with hemodynamic instability requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Tamponade with Foley balloon transiently seized bleeding, however, repeat attempt at anticoagulation led to a repeat bleed with a drop in his hematocrit of 44 to 34, he became hypotensive requiring 3 units of red blood cells, 1 unit of fresh frozen platelets, vitamin K and repeat placement of Foley and the rectum for tamponade of bleeding.
He underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**4-20**] to assess his etiology of bleeding, which revealed diverticulosis of the ascending colon and transverse colon, blood throughout the rectum and sigmoid colon and a heaped up ulcerated mucosa in the rectum, which was presumed to be the site of the prostate biopsy.
There was no visible vessel noted, however, given that this was site was in the site of the source of bleeding it was injected with epinephrine and cauterized.
Prostate nodule with a PSA jump from 2.3 to 6.5.
Mechanical aortic valve replacement in [**2134**] due to bicuspid aortic valve.
Right knee surgery.
Pelvic fracture in [**2142**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  His father ahs bipolar disorder and his mother had a brain tumor.

He had no further bleeding from this time until the time of discharge and passed two soft bowel movements without evidence of blood prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of hypertension controlled on Hydrochlorothiazide and Moexapril.
At the time of his gastrointestinal bleed and hypertension these medications were held.
He also has a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement secondary to a bicuspid aortic valve.
He was admitted for prostate biopsy and a screening colonoscopy due to the need for anticoagulation with heparin while holding Coumadin.
Renal:  The patient is noted to have a baseline creatinine ranging from 1.1 to 1.3, likely secondary to some renal insufficiency from his hypertension.
On [**4-24**] he was noted to have a bump in his creatinine to 1.7 most likely secondary to his gastrointestinal bleed and hypotension.
Hematologic:  As mentioned above after his lower gastrointestinal bleed he received a total of 3 units of red blood cells, one unit of fresh frozen platelets and vitamin K on admission.
Anemia due to blood loss.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Hyperplastic colonic polyps.
Renal insufficiency.
