Admission Date:  [**2120-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-12-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**] Chief Complaint: Right hip pain, unable to walk  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Partial Hip Replacement   History of Present Illness: 85 yo M with superficial bladder ca (dx [**2103**]) - stage IV, mets to bone - R femur and s/p excision of R sided lung cancer [**2118**] who presents with acute on chronic worsening of R hip pain felt to be secondary to R femur metastatic lesion.
He has tried Advil 600mg prn leg pain as well as Tylenol #3 (taken infrequently) at home.
His pain in minimal while lying in bed, though he likens standing and walking to "giving birth" because the pain is so bad.
Nephrostomy tubes are functioning well without bleeding.
No SOB or chest pain.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 94340**] is an 84-year-old male with a history of superficial bladder cancer originally diagnosed in [**2103**] and treated with local resection and intravesicular BCG/IFN in [**2114**] and [**2115**].
In [**2-/2118**], TURBT revealed papillary urothelial carcinoma, largely low grade with focal high grade features and lamina propria invasion in his prostatic urethra.
Restaging TURBT on [**2118-6-17**] revealed two small recurrences of papillary urothelial carcinoma, low-grade, with a focus of invasion into the lamina propria but muscularis was free of tumor.
Retrograde pyelograms demonstrated severe bilateral hydronephrosis and he was in acute renal failure with Cr of 2.2, up from 1.3.
Ureteral obstruction was thought to be due to locally advanced bladder cancer.
The right nephrostomy tube was removed on [**2119-2-16**] but on [**2119-4-4**], he developed bilateral hydronephrosis again and a left nephrostomy tube was placed.
He has had multiple complications, including ureteral obstruction, hydronephrosis, renal failure (Cr of 2.8 in [**6-14**]) and hematuria felt to be due to radiation cystitis.
Cystoscopy in [**1-14**] showed one tumor on the right bladder wall which was fulgurated.
Follow-up cystoscopy in [**3-/2120**] was normal, but in [**2120-6-7**] he had several areas of infiltrative papillary urothelial carcinoma.
In [**2120-9-7**] pelvic imaging disclosed stage IV bladder cancer and a destructive bone lesion of the right lesser trochanter, for which he received radiation, completed on [**2120-10-9**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # Superficial bladder cancer (see OMR for details) # Squamous cell cancer RLL s/p excision [**11-13**] # Adenocarcinoma in RML s/p excision [**11-13**] # Lingular nodule, ?
bronchoalveolar carcinoma # CAD # s/p pacemaker # hypercholesterolemia # s/p bilateral inguinal hernia repairs # Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline Cr ~2.0 (stage III CKD)   Social History: Lives with his wife.
HEART: Distant heart sounds, regular, with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
No crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No hepatosplenomegaly., pressure ulcers b/l ischial tub.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to his mid calves bilaterally.
Skin is flaky, warm NEURO: Pain with abduction of R leg, no tenderness to palpation.
XRay: There is no evidence of a new fracture.
Patient has known osteolytic lesion in the proximal shaft of the femur and large osteolytic lesion in the lesser trochanter; this is unchanged from prior as does degenerative changes in the right hip joint.
Destructive mass involving the right lesser trochanter and lateral subtrochanteric femur has progressed.
There is high risk for pathologic fracture if this has not already occurred.
New lesions within the left pubic symphysis and right sacrum.
The right sacral lesion abuts the S3 nerve root.
Slight progression of disease within the pelvis.
New right sacral lesion with soft tissue component, most likely lytic metastasis of rapid progression.
L3 left pedicle blastic lesion , overall unchanged since [**2118**].
Extensive degenerative disease of the lumbar spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 94340**] is an 85-year-old male with invasive bladder cancer and lung cancer, who is not pursuing aggressive treatment who presents with severe, worsening leg pain secondary to lytic lesion in prox femur.
Hip Fracture: A hip X-ray was done that showed lytic lesion of femur and subsequent CT demonstrated extensive cortical destruction of right femur and of left pubic symphysis.
Echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function without LVOT gradient as well as mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
During the procedure he was hypotensive and had EBL of about 1000cc.
There was concern that the patient may have focal neurological deficits on right side, but those resolved quickly as the patient became more oriented.
Post-operatively, the patient was noted to have poor UOP with hematuria that resolved.
The patient also had leukocytosis to WBC of 30, likely post-procedural stress and trended downward.
The patient remained alert, oriented, and hemodynamically stable and was transferred back to the floor.
# UTI - Urine cultures significant for MRSA infection sensitive to vanc and bactrim.
# Acute on Chronic RF - Patient had an elevated Cr and low UO through nephrostomy tube.
Nephrology was consulted who felt that his ARF was likely post-obstructive, but could not rule out an element of AIN given pos eos seen on smear.
Post-operatively, patient was found to have hematuria (as stated above), that resolved.
His Cr elevated again, thought to be secondary to blood loss from surgery and ATN.
