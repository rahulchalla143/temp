He has become progressively fatigued as his leg swelling and abdominal distension have progressed.
His abdomen has felt uncomfortable due to the distention, but he denies any actual abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.
He also denies any hematemasis, hematochezia but may have had some melena.
He denies any frank fevers but has "felt warm" with some chills as well.
Aside from him being fatigued, his family has not noticed his mental status to be altered; his daughter denies him being confused or disoriented.
He has noted a decreaed appetite and has had a poor PO intake.
Past Medical History: - chronic hepatitis B infection (precore mutation positive, HBeAb positive, HBeAg negative) with cirrhosis with known grade II varices on EGD in [**11/2188**] - chronic thrombocytopenia, presumably from cirrhosis - recent hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis with "innumerable nodules" on liver MRI with elevated alpha-fetoprotein - positive PPD   Social History: Smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per day.
Family History: His wife has a history of hepatitis B infection; otherwise noncontributory.

Studies: CXR AP ([**2190-4-20**]): There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which appears new when compared to the prior study.
Findings may be due to increased perihepatic fluid, but a subpulmonic effusion cannot be completely excluded.
No pneumothorax is identified.
CXR [**4-21**]: interval development of edema .
MRI Abdomen ([**2190-4-7**]): There is decrease in signal intensity of the liver diffusely on the in-phase images, compatible with presence of siderotic nodules.
The liver is diffusely heterogeneous in signal intensity.
There is nodularity of the liver contour compatible with chronic liver disease.
There are several nodules within the liver, which have increased signal intensity on the T1-weighted images, pre-contrast and decreased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images.
On the arterial phase images, there is no definite enhancement, however, minimal peripheral enhancement of the lesions is identified post-contrast and there also appears to be new wash-out of contrast from many of the lesions.
The liver appears to have innumerable nodules throughout, which appear bigger and more discrete compared to the previous study and also show new wash-out and increased heterogeneity in the later phases post-contrast compared with the previous study.
These findings are concerning for diffuse hepatoma (HCC).
There are also tiny cysts within the liver such as an 8-mm cyst in segment VIII and a tiny cyst in the dome.
There is a linear area of increased enhancement seen in segment VI of the liver subcapsularly.
This region shows minimal increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images and probably represents fibrosis with also some shunting between the portal vein and hepatic vein without significant change.
There is minimal ascites.
Of note, he had Guaiac positive brown stool on rectal exam.
First night in the hospital, he became dyspneic after IVF fluids and albumin; a chest xray: mod fluid overload.
Pt developed a new O2 requirment.
Serial Hct trending down to 22 and then, the following morning, he had a maroon, jelly-consistency stool.
BP drifted down to SBP 80s-90s, with mild tachycardia 80s-> 105.
In the MICU, EGD showed blood in stomach, stigmata of variceal bleeding, one varices banded, duodenal ulcers one of which looked ulcerated and suspicious for malignancy.
Paracentesis attempted but not successful.
Pt's renal function deteriorated, consistent with hepatorenal syndrome, despite volume challenge with albumin, normal saline and blood products.
