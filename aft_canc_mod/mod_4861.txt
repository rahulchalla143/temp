Admission Date:  [**2173-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-11-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-9-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status/fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 y/o male with PMH significant for plasma cell leukemia/multiple myeloma dx in [**5-/2173**] after presenting with diffuse bony pain in the setting of a recent MVA.
His treatment has been complicated by invasive aspergillosis treated with TIW ambisome and a recent hospital admission on [**8-23**] for febrile neutropenia.
He presented to the ED on [**10-17**] with change in mental status/lethargy along with chills/fever.
He was noted to have an elevated lactate and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for presumptive sepsis along with hypercalcemia.
He had been in his usual state of health prior to this episode and denied any sick contacts, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea, HA, weakness, or palpatations.
His mental status changes were thought to be more due to his hypercalcemia than his infection but he has failed to normalize completely despite correction of his hypercalcemia w/ pamidronate and treatment of his infection w/ IVF, vanco, and ambisome.
He was called out to the floor where he was started on cefepime for febrile neutropenia.
He responded to a 1L bolus but then quickly became hypotensive again.
During his stay in the ICU, his major problems included infection for which he was continued on his antibiotics (vanco, ambisome, flagyl, acyclovir, adn , coagulopathy requiring product transfusion, continued hypotension complicated by significant peripheral edema, and continued diffuse bony pain.
He remained well from a respiratory standpoint.
Onc Hx: Pt presented in [**2173-5-19**] for evaluation of diffuse bone pain, at which time he was noted to have an increased BUN, creatinine, and was hypercalcemic.
Bone marrow bx was done on [**6-9**], showing extensive involvement by plasma cell myeloma with 80-90% cellularity.
A skeletal survey at that time showed probable multiple myeloma, and a Beta 2 microglobulin level was 22.0.
He has a IgG kappa monoclonal protein, and presented to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] with stage IIIB myeloma/plasma cell leukemia.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 2.
Multiple Myeloma: dx [**5-23**], treated w/ velcade; c/b pancytopenia 3. hx of invasive aspergillosis dx in [**7-/2173**], on ongoing TIW ambisome treatment 4. baseline creatinine since diagnosis 1.8-2.3 5.
Hypertension 6.
Hyperlipidemia 7. s/p MVA 8. s/p tonsillectomy at age 19  Social History: Retired, previously worked as a florist.
No family history of cancer or heart disease.
Physical Exam: 97.9, 102/50, 67, 19, 95% Gen: Sedated minimally arousable AA man in NAD HEENT: proptosis, pupils small, MMM, no LAD Chest: Crackles at the bases CV: RRR, S1/S2 intact, 2/6 systolic murmur at apex Abd: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended Ext: 2+ DP, no edema, diffuse pain w/ any movement .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**10-17**]: No mass effect or hemorrhage.
Multiple lytic areas in the skull likely secondary to patient's history of multiple myeloma.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**10-18**]: 1) Multiple new diffuse nodular opacities, with a dominant right upper lobe cavitary lesion.
Many previously evident areas of consolidation have improved with evolving cystic cavities.
New lung findings most likely represent recurrence of known invasive aspergillosis.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4) Diffuse osseous metastases, unchanged.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no chocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR: [**10-19**] New generalized, moderately severe interstitial abnormality accompanied by increasing mediastinal vascular caliber and interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is due to pulmonary edema, which could be cardiac or volume related or response to transfusion or even drug administration.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Cavitary consolidation in the right lung apex, which developed between [**9-14**] and [**10-17**] is partially obscured by the generalized lung process, and there may be another focus of new consolidation in the right mid lung laterally.
tach at 101; nl axis; no ST t-wave changes.

Change in mental status: On arrival to hospital, change in mental status thought to be due to hypotension/sepsis given that mental status improved markedly with fluids resuscitation.
Pt also w/ marked hypocalcemia on labs that was corrected.
Pt was then found to be altered with a normal BP after fluid resuscitation so an LP was done which demonstrated plasma cells in the CSF.
The patient's family was informed of the diagnosis of CNS plasma cell leukemia and decided to make the patient CMO.
Sepsis: Pt was admitted with hypotension and AMS.
His initial blood cx grew out MRSA and he was started on vancomycin/cefepime and his line was removed.
His LP and urine did not show signs of infection.
He was given ambisome for CT findings demonstrating likely worsening invasive aspergillosis and acyclovir for a history of disseminated zoster.
After the LP showed CNS involvement of his plasma cell leukemia, the patient was made CMO.
LP showed CNS involvement of his disease in the CNS.
His pain was well controlled with a lidocaine patch and prn morphine.
