Admission Date:  [**2169-2-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-3-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-4-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  SICU  ID:  A 74 year old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs with obstruction and transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for evaluation for a palliative stent, after persistent respiratory failure at an outside hospital with failure to wean.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 74 year old male with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lungs, embolic cerebrovascular accident history with residual left-sided paresis, atrial fibrillation, status post failed cardioversion times three, left ventricular hypertrophy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2169-1-22**] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decompensated on the floor and was in severe respiratory distress and was intubated on [**2169-1-26**].
He had failure to wean since [**1-26**].
Workup at the outside hospital included a spiral computerized tomographic angiography which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed bilateral mid bronchus mass that was narrowing the airways.
An echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 65%, biatrial enlargement, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and a small effusion.
The patient was also treated for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and Clostridium difficile there.
On arrival to this hospital the patient was complaining of being hungry, no other complaints, no shortness of breath, no chest pain, no abdominal pain and no nausea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs diagnosed in [**2161**], status post two cycles of IL2 and status post nephrectomy, embolic cerebrovascular accident with residual left hemiparesis, atrial fibrillation status post unsuccessful cardioversion times three on Lovenox for anticoagulation, left ventricular hypertrophy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, nasal polyps, thyroid disease not otherwise specified, adrenal nodules.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Dry mucosal membranes.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, no thyroid mass, no jugulovenous distension.
Heart:  Regularly irregular, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no organomegaly.
Extremities:  Right PICC line, dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally equal, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Right side [**5-24**] arm and leg strength.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  A 74 year old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs with right brachial and pulmonary artery compromised by tumor, transferred for evaluation for palliative set by the Interventional Pulmonary Team here and to be primary oncologist.
The patient has been intubated for three weeks with respiratory failure and failure to wean prior to transfer here.
Respiratory failure - We thought that the most likely cause of the respiratory failure was mucous plugging plus airway compression.
He was started on a sepsis protocol with an initial lactate of 4.9, white count increased from 13.4 to 16.5 and the patient was in atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
The patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response felt to be secondary to lung disease plus sepsis plus hypoxemia.
On [**2-20**], he progressed into supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy versus monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, slipping into and out of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
Echocardiogram was done on [**2-23**], which showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 70 to 80%, 1+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ aortic regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion.
6 hours, after which his atrial fibrillation remained under reasonable control with less rapid ventricular response and no more episodes of supraventricular tachycardia versus ventricular tachycardia and Electrophysiology felt that he was stable to go to the Operating Room.
The operative procedure was delayed until [**3-1**], secondary to anesthesia and timing issues.
He then proceeded to put out copious amounts of secretions and with initial attempts to wean the ventilator after the procedure were futile and he was kept on pressure support ventilation 15 and 5 with good ventilation at that time.
Clostridium difficile colitis - On Flagyl, started [**2-8**].
Renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to lungs with extrinsic airway compression.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Status post cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis.
4 hours prn anxiety  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.
