He did well immediately post procedure and was discharged home the next day, but since then has noticed gradually increasing distension of his abdomen and shortness of breath.
He reports a baseline soreness in his abdomen but no new or increasing abdominal pain.
His appetite is slightly decreased but he denies any pain, nausea, or vomiting with PO intake.
His shortness of breath has increased progressively, to the point where he is now very short of breath with climbing 2 flights of stairs, but denies any chest pain or orthopnea.
He denies any fevers but does report feeling more frequently cold.
By report there no delayed phase filling of the liver, and there was thrombosis of the R portal vein and portal vein proper extending to the confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins.
Hypertension Depression Prostate CA  PSH: R hemicolectomy/wedge liver bx [**5-5**] Radical prostatectomy [**2152**] for prostate CA   Social History: Works as a salesman, residing in [**State 3908**].
Physical Exam: VS: 98.6  79  125/86  16  98% on RA Gen: Well appearing, in no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, oral mucosa pink/moist Neck: Supple, no LAD or JVD Chest: Mild crackles b/l lung bases Heart: S1S2 RRR no M/G/R Abdomen: Soft, distended, nontender, hypoactive muffled bowel sounds, + fluid wave, well healed midline scar.
New interval filling defect encompassing and expanding the right portal vein, main portal vein, extending partially into the left portal vein consistent with acute thrombus.
A large filling defect also now occludes the superior mesenteric vein nearly completely.
A partially occlusive defect is noted to extend for several cm into the splenic vein.
New moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Multiple irregular low-attenuation areas within the liver, consistent in appearance of liver metastasis, predominantly within the right lobe.
Several foci within the left lobe are too small to characterize.
[**3-1**] Portal vein thrombolysis:  Portal vein thrombosis with possible cavernous transformation of portal vein.
[**3-2**] Portal venogram: Followup of TPA portal venogram demonstrated persistent occlusion of the portal vein.
Removal of vascular sheath after embolization of tract with Gelfoam.
[**3-4**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.
New elevation of the right lung base could be due in part to subpulmonic effusion or more likely elevated hemidiaphragm perhaps reflecting subdiaphragmatic mass effect.
This is accompanied by increasing moderate atelectasis at the right lung base.
There is no pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax  [**3-4**] DOPPLER EXAMINATION OF THE LIVER: The portal vein appears dilated and is filled with echogenic material.
Portal vein thrombosis involving the main, right and left portal veins.
Allowing for differences in technique this appears not significantly changed from prior CT examination of [**2162-2-28**].
There is again seen elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which may be due to subpulmonic effusion versus eventration however, this is unchanged.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
The patient had low urine output on transfer, and was bolused; urine electrolytes were obtained (FeNA 0%), and urine output was closely monitored.
The patient began experiencing some wheezing and shortness of breath, for which he received nebulized treatments, and serial chest x-rays were performed.
The chest x-rays showed some atelectasis, and the patient was encouraged to use incentive spirometry and to get out of bed and ambulate.
He is advised to continue with leg elevation and wearing TEDS hose as tolerated, no further diuresis is recommended at this time.
Also of note Mr [**Known lastname 22782**] has been found to be HIT positive and has been advised of this heparin allergy and that he is to never receive Heparin products.
