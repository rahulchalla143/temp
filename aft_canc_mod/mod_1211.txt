CXR shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates indicative of pneumonitis but no indication for hypoxemia.
He was given lasix with unknown UO (nurses did not monitor), levo/flagyl x 1, and he stabilized to 100% NRB without improvement.
During these episodes, patient had sinus tach to 120s, which was not treated.
He has a history of extensive PEs but has been compliant with lovenox 100 per day.
He was admitted today with hematuria, abdominal pain, repeated vomiting.
Patient has a history of hematuria and has ureteral invasion of his tumor on prior imaging.
He was seen in epi clinic on [**3-5**] for gross hematuria in which his lovenox was decreased from 120 to 100 mg qd and he was given levaquin for treatment of a UTI based off of a positive UA.
The pt noticed a slight decrease in his hematuria and was feeling relatively well when he began to have repeat gross hematuria with clots beginning last pm at 8:30.
This was associated with a dull, achy pain in the suprapubic area.
He initially refused to go to the ED for evaluation; however he was up all night with urinary urge and gross hematuria that he presented for evalution early this am.
He was given mag citrate and fleets enema for large amt of stool seen on KUB and had one small BM.
On the Reata site, states no overt side effects to the drug in administration for 28 days to baboons, but no side effects noted in humans.
Past Medical History: PAST ONC HISTORY: The patient initially presented in [**2125**] for evaluation of mild hematuria when a CT abd showed thickening of the sigmoid colon.
A sigmoidoscopy showed a large non-bleeding mass and he underwent sigmoid colectomy which showed moderately differentiated ulcerated adenocarcinoma reaching the serosa with [**5-18**] lymph nodes were positive for metastasis.
Since his initial presentation of stage III colon CA, he has progressed to metastatic disease to the lung, liver, abd wall, ureter.
He is status post 5-FU, irinotecan, and Avastin with disease progression.
He was recently placed on a phase 1 Reata clinical trial, which has since been held due to progression of disease.

KUB [**3-16**]:  Large amount of stool within the large bowel with no evidence of obstruction.
CXR [**3-16**]:  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
Again noted are innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with the patient's history of metastatic colon cancer.
No additional focal consolidations or effusions are seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
Moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis in the right kidney with associated parenchymal thinning, not significantly changed from previous CT dated [**2131-1-26**].
Small amount of echogenic material within the bladder which is consistent with patient's history of intraluminal bladder hematoma.
Large mass identified within the region of the bladder likely corresponding to patient's known anterior abdominal wall metastatic disease.
Ureteral mass [**3-19**]: path pending .
Once in the bladder we were immediately confronted by a large space occupying bladder clot occupying likely [**4-15**] of the bladder, which was evacuated.
A large papillary frondular mass emanating from the right ureteral orifice of approximately 3 x 2 cm, high grade appearing, was resected and sent for pathology.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Extensive metastatic disease including innumerable pulmonary nodules, pleural mass, hepatic lesions, omental and abdominal wall disease.
The pleural disease and hepatic metastasis appears increased from prior examination.
Tiny non-obstructing stone in the left proximal ureter.
Irregularity of the bladder is likely related to the prior day's cystoscopy.
Patchy basilar opacities, best appreciated within the right lower lobe are suspicious for areas of aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis given clinical history.
Metastatic burden appears stable/ 3.
Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with metastatic colon CA and h/o PE presents who presented with hematuria and abdominal pain.
The CBI and a more aggressive bowel regimen were continued on the night of admission when the pt developed emesis and subsequently desated down to the upper 70s on RA.
An EKG was performed without any ischemic changes.
There was also a question of whether or not capillary leak could be a side effect from the pt's clinical trial drug, Reata; however, no literature suggesting this was found.
Based off of CXR, it was most likely that the pt's hypoxia was secondary to aspiration PNA vs. an aspiration pneumonitis.
While in the MICU, it was noted that the pt continued to have gross hematuria and large blood clots in spite of continuous bladder irrigation.
Renal was consulted who felt that the cause of his ARF was most likely post-renal in nature given his known h/o a R ureteral mass and ongoing hematuria.
Urology took the pt for cystoscopy in which a large blood clot occupying [**4-15**] of the bladder was evacuated and a large, high grade appearing R ureteral mass was biopsied and resected.
Lovenox was titrated up from 40 to a treatment dose of 80 mg SQ qdaily without any increase in hematruia or Hct drop.
Of note, the pt had two seperate urinary void trials without success prior to d/c (bladder scan with 450 cc, 400 cc respectively).
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Name (STitle) **] for further oncologic care.
During the hospital course, Reata was d/c'd given demonstrated progession of disease .
Chlorpromazine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H PRN () as needed for hiccups.
