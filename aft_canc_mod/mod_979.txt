He also saw his PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 22343**] with complaint of decreased appetite and 20 pound weight loss over the last two months.
When questioned, he also notes having a metallic taste in his mouth, pruritis, difficulty sleeping, and "fogginess" of his mental status.
On arrival to the ER the pt was found to have peaked T waves on his EKG and a potassium of 7.0, for which he received calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and kayexelate 30mg x 2 with no response.
He was mildly tachycardic to the 90s-110s.
at present he reports feeling dyspneic only, a little bit better than when he arrived.

This findings, in the absence of other major/minor criteria for plasma cell myeloma, are consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).

Brief Hospital Course: 78yo man with h/o DMII, HTN, MGUS presents with new onset ARF on CRI with critically high lab values as well as acidemia to 6.94 and hypothermia to 33 degrees celsius.
# ARF on CRI: Pt has many possible etiologies for this.
Initially it seemed most likely transformation of his MGUS to MM with resultant renal failure, although Heme/onc was consulted and with results of IgG and spep/upep, this seemed unlikely.
Additional etiologies arose once the patient was found to have a hypocomplentemia of GN or possibly ATN.
Other possibilities include cardiac origin with poor forward flow although history does not suggest this and pt has maintained good BP throughout this hospitalization.
Possible progression of underlying HTN/DM nephropathy as pt has had a slow increase in his Cr since [**Month (only) 958**], however fast jump from 2.8 to 10.8 since [**Month (only) **] makes this seemed less likely.
Additionally, it was noted on imaging that the patient has a size discrepancy in his kidneys and an MRA showed moderate renal artery stenosis of right renal artery.
Throughout his stay in the MICU, the patient was emergently dialyzed and then received about 36 hours of CVVHD secondary to borderline blood pressures.
On transfer to the floor, pt had dialysis every T/Th/Sat.
As they continued to trend up, more concern for cholangitis.
Patient went to ERCP and was found to have a submucosal mass at the ampulla and brushings were taken.
#Gastritis- During this hospitalization, pt found to have guaic positive stools.
During the ERCP, an endoscopy was performed and gastritis was found.
# coagulopathy - when patient was admitted, he had several days of PTT>150 for unclear reasons.
Thought that perhaps this was secondary to DIC as PT/INR were also elevated, but DIC labs were wnl on serial checks over the course of 5 days.
# Anemia- in the setting of bilateral groin hematomas and right sided adductor compartment bleed, seen on CT, secondary to emergent attempts at HD catheter placement (eventually placed in the RIJ).
# elevated cardiac enzymes: EKG with peaked T waves but no ischemic changes.
Likely troponin elevated in setting of decreased clearance with ARF, however it peaked at 2.2 s/p dialysis for unclear reasons as [**Name (NI) **] showed EF>55% with normal LV function.
Was initially beta blocked and on aspirin but in the setting of acute bleed and hypotension requiring pressors transiently, these were d/c'd.
# DMII: given renal failure held oral hypoglycemics.
Pt with very elevated FS on floor after receiving 4 L of D5 as well as D50 for hypekalemia.
# HTN: pt has h/o htn but after HD has been relatively hypotensive.
Acute on chronic renal failure on HD 2.
Ampullary Cancer 3.
Gastritis with melanotic stools 4.
Demand ischemia  Secondary 1.
HTN   Discharge Condition: HD stable and afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute on chronic renal failure and started dialysis.
Biopsy was obtained at that time and showed adenocarcinoma of the ampulla.
