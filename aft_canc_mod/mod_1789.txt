Was hypertensive at HD yesterday and sent to ED.
Pt had CT head showing periventricular hypodensity within R frontal matter called as subacute to chronic infarction.
She then was noted to have coffee ground emesis and had an NG tube placed which cleared with 750 cc's.
She is c/o discomfort from the NG tube, but denies all other symptoms.
Past Medical History: Diabetes with ESRD on HD Hypertension Dyslipidemia CAD s/p CABGx4 (LIMA-LAD,SVG-Diag,SVG-OM,SVG-PDA) [**2138-11-28**] Retinopathy Chronic kidney disease on HD Myelodysplastic syndrome PVD s/p R com Fem to [**Doctor Last Name **] BPG in '[**37**] and Left [**Name (NI) 1793**] PTA/Stent [**2140-7-7**] GERD Anemia [**1-3**] MDS and ESRD  Social History: -Lives with husband and son.
2/6 systolic murmur on L sternal border.
Short P-R interval.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-6-5**] the rate is slightly faster and no longer bradycardic.
Non-specific repolarization abnormalities are somewhat more pronounced in the inferolateral leads.
No definite focal consolidation.
NC HEAD CT [**2142-7-5**]: No acute intracranial process.
Area of periventricular hypodensity within the right frontal white matter that may represent a site of subacute to chronic infarction.
BRAIN MRI [**2142-7-7**]:  There is an area of signal abnormality in the right basal ganglia which demonstrates high intense FLAIR signal as well as low FLAIR signal, indicative of a chronic right basal ganglia infarct.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
A few punctate foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter indicate mild changes of small vessel disease.
The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Echo [**2142-7-9**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
================================= MICROBIOLOGY: UCx [**2142-7-5**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
MRSA screen [**2142-7-6**]: negative  Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with PMH of 4v CABG ([**2137**]), PVD, ESRD on HD (TTSat) who presented to ED with complaints of HA x2 wks, nausea and emesis for x few days, hypertensive to 200's, and with reported coffee ground emesis in the ED.
Monitored in MICU for coffee ground emesis and for hypertensive emergency, stable on the floor.
Hypertensive emergency: patient with chronic hypertension, on 4 agents as an outpatient.
She also has ESRD on HD, likely from her diabetes and hypertension.
In the ED, her SBP was >200 with complaint of headache.
Noncontrast head CT was done to rule out a bleed and neuro was consulted.
Nonfocal neuro exam per note and head CT was negative for a bleed, though there was a question of subacute or chronic infarct.
She complained of headache on the floor, but her neuro status remained stable and she was treated with tylenol prn for headaches.
Coffee ground emesis: Patient first had an episode of coffee ground emesis in the ED, which cleared quickly with NGT and lavage.
GI did not want to scope the patient given her hypertensive emergency and no evidence of active bleeding at the time, as her coffee ground emesis cleared very quickly.
She was admitted to ICU for monitoring and had another episode of coffee ground emesis, which also cleared quickly with lavage.
# ?Infarct: In the ED, head CT was done to evaluate for bleed.
No acute bleed was shown, but it showed possible chronic/subacute infarct.
MRI brain w/o contrast was done to further evaluate, and only showed possible old infarct in basal ganglia without new or subacute infarct.
CTA of neck and head was not done as patient still makes urine and renal thought additional injury with large contrast load would not be advisable.
Neuro recommended blood pressure of SBP>110 as pt does not have evidence of acute stroke, and TTE only showed moderately dilated L atrium, mild symmetric LV hypertrophy and normal global/regional systolic function without septal defect.
# ESRD on HD: ESRD likely due to diabetes and hypertension.
# EKG changes: She had some EKG changes on admission without corresponding symptoms and negative cardiac enzymes.
She was continued on tele given her continued hypertension and possibility of demand ischemia.
No further changes seen on tele.
# DM: On insulin at home with A1C of 5.4% on admission.
She was continued on home insulin dosing and diabetic diet.
12.oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 5 days.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypertensive emergency Secondary diagnosis: coffee ground emesis, likely from [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came into the hospital because of your high blood pressure.
You also had headache, nausea and vomiting, and in the emergency department, had some vomit with blood in it, which cleared quickly.
Your nausea and vomiting improved as well.
You had a scan of your head to rule out bleeding in the brain given your headache and high blood pressure.
The scan of your brain did not show any bleeding, but did show a possible old stroke.
