with no prior cardiac history, except for DOE, which may have been pulmonary in nature, underwent elective laparoscopy for a colon mass on [**2196-11-3**] at NEBH.
The patient also had lysis of adhesions, right colectomy, and cholecystectomy, along with abdominal hernia repair with fascia release and mesh placement.
On [**11-8**] afternoon, she complained of difficulty in breathing and diaphoresis.
She also states that she had some tightness in her chest.
The patient had EKG changes with T wave depressions and ST depressions and was then sent back to ICU.
She also had some transient hypotension last eve down to 80/40, which responded to 250 mL bolus NS x 2, 11pm trop 0.68, 5am today down to 0.47.
She continues with significant T wave depressions, but no further shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
Lung sounds are diminished with occasional audible wheezes, slight white sputum, few crackles this am which cleared with cough, cxr negative.
Large abdominal dressing and 2 JP drains along with abdominal binder, mepitel dressing to right chest, perhaps secondary to open sore of unclear etiology.
She currently denies any shortness of breath, diaphoresis, chest pain or discomfort.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Colon cancer 29/10 pos PPD with negative CXR PNA [**9-2**] UTI Severe COPD/ashtma Migraines Anxiety Depression s/p hernia repair, hysterectomy, and knee arthroscopy.
Sclera anicteric.
CARDIAC: S1, S2, no murmurs auscultated.
No femoral bruit at right groin insertion site.
Sitting up in chair eating breakfast HEENT: supple, no JVD CV: RRR, no M/R/G RESP: crackles bibasilar ABD: well approximated staples running midline from xyphoid to groin.
No swelling, drainage or signs of infection.
No sig pain around incision area.
Extremeties: right groin with no hematoma or sig ecchymosis.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the midventricular segments and akinesis of the apex.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CARDIAC CATH:  [**2196-11-9**] Left ventriculography: 1+ mitral regurgitation, LVEF=40%, extensive area of anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis LMCA: LAD: 30% mid LCx: no significant disease RCA: 40% mid Most consistent with Takotsubo syndrome.
Brief Hospital Course: # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization did not show significant coronary artery disease.
Venogram during catheterization showed characteristic apical ballooning, consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
30% occlusion of LAD mid and 40% of RCA mid.
# PUMP: Found to have likely Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with LVEF=40%, areas of hypokinesis.
The patient was encouraged to follow up with PCP outpatient regarding daily inhaler treatment, as she was thought to have poorly controlled COPD that would benefit from therapy.
# ABDOMINAL WOUND CARE:  s/p colectomy, cholecystectomy, lysis adhesion, hernia repair.

You also had some plaque in your arteries, so we recommend that you take one baby aspirin per day.
We also think that your breathing problems are not being treated fully right now.
You should follow up with your primary care provider in order to determine which combination of medications would best control your symptoms of difficulty in breathing.
