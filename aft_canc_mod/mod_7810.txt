biopsy mediastinal mass.
History of Present Illness: 69 yo M w HTN, Afib, DM, recent dysphagia and newly diagnosed mediastinal mass.
He recently underwent biopsy by IP 5d prior to admission and since has had worsening cough with productive yellow sputum, fevers to 104.5 and chills.
Also reports nasal congestion, slight SOB, sore throat, nausea and occasional vomiting.
Pt denied lightheadedness, dizziness .
CXR revealed bibasilar PNA and stable mediastinal mass.
Labs were significant for leukocytosis, acute kidney injury but normal lactate.
Given persistent hypotension into 80s-90s, pt admitted to ICU for furthur workup.
Vitals prior to transfer T98.4, HR82, BP90/46, RR23, O2100% on RA  Past Medical History: 1) HTN 2) Afib 3) DM 4) Gout 5) Dysphagia: differential diagnosis for his dysphagia includes esophageal cancer, metastatic cancer or local invasion to esophagus.
Large soft tissue mass centered in the posterior mediastinum directly adjacent to the mediastinal structures and compressing the esophagus, the differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, lung carcinoma (small-cell carcinoma) and GI stromal tumor.
Esophageal carcinoma is very unlikely.
FNA without malignant evidence, pathology pending.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: Poor airmovement, bibasilar crackles L>R.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
STUDIES: CXR: Bibasilar airspace opacities worrisome for infection or aspiration.
EKG: NSR at 77, slightly leftward axis, left atrial enlargement, partial RBBB, lateral concave <1mm ST elevations c/w early repolarization - pt symptomatic.
Nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the distal stomach but the tip is indistinct.
Right basal atelectasis stable.
More severe opacification at the left lung base also probably atelectasis grossly unchanged but incompletely imaged.
Upper mediastinal mass stable.
Slightly increased size of posterior mediastinal mass with stable appearance to satellite lesions including a nodule in the lingula.
Increased size of now moderate pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis.
Mediastinal mass: He had a history of progressive dysphagia with outpatient workup and biopsy with pathology pending at time of admission.
Mass had been growing quickly and was possibly limiting PO intake and also worsening respiratory distress.
On [**12-6**] path returned with findings suspicious for small cell lung carcinoma, but given necrotic sample, recommended further biopsy.
In the meantime, it was determined that the previous sample was sufficient for diagnosis of carcinoma.
Pt was then taken for intubation and rigid bronchoscopy with bronchial stenting then transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for oncology and radiation treatment.
Had ECHO showing no hemodynamic compromise of the mass.
CT head with contrast showed no ICH or abnormal enhancement.
Influenza testing was negative as were blood and urine cultures, although sputum cultures could not be read due to contamination with oropharyngeal organisms.
He had some deconditioning from the infection and lung cancer.
Acute Renal Failure: This was likely prerenal.
A Fib: He was found to be in atrial fibrillation and experienced episodic RVR.
