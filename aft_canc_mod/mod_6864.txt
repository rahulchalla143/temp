5 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule, in absence of risk factors, dedicated chest CT is recommended for followup at 12 months.
hypoxia was thought to be secondary to poor air movement due to vocal cord dysfunction and loss of trach.
Per patient's ENT doctor (Pieter Nordzig at [**Hospital1 2177**]), trach was placed in [**4-9**] for vocal dysfunction following intubation for respiratory failure.
Respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA.
Given lower extremity edema and mildly elevated BNP, patient was also given furosemide 80mg IV x1.
Treated for pneumonia in ED and continued on floor given productive cough and leukocytosis.
Pt also developed a diffuse reticular erythematous and pruritic rash on all 4 extremities, abd, and chest.
It was thought that the Levaquin may have been contributing to rash, in addition, there no infiltrate on CXR to treat, so it was stopped in the ICU.
Blood gas was drawn and showed acidosis with severe CO2 retention.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to a possible pneumonia, which was transiently treated with levofloxacin (started [**2185-9-26**]) however patient developed a rash and the levoquin was stopped.
Clinical scenario most consistent with hypervolemic hyponatremia.
Pt developed tachycardia thought to be [**3-5**] beta blocker withdrawal and thus restarted IV beta blocker.
