Volume overload.
Severe pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette have worsened since [**4-28**].
Borderline interstitial edema is present.
No pneumothorax.
Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet due to a goiter is longstanding problem, unchanged.
Healed bilateral rib fractures with overlying pleural thickening are also chronic.
Sinus rhythm with baseline artifact.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 y/o male with ESRD, COPD, CML who presented with dyspnea, relieved with hemodialysis secondary to volume overload.
Dyspnea -  Given that there was a rapid improvement after large volume dialysis as well as no signs of COPD exacerbation, his dyspnea was likely caused only by fluid overload.
Leukocytosis - appears to be at patient's baseline and likely seconary to CMML as documented previously.
In the absence of fever or any other localizing symptoms, did not culture.
He was dialyzed two consecutive days and had an excess of [**4-21**] L removed.
COPD - continue spiriva, adavir, and albuterol; no need for systemic steroids  CMML - Diagnosed 6 months ago, and the patient is not being treated at this time.
Persistently elevated WBC count likely due  to CMML.
