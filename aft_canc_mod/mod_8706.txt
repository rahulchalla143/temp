Esophageal cancer; status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure.
Blood loss anemia.
Volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman who had previously been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and had undergone chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy.
When the patient initially presented, it was with an upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2148-4-16**] which required 4 units of packed red blood cells.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15532**] esophagus with an 8-cm fungating distal esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The patient presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy for management of his esophageal cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   In terms of initial physical examination, the patient was in no acute distress.
There were no palpable lymph nodes in the neck in the supracervical or axillary region.
His calves were nontender, and he had no edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted on [**2148-8-26**] and underwent an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], during which he had an estimated blood loss of 800 cc.
Otherwise, there were no intraoperative complications.
Intraoperatively, there was a finding of tumor at the gastroesophageal junction and firm celiac nodes, but no other evidence of metastasis.
The patient had his epidural stopped, and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He was also given aggressive fluid hydration, as his blood pressure was thought to be secondary to his volume loss.
On postoperative day two, the patient developed some respiratory distress and was found to have a central venous pressure of 11.
He was treated with aggressive chest physical therapy and nebulizers treatment, but it was felt that this was likely secondary to volume overload as he was positive 7500 cc of fluid on postoperative day zero.
His chest x-ray showed some left lower lobe collapse and consolidation which was stable and an unchanged right lower lobe opacity.
By postoperative day four, the patient was otherwise clinically stable but continued to have some respiratory difficulties with a notable arterial blood gas of 7.4/45/125/29 and 2.
He subsequently underwent a barium swallow study which showed no abnormalities.
Notably, the patient did have occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation while in the Intensive Care Unit which were treated with intravenous Lopressor and did resolve.
By postoperative day nine, the patient was doing well and was without complaints.
