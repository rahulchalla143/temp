Past Surgical History: b/l shoulder arthroplasties Ankle surgery surgery for gynecomastia   Social History: Supportive wife and daughter.
There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with the clinical impression of some volume overload.
Intact midline sternal wires and prosthetic valve is in place.
Unremarkable-appearing ileocolonic anastomotic site with no peri-anastomotic fluid collection or significant inflammation.
Minimal peritoneal fluid and mesenteric stranding as expected.
Pockets of hematoma within the abdomen and lower pelvis left rectus sheath likely at prior port site as detailed above.
Mild perihepatic ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the inpatient unit after a laparoscopic right colectomy for removal of an colonic adenoma.
The patient complained of pain overnight despite management with Hydromorphone PCA.
On the morning of post-operative day one, the patient was found to have management reduced urine output of 10-12cc/hr and hypotension to 78/42.
An EKG and showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 88 which was his baseline rhythm.
Because of persistent hypotension, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient continued to have borderline blood pressure readings.
Because of recent anticoagulation, the appearance of the patients tissue during the case, a moderate amount of ecchymosis around the port sites of the original laparoscopic procedure and persistent hypotension the patient was taken back to the operating room on [**2149-9-23**] for exploratory laparoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy to view the anastomosis and lumen of the colon.
At this time the patient was distended but denied nausea and it was thought that the patient most likely had a post-operative ileus, he tolerated sips of clears.
Because of pancytopenia with a notable monocytosis oncology was consulted to comment on abnormal lab values and determined that the patient's anemia was most likely related to acute blood loss, thrombocytopenia related to possibly a stress reaction from acute illness, and leukopenia with monocytosis also likely a stress reaction.
