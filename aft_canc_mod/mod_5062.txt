Admission Date:  [**2187-10-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-5-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 61M PMH metastatic renal cell carcinoma was c/o increasing dyspnea and increasing abdominal girth/ascites beginning on [**2187-9-27**].
VNA noted that O2 sat was 70-80% on 3L NC and patient was increasingly dyspneic at rest; patient went to ER [**9-27**] for urgent paracentesis.
After undergoing emergent therapeutic paracentesis the patient intially felt significantly improved, with decreased dyspnea and improved energy.
There was concern for portal vein thrombosis vs hepatic congestion.
The patient had a bedside TTE which showed a moderate pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade.
On arrival to the floor, the patient states his SOB is "OK."  He complains of increased abdominal girth.
Past Medical History: -Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed in [**4-28**] on chest CT  for workup of chronic cough -Prior right medial cerebellar infarct (asymptomatic, seen on brain MRI) -Pulmonary Embolism s/p insertion of retrievable OptEase IVC filters in the right andleft IVCs (pt with duplicate IVC) on [**2187-7-15**] -HTN -Internal/external hemorrhoids -H/o ETOH abuse requiring hospitalization 28 years ago, no history of DTs  Social History: The patient lives with his wife and children in [**Location 72727**] [**State 350**].
Family History: Significant for maternal grandfather with rectal cancer.
No evidence of portal venous thrombosis.
Right liver lesion, stable in size, and consistent with a cyst on recent MRI.
The appearance of new internal vascularity is likely artifactual.
Second cystic liver lesion also stable from prior MRI, is more concerning for metastatic disease .
CXR: : Limited study demonstrating pulmonary edema with moderately large bilateral pleural effusions significantly worse since the [**6-/2187**] studies.
Underlying or progressive known metastatic renal cell carcinoma cannot be excluded in the presence of these findings .
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is left atrial diastolic collapse.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial and due to increasing pleural effusions, ascites, and moderate pericardial effusion.
Metastatic RCC: with either malignant effusions or effusions from [**Year (4 digits) 61468**].
Pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade.
