HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with multiple medical problems with the past medical history significant for gastric cancer status post resection with vagotomy, prostate cancer with likely bony metastasis, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, chronic anemia, questionable history of gastrointestinal bleeds with several esophagogastroduodenoscopies in the past showing Candidal esophagitis with nonbleeding fundal polyps, and dementia thought to be secondary to Alzheimer disease.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-30**], with a 30 pound weight loss over several months and acute and chronic mental-status decline and pneumonia.
He was treated for his pneumonia with Levaquin and then changed to Azithromycin and sent to Core for rehabilitation on [**2147-10-4**].
While there, the patient had continued treatment of pneumonia and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**10-16**], which showed esophagitis with nonbleeding fundal polyp.
He had been started on TPN for unknown number of days, which was being given through a PIC line, and on [**10-28**], grew out MRSA from blood and E. coli from urine.
On [**2147-11-4**], the patient was febrile to 102 degrees and repeat blood cultures at that time showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
The patient now presents to [**Hospital1 346**] with black-tarry stools, which have been going on for an unknown number of days at [**Hospital1 5042**].
There was no history of emesis or bright red blood per rectum.
EKG done at that time showed new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Prostate cancer likely bony metastasis.
Chronic anemia.
Question of history of GI bleed.
Recurrent aspiration pneumonias.
Atypical chest pain with a normal stress test in [**2145**].
Poor nutritional status.
Spinal column stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He has multiple pressure sores with some skin breakdown on his extremities and back.
HEENT:  Exam showed temporal muscle wasting.
There are no bruits.
There was no elevated JVP.
LUNGS:  Lungs are with wheezes or crackles anteriorly.
HEART:  Heart revealed irregularly irregular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was soft, nondistended and nontender.
There were no active bowel sounds.
Blood cultures at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**10-28**], grew out MRSA in two bottles.
Blood cultures at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**11-24**], had gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, as well as yeast, growing two separate sets of blood cultures.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on admission showed a left pleural effusion, question of basilar consolidation.
EKG:  The EKG showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 103 with left axis deviation.
There were no Q waves and no significant ST or T-wave changes.
The atrial fibrillation was new, as compared with [**2147-9-30**], which showed a sinus rhythm with APC.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with fungemia and bacteremia, as well as a question of aspiration pneumonia.
The Ceftazidime was discontinued on [**11-12**] as there was no evidence of gram-negative infection.
The blood cultures grew out E. coccus, which was sensitive to Vancomycin.
The patient had been complaining of headache and it came back negative for any evidence of abscess.
The patient's Flagyl was discontinued on [**11-13**], as there was no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and repeated stool samples were negative for C. difficile.
However, during the PIC line placement, the patient was noted to have clot in the right subclavian vein.
GI:  The patient was admitted with GI bleed with a decreased hematocrit and bright red blood per rectum, by report at [**Hospital1 5042**].
Until then, they felt that the GI bleeding should be treated conservatively with blood transfusions, as needed, as well as IV Protonix.
They had no desire to scope the patient given his unstable medical status.
A KUB was obtained on [**11-12**], as the patient had no bowel sounds, but it was negative for toxic megacolon.
The patient has been stable from a GI standpoint since then.
Until recently having a few episodes of bright red blood mixed with stool, starting on [**11-25**].
In addition, the patient has tested positive again for C. difficile on [**11-22**], and he has been restarted on Flagyl for this.
FEN:  The patient was very complicated regarding his nutritional status since admission and NG tube was attempted on admission, but unable to be placed, likely secondary to his poor anatomy, due to previous gastric resection.
In addition, his daughter was very reluctant to give the patient TPN based on his history of fungal infection.
The patient had been a very difficulty access problem, as he had several areas of cellulitis on his extremities.
However, they explained to the patient's daughter that he was still at high risk for aspiration.
At this time the sodium is going to be decreased in his TPN and a FENa is going to be measured to see if the patient may be volume depleted.
He did have one episode of CHF after receiving blood on [**2147-11-15**].
He also has had a few episodes of atypical chest pain.
He ruled out for MI on admission with negative enzymes.
Echocardiogram on [**2147-11-13**], showed no wall-motion abnormalities.
He had an episode of chest pain on [**2147-11-23**], which was felt to be likely musculoskeletal in origin, as the pain seemed to be increased with palpation.
Morphine for this, but has really no recurrences and has not required Morphine since that time.
RENAL:  The patient has no known history of any renal disease with his baseline creatinine being .7 to .9.
Therefore, FENa is going to be measured today to determine whether this is prerenal in origin versus some renal toxicity from the AmBisome.
SOCIAL:  There have been several meetings with the social workers throughout this [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, as his daughter has been extremely difficult to deal with as she wants to provide a lot of the nursing care to the patient herself.
She repeatedly does activities, which the nursing staff has asked her not to do, including, transporting the patient herself, feeding the patient when asked not to, rubbing unauthorized medications on the patient's skin, namely honey and vodka, suctioning the patient so forcefully that he either has hemoptysis or vomits secondary to her inducing a gag reflex and attempting to suction the patient with a Foley catheter in his nose, which resulted in epistaxis.
In addition, the patient still has no definite health-care proxy.
A head CT is already described, but negative for any acute intracranial pathology.
Splints were obtained for the patient's feet to help to prevent any contractures of the ankle.
He had a few episodes of decreased saturations, which were likely due to some aspiration, as well as his one episode of CHF as was already described.
Chest x-ray showed is difficult to determine as the patient is a poor inspiratory effort.
His most recent chest x-ray done on [**2147-11-23**], showed that there are still diffuse opacities bilaterally, which could represent aspiration or pneumonia, which is not significantly changed from admission.
In addition there are bilateral pleural effusions with the left side greater than the right associated with compressive atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Enterococcal bacteremia.
Poor nutritional status.
Chronic atypical chest pain.
