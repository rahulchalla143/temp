Cholangiocarcinoma found when CT scan [**9-27**] demonstrated a 2.4 x 3.2 cm diameter low attenuation mass surrounding the common duct, extending into the region of the pancreatic head and through the retroperitoneum down to the renal vein and encasing the proximal portal vein as well as the hepatic artery.
Pt found to have progression of pulmonary disease and chemo regimen was changed to second line of cisplatin/5FU [**4-28**].
Course complicated by thrush and fatigue.
Pt presented to ED with hematochezia and hematemesis with BRB.
Past Medical History: Onc history: Dx [**8-28**] with cholangiocarcinoma -- local extension including encasing the portal vein and hepatic artery, extending into the head of the pancreas and encircling the duodenum.

Delayed images demonstrated no opacification of the portal vein, suggesting occlusion of this vessel.
Note: The patient has been stable with no further bleeding over a 24 hour period.
Angiogram # 2 IMPRESSION: Selective arteriograms were performed in the celiac, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] without signs of active bleeding.
There is no flow within the GDA that was previously embolized with coils.
Marked interval increase in intra-abdominal and intrapelvic ascites with anasarca.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No evidence of free air.
Sigmoid colonic wall thickening could be suggestive of procto-sigmoiditis.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**6-2**]: IMPRESSION: Large amount of ascites in all four abdominal quadrants with marking of right lower quadrant for paracentesis to be performed by clinical staff.
Small pockets of ascites were identified in each quadrant with a moderate-sized pocket above the bladder.
IMPRESSION: Moderate ascites without adequate spot for paracentesis marking   Brief Hospital Course: 61M w/ primary sclerosing cholangitis diagnosed with cholongiocarcinoma who presented hematemsis and BRBPR.
Endoscopy saw a clot in the second portion of the duodenum, and during the procedure a large amount of bleeding began apparently out of the second part of the duodenum.
ERCP found a bleeding vessel in an ulcerated part of the tumor in the second part of the duodenum.
A repeat angio showed no clear target for embolization as the tumor was well-vascularized, so given that the patient was likely to rebleed and that the next bleed would be untreatable, the decision was made to make the patient CMO.
On the floor, his only complaint was his abdominal distension from his ascites.
This was drained for palliative purposes on [**6-2**] by paracentesis.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a very high chance of the bleeding vessel rebleeding and there is no medical intervention that can be done to alleviate it at this time.
His daily needs are minimal but when his bleeding starts again, he will likely need an NGT quickly for managment of bleeding as well as possible associated nausea/hematemesis.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe gastrointestinal bleed.
