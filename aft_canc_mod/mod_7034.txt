He notes that it was about this time that he began to have trouble walking, getting out of bed, and doing his daily activities.
In the last 4 weeks, he notes that his weakness and fatigue has gotten worse.
He reports significant amount of difficulty ambulatingm and cites episdoes of sinking to the floor and not being able to get up.
He also reports a new tremor, and headache.
He also reports urinary incontinence, mildly worse from the past, as he has a hx of prostate ca s/p brachytherapy.
He also notes a new subcutaenous nodule in his inner right thigh.
Resection of a primary melanoma from the posterior aspect of  his left upper arm [**2150**].
Recurrence of disease in the left supraclavicular lymph nodes  in 06/[**2163**].
One cycle of biochemotherapy in [**5-/2165**], interrupted due to development of pancreatitis and severe orthostatic hypotension.
Resection of bulky left supraclavicular lymph nodes by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**].
Resumption of DTIC, which resulted in stabilization of his lung metastases.
Resection of a right subscapular mass by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] and subsequent radiation therapy to this site.
Sutent given [**9-/2168**] through [**3-/2169**] and stopped because of development of subcutaneous metastases.
2. prostate cancer [**2162**] s/p seed implants c/b radiation proctitis 3. hypercholesterolemia 4. psoriasis s/p UV tx 5. pancreatitis secondary to chemo [**11-30**] s/p subtotal pancreatectomy 6. non tension ptx [**11-30**] 8. h/o PE and DVts 10y ago .
Social History: divorced, 4 kids, GF=HCP, GF x 34 yeras, retired- president of A and P food stores, h/o ETOH, sober x 34 years (AA),no tobacco   Family History: He has two brothers and two sisters.
One sister died of a gynecologic cancer.
None of the siblings or his children ever had a diagnosis of melanoma or other skin cancer.
Imaging: MRI Head [**2169-8-16**]: 1) Irregular enhancing mass of the right frontal lobe is associated with significant secondary mass effect and subfalcine herniation.
There are small foci of enhancement extending to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and T2 hyperintensity extending into the corpus callosum.
There is overlying leptomeningeal enhancement, which may represent tumor extension vs engorged vessels.
However, a glial tumor should be considered in the differential.
2) Round enhancing mass lesion of the right cerebellum with mild surrounding edema is consistent with metastatic disease.
There are areas of abnormal enhancement along the folia of cerebellum which might represent leptomeningeal seeding/engorged vessels.
3) Pathologically enlarged node of the right posterior cervical space which may represent metastasis.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: No significant interval change in size to right lower lobe pulmonary nodule, right infrahilar dominant mass, and mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy.
No new metastatic lesions identified.
Right atrial abnormality.
Possible left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2169-3-16**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
Minimal amount of nodular enhancement along the posteromedial aspect of the right frontal resection cavity which represents post-surgical changes.
Cerebellar mass and right cervical mass again visualized.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76yo M w/ a PMH of metastatic melanoma p/w FTT and generalized weakness, now found to have brain metastases and cerebral edema.
<br> # BRAIN MASSES: The patient presented with headache and generalized weakness.
He underwent brain MRI on the evening of admission and was found to have an irregular enhancing mass of the right frontal lobe measuring 32 x 32 mm in axial dimension with associated severe cerebral edema and 16 mm sub- falcine herniation.
He was also found to have a round enhancing lesion of the right cerebellum measures 18 x 16 mm.
These lesions were felt to be consistent with metastatic disease from his known diagnosis of melanoma.
On neurologic exam he was found to have evidence of diplopia, left sided facial weakness, left sided pronator drift, left sided upper and lower extremity motor weakness and difficulty with finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements bilaterally L>R.
He continued to have evidence of cerebellar dysfunction as manifested by difficulty with finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements.
He also continued to have a mild left sided facial droop.
<br> He underwent a right frontal craniotomy with excision of his frontal lesion on [**8-23**].
He tolerated the procedure well with no evidence of residual tumor on post-op MRI.
Preliminary path showed spindle cell tumor.
He was set up with an appointment in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic, where his cerebellar tumor will be addressed.
<br> # MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: The patient presented with mental status changes which he described as increased ability to "do anything."
It was felt that his presentation was likely secondary to his metastastic disease, specifically his large frontal lobe lesion with associated edema.
He had no localizing symptoms of infection.
<br> # MELANOMA: The patient reports a new subcutaneous mass on his thigh and possibly his neck which likely represent metastatic disease.
He has no been on treatment for the past several months and has known metastatic disease in his lung and subcutaneous tissue.
MRI of the brain performed on admission showed evidence of new lesions in the brain.
He underwent CT of the chest/abdomen and torso which showed evidence of a previously known pulmonary lesion but no knew lesions.
MRI of the spine to evaluate further for metastatic disease was deferred during his MICU course but may be considered during this hospitalization given that on presentation the patient noted some mild bowel incontinence (but in the setting of diarrhea).
He will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] as an outpatient to have his thigh lesion evaluated.
<br> # 2ND DEGREE HEART BLOCK: The patient has a history of Wenckebach phenomenon.
He was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
His was monitored on telemetry and did not have any concerning events.
<br> # ANEMIA: On admission the patient had evidence of a mild macrocytic anemia with an MCV of 101 and hematocrit of 37.3 which is approximately his baseline.
Reticulocyte count was 1.2 which is slightly decreased in the setting of anemia.
The etiology of his anemia is unclear.
<br> # PULMONARY EMBOLUS: The patient has a remote history of pulmonary embolus for which he is on coumadin.
It was felt that his acute renal failure was thus of prerenal etiology secondary to dehydration.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Charwell House  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic melanoma to brain  Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable.
