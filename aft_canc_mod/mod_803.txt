There is a large amount of associated edema extending into the white matter of the posterior frontal lobe and the occipital lobe.
There is associated compression of the frontal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle, and moderate to severe shift of the septum pellucidum, third ventricle, and other normally midline structures to the right.
In addition, there is a smaller, less than 1 cm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere, which also demonstrates somewhat irregular enhancement suggestive of partial necrosis.
There is a mild amount of edema associated with this mass.
There are foci of increased susceptibility in the left parietal masses, consistent with blood products; while this appearance would also be consistent with calcification, no calcification was seen on the head CT of the same day.
There is also a rim of increased susceptibility around the right cerebellar mass, also consistent with blood products.
There are multiple small foci of T2 signal hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally, without any associated mass effect or enhancement, consistent with chronic microvascular disease.
No signal abnormalities are present in the cortex overlying the left posterior frontal, parietal, and the occipital vasogenic edema.
In retrospect, the cortical thickening noted on the preceding CT scan was likely related to volume averaging artifact.
There are no areas of vascular stenosis or occlusion.
Left parietal and right cerebellar necrotic, hemorrhagic masses which are consistent with metastases.
Severe edema and moderate-to-severe shift of midline structures associated with the left parietal mass.
Mild edema associated with the right cerebellar mass.
No evidence of acute ischemia.
There is no residual enhancing tissue within this area.
There is a small postoperative fluid collection in this area as well as a small subdural with no significant mass effect.
There is blooming artifact on gradient echo images, likely related to a small amount of air.
The amount of adjacent edema within the frontal and parietal lobes is unchanged from the prior examination with some mass effect upon the midline structures as well as the posterior and anterior horns of the left lateral ventricle.
There is a small right cerebellar enhancing lesion with a mild amount of surrounding edema as noted on the prior examination consistent with metastatic disease.
An area of low T2 signal within this lesion could be consistent with some necrosis.
Multiple T2-signal abnormalities are seen also within the basal ganglia bilaterally and periventricular white matter, most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct.
Minimal artifact is seen surrounding the postop cavity.
IMPRESSION: Status post surgery on the left parietal lesion with no significant residual enhancing tissue.
No significant change in the left parietal or right cerebellar vasogenic edema.
------ PATHOLOGY from lesion:  LEFT HIGH PARIETAL LESION (including intraoperative smear):  METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA with cribriform histology and extensive necrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 17510**] was admitted to the Neurology Service and underwent a MRI which showed a Left Occipital heterogenous enhancement and right cerebellar lesion.
CXR showed a mass in RML brain mass was thought to metastatic.
to a goal dose of 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]  He was brought to the OR on [**6-26**] and underwent a left sided craniotomy for tumor removal.
Intraoperatively he was noted to have an episode of bradycardia with rate 30-40s which did not effect his BP, he also had a similar episode in the recovery room which required administration of 0.5mg of Atropine.
Postoperatively he was awake, alert, following commands and appropriate.
He had a slight right sided drift and slight right sided upper extremity weakness.
He had post-operative MRI which showed no complications and was transferred to the surgical floor.
He was evaluated by OT/PT he was found to be ataxic and have a partial right sided neglect and would benefit from rehab.
