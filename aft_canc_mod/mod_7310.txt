Pt has been a bit fatigued since his chemotherapy was started, but had no seizure-like activity prior to yesterday, when his brother noted that his R hand would shake intermittently.
This afternoon, the patient was at home and suddenly developed diffuse R body rhythmic jerking.
No LOC or loss of continence, no tongue biting.
Overall, otherwise, pt has been relatively well with no intercurrent infections or illness.
Past Medical History: HTN PTSD depression plantar warts genital herpes GERD duodenal ulcer H pylori negative  Social History: No tobacco now or in past.
No recreational drugs.
Family History: M died of colon Ca at 55y/o B died of pancreatic Ca at 40y/o  Physical Exam: T afebrile, BP 115/60, HR 114, RR 19  O2 99 room air.
Initial exam performed while patient having rhythmic jerking, likley partial seizures: at that time he was hypertonic, shaking his R upper and bilateral lower extremities, following commands but not producing speech.
Neck  Increased tone overall in neck/shoulders, but neck supple with no pain with flexion/extension, no thyromegaly, no [**Doctor First Name **], no bruits Chest  CTA B CVS  RRR w/ 2/6 SEM at LSB.
EXT  no C/C/E, distal pulses full, no rashes or petechiae  Neuro MS: awake, does not produce speech, follows simple commands but only intermittently.
decreased bulk, increased tone throughout, no tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia.. Pt moves all four extremities equally antigravity, would not follow commands for strength testing except for grip, which is [**6-15**] bilaterally.

The growth pattern is not typical of a metastasis  TRANS ESOPHAGEAL ECHO Mildly to moderately thickened mitral valve with moderate mitral  regurgitation and probable vegetation.
No abscess seen.
MR SPECT There is no change in the enhancing infiltrating mass in the left frontal cortex, with surrounding vasogenic edema.
There are no new mass lesions.
2) Stable appearance of upper abdomen with no evidence of recurrent disease.
3) Stable peripancreatic fat stranding and small lymph nodes.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old male with pancreatic cancer, presents in with right sided arm and leg twitching c/w with partial status.
Found to have left frontal lobe mass.
Neuro: He was initially given ativan and loaded with dilantin for seizure control.
His seizures became less frequent and resolved completely by hospital day #3.
He has slowly been transitioned from dilantin to Keppra without recurrence of his seizures.
Differential diagnosis of left frontal mass included metastasis, primary brain tumor, infection or stroke.
Imaging seems most consistent with a primary CNS lesion such as glioma, PNET, or lymphoma.
The patient refused LP to look for malignant cells or infectious etiologies.
GI:  Pt did well from a GI perspective.
He did have one episode of nausea/vomiting on [**4-11**] which was associated with mildly elevated LFTs and [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.
He had a CT scan of the Abd/Pelvis which showed no evidence of disease recurrence.
CV: TEE was done to evaluate for possiblity of endocarditis, showed a tiny, mitral valve veg.
Emperic abx (vanc and gent) was begun, but later d/c'd (on [**2186-4-12**]) given very low suspicion for endocarditis  4.
endocarditis -d/c'd [**4-12**], has remained afebrile since and blood cultures have been negative.
Also rec'd Levofloxacin x3 days (start [**4-2**]) for traumatic foley insertion-now d/c'd.
This decision pending prognosis of pancreatic and brain lesion.
CT showed no disease recurrence.
