Invasive adenocarcinoma of the periampullary duodenum, poorly differentiated, arising from an adenomatous precursor lesion with high grade dysplasia, with invasion into subserosal adipose tissue (pT3); lymphovascular and perineural invasion is present; see synoptic report.
Pancreatic parenchyma with focal changes of low grade intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIn-1), focal dilation of pancreatic ducts, and squamatization of duct epithelium.
Comments:  Adenomatous precursor of the duodenum is present in multiple sections, but is shown best on Slide K. No dysplastic precursor is found within the ampullary region itself, arguing against the tumor origin from this site.
