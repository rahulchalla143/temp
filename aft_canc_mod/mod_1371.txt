Admission Date:  [**2111-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-5-13**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Caffeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: status post fall, dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O C CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CTA HEAD & NECK W&W/O C & RECO C-SPINE, TRAUMA MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS TTE CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   History of Present Illness: 83 yo female with h/o breast CA s/p mastectomy and chemo and h/o syncope vs seizure event in [**2108**] who is transferred with a left cerebellar ICH.
She then felt LH and increased the hot water.
She went to [**Location (un) 620**] and had a head CT which showed a left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage with some edema, but no obstruction of the 4th ventricle.
She also has a positive troponin, but had no CP or ECG changes and no ASA was given due to the hemorrhage.
ROS: Patient denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, dysarthria, dysphagia, neck pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, visual changes, diplopia, hearing changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or bowel/bladder problems.
She had recurrence in LNs and was treated with 16 months chemo ~1 yr ago.
She also gets frequent PRBCs.
Family History: No strokes.
OP clear Neck: No Carotid bruits CV: RRR, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Ext:No cyanosis/edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam Orientation: Oriented to person, [**Location (un) 620**], and [**4-/2027**] Attention: Able to do DOWF not B Language: Fluent with good comprehension and repetition.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors No apraxia, no neglect.
Small hyperdense focus in the left cerebellum likely represents subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Mild surrounding edema, but no significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease, with additional area of hypodensity in the right parietal lobe that may represent an area of subacute infarction.
If there is clinical concern, MRI would be more sensitive for evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
MRI [**5-8**]: Multiple infarcts involving several vascular territories, the largest area involving the right temporal and parietal regions, which appear acute and subacute.
Please consider a cardiac echo to evaluate for thrombus and defects such as a PFO or ASD.
Follow up examination in a few days may help to differentiate multiple emboli from the possibility of metastatic disease given the patient's history of breast cancer.
The cervical spine cannot be fully evaluated on these views; however, there are no signs for acute injury.
If there is high clinical concern, cross-sectional imaging with CT scan can be performed.
Extensive degenerative change of the cervical spine.
3mm left supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm.
Fusiform aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm in the V3 segment of the right vertebral artery.
Right upper lobe peripheral consolidation could represent areas of infection/neoplasm or pulmonary infarct from emboli.
Air bronchogram containing right upper lobe opacity is likely infectious with malignant etiologies including a slow growing bronchoalveolar carcinoma felt less likely.
Slightly prominent peripheral interstitial markings more inferiorly is also likely infectious however underlying lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
Small pericardial effusion.
Small right renal hypoattenuating lesion, likley benign but too small to characterize.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Moderate atherosclerotic vascular disease.
TEE [**2111-5-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest x 2 (unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 yo female with h/o breast CA s/p mastectomy and chemo and history of syncope vs seizure event in [**2108**], confusion x 3 weeks, who is transferred with a left cerebellar ICH.
On MRI, found to have multiple infarcts, likely embolic as there is a large right temporoparietal infarct and multiple other small infarcts in anterior and posterior circulations bilaterally.
MRI showed right temporoparietal infarct, several other small right and left infarcts, c/w embolic source or prothrombotic state.
It was felt that she was prothrombotic and hypercoaguable due to her malignancy.
We did not start anticoagulation because of the presence of a large hemorrhagic transformation in the cerebellum.
Plan discussed with patient and son who understand the risks of bleeding on anti-coagulation soon after the stroke and of subsequent strokes from prothrombotic state due to her underlying metastatic breast cancer.
She had a right upper lobe peripheral consolidation seen on CXR, which could represent areas of infection/neoplasm or pulmonary infarct from emboli.
Status post fall:  CT c-spine done at [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital, report no fracture but positive for retrolisthesis.
MRI C-spine without ligamentous injury.
Cards:  Monitored on telemetry without events.
Patient had elevated tropT (peak 0.20) with normal MB index.
TEE negative for valvular vegetations, clot, large atheromas or ASD/PFO.
ID:  CT chest performed showed air bronchogram containing right upper lobe opacity, likely infectious with malignant etiologies including a slow growing bronchoalveolar carcinoma felt less likely.
Slightly prominent peripheral interstitial markings more inferiorly is also likely infectious however underlying lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
Started on Cipro for treatment of community acquired pneumonia for 7 day course.
Heme:  Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Per her son, she has been intermittently anemia since start chemotherapy and has required blood transfusions in the past.
Metaxalone 800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for muscle spasm.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Left cerebellar abd Right parietal infarcts with hemorrhagic conversion  Secondary diagnosis: - Metastatic breast CA - Gastroesophageal reflux - Anemia   Discharge Condition: Good.
Right postural tremor.
Left upper motor neuron pattern arm weakness (dist>prox).
Discharge Instructions: You have embolic strokes to your brain.
If you have any weakness, numbness/tingling, difficulty speaking, sudden vision or hearing changes or any other worrying symptoms, please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency department.
