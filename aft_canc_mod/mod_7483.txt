Patient was noted to have dysphagia and on endoscopy she had an adenocarcinoma .
CT revealed no evidence nor metastatic disease although a small 1.x2cm lesion was noted in the uncinate process.
Patient states she has pain [**6-27**] without radiation in the epigastrium, no nausea, no vomiting.
This pain is new since the EUS.
No fevers, chills.

No crackles or wheezes GI: bowel sounds positive, abdomen soft non-tender.
no erythema Neuro: awake, alert oriented  Pertinent Results: CXR: [**2104-10-1**]: Bilateral lungs are hyperexpanded suggestive of emphysema.
Left minimal pleural effusion and [**Hospital1 **]-basal lung atelectasis are no different as compared to the prior radiograph.
Lower lung atelectasis is unchanged.
There are no new lung opacities of concern.
[**2104-9-26**]: Substantial opacification is seen at the left base, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
On the right, there is only mild blunting of the costophrenic angle with mild atelectatic changes.
Skin staples over the base of the left neck and midline of the abdomen and surgical staples projecting over the left upper quadrant are noted.
There has been interval removal of a drainage catheter at the left lung base with slight increase in small left pleural effusion.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is mild interstitial edema as before.
There is no new focal consolidation.
There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch.
Upper Extremity Doppler: [**2104-9-25**]: Non-occlusive deep venous thromboses of the right distal internal jugular and axillary veins and occlusive right basilic venous thrombosis.
The right subclavian vein could be fully evaluated but color Doppler analysis shows wall-to-wall flow suggesting patency.

Transhiatal esophagectomy with Laparoscopic jejunostomy.
On [**2104-9-17**] she developed atrial fibrillation 140's amiodarone IV was initiated, hypotensive requiring low-dose pressors.She converted to SR 60's within 24 hrs.
[**2104-9-18**] hypoxic requiring re-intubation.
CXR showed left lower pleural effusion which was residual left lower lobe effusion.
Her TF were changed to vivonex, nonfat with medium change triglycerides.
CXR with no effusion.
She had no further atrial fibrillation while hospitalized and can be tapered off as an outpatient.
Speech: seen by speech and swallow for bedside evaluation [**9-23**] intermittent s/sx of aspiration with both thin and nectar-thick liquids.
Pt was noted with significant anxiety related to PO intake, and it is possible that some of thesymptoms of aspiration or discomfort noted at bedside were due to this anxiety, however, aspiration cannot be r/o.
ENT: Voice weak and mild hoarsness.
Left vocal fold absent abduction, adduction, median position.
They recommended Diet per speech and swallow.
LEMG at 1 month post-op to determine prognosis If voice or swallowing worsens, will suggest temporary vocal fold injection as outpatient.
DVT: Right upper extremity edema noted.
Right upper extremity doppler [**2104-9-25**] showed Non-occlusive deep venous thromboses of the right distal internal jugular and axillary veins and occlusive right basilic venous thrombosis.
