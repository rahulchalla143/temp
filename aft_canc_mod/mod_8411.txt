Admission Date:  [**2104-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-10-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-3-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5062**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, increasing oxygen requirement   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 67 y/o female with metastatic breast ca (mets to liver, lung, and possibly cavernus sinus) on ongoing weekly paclitaxel, presented with persistent fevers.
On that day she was found to have a fever of 100.9.
She was treated empirically with ciprofloxacin for a possible UTI x 1 week.
CXR on [**9-24**] showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
CXR on [**9-25**] showed mild asymmetry in the upper zones with some suggested increased opacification on the right.
On the floor, patient triggered twice for increased respiratory rate into the high 20s and low 30s.
Her oxygen requirement has risen from 98% on 2L NC to 88-90% on [**4-17**] L NC overnight.
CTA is read as atypical infiltrate versus diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis resulting in congestion of the lung parenchyma.
Oseltamivir 75 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] was added on [**9-26**], ID was consulted, and ICU admission was requested for increasing oxygen requirement and request for bronchoscopy with biopsy - question is whether this pulmonary process is indeed lymphomatous spread or simply atypical infection.
She denied pain anywhere or any other complaints.
Past Medical History: # Metastatic breast cancer: - [**2098**]: a mass was found in her left breast on mammogram - [**2099-4-23**]: lumpectomy.
She continued  on exemestine until [**2102-3-17**] when a chest X-ray showed a 4 mm mass  in her left lung and biopsy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] showed  metastatic breast carcinoma.
- [**Date range (2) 104396**]: received capecitabine - [**8-/2103**]: chemotherapy was switched to liposomal doxorubicin because of progressive lung metastases.
She continued on liposomal doxorubicin until she again had progressive disease and was started on paclitaxel.
- [**2104-8-5**]: PET showed FDG-avid disease in her lungs and possbily the liver.
She experienced blurry vision in OS that lasted for seconds upon awakening in a.m. MRI showed Meckel's cave enhancing  mass.
No illicit drugs  Family History: Her mother has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
Her father died at age 81 from pancreatic cancer.
Brothers have hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Indeterminate diastolic indices.
No endocarditis, abscess or significant valvular regurgitation seen  CTA [**9-26**]: 1.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
Diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis, with resulting widespread ground-glass opacities indicating parenchymal congestion (reflecting non-cardiogenic edema).
Grossly unchanged innumerable pulmonary nodules compatible with metastases.

No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is, however, mild asymmetry in the upper zones with some suggested increased opacification on the right.
Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxia ??????
CT showed diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis resulting in congestion of the lung parenchyma which was thought to the be the cause of her hypoxia.
She was also intitially treated with cefepime for broad coverage, which was stopped once she improved clinically.
# Metastatic breast cancer: most recent paclitaxel dose was on [**2104-9-16**].
CEA elevated at 7.9 up from 4.9 last month.
# Elevated LFTs - Elevated on admission.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to liver metastases vs. infectious process vs secondary to steroids.
# Hypertension: Stable.
