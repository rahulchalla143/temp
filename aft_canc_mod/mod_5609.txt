Admission Date:  [**2182-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-3-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 88 year old female with history of Stage IV right sided breast cancer (no chemo d/t poor functional status) and CVA with chief complaint of lethargy.
At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the pt was currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia with levaquin and flagyl since [**2182-3-6**].
Pt received Vanc, Zosyn and rectal tylenol and norepinephrine was started for hypotension.
Exam notable for L sided weakness which is residual from old CVA.
Past Medical History: s/p basal ganglia CVA in [**5-14**] L.carotid stenosis 60% MRI/MRA in [**4-12**] valvular heart disease Hypertension Osteoarthritis peripheral vascular disease depression LBBB at least since [**4-12**] Prolonged QTc  Social History: Denies tobacco, alcohol, drugs.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Right rhonchi, left minimal breath sounds, no wheezes CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: A+Ox2 (to [**Hospital1 18**], [**Holiday **], name, not oriented to year).
CN II-XII intact, Strength 4/5 in RUE, less in LUE   Pertinent Results: CXR ([**2182-3-9**]) FINDINGS: There has been interval development of a massive left pleural effusion.
There is only a small component of the left upper lung  demonstrating aeration.
There is resultant mass effect with rightward deviation of the mediastinum.
Although cardiac silhouette size is impossible to assess given the presence of a massive left effusion, it is presumed relatively stable in size.
The right lung is grossly clear free of any focal consolidation.
The extreme right costophrenic angle has been excluded from view, but no large effusion is seen on the right.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of a massive left pleural effusion with resultant mass effect on the mediastinum.

The source was thought to be pulmonary infection given large effusion.
# Pleural effusion: She was found to have a large left sided pleural effusion, which was though to be either of malignant or pneumonic etiology.
She had a recent chest fiml that showed left consolidation with effusion so she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
However, she also had a recent PET scan with mediastinal LN involvement malignancy was also considered.
Initial results were not consistent with infection with culture and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Repeat thoracentesis showed a similarly exudative physiology.
# Acute renal failure: She was found to have an elevated creatinine, which was thought to be due to either reduced renal perfusion in the setting of hypotension, possibly ATN.
# Anion-gap acidosis: Pt initially had an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well.
The anion gap acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
Medications on Admission: AMLODIPINE 5 mg once a day CARBIDOPA-LEVODOPA - 25 mg-100 mg Tablet - 1.5 Tablet(s) by mouth four times a day CLOPIDOGREL [PLAVIX] - 75 mg daily HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE - 25 mg daily LISINOPRIL - 20 mg DAILY POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 3350 [MIRALAX] SIMVASTATIN 10 mg at bedtime ACETAMINOPHEN BISACODYL 10 mg Suppository MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE [MILK OF MAGNESIA] 30 ml by mouth daily as needed for constipation SODIUM PHOSPHATES [FLEET ENEMA] rectally daily as needed for constipation 2 hours post dulcolax  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary:  pneumonia secondary:  hypertension   Discharge Condition: A&O x 2, requires 2L O2 by nasal cannula, not ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because of fevers.
You were found to have a pneumonia.
This was likely due to aspiration of food into your lungs.
