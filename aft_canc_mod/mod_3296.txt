Post op had airway compromise and bronch revealed TBM-transferred for eval.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CRI, baseline Cr 1.2 Diabetes with peripheral neuropathy.
Family History: CAD in family  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: T96.9 P87 BP107/44 R18 97% 4L Gen- pleasant Caucasian male in no apparent distress HEENT- anicteric, PERRLA, moist mucus membrane, normal oropharynx, neck supple CV- regular, no r/m/g RESP- clear bilaterally(anterior) ABDOMEN- soft, nontender, nondistended EXT- no edema NEUROLOGICAL: .
VIII: Hearing intact bilaterally to finger rub IX, X: Palatal elevation symmetric [**Doctor First Name 81**]: SCM, trapezius strength intact XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations .
No pronator drift.
Sensation: decreased sensation in lower extremities bilaterally up to level of ankle, decreased proprioception in lower extremity, normal sensation and proprioception in upper extremity .
No evidence of tracheobronchomalacia or stenosis.
Findings that may be consistent with recent median sternotomy and thoracic surgery if sternotomy was performed within the past 15 days.
Several slightly enlarged mediastinal nodes which are likely hyperplastic but could be followed to ensure resolution or stability if warranted clinically.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with likely lower lobe atelectasis.
Splenic hypodensity which could represent a hemangioma or possibly an infarct.
Consider ultrasound for further characterization, if warranted clinically.
[**2138-5-30**]: ECHO Conclusions: Technically suboptimal study due to poor image quality.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve is not well seen, but Doppler does not suggeste aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No definite mitral regurgitation is seen.
No pericardial effusion is seen.
Once stabilized, pt underwent a bronchoscopy [**2138-5-29**] that showed no evidence of TBM.
CTA confirmed no TBM.
Evaluated by neurology for autonomic dysfxn.
Recommended Tilt table and other recommendations: Evidence of autonomomic dysfunction on formal testing (full report to follow).
had labile blood pressures, which if sustained, may cause symptoms of orthostatic intolerance.
Autonomic dysfunction may be secondary to DM and/or multiple myeloma.
Generally, we recommend 2L of fluid and 10gm of salt per day.
Given his recent cardiac history, this may not be possible to achieve, but maximize therapy as can be tolerated.
It may be necessary to avoid heavy compression given his diabetic neuropathy.
If he remains orthostatic and is unable to tolerate physical therapy, it may be necessary to start low dose midodrine, 2.5mg at 7am, noon, and 4pm.
