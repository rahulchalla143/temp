Past Medical History: thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy and currently taking sutent - 4 wk on the 2 week off - this week is week #4   Social History: lives with wife, [**Name (NI) **] EtOH, [**2-10**] ppd   Physical Exam: On admission:  PHYSICAL EXAM: O: T:98.6  BP: 167/84         HR:90    R18       O2Sats98 RA Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Hemorrhagic mass or masses extending from the right occipital lobe into the atrium of the right lateral ventricle, suggesting metastatic disease.
Vasogenic edema with associated contrast enhancement extending from the atrium of the right lateral ventricle into the temporal lobe, likely reactive edema with a breakdown in the blood/brain barrier.
Hemorrhage expanding the right lateral ventricle, and also within the third ventricle.
2 mm hemorrhagic lesion in the right superior paracentral lobule cortex, likely another hemorrhagic metastasis.
Expansile erosive metastases in the right sphenoid bone (slightly smaller since [**2169-7-5**]) and occipital bone (stable).
Nonexpansile small metastasis in the left parietal bone, stable.
Right parietal hematoma with hemorrhagic extension into the lateral ventricle and a likely solid enhancing component along the medial margin of the hematoma suggesting hemorrhagic metastasis.
Lytic metastasis with enhancement in the right greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of sphenoid and occipital bone as seen on the recent study.
Status post resection of right cerebral hemisphere hemorrhagic lesion with residual blood products within the resection bed, similar amount of vasogenic edema and decreased intraventricular hemorrhage.
6-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures, slightly increased from [**2171-7-23**].
Status post right craniotomy with expected post-surgical changes including pneumocephalus and adjacent blood products.
Lytic destructive bone lesions in the right sphenoid and occipital bones again noted, consistent with metastases.
[**2171-7-27**] MRI Brain +/-: IMPRESSION: Status post right parietal craniotomy, residual blood products are noted in the surgical bed along the right ventricular atrium with residual intraventricular hemorrhage, there is no evidence of acute ischemic changes.
There is no evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Unchanged bone lesions involving the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the right sphenoid sinus and occiput, likely consistent with metastatic disease.
An MRI Brain was obtained which shows there may be an underlying mass and further lesions.
Frozex section introperatively was + for metastatic disease.
A Post op CT demonstrated interval post-op changes.
A post-op MRI was obtained on [**7-27**] showing residual blood products with a question a residual enhancement.
8. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right IPH with intraventricular extension Cerebral edema Multiple brain lesions (hemorrhagic mets) Thyroid cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Your wound closure has dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
