Wrapping of bronchial anastomosis with intercostal     muscle flap.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy.
[**2184-12-8**] Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: 58M diagnosed with a squamous cell LUL tumor.
He has had interval EBUS which confirmed squamous cell cancer of the left upper lobe.
The 7 node shows atypical cells c/w squamous metaplasia (negative).
His PET scan shows the very avid left upper lobe mass with avid mediastinal nodes.
Past Medical History: PMH/PSH none  Social History: Cigarettes: 1 pack/day x 35 years, quit 6 months ago ETOH:       [ ] No   [x] Yes but quit 6 months ago Drugs: No   Family History: Mother - died of lung cancer at age 57 Father - died of lung cancer at age 60   Physical Exam: On Discharge: VS: 98.9  88  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91610**]  96% on RA GEN: NAD HEENT: Neck incision c/d/i without erythema, dermabonded.
CV: RRR, nl S1 and S2 PULM: Mild wheezes in RLL, otherwise to CTA, no respiratory distress.
A bulging mediastinal contour projecting over the left hilus could be due to hematoma or tissue augmentation of the left upper lobectomy and sleeve resection.
Apical pleural tube in place.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
Subcutaneous emphysema, left chest wall, is minimal.
The posterior short-segment rib resection is visualized by approximately one-half shaft width.
[**2184-12-4**] CXR: No pneumothorax or pleural effusion, but apical pleural tube in place.
No change in mild subcutaneous emphysema left chest wall and neck.
Mild left suprahilar atelectasis is new.
No progressive enlargement of the post-operative left hilar bulge, either hematoma or bronchial augmentation.
[**2184-12-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable to slightly increased left lung atelectasis.
[**2184-12-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable to slightly increased left lung atelectasis.
[**2184-12-7**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, partially obscured by left lower lobe and lingular atelectasis.
There are no pleural effusions or evident pneumothorax.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.
There are low lung volumes.
Surgical fracture of the posterior left 5th rib is again noted.
[**2184-12-9**] CXR: There is persistent opacity in the left lower hemithorax consistent with large are of atelectasis.
Fluid and air in the left pleural space are small and grossly unchanged.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled with an epidural catheter.
He was kept in the ICU overnight to optimize his care and to monitor his respiratory status.
Neuro: The patient received an epidural and IV tylenol immediately post-op with good effect and adequate pain control.
APS service retained epidural until POD 4 due to efficacy.
CV: Metoprolol was use post-op for rate prophylaxis against A-fib due to possible pericardial irritation intraoperatively.
Pulmonary: Good pulmonary toilet, nebulizers, incentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged throughout his stay.
Nebulizers were continued for persistent wheezing noted on auscultation which had nearly completed resolved by discharge.
Chest tube was kept to water seal and initially had high output and was retained until POD 4 and was discontinued without complication.
Routine CXR revealed continued left sided atelectasis and flexible bronchoscopy was performed by interventional pulmonology on POD 5 which revealed granulation tissue along the anastomotic site.
Repeat CXR showed continued atelectasis and questionable pleural effusion and IP again saw the patient and performed ultrasonography which revealed a small amount of fluid not amenable to drainage.
Patient was asymptomatic by discharge without shortness of breath or respiratory distress and was ambulating without difficulty on room air.
Postoperatively he had a leukocytosis to 28K which was downtrending throughout his stay.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched and were downtrending throughout his stay and afebrile at time of discharge.
Bacteria was speciated as H. flu that was beta lactamase negative and presumptively  sensitive to amoxicillin and patient was discontinued on a course of augmentin.
Incisions were routinely monitoring and were without signs or symptoms of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
