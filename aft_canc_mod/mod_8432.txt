Chest CT shows miliary lesions in lung, liver and spleen.
She will be admitted to rule out tuberculosis.
Patient presented to outside hospital on [**2192-3-22**] with fever, chills and nonproductive cough.
Patient reported a one week history of easy fatigability, shorntess of breath on exertion, pleuritic chest pain and nonproductive cough.
She also developed chills and subjective fevers.
In OSH ED, chest x-ray did not show infiltrate and blood culture grew gram positive cocci in clusters in 1 out of 4 bottles.
She subsequently went home and returned the following morning on [**2192-3-23**] to the OSH ED, with recurrence of chills and temp in ED measured as 103.5 rectally.
Patient denies hemoptysis, phlegm production but does have some slight nausea.
No recent travel or pets at home.
Chest/abdominal CT revealed miliary lesions in lung, liver and spleen.
She was subsequently transferred to BIMDC to rule out tuberculosis and for further workup.
ROS: Denied headache, dizziness, chest pain, vomitting, abdominal or urinary complaints.
2. essential hypertension 3. s/p tonsillectomy 4. s/p myomectomy for uterine fibroids 5. s/p appendectomy 6. s/p liver biopsy   Social History: Lives with husband of 26 years in [**Location (un) 82229**].
Family History: F died at age 69 of heart disease.
Physical Exam: 101.9     98/66     104      18       95% room air GEN: in bed under multiple covers and a down jacket SKIN: no rashes or lesions appreciated, warm to touch HEENT: PERRL, small white plaque on lateral sides of tongue, OP nl, no LAD appreciated, neck supple CV: RRR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs/rubs/gallops PULM: fine rales R>L, no wheeze ABD: soft, nontender, +BS, nondistended EXT: nonedematous, good pulses NEURO: AOx3, nonfocal   Pertinent Results: At OPH: lying    HR 146   BP 119/71 sitting  HR 150   BP 111/80 standing HR 160   BP 94/60 .
Imaging: CXR [**3-22**]: elevated right hemidiaphragm with atelectasis of the right lung base .
CXR [**3-23**]: interval presence of an increased density in the right upper lobe which was consistent with pneumonia.
EKG: 135 sinus tachycardia, nl axis, no acute ST-T changes unchanged from prior.
LABS At [**Hospital1 18**]: PENDING STUDIES: LIVER BLOOD POOL STUDY [**2192-2-24**]: Focal increased tracer uptake in the liver which correlates with the suspicious lesion seen on MRI, consistent with hemangioma.
Because there has been equivocal enlargement of this lesion when compared to prior examination, additional imaging is recommended.
Most likely this lesion is an atypical hemangioma.
CHEST, TWO VIEWS [**2192-10-18**]: No active lung disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, 50W w/autoimmune hepatitis/primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome on chronic immunosuppressants p/w fever, nonproductive cough and miliary lesions in lung, liver and spleen seen on outside chest/abd CT. .
Differential diagnosis includes TB, CAP, UTI or abdominal infection.
Given chronic immunosuppresion, infectious etiology should be broad to include fungal and parasitic infections.
RUL infiltrate seen on OSH chest x-ray suggestive of pneumonia and miliary lesions in multiple organs suggestive of miliary TB, MAC or fungal infection.
--rec'd ceftriaxone and azithromycin [**Date range (1) 71671**] at OSH, then changed to levaquin on [**3-26**] --continue levaquin for now to cover CAP and atypical PNA --f/u OSH test results --repeat bld cxsx2, mycolytic, UA/urine cx --induced sputum x3 to rule out TB --repeat CXR and chest/abd CT --respiratory precautions for now --consult pulm in am, may need bronchoscopy if unsuccess with induced sputums --CIS >100.4, tylenol 325mg PRN not to exceed 2g/day --follow fever curve .
Chronic liver disease: autoimmune hepatitis and PBC.
--follow LFTs --apprec liver recs .
Miliary lesion in multiple organs: Lung, liver and spleen involvement.
Differential diagnosis includes TB, atypical mycobacteria, histoplasmosis.
On the evening of [**2192-3-27**], the pt was transferred to the MICU for hypotensive episodes and worsening dyspnea.
The bronchoalveolar lavage was positive for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and the patient remained intubated.
On [**2192-3-29**], a CT scan of the torso was performed to rule out other causes of sepsis and respiratory failure.
Exploratory laparotomy performed on [**3-29**] which was found to be negative for any intraabdominal pathology.
She developed a fatal arrythmia and was pronounced dead on [**2192-3-31**].
ADDENDUM: A few days after the patient expired, the final path report on the liver biopsy showed non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type, high grade.
