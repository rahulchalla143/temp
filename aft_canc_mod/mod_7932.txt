Admission Date:  [**2153-7-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-7-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-9-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Attending Info 8238**] Chief Complaint: Upper GI bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper endoscopy Angiogram   History of Present Illness: 52 year old male with PMH stage IIb pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p whipple and ajuvent chemoradiation.
He was believed to be in remission until presenting in [**2-/2153**] with weightloss and abdominal pain.
Found to have cholelithiasis CA19-9 uptrending, PED scan showed Focal FDG avidity in proximal pancreatic body just distal to the anastomosis is concerning for recurrent disease.
Post proceedure, he had bright red blood in the toilet bowel and has noted intermittant blood intermixed with stool.
He has had episotic abdominial pain and nausea after eating and [**3-9**] weight loss over 1 month.
Seen in clinic on [**7-6**] where vitals were HCT 28.5 (down from 32.8 on [**6-28**], and 43.8 on [**5-23**]) where rectal exam showed external hemorrhoids GUIAC positive.
He describes fatigue that is new and progressive, not associated with shortness of breath or chest pain.
Past Medical History: # Onc Dx: Stage IIB (T3N1MO) pancreatic adenocarcinoma # Onc Tx: s/p Whipple [**2151**] followed by adjuvant chemoradiation with gemcitabine and radiation with concurrent 5FU which finished [**2152-1-5**].
# Onc Hx: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with Stage II pancretic cancer in [**2151-4-5**] when he presented with a two week history of abdominal pain and jaundice.
FNA of a pancreatic head mass showed atypical cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma and he underwent a Whipple at [**Hospital1 112**] on [**2151-4-19**].
Pathology revealed a 4.5cm moderately to poorly differentaited adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head with extension directly into the peri-pancreatic soft tissue and peripancreatic lymph nodes and wall of the duodenum and duodenal mucosa.
Of note, chronic pancreatitis and PanIN 3 were present diffusely.
# Pt lost to follow up from [**1-/2152**] to [**2-/2153**], represented wtih abdominal pain, weight loss - CT imaging [**2153-2-19**] demonstrated a new heterogenously enhancing 2.7x3.6cm lesion in the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver abutting the liver capsule.
He was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who discussed systemic chemotherapy options for a presumed metastatic pancreatic cancer.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Liver cysts - Pancreatic insufficiency - chronic pancreatitis on whipple specimen - PanIN 3 diffusely on whipple specimen.
+ Asbestos exposure in [**2119**].
Family History: - no pancreatic cancer Mother: diabetes Father: HTN [**Name (NI) **]: Stomach cancer.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: T 98  Ht 73"  Wt 173.1lbs, bp 116/60  HR 91  RR 18  SaO2 99RA GEN: NAD, awake, alert HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP slightly dry and without lesion NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Conjunctivae slightly pale.
Erythema and friability in the Gastro-jejunal anastomosis.
Marked, increased venous enhancement around the gastrojejunal anastomosis along with increased venous varices from the gastroepiploic collateral system because of new splenic vein thrombosis is very suggestive that this is the site of GI bleeding.
No luminal extravasation however.
No metastasis evident.
Differential arterial hyperenhancement of the liver without portal venous lesion that would explain it.
No definite metastasis.
Dynamic images of the abdomen show no evidence of GI bleeding.
The lateral pelvis view shows no evidence of GI bleeding.
DSA arteriograms of the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery with superselective in characterizations of two second order branches of the superior mesenteric artery revealed no perceptible arterial extravasation, arterial spasm or other vascular pathology.
Hemostasis at the right common femoral artery puncture by deployment of 6 French Angio-Seal vascular closure device.
EGD REPORT ([**2153-7-12**]): Mild esophagitis was seen.
Evidence of known Whipple anatomy was encountered, and a large amount of fresh blood was seen in the stomach and suctioned.
Brisk bleeding was identified at the GJ anastamosis.
The specific cause of bleeding could not be ascertained because of the volume of blood.
It is not possible to determine definitively if the bleeding is arterial or venous in nature.
There was minimal blood in the afferent limb and a moderate amount of blood in the efferent limb which appeared to be secondary to bleeding from the GJ anastamosis.
Surgery and IR were made aware of large volume blood loss and need for emergent intervention.
Empiric embolization can be considered if no extravasation is seen, however, there is CT evidence of possible venous source related to splenic vein thrombosis/varices.
MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAM REPORT ([**2153-7-12**]): Diagnostic angiography of SMA and celiac axis, which did not demonstrate any active extravasation.
EGD REPORT (GLUE EMBOLIZATION, [**2153-7-16**]): At the G-J anastomosis there appeared to be a possible visible vessel with an underlying varix.
2 cc of glue were then injected into the two sites at the source of the bleeding with successful hemostasis.
The area was washed an no further bleeding was noted.
Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the body compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to Jejunum  Discharge Labs: WBC 2.9, Hct 30.7, plt 96k Hct [**7-22**] 31.0 Hct [**7-21**] 28.5   Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo M with pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple with recurrent disease, diabetes mellitus on NPH insulin admitted with massive gastrointestinal bleeding and acute blood loss anemia due to bleeding from gastric varix.
Patient continued to have melenic stools and had repeat EGD showing bleeding from the GEJ, engorged splenic vessels, and gastric varix most likely due to splenic vein thrombosis s/p Whipple.
This could not be clipped successfully and bleeding continued necesitating addition 5 units of red cells, 6 pack of platelets and 2 units of FFP via the massive transfusion protocol.
Tagged RBC scan did not reveal bleeding and IR angiogram did not show extravasation.
Patient received additional 3 units red cell transfusion and hematocrit remained relatively stable following the procedure without need for further transfusion.
On day of discharge and the day prior, patient is having some ongoing maroon color to his stools.
However, he remains completely asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable, and importantly his Hct has been stable ~30 for > 3 days.
If in the future he bleeds again, surgery would not be a good option for further management, instead warrants IR embolization via splenic artery embolization or splenic vein retrograde embolization.
#Pancreatic cancer s/p Whippe with recurrent disease: Patient was continued on Creon and will follow up with his Oncologist in [**Location (un) **] for consideration of chemotherapy for his recurrent disease.
#Anxiety - Patient's chronic anxiety was stable, and he received Ativan QHS and clonazepam when he was NPO.
#PPx - The patient received pneumoboots for prophylaxis.
2. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain/ headache.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed from gastrojejunal anastamosis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with massive GI bleeding.
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a bleeding blood vessel near your recent surgery in your stomach.
This was injected with epinephrine (to shrink the vessel) and your bleeding stopped.
Please call your doctor if you experience any darkening of your stools or see frank blood in your stools or if you develop increased shortness of breath, nausea, chest pains, increased fatigue, or dizziness or lightheadedness or feel as if you are going to pass out as these may be signs that your blood counts are low.
