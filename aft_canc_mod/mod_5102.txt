The salivary gland had 4 of 9 nodes showing evidence of extracapsular extension as well.
His interferon therapy was discontinued after five weeks due to mental status change and declining performance status.
CT torso [**2166-8-18**] showed concerning metastatic lesion in the region of the left kidney as  well as a new right hilar adenopathy measuring approximately 1.8  cm in greatest axial dimension concering for metastatic spread.

Findings consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
Right upper lobe opacity is new, and may represent an infarction, alternatively, this could be seen in the setting of infection.
Stable appearance of noncalcified right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Evaluation for small nodule is limited by motion artifact.
[**2166-12-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-21**], there is little change.
No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
No evidence of DVT.
