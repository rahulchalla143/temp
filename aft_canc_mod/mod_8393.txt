Incidentally he reports that he has had worsening back pain for the last week, describes [**8-17**] pain which is usually controlled on Percocet to [**3-17**].
The pain is sharp, constant, and is in a band along the beltline between his hips.
He has no pain, numbness or tingling in his legs.
No change in bowel or bladder function.
In addition, he has been taking more Percocet than usual - 6-8 tabs daily and subsequently began having nausea and vomiting [**2-8**] x this week.
He denies bleeding - mucosal or otherwise.
ROS: decreased appetite, denies SOB, CP, no fever or chills, but reports cold intolerance.
no change in bowel habits, with regular BM daily.
CT scan was done showing no evidence of RP bleed.
Past Medical History: - History of hairy cell leukemia diagnosed in [**2141**], status post splenectomy  without further treatment.
- Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer (summary below) - History of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia - Benign prostatic hypertrophy - DM type 2 on oral hypoglycemic agents - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypertension - Status post left hip replacement [**2166-6-2**] - Recent DVT and PE ([**2166-5-12**]) - Status post Electrophysiology ablation of AVNRT focus - Status post Fluoroscopic guided placement of [**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter .
Brief Onc Summary per last endocrine note: "The patient was diagnosed in [**2166-4-7**] with follicular thyroid carcinoma affecting his lungs, lumbosacral spine and left hip.
He suffered a fracture of his left hip for which he had a left replacememt and was found to have extensive bony lesions at the L5-S1 invading his spinal canal, this causing severe spinal stenosis.
He received external beam radiation for spinal metastases but suffered DVT complicated by coronary embolus while in rehab.
Because he had been on Amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, he could not immediately be treated with radioactive iodine for his metastatic disease.
He was treated with Thyrogen twice as his TSH could not be increased adequately due to topic production of thyroid hormone by metastatic thyroid carcinoma.
He was treated with Decadron around the time of the therapy due to known spinal metastases and concern for cord compression."
Family History: He reports that his mother had breast cancer and died at 82y/o.
His father died of a stroke at 86y/o.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.4 BP 129/94 HR 88 RR 17 O2 100% RA Gen: Elderly man in mild distress - appears uncomfortable sitting upright in bed HEENT: MMM, no OP lesions - no mucosal bleeding, EOMI, pupils dilated (s/p b/l cataract surgery) Neck: Supply, no LAD, no JVD Heart: RRR, nl S1/S2, no S3/4, no murmurs Lungs: CTA b/l, no wheezes or rales Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses, no HSM, no guarding or rebound tenderness MSK: Approx 4cm mass over vertebrae around level T10-L1 - tender to tough, not fluctuant, non-erythematous.
Otherwise generally tender to lumbar/sacral region Extrem: 2+ pitting edema b/l, compression stockings in place, skin smooth and hairless.
no erythema or calf pain.
[**9-6**] --> Blood, urine and tissue cx --> Pan-sensitive Klebsiella .
Signal changes indicative of metastatic disease are still noted at this level.
On the post-gadolinium images a central area of low signal identified within the T12 vertebral body which could be due to changes from treatment.
Metastatic disease to L4, L5 and S1 again noted unchanged in extent.
No evidence of new bony metastatic disease or epidural mass.
Multilevel degenerative changes and a small arachnoid cyst at the posterior aspect of the thecal sac at T12-L1 level are unchanged from previous study.
CT Lumbar spine ([**8-18**]): Multilevel metastatic disease within the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar spine as described above.
Specifically, marked destruction and loss of vertebral body height of the L1 vertebral body with appearance suggesting soft tissue infiltration extending posteriorly with an epidural component.
These findings suggest a hemangioma of the L4 vertebral body with superimposed metastasis, recommend further evaluation with an MRI of the thoracic spine.
Approximately 2.7 x 2.5 cm low-attenuation lesion within the interpolar aspect of the right kidney likely representing a renal cyst, recommend further evaluation with ultrasound.
No evidence of retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal bleed.
Multilevel thoracolumbar spinal metastasis with soft tissue and indentation into the spinal canal, which has been described in detail on recent MRI and CT of the lumbar spine.
X-ray L Hip: Views of the left hip show an unchanged appearance of the left femoral hemiarthroplasty.
No acute fracture is identified.
Degenerative changes are seen in the lower lumbar spine.
Degenerative changes are seen in the right hip.
No acute change.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 77 yo man with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer with known vertebral metastases presenting with hypotension, elevated lactate, hypoxia concern for sepsis or bleed.
He was initially treated for worsening lower back pain, and started a chronic pain regimen and restarted XRT to L hip and lumbar spine.
He spent over 1 week in the hospital when he was transferred to ICU for hypotension and placed on pressors & antibiotics.
He was found to have a rapidly spreading infection of both legs to the hip.
Surgery immediately evaluated and took patient to OR [**9-6**] for fasciotomy which revealed a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.
He has undergone aggressive fluid resuscitation and remained intubated with relative pulmonary edema after his surgery.
