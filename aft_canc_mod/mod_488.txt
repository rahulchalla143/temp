Admission Date:  [**2166-2-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2166-3-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-3-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and reactive airway disease admitted for decreased oxygen saturations and decreased blood pressures secondary to pneumonia.
She reports not feeling well for the last two weeks prior to admission; initially with flu-like symptoms included rhinorrhea and a cough.
She also had fevers up to 102.8 degrees.
She has been feeling increasingly weak and decreased oral intake.
She also has had a cough occasionally productive; however, no hemoptysis.
She denies any chest pain.
She does not really complain of shortness of breath but has been in bed most of the time.
She came to the Emergency Department because of weakness and was found to have an oxygen saturation down to the 70s, which responded to supplemental oxygen and nebulizers.
A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe consolidation.
She received about 4 liters of fluid in the Emergency Department.
She denies a travel history.
Asthma for the past 10 years; no history of intubation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   No family history of deep venous thrombosis or clotting disorders.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pulmonary examination revealed no wheezes.
Decreased breath sounds at the left base with an egophony change and decreased fremitus.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
No focal motor deficits.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at about 125 beats per minute and normal axis.
ST depressions in leads II and aVL.
NO T wave inversions.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 58-year-old white female with a history of hypothyroidism and asthma coming in with a history of fever, cough, hypoxia, hypertension, and a chest x-ray with evidence of pneumonia.
In the Intensive Care Unit, an attempt was made to tap a left-sided effusion under ultrasound guidance, but this only retrieved 3 cc of sanguinous fluid.
PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures eventually revealed 4/4 bottles positive for streptococcal pneumonia sensitive to penicillin.
for further treatment of her pneumonia.
The patient remained afebrile while on penicillin V and did not appear toxic.
Her cough gradually decreased and became dry.
However, she continued to have a cough upon discharge from the hospital.
While she did have a left lower lobe pneumonia, a follow-up chest x-ray several days later revealed right-sided infiltrates in the upper and medial lung zones and a small right-sided effusion as well.
CARINAL MASS ISSUES:  Upon transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor, the patient underwent a chest computerized axial tomography to further evaluate her effusion and pneumonia.
On this chest computerized axial tomography scan with contrast, a large intraluminal lesion was seen in the lower trachea carina and proximal main stem bronchi which was continuous with precarinal lymph node.
There was also bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy present.
Also on that computed tomography scan, a consolidation mostly in the lower lobes (left greater than right) was seen; in keeping with pneumonia.
There were small left and right pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion.
The biopsy pathology was revealing for adenocystic carcinoma.
The patient underwent a staging evaluation at this point with first a magnetic resonance imaging of the head which revealed no evidence of metastatic.
The patient then underwent a computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis which were also negative for metastatic disease.
Given that adenocystic carcinoma can be salivary in nature or origin, the patient underwent a computed tomography of the neck with contrast to further evaluate for a primary lesion.
There again, there were no masses seen, and no evidence of metastatic disease.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient's pulmonary status was complicated by both the carinal mass and a significant streptococcal pneumonia.
The patient had significant oxygen requirements on the floor and desaturated quickly down to the mid 80s on room air.
Later on in the hospital course, the patient did have a desaturation down to 80% on room air; at which point, given her history of tumor and pneumonia, the question was brought into whether she was having a hypercoagulable state and could have been experiencing a pulmonary embolism to account for her desaturation.
The patient underwent a bilateral lower extremity Doppler examination which was negative for deep venous thrombosis and also a computed tomography angiogram of the chest which was negative for any pulmonary embolism.
The computed tomography of the chest also revealed an increase in the size of the pericardial effusion which they called moderate-to-large in size.
The patient had a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no evidence of a decrease in ventricular function, a normal valve, and a small pericardial effusion which did not significantly impair hemodynamics.
The computed tomography also revealed new secretions interrupting the airway and the right lower lobe bronchi; and this was brought to the attention of the Interventional Pulmonology team who teamed that the patient was young enough and healthy enough to move these secretions on her own without further bronchoscopy.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  A pericardial effusion as evaluated by the transthoracic echocardiogram described in the last paragraph (in Pulmonary paragraph).
OVERALL SUMMARY:  Overall, the patient underwent a metastatic workup for an adenocystic carcinoma of the carina which revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.
The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospital course after she was started on antibiotics; although, she did have a significant oxygen requirement during her hospital course.
It was felt that this was not due to infectious disease issues as much as tumor issues.
Adenocystic carcinoma of the carina.
Pneumonia (organism is streptococcal pneumonia sensitive to penicillin).
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was highly encouraged to go into pulmonary rehabilitation due to her supplemental oxygen requirements and quick desaturations with any type of movement; however, the patient refused this saying that she would do fine at home.
