His oncologic history began in [**2135-1-15**] when he developed fatigue and by [**2135-4-14**], he had developed anemia.
CT of his abdomen revealed a large right kidney mass.
There was tumor invasion of the renal vein and metastases to the adrenal.
He was followed closely and developed a cough in [**2136-4-14**].
Chest CT in [**2136-2-13**] revealed large lung nodules consistent with renal cell metastases.
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Reveals a well appearing middle-age male in no acute distress.
Abdomen is rounded, positive bowel sounds, soft.
Mild tenderness over the right nephrectomy scar area.
for 14 planned doses, [**11-27**] scheduled doses with dose #11 held due to hypotension and doses 13 and 14 held related to mild neurotoxicity and severe constitutional side-effects.
His course was notable for early hypotension initially responding to fluid boluses later requiring dopamine and Neo-Synephrine, vasopressor support.
As per protocol, he was placed on a cardiac monitor, and on [**3-26**] at 7 a.m., he had a run of question of ventricular tachycardia.
He had no acute ischemic changes on EKG.
Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation with a left ventricular ejection fraction slightly decreased at 50-55%.
Cardiac enzymes continued to trend downward and he remained without any arrhythmia on telemetry.
He was felt to have an IL-2-induced myocarditis without myocardial infarction.
He was discharged to home on [**2136-3-27**] with a normal CPK and no cardiac symptoms.
Other side-effects during his course included fevers and chills, and an erythematous skin rash.
He also had some nausea and vomiting treated with antiemetic therapy.
He had a mild thrombocytopenia with a minimum platelet count of 72,000 thought related to IL-2, which had improved to 98,000 on the day of discharge and developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 4.3 on [**3-24**], improved to 1.5 on [**3-24**]; mild transaminitis with an ALT of 46 and an AST of 63 on [**2136-3-24**] again improved before discharge.
He developed a mild metabolic acidosis with a CO2 of 19 on [**3-24**], treated with bicarb and his maintenance IV fluids.
He had a mild renal insufficiency with a peak creatinine of 1.8 improved to 1.1 on the day of discharge.
The side-effects included mild diarrhea treated with antidiarrheals.
By [**2136-3-27**], he had recovered from myocarditis and other side-effects to allow for discharge to home.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to notify us for fever or cardiac symptoms.
prn nausea, acid stomach, or while on NSAIDs.
prn nausea, or anxiety, or for sleep.
prn fever or pain.
DIAGNOSIS:  Status post cycle one, week one high-dose IL-2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma with course complicated by myocarditis.
