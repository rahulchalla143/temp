# GIB:  The patient had a dramatic drop in her Hct from a baseline of 33 down to 18 on admission.
Even though the patient's vital signs were stable on admission, she was on a beta blocker, thus was admitted initially to the ICU for concern for hypovolemia.
The GI bleed was thought to be precipitated by being significantly supratherapeutic with her INR.
The patient had a colonoscopy and EGD during admission, which showed evidence of gastritis and multiple polyps, likely the source of bleeding in supratherapeutic INR.
Will need capsule endoscopy as an outpatient as may have a small bowel lesion contributing to bleed.
# Troponin leak: As the patient had atypical chest pain cardiac enzymes were drawn.
Two sets showed no increasing trend, most likely at the patient's baseline.
# Type 2 DM:  While the patient was NPO she received only [**2-5**] dose of patient's home NPH which is 20 [**Hospital1 **] (gets 45 and 40 at home).
# A fib: The patient was in sinus bradycardia during her hospitalization thus far.
Continued amiodarone as it was likely maintaining normal sinus rhythm because of antiarrhythmic properties.
Held warfarin as was supratherapeutic on admission and has GI bleed, but restarted on discharge.
# HTN: As above, the patient had borderline blood pressures during admission in the setting of GI bleed.
# Diastolic Dysfunction: Echo in [**2172**] had EF 60% and mild diastolic dysfunction with inc E/E'.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin.
# ESRD: Secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
# Glaucoma: Switched bimatorpost to latanoprost as home med non-forumlary.
