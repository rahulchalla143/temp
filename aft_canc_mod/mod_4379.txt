Small radiolucent focus noted in the left frontal [**Last Name (un) 500**], which may represent a hemangioma or focal lytic lesion.
Correlation with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 500**] scan can be considered if there is history of an underlying primary malignancy.
Otherwise, a followup study can be considered to assess stability/progression, given the lack of prior images  GI bleeding study [**2144-5-1**]: GI bleeding likely within the proximal small bowel present within first 15 minutes.
No active extravasation identified.
The site of bleeding identified on the GI scan is not identified.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
ENDOSCOPY:  EGD [**2144-4-20**]: Small hiatal hernia Salmon-colored mucosa consistent with Barrett's esophagus note at the GE junction.
A band-like protruding lesion noted in the area of Barrett's, more like mass than varices in the esophagus Erythema, congestion and small erosions in the antrum compatible with gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Small bowel enteroscopy [**2144-5-4**]: Mass in the lower third of the esophagus Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum and jejunum upto 120 cm Otherwise normal EGD to 120 cm  EGD/endoscopic ultrasound [**2144-5-6**]: Mass in the middle third of the esophagus (biopsy) EUS T stage: An exophytic esophageal mass involving the mucosa, submucosa.
N stage: No abnormal lymph nodes were noted.
Staging applies if malignancy is confirmed.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .

Adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, and arising in a background of intestinal metaplasia, consistent with Barrett's esophagus.

EEG [**2144-5-5**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mostly theta and delta frequencies.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there were no epileptiform features.
Overall, this background is suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.
Amongst the most common causes of encephalopathy are metabolic disturbances, medications, infection, and anoxia.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient was initially transferred from an outside hospital in the setting of a recent 15-pound weight gain and increased dyspnea and cough.
At the outside hospital, treatment with furosemide dropped the patient's blood pressure to the 90s, and it was felt that inotropic support would be required for diuresis.
Milrinone was initiated, but this resulted in hypotension and tachyarrhythmias, so it was stopped.
Between [**2144-4-21**] and [**2144-5-1**], the patient reaccumulated fluid in the setting of blood transfusions and fluid boluses for GI bleeding and low urine output.
Between [**2144-5-1**] and [**2144-5-10**], diuresis proceeded with IV Lasix without any need for pressors or inotropic support.
# Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient had persistent hypotension, requiring vasopressors between [**2144-4-13**] and [**2144-4-29**].
The patient's hypotension was felt to be multifactorial, with contributing factors including ventricular dysfunction, decompensated heart failure, bacteremia, sedating medications, diuresis, and GI bleeding.
# Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation on [**2144-4-13**].
She extubated on [**2144-4-21**] and reintubated from [**Date range (3) 86123**] in the setting of dental extractions.
# Esophageal carcinoma: An esophageal mass was incidentally noted on an EGD performed on [**2144-4-20**] as part of the patient's work-up for GI bleeding.
The mass was further evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and biopsied on [**2144-5-6**].
Pathology showed esophageal carcinoma.
No abnormal lymph nodes were noted on EUS.
ERCP was consulted for possibility of endoscopic resection, but given the high risk of complications (10%) and need for emergent surgery that the patient would likely not tolerate, this was thought to pose more risk than benefit to the patient.
# GI bleeding: The patient had guaiac-positive stools since admission.
EGD was notable for an esophageal mass that proved to be an adenocarcinoma but was not felt to be the source of the bleeding.
A GI bleeding study, done on [**2144-5-1**], was suggestive of a proximal small source.
# Dental extractions: The patient was noted to have very poor dentition.
There was a concern that the patient's mouth could be a source of systemic infection.
The extraction was without complications.
Enteral tube feeding was initiated, but it was stopped because the patient pulled out her feeding tube.
She has been afebrile since [**2144-4-22**].
# Altered Mental Status: The patient had persistently altered mental status, with gradual improvement after extubation.
There was a question of normal pressure hydrocephalus on head CT, but the neurology service did not feel that the patient had NPH.
LP was performed and was notable only for minimally elevated protein.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient had rapid atrial fibrillation while on a milrinone drip.
# Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: The patient started amiodarone on [**2144-4-18**] for NSVT.

You were treated for heart failure with diuretic medications.
Your hospital course was complicated by breathing problems which required intubation.
You also had bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, for which you received multiple blood transfusions.
A mass was found in your esophagus, and a biopsy was performed, showing that you have esophageal cancer.
