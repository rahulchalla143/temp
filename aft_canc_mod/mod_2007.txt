While undergoing a bronchoscopic procedure for ablation of a bronchial  carcinoid tumour, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest.
Resuscitation was begun, TEE revealed that there was air in the left ventricle.

left upper extrem DVT INDICATION: 75-year-old female with history of new-onset left upper extremity swelling and history of central venous catheter on that side.
Although compression of the axillary vein was not performed, relative loss of color flow was demonstrated within the axillary vein.
The cephalic vein was not previously imaged and demonstrates non-compressibility consistent with intraluminal thrombus.
No evidence of left axillary DVT extension.
No visualized thrombus is seen, with demonstrated normal wall- to wall flow.
Intraluminal thrombus of the left cephalic vein, which was not previously imaged.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2122-7-27**] 10:37 AM  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  Reason: LLE CLOT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old woman with New onset of left lower ext swelling with history of CVL on that side REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
left lower extrem DVT INDICATION: 75-year-old female with new onset of left lower extremity swelling, and history of central venous catheter placement.
COMPARISON: Left lower extremity ultrasound dated [**2122-7-24**].
As previously indicated, thrombus is seen extending from the popliteal vein through the superficial femoral vein, and into the common femoral and greater saphenous vein.
There has been no significant interval resolution or progression of the identified thrombus.
Although a normal waveform is demonstrated within the mid and distal superficial femoral vein, no visualized color flow is demonstrated, and no compression was visualized.
IMPRESSION: Essentially occlusive thrombus extending from the popliteal vein through the mid superficial femoral vein.
While undergoing a bronchoscopic procedure for ablation of a bronchial  carcinoid tumour, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest.
Resuscitation was begun, TEE revealed that there was air in the left ventricle.
There was a visible pocket of air in the left ventricular cavity.
There was reduction in the appearance of the air pocket on fluoroscopy.
Fluroscopy did not reveal any evidence of pneumothorax.
POD#8- Pt found unresponsive w/ agonal respirations with stable hemodynamics.
