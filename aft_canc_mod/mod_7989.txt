The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).

Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old with worsening symptoms of heart failure and found to have severe mitral regurgitation presenting for mitral valve replacement.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
