History of Present Illness: This is a 50 year-old woman presenting with a large spindle cell carcinoma in her right hepatic lobe.
She was seen in the melanoma clinic for evaluation of a possible melanoma metastasis.
She was found to have a hepatic spindle cell carcinoma and was referred to the Transplant Surgery Clinic.
She presented to [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic this morning to initiate evaluation for a possible hepatic lobe resection.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] decided to admit the patient for preop workup and abdominal imaging.
The patient denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, jaundice, scleral icterus or pruritis.
She also states that she gets bilateral lower extremity edema when sitting for long periods of time and cramping in her calves when she drives.
She also has some complaints of lower back pain which she partially attributes to her job which requires her to sit for long perids of time.
Past Medical History: slightly elevated blood pressure, melanoma on her back s/p wide excision w/ advancement flap [**5-26**], Lf great toe crush injury s/p surgical intervention in '[**52**] and '[**53**].

Large heterogeneously enhancing lesion replacing segments 4a/4b/[**6-1**] of the liver, supplied by the right hepatic artery.
Probable occlusion of the right portal vein.
There is a heterogeneously enhancing lesion within the right lobe of the thyroid corresponding to that described on recent PET-CT which is concerning for malignant process.
There is a small amount of simple-appearing free pelvic fluid and a heterogeneously enhancing structure within the lower pelvis which may represent a fibroid uterus; pelvic ultrasound is recommended for further assessement as indicated.
No other pelvic abnormalities were identified.
Results were as follows: Atypical single cells with increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios, irregular nuclear contours and prominent small nucleoli.
Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 37914**] operative note there was a large mass replacing much of the segments [**Doctor First Name **], IVB, V and VIII, as was seen on the pre-op CT.
Biopsies taken at the time of surgery were returned with the following: -Poorly differentiated spindle cell and epithelioid tumor, consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma.
-Immunostains of the tumor cells within the areas of epithelioid differentiation are diffusely and strongly positive for HMB45, Mart 1 and S100, and negative for actin, desmin, LCA, EMA and cytokeratin cocktail.
Given the patient's history of previously excised invasive malignant melanoma of the right mid-back (which also demonstrated epithelioid differentiation within the vertical growth phase; see prior report S02-[**Numeric Identifier 37915**]), the tumor morphology and immunophenotype support a diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma.
-Portal lymph node, excisional biopsy: One lymph node with no malignancy identified.
Abdomen was non-distended with dry incisions.
Of note, she did experience intermittent nausea unrelieved by zofran.
Nausea resolved.
Site remained without redness.
