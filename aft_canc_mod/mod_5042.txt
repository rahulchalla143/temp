Left bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
([**2125-2-18**]) ERCP: IMPRESSION: Two filling defects within the common bile duct, consistent with CBD stones, associated with CBD and hepatic duct dilatation .

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 61 year-old female with HTN, Anemia who was transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with cholangitis and anemia, clinically doing well.
# CHOLANGITIS Patient underwent ERCP with successful placement of Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent, and bile was seen draining into the duodenum.
Due to difficulties with sedation, sphincterotomy was not performed.
For pre-operative risk assessment, ECHO and p-MIBI were performed, revealing no significant valvular abnormalities; EF was preserved, and resting/stress myocardial perfusion was normal -- given these findings, patient at low risk for perioperative cardiac events, and she was already on a beta-blocker as part of her anti-hypertensive regimen.
# ANEMIA Patient presented with Hct of 15 in setting of cholangitis and guiaic positive stool.
Iron studies consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
Colonoscopy showed small polyp which was resected, otherwise normal.
EGD showed findings consistent with gastritis, as well has large hiatal hernia with localized erosion within hernia sac ([**Location (un) 25056**] ulcer).
Anemia was attributed to iron deficiency anemia in setting of gastritis/erosions, and oral iron/folate supplementation was initiated, as was PPI.
# HIATAL HERNIA Hiatal hernia was seen on endoscopy, and UGI series with SBFT was advised for further evaluation.
# LBBB On presentation, patient's EKG with LBBB, no old for comparison.
Aspirin was held on admission in setting of Hct 15 and guiaic positive stool.
# MIGRAINES Not active currently, on Fioricet at home.
