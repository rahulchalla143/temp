Upon discussion with the patient and review of Atrius records it appears she has been experiencing severe back pain since [**Month (only) 958**].
At that time, she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28549**] for her back pain and then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] who ordered a MRI spine on [**4-7**] which showed diffusely abnormal signal of the L1 vertebra, discrete lesion in T12.
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Orthopaedics) and underwent a bone scan on [**4-7**] which showed abnormal tracer in T8, T9, L1.
An MRI of her spine, CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis on [**4-23**] showed 2cm mass in the right hilum associated with small rt hilar LN and enlarged rt paratraceal LN measuring 9.8mm and 12.7mm.
Pulmonary nodule at the superior segment of RLL measuring 2.8mm as well as 3.1mm RUL nodule.
Lytic lesion was also noted at L1, T12.
She re-presented to her oncologist on [**5-1**] for continuous severe back pain.
Pt underwent XRT (second session) yesterday and had a progression in her severe back pain and was referred to the ED.
Her labs were unremarkable aside from anemia of 33.2, WBC was 7.9.
A CT Pelvis was ordered which showed no fracture; L5 vertebral body lytic lesion.

Physical Exam: On admission: Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.0  P 96  R 20  153/88  97% on RA Gen: Well appearing although thin, pleasant, no acute distress but resting slightly uncomfortably in bed HEENT: PERRL, EOMI.
Normal oro/nasopharynx Neck: Supple, without adenopathy or JVD.
No tenderness with palpation.
Upon transfer back to Oncology Medicine after spine surgery: Vitals: T 96.4, BP 151/72, HR 98, RR 18, 97%2L NC Gen: Well appearing elderly Caucasian woman lying in bed watching TV, pleasant, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI.
Normal oro/nasopharynx Neck: Supple, without adenopathy or JVD.
No tenderness with palpation.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No evidence of fracture.
L5 vertebral body lytic lesion disrupting the cortex concerning for a metastatic lesion.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] with and without contrast: Pathologic compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion  and severe spinal stenosis and mild epidural and paraspinal soft tissue enhancement indicative of epidural and paraspinal metastatic disease.
Severe compression of the cauda equina and probable compression of the tip of the conus is identified without abnormal signal in the distal spinal cord.
The compression fracture is new since the previous MRI of [**2131-4-7**].
Small foci of metastases are seen in T12 and L2 vertebral bodies.
CXR: Right hilar and lower paratracheal adenopathy, small right effusion and elevated right hemidiaphragm are evident on this conventional bedside radiograph taken with the patient supine.
I discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86072**] that the reference chest CT shows extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as well as the findings suggesting widespread malignancy.
No acute fracture or abnormal alignment identified.
Right hilar lesion, right pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy better evaluated on contrast-enhanced CT of the chest dated [**2131-5-4**].
Lytic lesion in T12 vertebral body concerning for metastatic disease.
MR brain for cyberknife planning: Unchanged 11-mm enhancing mass within the right cerebellar hemisphere may represent a metastatic lesion in this patient with known lung cancer with no additional intracranial metastatic lesions identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old woman with depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia and hypertension who presents with severe back pain after radiation therapy for metastatic malignancy, likely of lung origin given hilar mass.
Was found to have cauda equina syndrome and underwent emergent spinal fusion/laminectomy on Thursday, [**5-16**].
After patient was taken to the OR for cauda equina syndrome and underwent T11-L3 fusion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], she was sent to the surgical ICU for close monitoring.
Patient returned on Dilaudid PCA at 0.12 every 6 minutes with no basal rate; wound vac in place with minimal drainage.
# Back Pain: Found to have cauda equina syndrome, now s/p surgery (T11-L3 LAMINECTOMY WITH FUSION).
- Continue pain regimen as follows: * Fentanyl patch 75 mcg every 72 hours * Tylenol 1 gram every 6 hours * Lidoderm 5% patch daily * Tizanidine 2grams three times daily as needed (for muscle spasms) * Dilaudid 2-4mg by mouth every two hours as needed for pain * Dilaudid 0.125-1.5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain .
# Metastatic Disease: Pt was undergoing work-up to find the primary cause of her metastatic disease.
Given her smoking history and presence of hilar mass and lymphadenopathy, a pulmonary lesion was suspected.
Pt was going to undergo a mediastinoscopy with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, for sampling of hilar mass for primary disease work-up.
# Cerebellar Lesion: On her recent imaging, patient was noted to have a cerebellar lesion which was going to be assessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13014**] for possible cyberknife therapy as an outpatient.
Lovenox was initially held due to the spinal surgery.
Patient was resumed on Lovenox 60 mg twice daily for her extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She did have an episode of acute shortness of breath in the hospital that was likely due in part to another small pulmonary emboli while off Lovenox.
# Anxiety: Currently well-controlled.
Patient did become mildly delirious/confused with Ativan 1mg.
# Hypertension: Well-controlled on home medications although under significant pain currently - Continue atenolol for now - Control pain per regimen above .
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Dyspnea.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Dyspnea.
Tizanidine 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for spasm pain.
Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with severe back pain and was found to have dangerous compression of your spine (in the cauda equina, or tail, end) by cancer metastasis.
Your pain was managed, you worked with physical therapy and was prepared for Cyberknife to the metastasis to your brain.
Then OFF (last day: [**6-2**]) --> START Pantoprazole 40mg daily instead of Ranitidine for acid reflux --> START bowel regimen as narcotic pain medications can make you contipated --> CONTINUE Nebulizers (albuterol/ipratropium) to help with shortness of breath from the blood clots in your lungs --> START pain medication regimen as follows: * Fentanyl patch 75 mcg every 72 hours * Tylenol 1 gram every 6 hours * Lidoderm 5% patch daily * Tizanidine 2grams three times daily as needed (for muscle spasms) * Dilaudid 2-4mg by mouth every two hours as needed for pain * Dilaudid 0.125-1.5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain .
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
