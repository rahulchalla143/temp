There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output and increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Increased transaortic velocity secondary to high output and increased stroke volume, not aortic stenosis.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
The severity of aortic regurgitation has increased minimally.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2140-2-10**] 5:00 PM FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes when compared with prior and increasing bibasilar opacities.
There is indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, increased compared with prior.
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Lower lung volumes with indistinct pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2-12**]- FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change as to the massive bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities, right more than left.
No opacities have newly occurred.
No larger pleural effusions.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
EKG-[**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1955**] H [**Medical Record Number 107892**] M  85  [**2054-4-24**]  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2140-2-10**]  5:07:14 PM Sinus rhythm with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Otherwise, multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2140-2-11**]): Negative for Influenza B.
Video swallow ([**2140-2-15**]): VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: The study was conducted in collaboration with speech pathology.
There is silent aspiration with thin and nectar consistency.
There is a small amount of penetration or residuals seen with honey consistency.
There is no penetration or aspiration seen with ground or puree consistency.
There is a moderate amount of residue within the valleculae and piriform sinuses.
Moderate residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses.
Brief Hospital Course: 85M with a pmh of bronchiectasis, HTN, a-fib (on warfarin), s/p CVA, and neurofibromatosis who presents with hypoxia and tachypnea requiring NRB for ventilation and ICU stay through [**2-12**] for hypoxemia.
# Hypoxemia-multifactorial, but most likely initiated by aspiration pneumonia.
He had some acute diastolic heart failure with elevated BNP.
Initial CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
He was given IV lasix, and ruled out for MI (He was contined on metoprolol, ACEi, statin).
Speech and swallow ordered, and video swallow showed severe silent aspiration on all liquids, including honey-thickened.
# Aspiration, FEN: See above for aspiration as etiology of pneumonia.
# Chronic leukocytosis: He has had elevated WBC since at least [**2132**].
On admission, there was a left shift with 88% polys, probably due to acute infection (PNA) currently.
1 bottle of blood cultures from [**2140-2-10**] was positive for GPCs in clusters - felt to be contaminant.
If leukocytosis continues or worsens should consider hematology/oncology consult or further ID w/u.
# Paroxysmal A-Fib: Currently in sinus rhythm.
Cause of renal failure unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had episodic ARF with creat as high as 1.6.
# Urinary incontinence: He had urinary incontinence with stage I ulcer.
He denied any feelings of retention, bladder fullness, or pain.
However, he may be considered for a bladder scan for possible urinary retention with overflow; if he does have retention, you may consider flomax.
# HTN: continued on metoprolol .
# DVT PPX-on coumadin and therapeutic .
# Prophylaxis: anticoagulated with coumadin  # Access: peripheral IV x 2  # Communication: Patient, Wife [**Name (NI) 794**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 107893**], [**Name2 (NI) **]ter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 107894**], Son [**Name (NI) 401**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 107895**]  # Code: Full (discussed with patient on multiple occasions, including on [**2140-2-12**] upon transfer to floor).
He was briefly considered for DNR/DNI in the setting of severe aspiration, but upon long discussion with him and his family, he opted for PEG tube.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: acute bacterial aspiration pneumonia atrial fibrillation bronchiectasis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity status: Ambulatory with assist, needing physical therapy   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from your rehab facility with shortness of breath and found to have pneumonia.
You had a speech and swallow test which showed severe aspiration on all types of liquids, including honey-thickened.
You will continue to get your nutrition through your feeding tube, and you should have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation once your pneumonia is resolved.
Medication changes: 1.stopped megace 2.medications for constipation if needed 3.decreased warfarin to 1 mg daily, this may need to be increased for goal INR [**1-7**] .
