Admission Date:  [**2181-6-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-5-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Cholangiocarcinoma of the distal common bile duct.
Placement of gold fiducial seeds for CyberKnife therapy.
History of Present Illness: The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who presented with obstructive jaundice.
On endoscopic US and CT scan a 3 cm stricture of the distal bile duct was noted.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Prostate cancer with radiation therapy in [**2167**].
Physical Exam: On Discharge: Gen:NAD CVS:RRR, no m/r/g Resp: CTA b/l Abd:soft, NT/ND, subcostal surgical incision with steri strips, JP drain in place, J tube in place.
DIAGNOSIS: I.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A): Chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis.
Bile duct margin (B): No carcinoma seen.
B.  Adenocarcinoma involving 3 of 12 peripancreatic lymph nodes ([**2-2**]).
C.  Duodenal segment with focal periampullary foveolar metaplasia, acute inflammation and reactive epithelial changes.
RADIOLOGY: [**2181-6-7**] CHEST PORT: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], there are substantially lower lung volumes with atelectatic changes at the left base.
Free air likely consistent with recent surgery.
Free fluid within the abdomen.
Peripancreatic fluid collections and stranding adjacent to the surgical site may represent post-operative fluid; however, pseudocyst and leak cannot be completely excluded.
Minimal dilation of proximal loops of small bowel measuring up to 4 cm, with transition point not clearly identified may represent post-operative ileus; however, cannot rule out small bowel obstruction.
Small segment of small bowel appears thickened within the left upper quadrant and may represent underdistension or may be secondary to post-operative changes.
Wall thickening at the gastrojejunal anastomosis likely represents post-operative edema.
Additionally, an area of lobulated thickened gastric fold at the GE junction is noted.
Multiple dilated loops of small bowel in conjunction with poor forward flow of contrast following injection of the J-tube are consistent with small bowel ileus.
There does not appear to be an obstruction at the entry site of the J-tube.
Poor gastric emptying with esophageal reflux.
**FINAL REPORT [**2181-6-10**]** MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2181-6-10**]):    No MRSA isolated.
On the same day, the patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) and open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).He was transferred to the SICU for postoperative respiratory insufficiency.
He had an episode of nausea and vomiting immediately after lunch, with persistent hiccupping.
The patient also experienced an episode of sinus tachychardia >130bpm, for which he was triggered.
A CT scan was performed on [**6-13**] (POD6) to evaluate for bowel obstruction which showed "minimal dilation of proximal loops of small bowel with transition point not clearly identified, questionable small bowel obstruction.
Small segment of small bowel appears thickened, wall thickening at the gastrojejunal anastomosis likely representing post-operative edema".
An UGI with small bowel follow through performed on [**6-14**] (POD7) showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel in conjunction with poor forward flow of contrast following injection of the J-tube, consistent with small bowel ileus.
A KUB was done done on [**6-18**] (POD11) to assess for obstruction:"persistent dilation of the small bowel, most likely representing ileus".
On POD12 a CT scan of the abdomen with PO and IV contrast was ordered for persistent failure to thrive and ileus on KUB with high JP amylase levels (2400): "thickening of a loop of small bowel just posterior to the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain and adjacent to the anastomotic site with the pancreas is minimally increased since [**2181-6-13**] and may represent postoperative changes".
At the time of discharge on POD15 ([**6-22**]), the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a clear liquid diet, tube feeds were up to the goal rate of 80 mL/hr, he was ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Postoperative respiratory insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
Please remove any remaining strips 7-10 days after surgery J tube care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
*Flush with 30 cc of water Q8H  JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
