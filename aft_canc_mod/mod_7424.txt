Mild fullness of pulmonary vessels again is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Degenerative changes about both shoulders and the thoracolumbar spine are again seen.
Brief Hospital Course: # Shortness of Breath - CXR on admission was suggestive of fluid overload vs infiltrate.
BNP was elevated (29,000's), making clinical presentation most consistent with acute on chronic hear failure, and thus she was diuresed.
Antibiotics were eventually discontinued on HD2 given significant improvement in respiratory status after diuresis and little concern for infection.
She was not labored or tachypneic with her breathing.
# Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130s on night of admission.
Metoprolol was initially held in setting of low blood pressures (see below) however, this was restarted as her pressures improved.
She was found to have an INR of 1.4 that was subtherapeutic, we continued on her home dose coumadin given renal failure and concurrent antibiotics.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was elevated at 2.1 from baseline in 1.6.
Thought to be pre-renal with a posible component from Multiple myeloma.
Thought to be due to minimal component of demand ischemia from hypotension in setting of renal failure.
Remained on aspirin, beta-blocker initially held in setting of low blood pressure but was then restarted.
# Hypotension: hypotensive on admission thought to be due to congestive heart failure vs. sepsis.
Pressures improved after initial treatment of acute heart failure.
# Depressed mental status: She was, at times, sleepy and difficult to arouse from sleep.
After discussion with the family and nursing facility, it was determined that this was her baseline mental status.
# Multiple myeloma - required no management during admission.
# Anemia: Likely due to multiple myeloma.
# Seizure Disorder: no seizure activity noted during ICU admission.
# COPD/chronic bronchitis: remained on home nebulizer treatment, given a burst of steroids for her treatment that does not need to be continued upon discharge.
