Admission Date:  [**2124-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-2-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-5-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: Known periampullary adenocarcinoma.
[**2124-1-26**]: Flexible bronchoscopy.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] was recently evaluated by my colleague when admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with obstructive jaundice.
He was managed there with an ERCP performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which demonstrated a large mass at the major papilla with a stricture the lower through the common bile duct, obviously concerning for malignancy.
He also underwent a CTA of the abdomen, which demonstrated the likely ampullary carcinoma with associated pancreatitis changes.
There was, however, no evidence of vascular involvement and no metastases to preclude the attempt at resection.
Today, Mr. [**Known lastname **] reports that he is eating okay, but finds that he has had diminished appetite as well as some abdominal pain going on since [**Month (only) **] with gradual increase in severity of the symptoms.
His abdomen is scaphoid with a well-healed umbilical incision from his umbilical hernia repair of several years ago.
LUNGS: CTA(B) COR: RRR ABD: (R)subcostal incision with staples c/d/i.
Right bundle-branch block.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age cannot be excluded.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-1-10**] no significant change.
[**2124-1-24**] CXR: No evidence of acute process.
Apparent narrowing of the lower trachea is more likely a projection of a posterior osteophyte,rather than a tracheal lesion.
There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
On this date, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with open pancreatic biopsy, cholecystectomy, fiducial placement, gastrojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for an intra-operative finding of ampullary cancer metastatic to common hepatic arterial lymph node, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Due to depressed mental status, the patient was brought to the PACU intubated.
The patient was re-intubated for hypercapnic respiratory distress.
Post re-intubation CXR revealed a small apparent narrowing of the trachea just distal to the tip of the ETT, conceivably related to recent preceding intubation.
The patient was transferred to the SICU in stable condition NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter in place, and a Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural for pain control.
Later, Fentanyl IV was added to the pain control regimen due to ineffective pain control.
On [**2124-1-26**], a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which did not show subglottic tracheal stenosis of the trachea endoscopically to any significant degree.
The mild extrinsic compression was felt to represent lymphadenopathy.
Neuro: As above, the patient ultimately received a Bupivacaine epidural with Fentanyl IV post-operatively with good effect and adequate pain control.
There were no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
He required multiple IV fluid boluses for low urine output and tachycardia with good response.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Remainder incision with staples c/d/i.
No antibiotic required.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
