She was admitted here from [**Date range (1) 85266**] for constipation, thought to be due to chronic narcotic use (fentanyl patches, dilaudid pca, tramadol, and oxycodone in recent past) for her multiple myeloma pain.

Last night there was some brown clots in the vomit.
She denies abdominal pain or feeling bloated.
An NG tube was placed with 700cc of bilious output.
She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, recent weight changes, rinorrhea, confusion, chest pain, SOB, urinary retention or dysuria, rash or joint pain.

Diffuse gaseous distension and borderline dilation of small bowel without evidence of obstruction.
Findings could represent ileus secondary to narcotic use.
Subtle nodularity and bronchial wall thickening in the RLL suggestive of aspiration.
Bilateral femoral head lucencies may represent multiple myeloma lesions.
Left pelvic sidewall mass extending through the left obturator foramen is concerning for plasmocytoma.
Gallstone within the gallbladder, but no evidence for cholecystitis.
[**2134-8-24**] KUB: Slight progression of diffuse gaseous distention of small bowel with increasingly collapsed colon distally, suggestive of ileus versus early or partial small-bowel obstruction.
No free air.
Large destructive lesion in the left humeral head extending into the diaphysis of the humerus as well as large external soft tissue component as described above.
Numerous additional lesions with and without soft tissue component, including incompletely imaged lesions in the cervical spine.
Findings are consistent with stated history of multiple myeloma.
Small left pleural effusion.
[**2134-8-30**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia.
Small left pleural effusion and erosion of the right humeral head.
[**2134-8-30**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
On the floor, the patient's NGT remained in for 24 hours, with minimal residuals.
Her hospital course was marked by increasing nausea/vomiting when her narcotics were provided, and a KUB on hospital day 4 revealed an ileus consistent with medications.
#DVT: On admission CT scan she was found to have a R common femoral vein DVT.
On [**2134-8-22**] there was difficulty obtaining blood draws and monitoring her PTT.
Her lovenox was held on [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] out of concern for a LGIB (?
LGIB versus bleeding hemorroid), but was restarted on [**9-5**].
On [**2134-8-22**], the patient (through her family) reported a significant increase in her joints where she is known to have lytic lesions.
Given her continued nausea and poor PO intake, a KUB was done and revealed an ileus.
Rad-onc and heme-onc were consulted for palliative radiation and chemotherapy, in an effort to wean her off pain meds.
A CT of her shoulder revealed significant lytic lesions, and rad-onc felt it was amenable to XRT as an outpatient (started [**9-2**]).
#Multiple myeloma: The abdominal/pelvic CT revealed a mass concerning for a plasmacytoma.
No further workup on this mass was done.
An appointment was made to be seen as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 18**] oncology, but her new medical problems during this hospitalization prompted involvement of the inpatient heme-onc consult service.
Her lasix and amlodipine was held on [**8-21**] after a BP of 99/38 and poor PO intake.
#[**Month/Year (2) 2320**]: She was hypoglycemic on the floor initially, requiring dextrose 50% and glucagon per hypoglycemia protocol.
#Anemia: At the time of her [**2134-8-18**] discharge her Hct was 34.4, thought to be due to her chronic disease.
There was a question of heme-positive residuals from her NGT, but this could not be verified.
Because she was on lovenox and noted to have dark maroon stools, it was suspected that she had a LGIB.
Her hct then stabilized and her bleeding was thought to be due to her hemorrhoid.
#Wound care: Noted on admission to have a clean wound on coccyx.
Subsequently noted to have ecchymotic perianal tissue, described as 2 small open areas at 3 and 7 o'clock, also 0.2 cm pink ulcer on large external hemorrhoid.
On hospital day 11 she wound care noted significant blistering in the skin folds of her breast and groin, as well as an ulcerous periurethral lesion.
Derm did not suspect HSV for her periurethral lesion.
#Afib: Was tachycardic on [**8-30**], thought to be due to dehydration in the setting of poor PO intake.
She remained asymptomatic, denying chest pain or shortness of breath.
An EKG revealed no ischemic changes or R heart strain.
A CXR revealed no focal consolidation.
An echo showed moderate LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%), increased LV filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), and no evidence of R ventricular strain or wall motion abnormalities.
#ACS/Demand Ischemia: Elevated troponins x 2.
No EKG changes suggestive of MI; elevated enzymes thought to be due to new-onset afib.
The ASA and lovenox were held on [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] out of concern for a LGIB (?
LGIB versus bleeding hemorroid), but restarted on [**9-5**].
#hyponatremia- Pt noted to have Na 126 and remained stable; initially thought to be hypovolemic hyponatremia but did not respond to IVF.
Pt had urine lytes which showed an SIADH picture.
#Decreased urinary output: On [**9-2**] she was noted to have decreased urine output, thought to be due to decreased intravascular volume in the setting of poor PO intake.
A foley was placed (rather than having to repeatedly straight cath her given her periurethral lesion), and she had adequate UOP following IVF.
Her pain was addressed with the standing tylenol described above.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: N/V secondary to narcotic-related ileus, R common femoral DVT, perianal wound Secondary: Multiple myeloma, HTN, diabetes II, anemia   Discharge Condition: Ms. [**Known lastname 85265**] is being discharged from the hospital in stable condition, at normal mental status (per her family) and in a wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 85265**],  You were admitted to the hospital with concern for your nausea and vomiting.
After an evaluation consisting of a history, physical exam, imaging and blood tests, it was suspected that it was due to your high levels of pain medications.
The CT scan showed no physical obstruction.
We decreased the doses of your pain medications, and it appeared that your nausea and vomiting improved.
The CT of your abdomen also showed a blood clot in your right leg.
During your hospitalization your heart rate was noted to be in an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You were also found to have a silent heart attack, which may have been due to the demand on your heart from the fast heart rate.
Started Miconazole powder for a rash 13.
Started Tramadol 50mg as needed for pain 14.
Once you complete your stay at rehab and make a decision regarding further desire for chemo or radiation, please call [**Hospital1 18**] for an appointment in oncology.
