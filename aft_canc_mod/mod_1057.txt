Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy demonstrated a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.
Mediastinoscopy was negative for mediastinal involvement.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by respiratory insufficiency requiring intubation.

There was no significant reduction of the tumor mass at the tracheobronchial angle.
Possible myocardial infarction.
