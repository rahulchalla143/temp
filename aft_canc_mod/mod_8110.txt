No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
They may be mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Trivial , central valvular mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no evidence of a central 1st-3rd order pulmonary embolism.
Embolism distal to this level cannot be excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly enlarged since [**2114-8-14**].
Mild stable left upper lobe atelectasis.
Sternal wound and probable associated anterior chest wall fluid collection/cellulitis consistent with the given history of recurrent sternal wound infection and recent debridement.
[**2114-8-21**] CT Head: Unchanged size and appearance of right frontal extra-axial mass, likely a meningioma, with unchanged surrounding edema and mass effect.
No evidence of new intracranial abnormalities.
No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.
No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old W with hypertension, diabetes mellitus II, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, pulmonary embolism, porcine mitral valve replacement and coronary artery disease status-post CABG ([**2112**]) complicated by chronic sternal wound infection with multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase E Coli who presented from rehab with fever and was found to have ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, and MDR Pseudomonas in her sternal wound.
On [**8-20**] she went for surgical debridement of her chronic wound by Plastic Surgery.
After which, she had a wound vac in place.
The patient's extended hospital course was complicated by an episode of tachycardia (appeared to be multifocal atrial tachycardia), hypotension, and altered mental status for which she was transferred to the ICU.
She had evidence of an NSTEMI, likely secondary to increased demand in the setting of tachycardia.
An echocardiogram revealed no changes.
Daptomycin was added for increased antibiotic coverage, but then removed after the patient improved relatively quickly with little intervention except for hydration, then lasix, and metoprolol for heart rate control.
She did have a drop in hematocrit for which she received 1U PRBC with an appropriate response.
Stools were guaiac negative, hemolysis and DIC labs were also negative.
Plastic Surgery was concerned for possible gallbladder pathology and requested a RUQ ultrasound, which revealed a midly thick gallbladder with mobile gallstone and no other evidence of acute cholecystitis.
A Chest CT showed no change in her sternal wound, no evidence of fluid collection.
Given that the wound was the likely source of her bacteremia, she underwent debridement on [**8-20**] by Plastic Surgery with subsequent wound vac placement.
Her wound appears to be healing well.
Her pain was controlled with 0.5 of IV morphine.
She will also need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Plastic Surgery, and with the Infectious Disease specialists, as specified in his dischrage worksheet.
# Anticoagulation: Given her history of venous thromboembolisms while on Coumadin, mitral valve replacement, and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was placed on an argatroban drip prior to and after her surgical procedure.
# Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has had a slowly increasing creatinine (1.1 on day of discharge, 0.5-0.6 baseline) secondary to poor PO intake and low volume status.
She will need monitoring of her kidney function by repeat creatinine measurements, and likely future re-initiation of her anti-hypertensives once her volume status corrects and kidney injury resolves.
Also, the patient has needed frequent repletion of her potassium and magnesium during her hospitalization, likely due to poor nutritional status and being on diuretics.
# Anemia: The patient has a chronic, normocytic anemia that slowly trended downwards during her admission.
Her stools were guaiac negative, and she had no evidence of hemolysis or DIC.
# Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate has been elevated since admission, and does not correlate with the sensation of dyspnea.
This appears to be chronic in nature, perhaps secondary to her severe kyphosis and an element of anxiety.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism seen on two different chest CTA.
Her CXRs were negative for pneumonia or signs of fluid overload.
Occasionally she complained of dyspnea, and wheezes were heard on pulmonary exam.
# DMII: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.
# CAD: NSTEMI in MICU as described above.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued lorazepam and aripiprazole.
# Considerations: This patient has baseline poor functional status.
Upon presentation she was wheelchair bound, unable to walk unassisted, unable to climb a flight of stairs.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Q6H as needed for anxiety.
Hydroxyzine 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] as needed for itchiness.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital for fevers and found to have an infection in your [**Known lastname **] and your sternal wound.
