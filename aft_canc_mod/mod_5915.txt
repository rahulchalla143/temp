Expereicned increased lethargy.
Patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 29694**]/11 with anemia [**1-13**] chemo and/or bony mets and an elevated white count.
Urinalysis had trace leuks, neg nitrates and WBC 14 with few bacteria.
She was bolused 3L NS without improvement, so a femoral line was placed and levophed was started.
CXR was read as extensive metastatic disease to the lungs with right pleural effusion and right basal consolidation.
The team spoke with pt's oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3459**] who was concerned this pleural effusion could be due to radiation pneumonitis, rec adding solumedrol to her regimen.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old woman diagnosed with pneumonia in [**2117-6-11**].
She failed to improve after multiple courses of antibiotics and eventually a CT scan of the chest on [**2117-7-27**] demonstrated consolidation of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe with narrowing of the bronchus intermedius.
However, there was extensive extrinsic compression.
[**2117-8-20**]: underwent a third bronchoscopy, biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma with LVI, and pathology from 4 lymph nodes also contained adenocarcinoma.
The patient had a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out PE for complaints of worsening shortness of breath and it revealed substantial consolidation in the right middle lobe with the right lower mass, now measuring up to 15 cm, although some of that may have been collapse of the right lower lobe.
[**2117-9-2**]:PET scan at the [**Hospital3 **] revealed extensive bony metastases in the large right lung mass, also there is an FDG avid adrenal nodule.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3460**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Radiation Oncology and chest simulation was planned for [**Date range (1) 98517**]/11: While inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**] evalulation of R hip demonstrated intramedullary tumor in the femur, but the cortex was intact.

No pulmonary embolism.
Large mass in the right lung with invasion of the hilar and the mediastinum.
Innumerable metastatic lung nodules.
An area of consolidation at the left lung base has minimally increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yof with metastatic NSCLC presenting with shortness of breath, hypoxia and hypotension.
CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, and no evidence of radiation pneumonitis, and so steroids were discontinued on HD2.
No clear etiology was discovered as CTA was negative for PE, her cardiac function appeared intact and no evidence of sepsis was observed.
NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER ??????
ANEMIA - chronic component, with additional decline.
No evidence for acute blood loss.
