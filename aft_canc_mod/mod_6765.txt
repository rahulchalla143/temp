Admission Date:  [**2154-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-4-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info 82431**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**5-10**] craniotomy for tumor resection   History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 47yF who had witnessed seizures after being found down in her bed by her fiance.
Allegedly, according to her fiance, she has been in good health until yesterday when she complained of a headache.
EMS found the patient flaccid on her L side and noticed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the field.
III, IV, VI: unable to assess V, VII: unable to assess VIII: unable to assess IX, X: unable to assess [**Doctor First Name 81**]: unable to assess XII: unable to assess  does not open eyes to commands / pain  Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally.
L side with 4+/5 strength though will again move spontaneously and withdraw from noxious stimuli  Sensation: grossly intact to painful stimuli in all extremitites  Toes upgoing on right, difficulty with assessing left due to agitation ON DISCHARGE O: T:98.3  BP: 113/71  HR: 82  R 18   O2Sats 98% on R/A Gen: Comfortable, In no acute distress HEENT: Pupils: 4.0mm to 3.0mm RRLA Neck: Supple.
No JVD or upstrokes Lungs: CTA bilat.
The lung volumes are low, but there is no focal consolidation.
Minimal density at the left costophrenic angle may suggest a small effusion, consolidation, or atelectasis.
The osseous structures and surrounding soft tissues demonstrate no abnormality.
FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there were long periods of generalized slowing of the background in the delta and low theta ranges.
There was no predominant posterior rhythm evident in this recording.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the alternating patterns of mild slowing of the background, attenuation of the background, and spindle pattern suggestive of a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
There were no clear lateralized features in this  recording and no epileptiform features.
This pattern is not suggestive of a non-convulsive status epilepticus pattern.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; OUTSIDE FILMS READ ONLY [**5-3**]   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 82432**] Reason: please second read  Final Report   FINDINGS: There is a calcified lesion within the right frontal region, measuring approximately 2 cm, the exact margins are difficult to determine, as well as its exact location whether intra-axial or extra-axial.
If this is intra-axial, oligodendroglioma would be a consideration, further characterization with MR is suggested.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normal midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells reveal mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus, as well as patchy opacification of the ethmoid sinuses.
No osseous erosion or irregularity is seen in the region of the lesion in the right frontal region.
IMPRESSION: Calcified lesion in the right frontal region, difficult to determine whether intra-axial or extra-axial, with mild surrounding vasogenic edema.
If intra-axial, consideration could be oligodendroglioma.
Radiology Report MR FUNCTIONAL BRAIN BY PHYS/PSYCH Study Date of [**2154-5-6**] 1:55 PM   Provisional Findings Impression: RXRa WED [**2154-5-8**] 10:17 AM PFI: There is evidence of a left frontal intra-axial lesion with small areas of heterogeneous signal as demonstrated previously on the MRI dated [**2154-5-4**].
A possible supplementary area is identified in the medial convexity (401:6).
During the movement of the left hand there is evidence of some areas of activation adjacent to the lesion, likely representing venous contamination, the activation area during the movement of the right hand appears within normal limits.

She was intubated at an OSH and came to [**Hospital1 18**] on propofol after CT revealed new Right Frontal Brain mass.
Her exam did not readily improve and there was concern for sub-clinical seizure.
Her EEG showed global slowing without spikes.
She was transfered to floor status and evaluated by speech for dysphagia.
The patient subsequently tolerated good POs and was cleared by PT for discharge.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: [**12-21**] Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for headache.
?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
?New onset of tremors or seizures.
?Any confusion or change in mental status.
?Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
?Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
?Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-28**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
