Some areas of increased opacification was seen in the right mid and lower zones, consistent most likely with atelectasis.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-27**] 1:55 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no change in the small apical pneumothorax on the right following clamping of the chest tube.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2163-2-28**] at 2:38:43 PM      FINAL  Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-11-4**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-28**] 5:32 AM FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of right-sided pigtail catheter.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax likely still persists.
Bilateral areas of atelectasis are again noted to be increased bilaterally and there maty be increasing vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HL, AAA s/p repair, known prior stage I lung adenoCA s/p limited resection with new RLL lung mass along with multiple ground glass opacities with new RLL lesion showing new squamous cell CA, admitted with hypotensiona and fever concerning for pna.
Despite treatment with antibitoics, however, she developed worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress which required intubation.
She became intermittently hypotensive while intubated and required vasopressors.
Her ICU course was complicated by bilateral infiltrates on chest xray which were ultimately thought to represent ARDS vs. pulmonary edema.
She also suffered a demand myocardial infarction in the ICU with resultant apical hypokinesis on echocardiography.
Given her underlying cancer, which was known to be progressing, and the severity of her acute illness with refractory respiratory failure, possible ARDS, and ongoing hypotension, many family meetings took place with members of the ICU team.
