DETAILS OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with a history of obstructive jaundice.
The patient was discharged home after placement of the tubes and subsequently returns with inability to eat and unable to keep up with the transhepatic catheter output.
Cardiac examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm without murmurs.
There was no leakage from around the catheter sites, slight pericatheter cellulitis, no abdominal discomfort, no hepatosplenomegaly.
On hospital day one, he developed marked shortness of breath and hypotension, and blood pressure dropped into the 70s.
His hematocrit remained stable at 30, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with a presumptive diagnosis of biliary sepsis.
The chest x-ray demonstrated a large right sided pleural effusion and the chest tube was placed with return of greater than 2 liters of clear fluid.
We were concerned that the right pleural effusion was biliary effusion secondary to malposition of the catheter, but the chemical analysis of the fluid did not confirm this.
On hospital day three, he developed marked azotemia with an increase in his creatinine to 37.2 and oliguria.
We were concerned that due to his markedly elevated bilirubin and cholangiocarcinoma, he may in-fact be developing hepatorenal syndrome.
We continued his resuscitation and then gradually over the course of the next several days, his oliguria and azotemia improved.
Due to patient's poor medical condition and probable unresectable disease due to his marked jaundice, we did not believe that he was an operative candidate in light of the ongoing blood pressure problems and we believe that he would not make it to surgery.
