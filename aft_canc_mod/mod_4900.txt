History of Present Illness: The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with a suspicious right upper lobe nodule.
ETOH: none  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T: 98.3  HR: 73 SR  BP: 100-124/60  Sats: 94% RA  WT: 130.5 lbs ([**2119-1-24**]) General: 73 year-old male in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple.
subcutaneous emphysema bilateral cervical area Card: RRR Resp: decrease breath sounds bilateral, no wheezes, subcutaneous emphysema right lung area GI: benign Extr: warm no edema Incision: right thoracotomy site clean dry, intact, margins well approximated no erythema Neuro: awake, alert, oriented.
Again extensive gas overlying the right chest and along the right chest wall and neck greatly obscures detail.
There may be a small residual pneumothorax.
[**2119-1-21**] & [**2119-1-22**]: stable tiny right apical pneumothorax with stable subcutaneous emphysema [**2119-1-20**]: interval placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter within the upper apex.
The previously seen pneumothorax is not well appreciated; however, this is partially due to the subcutaneous emphysema throughout the right chest wall.
There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm [**2119-1-19**]: There is no evidence of left-sided apical pneumothorax.
The previously identified postoperative local apical pneumothorax status post recent VATS procedure remains stable.
It may have decreased slightly.
[**2119-1-18**]: There is no evidence of left-sided apical pneumothorax.
The previously identified postoperative local apical pneumothorax status post recent VATS procedure remains stable.
It may have decreased slightly.
The previously described mostly right-sided chest wall emphysema continues again into the lower neck area bilaterally and is still very prominent.
No new abnormalities are identified [**2119-1-17**]: There is slight increase in right apical pneumothorax, and expected slight decrease in size of a post-operative hematoma continuous with the right upper mediastinal contour.
There has been no interval development of consolidation or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in right apical pneumothorax.
[**2119-1-15**]: Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, including the known right pneumothorax, right paramediastinal parenchymal consolidation, periatrial gas inclusion, and position of the right chest tube.
10R lymph node (A-C):  No malignancy identified.
11R lymph node (D-E): No malignancy identified.
Level 7 lymph node (H-K): Lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.
Peri-nodal fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue, fibrinous exudate and foreign body giant cell reaction; consistent with prior surgery.
V. 4R lymph node (L): Fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation, fibrinous exudate, and granulation tissue, consistent with prior surgery; no malignancy identified.
Right upper lobe (M-AG): 1.
Ten (10) peri-hilar/peri-bronchial lymph nodes, all with no malignancy identified.
While in the PACU he developed respiratory distress oxygen saturations 70% requiring NRB oxygen saturation 88-90%.
Subcutaneous emphysema slowly improving.
Chest-tube: persistent air leak continued on water-seal until improved.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema with right apical pneumothorax.
A pigtail was placed on [**2119-1-20**] to suction with residual small apical pneumothorax.
On [**2119-1-21**] he was placed to water-seal, right apical pneumothorax stable, clamping trial was done, follow-up chest film showed possible tiny apical pneumothorax.
Chest film: followed by serial chest films which showed right apical pneumothorax small right pleural effusion.
His chest film today showed increased subcutaneous emphysema with decreased right apical pneumothorax which was stable on further films.
Cardiac: Sinus tachycardia 110's.
BAL & Sputum were sent with no growth.
Pan culture no growth.
His WBC elevated secondary to steroids.
Pain: APS managed Bupivaiane/Dilaudid Epidural which was changed to Bupivacaine only secondary to hallucinations.
The epidural was removed on [**1-17**] and he transitioned to PO pain medication with good control  Neuro: episodes of anxiety treated with low-dose lorzapam, hullicinations which was self-limiting.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
13. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for anxiety.
15. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4470**] HealthCare Center at [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -Right upper lobe nodule -CMY: EF 20%, mod dilated LV, severe global hypokinesis, severe LV diastolic dysfunction.
