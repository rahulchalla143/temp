Admission Date:  [**2120-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-11-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**] Chief Complaint: GI bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy with small-bowel resection and primary anastomosis.
History of Present Illness: 48 year old female with a history of recurrent GI bleeds felt to be secondary to NSAID induced ulceration who presents with increased fatigue and shortness of breath, found to be anemic.
Ms. [**Known lastname 32130**] was hospitalized in [**Month (only) **] for melena and acute anemia with profound drop in hematocrit to 21 from unclear baseline.
Her presentation was in the setting of recent prescription of meloxicam for lateral epicondylitis.
An EGD performed during that admission did not reveal a source of bleeding, and a capsule study was attempted but terminated early secondary to equipment malfunction.
She also had a GI bleed in [**2118**], thought to be secondary to NSAIDs.
EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] at that time also did see a source of active bleeding, but noted a Schatzki ring in distal esophagus and diverticuli in sigmoid colon.
She notes that over the past two days she has become increasingly fatigued and short of breath with activity.
She reports pain in the center of her stomach which is [**2-22**], "small zaps" and like "champagne bubbles."
Pain is not associated with nausea or vomiting, and she has had a normal appetite.
She notes dark/black stools since sunday, which are different than her dark stools with iron.
Physical exam was significant for black guaiac positive stool.
Patient was comfortable, reporting [**2-22**] central stomach pain, no lightheadedness, no chest pain or shortness of breath.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: # Recurrent GI bleed [**2-14**] NSAIDs with no clear source identified ([**2120-11-12**], [**2118-12-13**])- diverticuli of sigmoid colon and descending colon, schatzki's ring in distal esophagus on EGD/colonoscopy in [**2118**] # Asthma # Seasonal allergies # Occasional GERD with spicy foods # Dysmenorrhea .
Tobacco: none Alcohol: occasional red wine Illicits: negative Exercise: 4x/day - walking, biking and yoga   Family History: No FH of bleeding disorder, colon or GI malignancy or IBD.
Father -  primary hyperparathyroidism, cardiomyopathy, DM, HTN Grandparents lived to 90's.
Enhancing intraluminal and extraluminal bilobed mass within the mid to proximal jejunum, corresponding to the mass observed on endoscopy.
No masses are present in the duodenum.
Numerous lymph nodes within the mesentery, but none are pathologically enlarged.
No active bleeding from this jejunal mass or elsewhere in the GI tract.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Free fluid in the deep pelvis may be due to a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst in the right adnexa.
Small hiatal hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo F with history of recurrent GI bleeds presenting with fatigue and anemia.
As recent EGD was negative and patient has no risk factors for UGIB (no NSAID use, infrequent alcohol use), low suspicion for esophageal or gastric source.
In addition, colonoscopy in [**2118**] showed only diverticuli, which may be source of bleed but unlikely as they were in sigmoid colon and patient denies any obviously bloody stool.
Therefore, a tagged RBC scan was performed, which showed slow bleed in the distal jejunum/proximal ileum.
The acute care surgery service was consulted and she was found to have a bilobed 4.4 x 2.4 cm mass in her jejunum.
She was taken to the OR on [**2121-1-3**] and had an ex-lap and small bowel resection.
She had no further bleeds and was able to be discharged home with appropriate follow-up instructions and warning signs  # Anemia: Normocytic anemia, most likely due to acute/subacute blood loss.
Likely source of bleeding to be the SB mass as described above.
Post-operatively, she had no bleeding and her hematocrits were stable until discharge.
Resolved with transfusions and fluid resuscitation.
# Leukocytosis: Likely related to stress reaction and demargination from GIB.
# Asthma: No shortness of breath or wheezing on admission.
Advair HFA  Inhalation   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intestinal bleeding with identification of a 4-cm small bowel mass at the level of the jejunum.
