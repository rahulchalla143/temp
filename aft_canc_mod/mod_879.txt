HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old woman with a history of moderate/severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism, non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma and status post CVP chemotherapy two weeks ago.
She was admitted on [**2189-2-18**], onto the Oncology Service secondary to trigeminal neuralgia and difficulty taking p.o.
The patient was followed by the Pain Service and was tried on numerous therapeutic modalities including Dilaudid PCA, a neuropathic pain [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and subcutaneous and intravenous narcotics.
By hospital day number two, the patient's transaminases were elevated with a mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase and T-bili.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed mild dilatation of the common bile duct status post cholecystectomy as well as a heterogenous liver which was a non-specific finding.
The patient was scheduled for possible endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography and had spiked a low grade temperature up to 101.6 F., with white count rising from 5 to 21.
The GI Team felt that the patient most likely did not have a cholangitis and other sources of infection were sought out.
The patient was found to have an enterococcal urinary tract infection greater than 100,000 colonies, sensitive to Ampicillin.
The patient was placed on Ampicillin but continued to have difficulty with pain control due to the trigeminal neuralgia.
She was followed by the neurology and pain service but was unable to have good pain control without associated sedation.
She attempted a nerve block adn a variety of medications for neuropathic pain without success.
In the setting of her increasing pain med requirements, the patient developed a decrease in mental status.
Chest x-ray revealed new focal left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient had crackles in the left lower lobe and she was given intravenous Lasix with 1.0 liters of urine output.
Due to the patient's aortic stenosis, the patient's systolic blood pressures decreased to the mid-80s and she was brought to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her aspiration pneumonia and her hypotension.
The patient was initially volume resuscitated and was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl in addition to ampicillin both for her enterococcal urinary tract infection as well as for the aspiration pneumonia.
Over the next three or four days, her oxygen requirement decreased and her mental status improved significantly as she metabolized all of her narcotics.
She however once again complained of escalating pain from her trigeminal neuralgia that prevented her from talking and eating.
The patient was readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit [**2189-3-6**] after having a repeat aspiration event.
Chest x-ray revealed mild congestive heart failure and a worsening of her aspiration.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit once again for hypotension with systolic blood pressures as low as 60, and worsening mental status in the setting of an aspiration event.
The patient's code status was changed to "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" "DO NOT INTUBATE" with no pressors.
Low grade lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's Grade 1 out of 3, treated with Rituxan, status post one dose of CVP on [**2-12**]; diagnosis of lymphoma was made in [**2188-11-22**].
Aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 cm squared.
Cardiac examination with a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Lungs with fine crackles at bases.
Abdomen with positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding.
Extremities with no edema.
During the second Intensive Care Unit admission, the patient's systolic blood pressure was extremely low and the family had requested no heroic measures including cardioversion, intubation or pressors.
The patient was volume resuscitated but remained hypoxic mostly due to her aortic stenosis.
She was deep suctioned aggressively and her hypercarbia and hypoxia resolved over the next two days.
She was treated with Vancomycin and given Gram positive cocci found in the sputum as well as a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl times ten days.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the rest of her Intensive Care Unit stay.
Due to her aspiration events, the patient was considered for a PEG tube.
The patient deferred given the fact that her husband had a PEG tube and had numerous complications from it and had died due to the complications of infection from the PEG.
The patient has been followed by the pain service throughout her entire stay and was followed and evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in Neurosurgery.
Next, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] believed that gamma knife surgery also was not appropriate since it would provide mild to moderate relief of her pain and may take up to two or three months to provide full benefit.
The patient needs substantial and immediately relief of her trigeminal neuralgia pain because she is at great risk of continued aspiration of her oral secretions and recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
The pain service continued the patient on a Lidocaine drip for 48 hours in the Intensive Care Unit since there have been few studies which have revealed that 48 hours of Lidocaine infusion can cause the trigeminal ganglion be deactivated, resulting in substantial benefit in the patient's pain.
The patient was continued on the Lidocaine drip with substantial decrease in her pain and was able to speak once again.
The patient was also placed on three days of Toradol and it was decided that the patient should not have any intravenous narcotics whatsoever and the patient should only have subcutaneous medications at a very low dose given her age and her inability to clear these medications effectively, and the problem with decreased mental status.
The patient's pain issues would be treated by the geriatricians and the primary medicine team that is picking up her care after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient also sustained a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction during her initial Intensive Care Unit admission.
The patient did not have any further EKG changes during her second Intensive Care Unit stay.
The patient continued to have decreased urine output throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay and given her aortic stenosis could not be bolused because she goes into pulmonary edema quite readily.
The patient did not want a PEG tube to be placed and J-tube placements had been considered and tried on the floor, but during the patient's mental status changes, she had a tendency to pull out the NG tube and it was decided that this was unsafe.
After a long talk with the family as well as the patient's lawyer, it was decided that the most appropriate code status for the patient would be "DO NOT RESUSCITATE", "DO NOT INTUBATE", no pressors.
If this does happen, the family has a strong desire to pursue Hospice level of care and does not wish the patient to have recurrent aspiration pneumonias, and understands that if her oral secretions cannot be controlled quite well with medical therapies due to her trigeminal neuralgia, that Hospice care would be preferable to recurrent aspiration events.
