NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-12**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait.
Pertinent Results: Stress Test [**2105-4-30**]: IMPRESSION: Poor exercise tolerance and marked drop in exercise tolerance from ETT in [**2101**].
Test terminated secondary to hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise low level exercise.
Ischemic ECG changes in the absence of typical anginal symptoms with nonspecific ST segment changes.
Cardiac Perfusion [**2105-4-30**]: IMPRESSION: New small, fixed, moderate apical and distal septal defect correlating with reversible abnormality on the prior study but with normal LV cavity size and preserved ejection fraction of 63%.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no lesions.
The LAD had a 40% stenosis in the proximal segment and 90-100% lesions in the mid segment.
The diagonal branch had a 90% origin stenosis.
The LCx was diffusely diseased with a tubular and beaded 90% lesion leading to a large OM2.
The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid segment and a 70% stenosis in the distal vessel.
The PDA was occluded, but appeared to have faint anterograde flow.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 20 mm Hg, LVEDP 26 mm Hg).
The PCWP mean was moderately elevated at 31 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (PASP 51 mm Hg).
The systemic arterial blood pressure was mildly elevated (SBP 140 mm Hg).
There was no evidence of restrictive or constrictive physiology.
There was no evidence of intracardiac shunt by oximetry.
Left ventriculography demonstrated low-normal LV function (EF 50%) and moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
CXR PA/lat [**2105-5-4**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by a pectus deformity.
Main and hilar pulmonary arteries are not enlarged and pulmonary vascularity generally is not engorged.
There is a small volume of right pleural fluid.
Carotid series [**2105-5-5**]: Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2105-5-5**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of recent infection, malignancy, or overhydration.
Uncharacteristic scars in the lung parenchyma, no recent infection.
Moderate dilatation of the upper esophagus.
