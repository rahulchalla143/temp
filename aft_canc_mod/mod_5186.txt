Patient initially presented with dysphagia and required a stent.
Patient returned to the hospital with coffee ground emesis and KUB showed that the stent migrated to his stomach.
Cholangitis:  Patient had elevated total bilirubin.
This was thought to be due to progressive cancer and he was not thought to be candidate for stent.
Mental status changes:  This was likely a combination of narcotics, elevated total bilirubin, anxiolytics.
As the patient developed toxic metabolic confusion and was agitated and combative, we increased risperdal to 1 mg [**Hospital1 **] and used haldol.
