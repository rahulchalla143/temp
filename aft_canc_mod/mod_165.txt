Admission Date:  [**2103-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-5-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-7-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**] Chief Complaint: hyponatremia: transfer from OSH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 79 yo m with head and neck cancer s/p treatment with radiation/chemo who presents with hyponatremia.
Last evening patient's sodium was 116 with no confusion.
Of note, Pt recently recieved amoxicillin for increased mucous (started on friday) after which he began to have diarrhea as well as increased residuals on sat.
Additionally, no acute neurological events were witnessed by medical staff such as seizures, acute delerium etc.
Past Medical History: throat ca dx [**12-31**]- poorly differentiated ca, s/p erbotox and xrt  CABG [**2-26**], 4V (echo [**4-28**]: nl ef) HTN Atrial fibrillation - on sotalol s/p cardioversion- discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7516**] his PCP who reports that he was very difficult to rate control and would like us to hold off on stopping sotalol unless necessary.
vision loss s/p L carotid endartectomy   Social History: lives in [**Location **] with wife married 51 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**], previously an investment banker, no etoh, tobacco currently, had 100 pack years of tobacco then switch to pipe 30 years ago until [**2100**].
[**2103-5-2**] 11:20 am URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2103-5-3**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2103-5-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CXR [**2103-5-2**]: AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Sternal closure devices and mediastinal clips are seen suggestive of prior CABG.
The thoracic aorta is tortuous and the cardiac silhouette is enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
There is increased interstitial opacity in the right upper lobe.
No pleural effusions are seen; there is some pleural abnormality - thickening versus fluid - on the left.
Increased interstitial markings with some confluent areas in the right upper lobe; the sharp demarcation of this area is consistent with prior radiation therapy, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Tracheal deviation to the left suggestive of a right superior mediastinal mass.
Comparison to prior studies is recommended, or alternatively a chest CT for further evaluation.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and additional history of throat cancer with prior radiation therapy was obtained.
A dense opacity projecting over the right apex may be slightly increased in density when compared to initial radiographic assessment and may reflect radiation changes.
More subtle left apical opacity is unchanged.
Increased opacity noted at the right base may reflect asymmetric edema versus developing consolidatopn/atelectasis and left-side pleural effusion has slightly increased in size from most recent radiograph.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
Biapical opacity, right > left, with apparent increase on the right compared to recent CXRs.
Although possibly due to evolving post- XRT changes given history of recent XRT therapy, correlation with portal suggested as well as comparison to outside studies would be helpful to exclude an acute infection such as TB developing in an area of radiation treatment.
Increased left-sided pleural effusion and slight worsening right effusion and adjacent basilar opacity.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT [**2103-5-6**]: No mass lesion, shift of normal midline structures, hydrocephalus, or major vascular territorial infarct is seen.
There is a small hypodense area within the left temporal lobe measuring 10 x 6 mm which is best seen on series 5, image 14.
This most likely represents an area of old lacunar infarct.
However, there is a hypodense area within the left temporal lobe measuring 10 x 6 mm which most likely represents an old lacunar infarct.
MR HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST [**2103-5-7**]: There is no slow [**Month/Day/Year 3631**] to indicate an acute infarct.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There are sulcal and ventricular prominence due to generalized brain atrophy.
There is fluid in the mastoid sinus air cells bilaterally, a finding that could be consistent with acute mastoiditis in the correct clinical setting.
No enhancing abnormalities are noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute infarct or enhancing abnormality.
Mild amounts of chronic microvascular ischemic change.
Fluid in the mastoid sinus air cells bilaterally could be consistent with acute mastoiditis in the correct clinical setting.
EEG [**2103-5-6**]: FINDINGS: BACKGROUND: During wakefulness, a 10 Hz alpha frequency posterior dominant rhythm was seen bilaterally.
One instance of body jerking was noted by the technologist which did not have any electrographic correlate.
There were occasional faster activity primarily in the temporal regions bilaterally, which correlated with mouth movements, most likely due to muscle artifacts.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to abnormal cardiac rhythmic.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness and stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: There were occasional premature beats and the average heart rate was 78 bpm.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.
This response consitent with hypovolemic hyponatremia likely from N/V/D, as well as from extensive airway secretions/insensible losses.
# Delirium: Confusion and alertness has improved considerably, however patient still has difficulty with place and is often forgetful.
# Acute unresponsiveness: In the context of his delirium, patient had an episode of unresponsiveness with stable vital signs, concerning for possible seizure.
EEG shows no evidence of epileptiform activity.
The episode may have been precipitated by a TIA given his history of carotid disease.
Skin appears to be improving without evidence of bacterial superinfection.
# Oral Secretions: Also likely due to radiation injury.
He also received a total of 5 days of levofloxacin for a possible underlying bacterial infection.
# Right upper extremity swelling: Suspect underlying DVT versus thrombophlebitis.
Recommend warm packs and elevation.
Patient is on coumadin for his afib and is being bridged with lovenox, given this finding.
# Abnormal CXR: Mild cough.
Low grade temps (99.7).
Concerning for early radiation pneumonitis.
However, they would not recommend corticosteroids unless patient develops hypoxia or worsening symptoms.
No history of TB exposure or positive PPD.
# Head and neck cancer: S/p xrt and chemo.
# access: left midline (initial PICC in right IJ so converted to midline) - can be d/c if you are able to get labs .
# PPX: aspiration and fall precautions, anticoagulated, on H2B  Medications on Admission: Sotalol 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: hypovolemic hyponatremia delirium right upper extremity swelling, suspect DVT radiation dermatitis abnormal CXR, possibly consistent with radiation pneumonitis  secondary: atrial fibrillation head and neck cancer of unknown primary chronic anemia   Discharge Condition: good: stable on room air, afebrile, still forgetful   Discharge Instructions: Please monitor for temperature > 100.5, shortness of breath, worsening cough, worsening mental status, or other concerning symptoms.
Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7521**]  Please follow-up for an MRA of your neck to rule out carotid artery disease on [**2103-5-16**] at 8:30 PM at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name **], basement level.
