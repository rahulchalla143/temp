Admission Date:  [**2121-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-4-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-1-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain and distention  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2121-4-3**] Exploratory laparotomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy, [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy tube placement, and placement of a vacuum dressing.
[**2121-4-10**] Re-exploration with washout, GJ tube placement, tracheostomy, [**State 19827**] patch placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 49 year-old female with a history of EtOH dependence who presents with abdominal pain and distention.
She reports 3 days of increasing abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, loose non-bloody, non-melenic stools, and occasional nausea/vomitting.
Denies any tobacco, IVDU, illicit drug use, ethylene glycol or mouthwash consumption.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:97.5 BP:125/75 HR:110 RR:23 O2Sat:100% on RA GEN: Thin female, NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, trachea midline COR: Tachycardic, III/VI systolic murmur, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, Distended, +BS, TTP diffusely, no rebound or guarding, tympanitic throughout, no shifting dullness.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Diffuse small bowel dilatation with no evidence of obstruction.
The presence of air-fluid levels raises the possibility of enteritis.
Small hepatic hypodensity too small to adequately characterize.
Left renal cyst.
Extensive pancreatic calcification and atrophy compatible with chronic pancreatitis.
Sclerotic focus in the right iliac bone abutting the SI joint of uncertain clinical significance.
Dilated small bowel, which is concerning for small-bowel obstruction.
Pancreatic calcifications suggesting chronic pancreatitis.
[**4-1**]-cXR-No previous images.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
Specifically, no convincing evidence of acute pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, patient underwent bedside ultrasound that did not demonstrate any ascites amenable to bedside paracentesis.
Abd CT showed diffuse small bowel dilatation with no evidence of obstruction or free air.
Incidentally, she was also noted to have progressive delerium and was given diazepam 5mg IV, and started on thiamine/folate intravenously.
On the following morning, the patient had a clear mental status and was able to answer questions appropriately.
She was aggressively hydrated with a total of 3L of IVF and continued to be tachycardic, likely either to dehydration or to withdrawal from alcohol.
She reported resolution of her nausea and pulled her own NGT.
On arrival to the medical floor she was tachycardic at 110, other vitals stable and similar to those on arrival to the ED.
She had a RUQ ultrasound that did not show cirrhosis, or cholecystitis.
She remained afbrile, and did not have leukocytosis, or jaundice, or a cholestatic picture in her LFTs thus cholangitis was not felt to be likely.
She was given IV fluids for her volume depletion.
She remained stable until [**4-2**], when her abdomen became increasingly distended.
Her abdomen became increasingly distended, and she had a new O2 requirement and her tachycardia increased from 110 to 140's, sinus.
An ABG was done that was unremarkable, a CXR showed hazyness at the right base.
Her chest CTA showed a large right sided pleural effusion, no PE and her CT abdomen was unchanged.
She continued to be uncomfortable, with increasingly distended bowel that was rigid and there was an abscence of bowel sounds.
In addition she became slightly confused, but was still oriented times three.
A repeat ABG showed an increased lactate to 2.2.
Surgery raised concern for ischemic bowel and she was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring as well as possible intubation as she required volume resuscitation.
Given her worsening condition and concerning abdominal exam, the patient was taken to the operating [**2121-4-3**] for an exploratory laparotomy and found to have diffuse peritonitis and fibrinous coating of the bowel with clearly purulent ascites, ileus, and ruptured left tubo-ovarian abscess.
She did develop sepsis and was started on pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Since she was a Jehovah's witness, she only received crystalloid and hespan for volume resuscitation.
On post-op day 4, she was taken back to the OR for re-exploration with washout and placement of large vacuum-assisted closure dressing.
During the surgery, pt became hemodynamically unstable, had increased pressor requirement for hypotension, and had diffuse intra-abdominal oozing of blood.
No specific bleeder could be identified and the bleeding could not be stopped.
She also expressed that she did not want further escalation of care or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
