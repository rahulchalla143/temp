Admission Date:  [**2124-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-4-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status and diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement Lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation, s/p antigen mismatched URD SCT on [**2124-3-10**] (now day +164), recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**8-17**] and now re-admitted to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] from clinic for diarrhea, waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, and electrolyte abnormalities.
As per physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **], patient had been having voluminous diarrhea, and was overall "not doing well."
Although he tolerated the transplant well, Mr. [**Known lastname 60074**] subsequent 5[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by GVHD of liver and GI tract, continous slow GIB, hematuria with BK viruria, adenoviremia, altered mental status, and extreme deconditioning.
All of his acute issues had resolved by the time of discharge, and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for continued rehabilitation.
On arrival to the floor pt appears tired but otherwise has no distress.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia (diet controlled) S/p tonsillectomy CLL (see below) .
Past Oncologic History (Per [**Hospital **] Clinic Note): Pt presented with his disease back in [**10/2119**] with an elevated white count and LDH.
He did have some bulky lymphadenopathy.
Over the course of six months, his white count began to rise and essentially doubled to approximately 130,000 with a rising in his LDH of up to 1400, and he also was noted to have worsening palpable lymphadenopathy.
He then presented in [**7-/2122**] with a rising white count, approximately 50% lymphocytes, and a mildly elevated LDH.
He also had some mild worsening palpable lymphadenopathy.
He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy.
This, however, ultimately was cut short on [**2123-7-7**] due to question of an infection versus PE for which he was ruled out.
He again had normalization of his white count and also no longer had any lymphocytosis.
He then eventually had developed an enlarging left cervical node which was biopsied and was found to have [**Doctor Last Name **] transformation.
Reinitiated therapy due to [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation with [**Hospital1 **] treatment (Continuous infusion of etoposide, Adriamycin, and Vincristine on days [**11-21**], Oral prednisone on days [**11-22**], and Cytoxan on day 5) in 02/[**2123**].
The patient underwent a Busulfan/Cytoxan conditioning regimen which did not cause neutropenia and he tolerated it with only mild diarrhea.
His initial transplant proceeded without incident.
His post-transplant course was complicated by severe GVHD, febrile neutropenia, and viremia.
Family History: Notable for father who died of prostate cancer, with question of lung involvement at the end.
An uncle with pancreatic cancer and an aunt with breast cancer.

No acute infarct or abnormal intracranial enhancement   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation ([**Doctor Last Name 6261**]) s/p MURD SCT on [**3-10**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab, now readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Altered mental status was thought to be of infectious etiology, though the CSF was negative for BK virus, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus, CMV, HSV, Herpes 6, and Toxoplasma.
Due to deterioration in mental status and persistent altered state, the patient was started on empiric cidofovir therapy at 5mg/kg IV weekly with oral probenecid for renal protection, per ID recommendations, for possible BK encephalitis pending the CSF results.
Neurology was consulted for altered mental status and once patient was released from ICU he underwent 24-hour video monitored EEG.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
Patient had periods of extreme agitation during which time he would thrash around in bed and strike his head against the side-rails.
During this time, patient required extensive sedation with anti-psychotics, benzodiazepines, and pain medication.
On [**9-10**], He sustained PEA arrest and was intubated, then sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (see [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course below).
BILATERAL SUBDURAL HEMATOMAS:  A CT head from [**9-7**] showed small bilateral hematomas.
A repeat head CT on [**9-9**] showed no interval change in the hematomas.
BK VIREMIA:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have persistent BK viremia.
#HYPOTHERMIA-thought to be secondary to infection.
Thyroid studies were consistent with a sick euthyroid picture.
GI BLEEDING:  Patient with long-standing heme positive stool, however, GI bleeding increased in early [**Month (only) 359**].
His hematocrit remained stable during these bleeding episodes.
He underwent flex sigmoidoscopy, which indicated bleeding from above the level of the transverse colon.
No other pathology was found at the time.
#ELEVATED LFTS/TBILI: Related to GVHD, medications, and chronic viral infection.
We tried to keep his platelets above 30-40 in light of GI bleeding and subdural hematomas.
#DECREASED URINE OUTPUT:  During first ICU course, patient had mild decrease in urine output.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course ([**2036-9-4**]): patient transferred to the ICU for hypothermia, with an axillary temperature approx.
He was transferred to the ICU for rectal temperature monitoring and rewarming.
During his ICU stay he continued to have worsening mental status, he was oriented to place, but extremely agitated.
In the ICU, the patient was started on phenylephrine and vasopressin and titrated off the norepinephrine due to atrial fibrillation.
Pan-CT showed new consolidation seen at the right and left upper lobes near the apices, consistent with pneumonia, bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, with right being new, small-to-moderate amount of free fluid within the abdomen and diffuse anasarca.
The underlying etiology of his altered mental status was unknown, as multiple blood and urine cultures exihibited no microbial growth.
Head CTs repeated on [**10-27**] and [**9-19**] showed no interval change in his subdural hematomas and no new intracranial hemorrhage.
He was able to be extubated since he seemed to have some improvement in mental status, with some alertness and responsiveness to voice commands.
Unforunately, on [**9-15**] he developed progressive bradycardia, followed by PEA arrest and was re-intubated by anesthesia, who suctioned a mucus plus.
He had a few episodes of bradycardia throughout the night and received atropine.
He suffered from hematuria and melena and was seen by urology and gastroenterology respectively.
A full infectious work-up for mental status change revealed no acute pathology so MRI was performed.
Neurology was consulted, repeat EEG was done on [**9-20**] but this showed low voltage background consisting of diffuse slow polymorphic delta activity.
There were no focal lateralizing lesions or epileptiform features noted that would be consistent with seizure like activity.
A morphine drip was started and patient was maintained on propofol for sedation and comfort.

White Petrolatum-Mineral Oil     Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for GVHD.
