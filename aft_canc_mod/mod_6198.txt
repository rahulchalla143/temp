Admission Date:  [**2187-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-8-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: nausea and headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right Crnaiotomy for tumor  History of Present Illness: This is a very pleasant 65 year old male who has been extensively worked up for nausea, vomiting, and headaches.
He is also reporting problems with blurry vision, which is occasional, as well as double vision sometimes.
Had a head CT done when his gastroenterologist did not find anything abnormal from the GI tract and revealed what seems to be primarily fatty tumor over the right frontal base.
He does not drink and denies asbestos exposure.
Differential would include a dermoid or a fatty meningioma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2187-10-9**] (4PM): Status post right frontal extra-axial mass resection with slightly decreased mass effect.
It is not clear whether linear hyperdensities along the margins of the surgical bed represents calcifications in the residual shell of the resected mass, or iatrogenic material.
There are low lung volumes.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
There is mild vascular congestion.
EEG [**2187-10-10**] This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of 4 Hz background rhythm which represents a moderate to severe encephalopathy such as can be seen in diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic, infectious, or other etiologies.
It is also abnormal due to the presence of right frontal slowing in the delta frequency range such as can be seen with subcortical dysfunction such as from ischemia, trauma, or mass, among other etiologies.
Of note, there is significant electrical artifact from 17:00 onward in the right hemisphere leads.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
Chest X-ray [**10-14**] Mild interstitial edema has progressed accompanied by some increase in pulmonary vascular congestion.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
New opacification at the right lung base could be pneumonia or pleural effusion, statistically it is most likely atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
Frozen section was dermoid or epidermoid tumor.
While in the PACU he demonstrated generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity and was given Dilantin (300 mg boluses) along with Ativan PRN.
Post-op CT head showed post-surgical changes reflective of removal of his dermoid tumor.
The patient had a repeat CT head 4 hours later on [**10-9**] given his seizure activity, which noted no significant changes.
It should be noted that the patient's left upper extremity IV access site showed signs of infiltration and his left extremity turned mottle and blue in appearance, concerning for compartment syndrome in the PACU post-operatively.
The plastic surgery team felt the pressures were not consistent with compartment syndrome and recommended arm elevations and warm compresses which seemed to improve the swelling.
On [**10-11**] the patient had an EEG which demonstrated no seizure activity.
The patient had a much improved neurologic exam on [**10-12**] and the patient's sedation was weaned.
The patient was successfully extubated on [**10-13**], and the patient was doing well neurologically with no focal deficits.
He was doing well on the floor with daily dressing changes for his arm with nursing.
He had no further seizures.
11. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**6-2**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
