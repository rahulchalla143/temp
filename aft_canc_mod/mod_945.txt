Admission Date:  [**2153-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-4-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-10-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lidocaine / Lipitor / Lovastatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15237**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is a 59 yo F with a 80 PYHx of tobacco (quit 4 yrs ago), COPD, CAD s/p MI, prolonged PNA admission in [**3-20**], who presents today from home with hemoptysis of 15-30cc of blood x 1 day.
She was admitted on [**3-22**] for hemoptysis and at that time was found to have a 8x8x9cm mass in the RUL displacing segmental bronchi of the RML but no clear invasion.
She had a PET and an MRI and found to have a T7 likely metastatic lesion and started on decadron last nght.
She states she started decadron yesterday and awoke at 6am and started to have hemoptysis again.
No chest pain, shortness of breath, + hemoptysis, no fevers/chills.
No abdominal pain.
-Strep pneumoniae pneumonia and sepsis and a prolonged intensive care unit stay complicated by difficulty extubating, delirium, and right internal carotid artery cannulization.
-HTN -COPD -CAD with a MI infarction in [**2144**].
Family History: She has no siblings.
Her mother passed away at age 76 of osteoporosis and severe emphysema.
She has no children.
Physical Exam: 96.9, 122/80, 94-101, 13, 96% on 4L GEN- lying in bed in NAD, AAOx3 Neck - no adenopathy appreciated HEENT- PERRL, EOMI CV- tachycardic, regular, no M CHEST- decreased breath sounds in RUL, wheezing bilaterally ABD- soft, NT/ND, +BS EXT- trace edema bilaterally, +2DP pulses bilaterally, +clubbing Back - no spinal tenderness NEURO- moving all extremities, CN 2-12 intact   Pertinent Results: PET scan: Intense FDG uptake associated with the right upper lobe mass is consistent with biopsy proven NSCLC.
The contiguity of the mass with the right hilum makes nodal disease likely, but poorly evaluated due to uptake from the primary tumor.
Uptake in right mediastinal nodes is mild and not definitive for disease involvement and there is no evidence of contralateral nodal disease.
Intense uptake associated with thoracic spine lesion is suspicious for an epidural metastasis as hemangiomas are not generally FDG avid.
There is mass effect upon the adjacent thecal sac and further evaluation with MRI is advised.
MRI T-spine: T7 vertebral body hemangioma and adjacent soft tissue mass eroding through the posterior cortex of the vertebral body and causing moderate compression of the thecal sac.
The appearance of this soft tissue mass, lack of vertebral collapse, and lack of hemorrhage would be atypical for a hemangioma.
Given the patient's known lung mass and involvement of the left pedicle, this most likely represents a metastasis.
Collision tumor given the presence of hemangioma should be considered.

The patient has no HCP and no family.
She needs help with resources including transportation to and from her appointments, as she lives in [**Location 686**] and must pay for expensive taxi rides to [**Hospital1 18**].
