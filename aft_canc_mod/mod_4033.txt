History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 56752**] presented from the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in NH where he presented for evaluation of subjective fever and mild abdominal discomfort.
This was discontinued but his sensation of nausea has persisted.
Two days PTA, he began feeling a mild discomfort in the periumbilical region which has persisted.
The pain is intermittent and mild, unchanged with eating or position.
He denied diarrhea, BRBPR, recent dietary changes, or other symptoms.
NK T cell lypmhoma of the nose (dx [**9-10**]) - s/p CHOP x 3 with high-dose methotrexate with minimal response - started on anti-EBV treatment (valgancyclovir, AZT) in [**12-10**] - started XRT [**2130-1-11**]   Social History: Pt.
He drinks alcohol occasionally  Family History: Mother with renal cell cancer.
No hx of lymphoma or leukemia in family  Physical Exam: T 100.5, HR 96, RR 18, BP 126/78, O2 Sat 98% RA Gen: comfortable, NAD, non-toxic appearing.
LN: enlarged LN fixed and mildly tender in the upper right anterior cervical distribution, shotty cervical LAD bilaterally,no other LAD in the axillary, supraclavicular, or inguinaldistributions.
No palpable masses, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowelsounds, no HSM.
Ext: no C/C/E Skin: no rash noted.
Positives include: [**2-16**]  sinus aspirate Aspergillus [**Country 11730**] [**2-24**]  sinus aspirate Aspergillus [**Country 11730**] (subsequent culture negative) [**3-4**]  + VRE on screening rectal swab [**3-17**]  R neck wound swab positive for VRE  Imaging: [**2130-1-30**]: CT Sinus: IMPRESSION: 1) Left nasal cavity lesion with mixed attenuation, as described above.
2) Maxillary retention cyst and mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
CT TORSO [**1-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1) A 3-4 mm vague nodule in the right upper lobe, new since the previous exam.
This is nonspecific and may represent infection or lymphoma.
2) Small hypodense focus within the left kidney, also nonspecific, which may represent lymphoma.
3) No etiology for left upper quadrant pain or diarrhea identified.
PET [**1-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Unchanged size, but decreased maximum SUV levels of the nasal cavity mass.
2) Increased FDG activity within the right submandibular node which appears new compared to the prior study.
3) Three focal new hepatic areas of increased FDG uptake representing distant metastatic involvement.
Multiple bilateral low-density lesions within the kidneys, in retrospect probably unchanged since [**2130-1-30**].
These have not progressed in the interval and are most likely related to lymphomatous involvement of the kidneys.
Vague stable lung nodules, with a new small focal patchy density within the left lung, probably due to focal atelectasis.
Small subcapsular lesion within the posterior right lobe of the liver, with two prominent adjacent draining veins.
Metastatic disease is not excluded, but the appearance would be most unusual for a metastatic lesion .
Small delayed phase enhancing lesion within the dome of the liver, most consistent with a hemangioma, but too small to fully characterize.
Multiple hypoenhancing lesions throughout both kidneys, consistent with lymphoma, and unchanged compared to CT [**2-13**], [**2130**].
No abnormal intracranial enhancement.
Decreased size of the intranasal mass since the [**Month (only) 1096**] MRI.
[**2-18**] CT torso: IMPRESSION: 1) Diffuse bilateral increased thickness of the pulmonary interlobular septa, new compared to the prior study of [**2130-2-13**].
This has the appearance of interstitial pulmonary edema.
Lymphangitic spread of tumor or lymphoma is in the radiologic differential diagnosis.
This appearance would be atypical for infection but in the presence of possible mild bronchial wall thickening, infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
No intra-abdominal abscess is identified.
3) Stable bilateral rounded ill-defined hypodensities in the kidneys, stable compared to the prior study.
4) Apparent left varicocele.
[**3-5**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1) Interval formation of bilateral dependent areas of consolidation in the lower lobes suggestive of aspiration with or without overlying pnuemonia.
2) Persistent and increased interstitial and alveolar opacities bilaterally.
The differential includes ARDS or less likely interstitial pulmonary edema or lymphatic spread of tumor or lymphoma.
3) Stable appearance of rounded hypoattenuating areas within the kidneys.
These have increased in the short interval ([**2130-1-30**]) and may represent multifocal pyleonephritis, lymphoma or less likely infarcts.
4) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Gallbladder contains sludge, though there is no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No biliary ductal dilatation.
2) Decreased maximum SUV levels within two right jugular chain lymph nodes.
3) New and worsened SUV avidity involving a right spinal accessory lymph node, the pre-carinal lymph node, and two tiny para-vascular lymph nodes.
4) Diffuse anasarca and worsening pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
5) New ascites.
6) Bilateral enlarged kidneys, without excretion of FDG, consistent with renal failure.
[**2130-3-12**] neck ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Edematous changes within the soft tissues of the right neck, and multiple lymph nodes, including enlarged nodes, the largest measuring 2.3 cm, without evidence of abscess or drainable fluid collection.
[**2130-3-14**] RUQ ultrasound: IMPRESSION: 1) No stone is identified within the common bile duct.
2) Gallbladder sludge.
[**2130-3-16**] MRCP: IMPRESSION: 1) Interval development of bibasilar atelectasis or pneumonia, ascites and anasarca.
4) No focal hepatic lesions to suggest candidiasis, no evidence of biliary ductal dilatation, no imaging evidence of pancreatitis.
[**2130-3-17**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: Interval rapid increase in extent of marked, diffuse airspace opacities within the lungs, which most likely represents diffuse bilateral pneumonia, but aspiration or pulmonary edema should be considered as well  [**2130-3-21**] bone marrow aspirate: hypocellular bone marrow with hemophagocytosis  Brief Hospital Course: 1. abdominal pain - On admission, the patient had LLQ pain.
The etiology of the pain was unknown.
On HD 2, the patient had a CT of the abdomen done which did not elucidate the cause of his abdominal pain.
He was started on a morphine PCA for pain control.
His abd pain subsequently improved and the PCA pump was no longer needed.
No abdominal pathology was found.
2. fever/neutropenia - On transfer from the OSH, the patient's ANC was ~600.
The patient was started on flagyl for question of c. difficile colitis and cefepime for empiric coverage of neutropenic fevers.
On HD 2, a CT torso was done which was notable for a vague nodule in RUL but no other source of fevers.
It was felt that the fevers were most likely secondary to his lymphoma, so his cefepime was stopped.
Later that evening, he had temperatures to 102F, associated with chills and mildly decreased blood pressure.
developed a low-grade fever in the context of beginning treatment with campath.
The fever became persistent and of greater intensity over the course of the next 4 hospital days.
Other than fever and rigors, the pt.
had no other symptoms which were suggestive for the source of possible infection.
He was re-imaged, including CT scans of the sinuses and torso, and no source of infection was identified.
A culture of nasal secretions was sent and grew out aspergillus [**Country 11730**].
It did suggest a decreased nasal tumor burden.
He was started on a morphine PCA for increasing pain in the nasal area on the eighth hospital day.
As mentioned above, the pt began to develop fevers around the time of campath treatment.
The cisplatinum was discontinued after 2 days of treatment as the pt developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.6 (FE Na 5.5%, suggesting acute tubular necrosis).
As the pt continued to experience persistent fever, increasing LDH and lymphadenopathy, it was decided to pursue another treatment regimen.
Due to the ensuing pancreatitis and elevated LFTs, concern was raised for dissemination of lyphoma.
A repeat PET scan was performed and did not show any evidence of dissemination.
However, there were a couple of new lymph nodes that lit up on this second PET, indicating that his lymphoma was not eradicated.
On [**3-21**], a sternal bone marrow aspirate was performed, showing involvement with pt's NK/T cell lymphoma, as well as hemophagocytosis (hemophagocytic syndrome being a known complication of this pt's lymphoma).
4.  respiratory failure - Pt required ventilatory support for a large portion of his hospitalization.
While on the BMT floor he often experienced episodes of SOB with his chemo treatments.
There were several times when he became slightly hypotensive and was bolused with fluids and had some minor SOB.
He then developed SOB and tachypnea that required transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring, and CT showed a diffuse process that was unclear but felt most likely to be capillary leak syndrome.
He was also felt to have significant consolidation in the bases, though bronchoscopy and induced sputum samples did not grow any organisms.
Repeat chest CTs showed interval increases in infiltrates and consolidation, but it was unclear whether this was due to fluid overload or to infection.
Afterwards, the extreme amount of chest wall edema was thought to be a major contributor to the inability to wean the patient from the ventilator.
He desired to have the tube out in order to discuss his feelings with his family, but he was tachypneic and uncomfortable with decreased amounts of support.
In addition, his sepsis was thought to be a major contributor, as it resulted in increased CO2 production and therefore greater work of breathing to ventilate adequately.
5.  acute tubular necrosis - pt developed ATN in the setting of chemotherapeutic agents and hypoperfusion, and muddy brown casts were visualized in pt's urine sediment.
A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.
As pt continued to have adequate urine output and did not experience severe electrolyte abnormalities, dialysis was held.
However, his kidney function did not recover spontaneously as expected, and ultimately, due to fluid overload and massive anasarca, ultrafiltration was begun.
Intravascular volume depletion and pt's hypotension limited the amount of fluid that could be removed safely.
6.  elevated pancreatic enzymes - pt's lipase was intermittently elevated, at one point at 3600 (on [**3-11**]).
He had significant abdominal pain only transiently.
GI was consulted, and it was felt that he needed an MRCP of the abdomen to see if there was significant biliary obstruction, with the thought that he may need an ERCP.
The MRCP was done, which showed no evidence of biliary ductal dilatation, nor radiographic evidence of pancreatitis.
It was thought that these changes were medication-induced and that pt had previously developed pancreatitis due to propofol.
7.  tachycardia - Pt was noted to have episodes of tachycardia into the 120s, not corresponding with fever or pain.
Echocardiograms on [**2-28**] and [**3-6**] showed mildly depressed LVEF and global hypokinesis, which was thought to be secondary to cardiomyopathy due to critical illness.
Pt's cardiac enzymes remained flat though mildly elevated, consistent with a demand ischemia in this setting.
8.  hyperbilirubinemia - pt's bilirubin climbed during the course of his hospitalization.
Pt was thought to be hemolyzing, as he had an elevated LDH and a low haptoglobin.
In the setting of his bleeding and labs consistent with DIC towards the end of his hospitalization, it was thought that this might be a contributing cause to the hyperbilirubinemia, particularly after the discovery of hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirate.
9.  neck infection - At the site of an earlier lymph node biopsy on the right side of the patient's neck (which revealed involvement of the lymphoma), he developed swelling and tenderness about one week prior to the end of his hospitalization.
It was not thought that this source of infection could explain the patient's ensuing sepsis.
He was transfused with multiple units of FFP to try to lower his PTT, which was >150 at one point; he was given units of cryo to keep his fibrinogen > 150, and he was transfused with multiple units of platelets, given his thrombocytopenia and active oozing from sites as well as guaiac positive stool and NG aspirate.
Clinical suspicion was high for a microangiopathic process.
This was thought to be of multifactorial etiologies, including uremia, infection, prolonged ICU stay, metabolic abnormalities, and long-standing sedatives and morphine.
Pt requested to be kept comfortable near the end of his course, with a morphine drip added to help with sedation and pain relief.
The goal was to try to alleviate some of the discomfort of being on the ventilator, without sedation too heavy to be compatible with communication with his family.
Although he had significant anasarca by this time, his CVP and decreasing urine output pointed to intravascular volume depletion.
In addition, his very warm extremities and continued fevers suggested sepsis, as well, though a particular source could not be isolated, even with multiple cultures.
At the same time, he was anemic and coagulopathic, and so he was transfused with multiple units of PRBCs and FFP in the last few days of his life.
Pt's family and the patient decided that given his grave prognosis in the setting of hemophagocytosis and evidence of lymphoma on bone marrow aspirate, that it would be reasonable to extubate the patient and withdraw pressors.
