Admission Date:  [**2182-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-8-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Fall and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 89yo CM with PMHx significant for CAD s/p incomplete atherectomy and PCA ([**1-27**]), and recent echo ([**7-27**]) demonstrating CHF (EF: 25-30%), moderate AS (valve area 1.0), mild->mod AR, mod MR, mod TR, and mild pulm artery systolic HTN as [**Doctor Last Name **] as DM2, and CKI (baseline Cr ?2-2.7) who was admitted to the ICU for managment of altered mental status in the setting of hypervolemic hyponatremia.
And per a prior note his wife reports that the patient had experienced a decrease in urine output, but no CP, SOB, PND, orthopnea, or abdominal pain.
In the ED he was awake and responsive and his initial vitals were 97.4, 82, 137/89, 16, 91% on 3L NC, but throughout the next couple of hours he became unresponsive and was found to be hyponatremic to 118.
In the MICU it was determined that the patient's hyponatremia was hypervolemic hyponatremia consistent with his history of heart failure and chronic kidney injury.
He was placed on a lasix drip and diuresed about 6L, taking into consideration the need to not decrease his preload in the setting of AS in order to maintain his CO. Renal was consulted for his elevated Cr, which occurred likely secondary to poor forward flow state and suggested an SPEP/UPEP, which was negative for Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
His Toresmide was restarted and a Heart Failure consult was requested.

The severity of aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation are increased.
The aortic valve gradient is lower, but is likely due to reduced stroke volume.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system was limited to the left-sided circulation.
The LMCA had mild disease.
The LAD was heavily calcified and had serial diffuse 90% stenoses in the proximal, mid, and distal portions of the vessel.
Angiography of the left circumflex demonstrated a 40% proximal stenosis and a 70% stenosis at the ostium of the OM1.
There was collateral flow from the LAD to the distal circumflex system.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right heart filling pressures with a mean PCW of 35 mmHg and RVEDP of 11 mmHg.
There was moderate to severe pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic hypertension with a PASP of 67 mmHg and PADP of 30 mmHg.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-7-29**], the severity of valvular regurgitation is slighlty less.
CXR ([**8-10**]): IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in CHF with persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
Discharge Labs: Hct-33.5* Chem: Glucose-126* UreaN-64* Creat-2.2* Na-142 K-4.3 Cl-101 HCO3-37* AnGap-8 Calcium-7.8* Phos-3.2 Mg-1.8  Brief Hospital Course: # MS change: Patient's mental status change was likely secondary to hyponatremia and improved to baseline upon correction of serum sodium concentration.
Head CT showed no evidence of acute intracranial process.
#Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia of 118 at presentation was likely secondary to a hypervolemic state from an acute worsening of chronic CHF.
#Acute on Chronic CHF: Patient presented with acute decompensation of known systolic heart failure.
Pt has bilateral pleural effusions which have shown interval resolution with diuresis.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Mild elevation of Cr from baseline 2.2 to 2.6 felt to be secondary to heart failure exacerbation.
We remained cogniscent of the patient's vavular disease throughout our managment of his volume overload; we were careful to not over-diurese the patient in order to keep his preload appropriate to maintain adequate cardiac output.
No CP on this admission, mild CE elevation.
#B/L pleural effusions R>L: Likely secondary to decompensated heart failure.
# Fall: Fall prior to admission was likely mechanical with possible contribution of hyponatremia leading to confusion leading to fall.
A CT Head in ED revealed no trauma or ICH.
# DM: We held the patient's glipizide and began insulin with sliding scale adjustment and regular accuchecks.
His blood sugar levels were reasonably controlled although the sliding scale was kept conservate due to patient's age and general poor health.
# Rash: Pt was found to have two different rashes, one on his bilateral lower extermities from the ankles to the knees and the other over his back and buttocks.
He was seen by dermatology who felt eruption on his back is most consistent with miliaria secondary to blockage of the eccrine ducts in an occlusive environment.
Pt was also noted to have a a nodule on his face concerning for a nodular basal cell carcinoma and likely actinic keratoses on the arms.
# H. Pylori: Pt had been found to be H. pylori positive on [**7-15**] by EIA.

Disp:*14 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: hyponatremia, acute exacerbation of chronic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 104625**],  You were recently admitted to the hospital for confusion that occurred because the sodium in your blood got too low because of your heart failure and kidney disease.
We were able to use medications to remove your excess fluid and you showed improvement.
You were taken to the cardiac catheterization lab and found to have multiple blockages in one of your heart arteries - 3 stents were placed in this artery to improve your blood flow.
Additionally, you were treated with an antibiotic for 10 days for a urinary infection you developed during your hospitalization.
Followup Instructions: **Additionally, he does have a nodule on his face concerning for a nodular basal cell carcinoma and likely actinic keratoses on the arms.
