He had a pacemaker/defibrillator placed in [**2114**] for primary prevention; he had an episode of VTach in [**2115**] causing syncope and was begun on amiodarone (d/c'd) and then procainamide since 4/[**2116**].
Later that day he reported associated light headedness/diaphoresis which prompted him to go to the ED.
He denied any chest pain or shortness of breath, LOC associated with these episodes.
At [**Location (un) 14078**] he was found to have 150 episodes of VT. Overnight he evidently had 10 episodes ventricular tachycardia (asymptomatic) and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP study and possible ablation.
His walking is limited by orthopedic problems rather than dyspnea.

There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is severe right ventricular compression, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion measuring ~1.2cm anterior to the right ventricle and right atrium, and <1cm posterior to the left ventricle and left atrium.
Transmitral Doppler does not suggest hemodynamic compromise.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-11-23**], the size of the posterior effusion is slightly smaller.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 82 yo with CAD s/p old IMI, 2 vessel CABG in [**2101**], NSTEMI in [**2113**] with stent to native L circ, CHF with EF 25-30%, VT s/p ICD placement presenting with recurrent VT.
Briefly, Mr [**Known lastname 32729**] was admitted w/o evidence of sustained VT on telemetry.
He had successful ablation of LV scar but this procedure was complicated by pericardial effusion/tamponade.
He had a successful VT ablation with mapping complicated by bloody pericardial effusion/tamponade and groin bleed (see below).
Mr [**Known lastname 95741**] ablation was complicated by hemorrhagic effusion causing tamponade requiring pericardial drain (140cc off).
The drain was pulled and repeat eccho initially showed some small reaccumulation which was subsuquently stable with no evidence tamponade.
During hospitalization had several episodes of hypotension, one resolving with draining of pericardial fluid, one with a NS bolus of 500cc and dopamine.
# Groin Bleed/Hematoma: Patient had groin bleed/hematoma in setting of elevtaed INR (coumadin outpt) and instrumentation in fem art for EP study.
# Rigors/Fever: Patient had rigors during groin bleed Differential includes transfusion reaction from FFP or bacteremia (transient or otherwise) from lines/lungs.
Not an acute issue .
# L arm thrombosis: Discontinued anticoagulation as he has been anticoagulated for over 6 mos and likely no further indication.
# Arthritis: continued prednisone as per outpatient PCP (although this is not likely an appropriate regimen).
# Prostate CA: outpt managmement, continued home medications of flomax and detrol.
# Mr [**Known lastname 32729**] is discharged with f/u in 2 days with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

If this fluid reaccumulates you could have symptoms such as light headedness, severe fatigue, low blood pressure, lower extremity swelling, or difficulty breathing.
If you have any of these symtpoms you should go to the emergency room or seek prompt medical attention.
You should also seek medical attention if you have chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, palpitations, fevers, or for any other concerns.
You are being treated with antibiotics, Keflex or cephalexin, and should continue a total 7 day course.
YOu should continue with a low sodium diet (2grams per day) and weigh yourself daiy; if you gain >2lbs or if you have trouble breathing you should contact your doctor.
