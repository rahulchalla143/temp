HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic hepatitis B infection who had previously had hepatocellular carcinoma for which he had undergone radiofrequency ablation of a 1.3 cm segment 8 lesion in [**2120-6-18**].
In addition, the patient had segmental Caroli disease.
He was evaluated electively in the hepatobiliary surgery office for possible surgical resection of a large left lateral segment liver mass which had grown from 4 x 4 cm to 9.2 x 7.5 cm in segments 2 and 3.
At the time of exploration, he was noted to have an enlarged cirrhotic liver but otherwise no evidence of portal hypertension.
A large mass involving the lateral-most aspect of the left lateral segment was found in addition to cystic structures in the liver which contained clear fluid.
Notably the site of the previous RFA was stable without evidence of recurrent disease but the patient did, by palpation of the surface, have a 1.5-2 cm nodule in segment 6 laterally and inferiorly which was confirmed with ultrasound.
The patient remained intubated overnight and initially required vasopressors for blood pressure support and significant fluid resuscitation for a persistent metabolic acidosis.
Early in his postoperative course, by postop day two, he was found to have partial thrombosis of his portal vein and middle hepatic vein.
Systematically, the patient's pain was controlled with intravenous narcotics, generally phentanyl throughout the course of his hospitalization.
His mental status never really improved during the course of his hospitalization as his multisystem organ failure as described below developed.
In terms of the patient's respiratory status, the patient was ventilated initially postoperative during correction of his metabolic acidosis.
His ventilatory requirements subsequently continued to increase secondary to the large volume of fluid required for his resuscitation and subsequently secondary to the development of bilateral Klebsiella pneumoniae.
The patient developed some degree of ARDS as well and remained quite difficult to ventilate and oxygenate.
Throughout the course of his hospitalization, his oxygenation and ventilatory support requirements continued to progressively increase despite efforts at diuresis and treatment of his pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics.
By [**1-18**], the patient was requiring between 80-100% FIO2 with maximal positive end respiratory pressure and ventilatory support and despite this, his oxygenation was marginal with PAO2 of between 50 and 65.
In terms of the patient's cardiovascular status, he required moderate doses of phenylephrine initially in the postoperative period but subsequently as the patient demonstrated evidence of septic physiology with source questionable from his pneumonia or possible urinary tract infection, he continued to require increasing amounts of vasopressor support including norepinephrine and vasopressin.
His persistent hypotension was not felt to be cardiogenic in etiology as he had two echocardiograms demonstrating no significant valvular disease and no significant wall motion abnormalities with a normal ejection fraction.
Throughout his hospitalization, multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were sent and did not demonstrate any evidence of myocardial infarction.
He did notably develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be secondary to the amount of fluid resuscitation and the physiologic stress that the patient was under.
He did have significant ileus which was managed with bowel rest as well as nasogastric suction.
The hepatic venous and partial portal venous thromboses were managed with heparinization as noted previously.
The patient's renal function continued to decline as well in addition to his baseline chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient developed complete acute renal failure and required the initiation of continuous venovenous hemodialysis.
As noted previously, the patient did develop a bilateral pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, both of which were secondary to Klebsiella on culture.
He was treated with the appropriate antibiotics which included vancomycin for gram positive cocci seen on gram stain of his sputum as well as ciprofloxacin and Zosyn for double coverage of pseudomonas and the ciprofloxacin covered the Klebsiella.
Given that the patient was evidencing significant progression of his multisystem organ failure as well as lack of responsiveness to maximal medical supportive therapy including full ventilatory support, full vasopressor support as well as continuous venovenous hemodialysis and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, discussion was held with the family as to the goals of care.
