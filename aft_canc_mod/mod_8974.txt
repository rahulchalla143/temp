History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 1158**] [**Known lastname **] is a 49-year-old man with glioblastoma diagnosed in [**3-/2125**], s/p partial resection, temozolomide chemo-irradiation, currently on bevacizumab/temozolomide with recent course complicated by focal left sided leg seizures, progressive left leg weakness, and vision changes presents to ED from home with concern for generalized seizure.
He reported these symptoms to oncologist who was concerned for focal seizures and increased his Keppra on Monday to 1250mg 3 times daily.
Today patient had an episode at approximately 3:30pm while resting.
Of note over the past week he has had progressive left leg weakness and has not been able to ambulate.
In addition, has been having visual hallucinations which he describes as appearing like a flying rubiks cube with wings and a light inside.
He also notes intermittent change in his voice.
He has left arm weakness since surgery.
He also developed left leg weakness that has been increasing in the past week.
CT head: there is a right frontal hypodensity 3.7 cm x 4.7 cm consistent with glioblastoma.
There is no hemmorhage or mass effect.
Family History: No history of brain cancer.

Compared with [**2125-6-17**], degree of vasogenic edema is improved.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.
There is no mass effect.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
There is a right frontotemporal craniotomy.
IMPRESSION:  Right frontal hypodense mass deep to the craniotomy defect consistent with given history, interval decrease in surrounding edema.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
At the very beginning, the patient was in a seizure with generalized sharp activity and muscle activity on EEG.
There were soon many other episodes of right hemisphere [**3-25**] Hz somewhat disorganized but somewhat rhythmic sharp activity correlating on video with mouth quivering.
In between episodes, there was some [**6-24**] Hz posterior background bilaterally, including on the right, but there was also intermixed, mixed frequency slowing and frequent sharp waves.
There are many brief bursts of rhythmic and sharp activity lasting just a few seconds.
In the longer episodes, there was prominent muscle artifact generally at the time of more immobility except for rapid eyelid blinking.
In some seizures, there was head and eyes turning to the left.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed muscle and movement artifact plus innumerable sharp waves and spikes.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed most of the seizures described above plus score is of shorter episodes of rhythmic sharp activity on the right side.
SLEEP: Showed some normal stage II sleep but with continued intermittent slowing and sharp features on the right.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no simple pushbutton activations, but it recorded 50-100 longer seizures of more than a minute or so, all based in the right hemisphere and most associated with blinking or diminished responsiveness and sometimes turning to the left.
At the beginning, it showed a low voltage fast pattern on the left side, with some posterior 8 Hz alpha activity.
On the right, there was widespread delta slowing and occasional sharp activity.
There were also a few bursts of generalized slowing.
There were many electrographic seizures.
Often, there was generalized muscle activity, corresponding to the patient blinking or with minimal facial twitching.
Occurred about [**6-24**] times an hour There were also frequent sharp waves and bursts of polysharp waves seen independently at C4 in the right central region.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The recording showed a slow background throughout, indicating a widespread encephalopathy.
In addition, there was prominent focal slowing on the right side and some bursts of generalized slowing.
Also, there were very many electrographic seizures, several of these with blinking has the clinical correlate.
From the beginning, the background was of low voltage but often of at least 8 Hz frequency.
There was frequent and prominent focal mixed frequency slowing broadly over the right hemisphere and particularly in the temporal area.
There were also very frequent focal sharp wave discharges at C4 in the right central region.
There continued to be focal onset seizures appearing electrographically at first in the right temporal region and spreading, sometimes more generally, but usually obscured by muscle artifact correlated on video with blinking.
Sometimes, there was no clear clinical manifestation on video.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a low voltage background of normal 8 Hz frequencies for much of the recording except as interrupted by focal slowing on the right side and by the many electrographic seizures described above.
Focal onset seizures occurred about twice an hour at the beginning of the recording and slowed to about one per hour by the end.

Patient was also kept on continuous EEG monitoring and initially kept NPO due to freqeunt seizure activity.
Seizure frequency continued to decrease on the floor and as of the night of [**2125-8-13**] EEG monitoring revealed no more seizure activity through the time he was dischaerged home.
(2) Bradycardia:  Patient had several episodes of bradycardia to 40s-50s during sleep, while sleeping comfortably, as well as throughout the day periodically, while interacting with staff.
Drug effect was considered and although certainly a possibility, choice was made to prioritize seizure control versus asymptomatic bradycardia.
Although plan was to restart essential home medications once taking POs again, labetolol and clonidine were held due to bradycardia.
(3) New Onset Insulin-Dependent Diabetes:  Likely secondary to dexamethasone in setting of underlying insulin resistance.
Pt has follow up PCP who has agreed to follow patient's diabetes as outpatient.
ISS was liberalized after initial control to prevent risk of hypoglycemia leading to seizures.
(5) TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient was schedule to get Avastin on day of discharge, [**2125-8-17**].
