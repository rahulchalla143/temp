Admission Date:  [**2145-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-9-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatic head mass Obstructive Jaundice  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Whipple Procedure Laparoscopic Staging with intraoperative ultrasound   History of Present Illness: This very healthy 72-year-old gentleman presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital recently with a number of weeks of progressive relatively painless jaundice.
He initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital on [**6-21**] with obstructive jaundice X 10 days.
He has had intermittent episodes of painless jaundice for the last 20 yrs, always resolving after a few days; he never sought evaluation for these, as they resolved after a few days.
In [**Month (only) 547**], he had an episode in [**State 108**], at which time he had severe diffuse abdominal pain.
The abdominal pain resolved after ~ 1 hour and his jaundice went away a few days after that.
He has not had abdominal pain since that time.
He had a CT of his abdomen [**6-16**], which showed intra and extrahepatic biliary dilitation, pancreatic duct dilation.
It also noted a cystic uncinate process mass and low attenuation in the pancreatic head.
He underwent a MRCP which showed high grade biliary obstruction with a fluid multilobulated lesion in the pancreatic head.
He underwent a repeat ERCP on [**6-22**], with extension of prior sphincterotomy, however, again the biliary duct could not be cannulatedHe was worked up with an ERCP which included a pancreatogram which showed a pancreatic ductal stricture.
However, technical problems, due to a periduodenal diverticulum prevented a cholangiogram from being achieved.
Follow-up ERCP showed evidence of huge clot in this diverticulum and at the ampullary region and there was no possible way to perform another interrogation of the bile duct.
The patient then had a significant GI bleed from this and was found to be extravasating from this area.
An interventional radiology technique took place and was able to embolize the bleeding pancreaticoduodenal arcade vessels.
Once this was under control, we then sought to figure out why he was suffering from a well developed progressive deep jaundice from biliary obstruction.
However, they did show stricturing of the bile duct and in some cases, hyperenhancing tissue within the bile duct.
Wife has severe osteoporosis and chronic pain issues.
No tobacco or IVDU.
[**Numeric Identifier 73810**] TRANCATHETER EMBOLIZATION  [**2145-6-25**] 8:41 AM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man with acute bleeding at site of pre-cut sphincterotomy (ampulla).
IMPRESSION: Successful embolization of pancreaticoduodenal branches supplying the abnormal focus in the periampullary / mid descending duodenum, as above.
Marked intrahepatic and central bililary ductal dilatation without pancreatic ductal dilatatation and without a definite pancreatic mass.
Subtle differential enhancement in the region of the abrupt caliber change of the CBD may be further evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound or repeat ERCP.
Outpouching adjacent to medial duodenum likely representing diverticulum, however given reported history, cannot exclude small contained duodenal perforation.
Marked intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
While no filling defects are demonstrated in the visible portion of the duct, the distal duct, including the portion at the ampulla, are obscured by susceptibility artifact and therefore cannot be evaluated.
Minimal dilation of the pancreatic duct at the head and neck, with a cluster of cysts in the pancreatic head.
Hepatic cysts.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Marked intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, without focal lesions seen.
A 13 mm simple cyst.
ECHO Study Date of [**2145-6-28**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricuclar hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
This revealed fresh clot in the duodenum with oozing at the major papilla.
(+) diffuse pururitis.
No fevers, chills   1) Obstructive jaundice: s/p 3 failed ERCPs - concern for possible pancreatic neoplasm given uncinate cyst/heterogeneous pancreatic head CEA was 1.3 and CA [**57**]-9 was 2123 .
2) Rectal bleeding: suspect this is secondary to bleeding from sphincterotomy site, as visualized on [**6-23**] endoscopy (s/p epi).
7) Ppx: pneumoboots = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================  Surgery was then consulted and a CTA was ordered on [**6-26**] showing - marked intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation; 1.5 cm cystic structure in left hepatic lobe, adjacent to the middle hepatic vein branch; marked dilatation of the central bile duct and cystic ducts with abrupt narrowing just proximal to the level of the ampulla; no pancreatic ductal dilatation; no obstructing mass in pancreas; small, cystic mass in the uncinate process; pancreas is normal, without peripancreatic inflammatory changes.
[**6-28**] RUQ US - Marked intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, without focal lesions seen.
A 13 mm simple cyst.
[**6-28**] EUS - Dilated bile duct with hyperechoic intrinsic lesion - stone versus cholangiocarcinoma.
Post-op Hyperglycemia: He initially had some elevated blood sugars.
His incision was C,D,I with no redness or signs of infection.
The drain was removed on the evening of POD 7 because it was a low output leak.
Shortly thereafter he began developing intense abdominal pain and exhibited peritoneal signs in the RLQ.
A CT was obtained the next morning and showed a  large  perianastomotic fluid  collection, and  additional  marked  stranding  and  fluid  within  the right  lower  quadrant.
He continued to have pain to the RLQ.
Another CT was obtained on [**7-8**] and showed stable appearing collection and clinically his pain improved and VS continued to be stable.
He was then switched to a PCA and eventually PO narcotics for pain control.
Post-op Shortness of Breath: He complainded of SOB on POD 4.
He was slightly fluid overloaded with crackels at the bases.
Pathology: Adenocarcinoma, pT3 - no lymph node involvment, Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
