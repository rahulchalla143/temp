No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Decreased area of vasogenic edema in left frontal vertex compared to [**2110-10-12**].
No retroperiotneal hematoma.
[**2110-11-17**] Pa/Lat CXR: Bilateral upper lobe pneumonia.
New severe alveolitis or other alveolar filling process primarily involving the upper lobes and therefore most likely connected to prior radiation therapy denoted by longstanding paramediastinal pulmonary fibrosis.
The differential diagnosis includes delayed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis potentiated by prior radiation (given the appropriate clinical history of ongoing chemotherapy, unknown to me).
Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and widespread atypical pneumonia are alternative possibilities.
[**2110-11-19**] Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)(Final [**2110-11-20**]):   NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii).
[**2110-11-21**] Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final [**2110-11-24**]):   NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii).
[**2110-11-24**] Ultrasound L upper extremity: IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity.
[**2110-11-25**] CT of C, T and L spine: C Spine IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease.
Extensive degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine, as described above.
No evidence of spinal metastatic disease.
Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities are partially imaged and are further characterized on CT exam of [**2110-11-18**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, appears slightly increased in size from prior.
Calcified disk protrusion at T6-7 with likely cord compression.
No evidence of metastatic disease.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen within the bones.
Stable appearance of the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Numerous sigmoid colon diverticula without associated inflammatory changes.
He presented to the ED following a presyncopal episode during which he was found to be hypotensive by EMS.
This hypotension resolved without intervention prior to his arrival in the ED where he was given broad spectrum antibiotics (HCAP coverage) for bilateral apical infiltrates and stress dose steroids for potential adrenal insufficiency.
A Head CT with contrast demonstrated improvement of his vasogenic edema and abdominal CT demonstated a stable AAA.
CT scan of the chest on the evening of admission demonstrated new severe alveolitis or other alveolar filling process primarily involving the upper lobes, but also with patchy involement in other lung fields.
The differential diagnosis entertained included COP as a late term sequelae of the chest radiation he had received one year prior, atypical PCP with particular concern for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] less likely possiblities such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, vasculitides, and pulmonary hemmorhage.
He had no oxygen requirement on the day of admission despite pronounced findings on chest CT.
Pulmonary was consulted regarding bronchoscopy, but this was cancelled given his worsening oxygen requirement which progressed despite empiric treatments.
However, B-glucan was grossly elevated to >500, galactomannam was elevated at 0.5, and LDH was elevated up to 754, suspicion was high for PCP pneumonia and patient was started on bactrim DS and steroids.
The patient's oxygenation steadily improved on bactrim and prednisone although he continues to require supplement O2 ( 5 lits ) per nasal cannula.As below, pt developed transaminitis and pan-cytopenia while on bactrim.
Concern for adrenal insufficiency which prompted ED physicians to give stress dose steroids.
Likely causes included  some element of SIADH secondary to lung inflammation/NSCLC  and this was likely exacerbated by mild hypovolemia as his sodium did increase with normal saline.
Treated with high sodium diet, mild fluid restriction and intermittant IVF as required by his volume status.Pt being d/c with low dose of oral supplemental salt.
Pancytopenia: On admission, His thrombocytopenia and leukopenia improved without intervention and was attributed to acute illness.
However, his anemia recurred mostly likley from myelosuppression due to high dose bactrim and he required 2 units PRBCs on [**2110-11-30**] and [**2110-12-1**].
NSCLC/ Code Status: Initially the patient was listed as DNR/DNI, but given his progressive oxygen requirement from a potentially reversible/treatable process and his relatively good response thus far from an oncologic point-of-view, this was discussed with the patient and his wife [**Name (NI) 382**] on [**2110-11-20**] by the hospitalist caring for him and he was switched to FULL CODE.
The patient's son was also present for this conversation.
Lower extremity weakness: Patient complained of progressively worsening weakness.
Non contrast head CT showed no worsening of his brain mets.
A CT spine (patient's pace maker is NOT compatible with MRI) showed no mets in the spinal cord but did reveal cord impingement due to DJD at T6.
The patient was seen in consultation with neuro oncology who felt that this radiologic finding was not causing clinical symptoms, had been documented on prior studies and was stable.
Differential diagnosis included neuromuscular process, paraneoplastic process, and deconditioning given prolonged hospitalization.
Transaminitis with elevated alkaline phos and normal bilirubin: The patient was assymptomatic and these laboratory changes were thought most likely due to drug effect.
Stage III NSCLC / brain mets: Repeat Head CT with contrast showing no new lesions, edema decreased.
History of Seizures: Secondary to brain mets.As above, DC'd keppra, started Zonisamide due to elevated LFT's.
Acute delerium at night: managed with Haldol 0.5-1 mg QHS with marked improvement though not complete resolution.
ultrasound negative.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
3. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
6. haloperidol 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for confusion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] [**Location (un) 1121**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PCP (pneumoncystis) pneumonia Lung cancer with brain metastases Elevated Liver function tests Hyperkalemia (high potassium) Hypoxemia (low oxygen) Hyponatremia (low sodium) Diffuse weakness Degenerative joint disease Left arm swelling Delerium at night High blood pressure High cholesterol Heart burn pan-cytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath from PCP (pneumoncystis) pneumonia that required intensive care unit monitoring for your oxygen levels.
Your strength has been improving and tests did not reveal a cause for weakness.You liver function tests have been elevated so your statin has been stopped and your anti seizure medication has been changed.Your potassium has been high probably from the bactrim antibiotic you need for your pneumonia.
This has been treated with a water pill (toresamide), IV fluids, and decreasing your carvedilol blood pressure medication.You have received 2 blood transfusions for anemia with good response.
You have had confusion at night time that has been treated with Haldol at bedtime.
F/U CBC and chem 10 in 2 days and then at least twice a week.
Results to be faxed to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10351**] , fax # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34802**] ## Pt will be contact[**Name (NI) **] for f/u with the [**Hospital **] clinic , if you do not hear from them  please contact [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] to set a f/u in [**4-26**] days.
