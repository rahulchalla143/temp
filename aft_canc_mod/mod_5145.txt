Admission Date:  [**2134-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-10-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-1-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**] Chief Complaint: Fever, weakness, change in mental status.
History of Present Illness: 62 year-old female with metastatic melanoma to liver/brain/pancreas presenting with fever and weakness after temozolomide chemotherapy on [**2134-10-6**].
In addition, she notes loose stools x 1 and difficulty swallowing solids.
Then, this week upon completion of chemotherapy, she developed a fever to 101 at home and progressive weakness to the point that she could not get out of bed.
Chest CT was obtained to further evaluate possible infectious etiolgies and incidentally noted large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Given altered mental status, head CT obtained, which is unchanged from prior.
An IVC filter was placed after the findings of pulmonary embolism as anticoagulation is not an option given her cancer metastatic to brain.
The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin but as there was no source of infection found antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient was initially noted to have SBP 80-90s but blood pressure improved with fluid boluses.
The patient continues to complain of right leg weakness and word-finding difficulties which she says are new over two-three days.
Biopsy was consistent with melanoma.
Her followup CT scan showed interval increase in size of the right liver mass as well as interval increase in size of multiple renal lesions and a new peritoneal or omental nodularity consistent with metastatic disease.
Additionally, she was found to have an increase in her pancreatic mass.
The MRI on [**2134-6-6**] revealed a small focal areas of metastatic involvement in both temporal lobes and possibly in the left mamillary body.
One lesion in the anterior left temporal lobe region was reported to be probably consistent with meningeal disease.
At that time, the patient was asymptomatic from her neurologic disease.
A CT scan on [**2134-8-9**] showed a massive increase in the metastatic disease burden with metastasis to the liver, pancreas, and subcutaneous tissues and massive increase in the amount of intra-abdominal, intrapelvic lymphadenopathy as well as omental nodularity.
She does not have any biological children but she has an adopted daughter.

Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the main pulmonary arteries bilaterally into the lower lobar branches and subsegmental branches.
There are several filling defects within the right atrial appendage.
This appears adjacent to a nodule along the pericardium, and is concerning for thrombus in this location, possibly of a metastatic origin.
Extensive diffuse metastatic disease within the mediastinum, soft tissues, liver, pancreas, and omentum.
New lytic lesion in the L1 vertebral body concerning for a new osseous metastasis.
Left apical pneumothorax, as seen on the recent chest radiograph.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2134-10-7**] IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or herniation.
Of the multiple previously described lesions, only the lesion at the left mamillary body is identified on the current study.
This is likely due to differences in the sensitivities between MRI and CT. No definite new lesions are identified.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of RV strain.

Pulmonary embolus.
Her metastatic cancer puts her at risk for thromboembolic disease.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of right heart strain as above.
Oriented x 3 but with neurologic deficits of word-finding and attention; these were improving prior to discharge.
Possible etiologies leptomeningeal spread, seizure, metabolic abnormalities, chemotherapy, or other drug-induced.
No evidence of new or worsening metastases or infarction on MRI head [**10-10**].
No evidence of infection.
The patient had evidence of leptomeningeal disease in [**6-3**] but is now status post WBI.
The patient had a lumbar puncture performed to rule out recurrent leptomeningeal disease.
She has complaints of generalized weakness over the past several days, which per her sister, is a marked change.
While there is no definite finding on exam, it is unclear if these findings could be related to her cancer, the treatment, or metabolic derangements.
The patient had a shuffling gait on exam.
Lumbar puncture was performed to rule out leptomeningeal disease and the preliminary cytology was negative.
The patient was started on Sinemet for Parkinson's-like symptoms with good effect.
The patient's mask-like facies and shuffling gait were believed to be secondary to Parkinson's disease.
Metastatic melanoma.
Fever/Sepsis/Lactic acidosis.
There was initially concern for SIRS/sepsis given the presentation of fever, hypoxia, and perceived confusion shortly after completing chemotherapy.
The patient was initially treated with antibiotics but these were discontinued when the patient was afebrile and with negative cultures for 72 hours.
The patient's celexa was initially held with the patient's change in mental status but was restarted during hospitalization without ill effect.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Pulmonary embolus, status post IVC filter placement 2.
Metastatic melanoma .
Discharge Instructions: Please contact a physician if you experience fevers, chills, headache, increased weakness, or any other concerning symptoms.
