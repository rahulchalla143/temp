Stable appearance of pancreatic head mass consistent with history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Stable encasement of superior mesenteric artery and occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein.
Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, improved since the previous study.
L upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive left axillary vein thrombosis.
Friability in the duodenal bulb (thermal therapy) Previous gastrojejunostomy of the stomach, 4mm non-bleeding ulcer noted at anatomosis site.
Pt had CT abd/pelvis which showed a similar tumor burden.
On EGD, a bleeding friable area was found that seemed consistent with progression of tumor into duodenum, which had been a concern during pt's prior GIB in [**1-17**].
The possibility of further intervention was discussed with IR who felt that this would be inappropriate unless pt bleeds again (given risk of adverse effects from embolization).
Also noted was a small stomach ulcer.
# L axillary clot: Pt noted to have swollen L arm and was found to have L axillary clot, likely [**3-13**] port which had been in since [**1-16**].
# LLE DVT: Pt noted to have LLE edema and ultrasound showed DVT.
# Abd Pain: Pt with abd pain and nausea on admission, no acute pathology on abd CT. Pt reported feeling bloated which improved after NGT on suction.
NGT was discontinued on HD2 and pt did not have recurrence of abd pain.
# Elevated INR: INR 1.5 on admission, he received 4 units FFP in ED in the setting of active GIB.
Pt gets regular outpt paracentesis by IR.
Pt had drain for ascites placed on [**2108-5-1**] and 1L ascitic fluid removed at that time.
Plan to drain prn for comfort.
