Found to have worse anemia with Hct 23.9 and troponin leak (0.2).
Now asymptomatic, denies chest pressure, dyspnea, lightheadedness, abd pain or bloating, or leg swelling.
Past Medical History: Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], CAD, MI in [**2161**], gout, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, HTN   Social History: Accountant at [**Hospital1 18**].
No carotid bruits.
Lungs clear w/o wheezing or crackles.
No hepatomegaly.
No peripheral edema.
No joint swelling or tenderness.
Slightly erythematous macular rashes on chest and upper back with scaly surface, no vesicles, c/w tinea versicolor.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was without stenoses.
The LAD had a 90% stenosis at D1.
The LCX had a proximal 50% stenosis and was totally occluded after OM1 with left-to-left collaterals filling the distal vessel.
The RCA was occluded proximally with left-to-right collaterals filling the distal vessel.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (28 mmHg) but normal early diastolic pressures (8 mmHg) consistent with diastolic dysfunction.
There was no aortic stenosis.
Left ventriculography demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction of 60%, with mild inferior hypokinesis.
No mitral regurgitation was seen.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
Numerous indwelling devices have been removed, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Worsening atelectasis at left lung base with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and probable small right effusion.
Minor areas of patchy and linear atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung are also demonstrated.
