Admission Date:  [**2173-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-1-25**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: headache   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-29**] left subdural hematoma evacuation [**2-4**] free latissimus flap scalp [**1-5**] stress MIBI [**1-12**] burr holes for subdural collection   History of Present Illness: 85 y/o female with a history of squamous cell carcinoma resected from her forehead approximately 18 months ago.
Approximately 6 months ago she noted progressive difficulty with ambulation and over the past 2-3 weeks increasing headaches.
She denies any falls or head trauma during this period,however,head CT obtained at an outside hospital reveals left frontal parietal chronic subdural hematoma approximately 1.7cm in thickness with 1.2cm midline shift.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, but left frontal bone superior to the orbit is eroded with possible local invasion of carcinoma.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for cranioplasty  with free flap.
Past Medical History: PMHx: atrial fib hypothyroidism CAD low back pain squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead   Social History: Social Hx: denied tobacco, EtOH, or IVDU; she lived alone at home - retired   Family History: Family Hx: noncontributory   Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: Gen: Appears cachectic, unconscious, NAD.
III, IV, VI: not tested V, VII: not tested VIII: not tested IX, X: not tested [**Doctor First Name 81**]: not tested XII: not tested  Motor: BUE's contracted, extend to noxious stimuli, BLE's with min w/d to deep noxious stimuli   Pertinent Results: SCALP PATHOLOGY RESULTS: Clinical: 85 year old woman with metastatic tumor, frontal scalp involving skull and dura.
Nuclei are enlarged and irregular and many are vesicular  with prominent nucleoli.
An origin from the epidermis is not identified nor is there definitive morphologic evidence of squamous differentiation.
A large subpopulation of tumor cells are immunoreactive for cytokeratins as pankeratins (AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2), MNF 116 and focally for cytokeratin [**6-13**] and EMA, and to show strong nuclear reactivity for p63.
There is variable reactivity in a subset of cells for CD138, CD31, CD68 and CD45.
The morphologic features in conjunction with these immunohistochemical findings favor that this tumor is a poorly differentiated carcinoma.
It may represent extension / recurrence of a tumor originally located at or near this site but a distant metastasis cannot be excluded.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-1-18**] 11:09 AM  Reason: f/u study  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old woman with s/p bifrontal craniectomy, in sicu REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: f/u study INDICATION: Status post bifrontal craniectomy, in CICU; assess interval change.
FINDINGS: Stable appearance of large hypodensity involving the left frontal lobe with a central high- attenuation focus with unchanged rightward shift of normally midline structures (10 mm).
Stable appearance of left subdural collection.
HEAD CT: FINDINGS: There is worsened subfalcine herniation today with the midline shift measuring 15 mm, previously 10 mm, with worsening effacement of rightwardly displaced left ventricle.
There is worsened uncal herniation with increased shift towards the midline of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
The large hypodensity involving the left frontal lobe appears increased in size today at 5.5 cm (previously 5.2 cm) again containing a central hyperdensity that has slightly decreased in size.
The left subdural collection appears essentially stable.
IMPRESSION: Worsening subfalcine and uncal herniation with slightly increased size of left frontal hypodensity and stable-appearing left subdural hematoma.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right or left lower extremity.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to neurosurgical ICU on [**2173-12-29**] for left frontal parietal chronic SDH with midline shift.
She was taken to the OR on HD#2 for evacuation of left subdural hematoma.
She underwent latissimus flap cranioplasty by plastic services on [**2174-1-5**] and she tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
She was extubated on [**2174-1-7**] without difficulty.
Repeat Head CT showed left frontal infarct/increasing SDH with increased midline shift.
She has mild weakness with RUE and [**6-12**] with LUE; she moves both LE antigravity.
Repeat CTH [**1-16**] with slight worse L SDH, and stable on CTH [**1-18**].
cell cancer with multiple surgeries, recent subdural with evacuation but no response.
After aggressive care to maintain while hoping for mental status improvement, pt has not made any gains and has remained unresponsive.
