Briefly, 64M with h/o lung ca s/p left pneumonectomy ([**2125**], unknown CA), more recently had w/u of recurrent R lung mass (unrevealing medisastinoscopy and paraceliac LN biopsy ([**7-17**]) at [**Hospital1 112**].
[**2138-1-12**] [Floor]: Pt presented ED on [**2139-1-12**] for with productive cough, low grade temps, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea.
[**Date range (1) 23890**] [Floor, ICU, Floor, Bronch, ICU]: CT scan revealed R hilar cavitating mass with evidence of tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities of the right lung.
Pt subsequently called back out to floor and underwent Bronch that showed near occlusion of the RUL bronchus by  mass and endobronchial bx and transbronchial FNA performed.
([**1-20**]) Vanc d/c'd as the pt underwent a rigid/flex bronch that revealed poorly differentiated NSCLC.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL & SURGICAL HISTORY: (per admit note) # Lung Ca s/p Left Pneumonectomy - first dx [**2125**] s/p radiation therapy (no tissue diagnosis known) followed by thoracics (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 17041**] at [**Hospital1 112**] - being evaluated for new right hilar mass s/p mediastinoscopy with biopsy without evidence of malignancy of note; sputum culture [**7-17**] with actinomyces # HTN # NIDDM2 # HL # Pituitary Microadenoma # Testicular Hypofunction # Obesity # Angioedema after a dental procedure with negative RAST for l  Social History: The patient quit smoking ten years ago but has a 25 pack [**Female First Name (un) **] history.
No known asbestos exposures or occupational exposures.
Family History: Mother died at age 38 secondary to ovarian carcinoma.
Father died at age 84 secondary to "heart trouble."
He had hypertension as well.
The patient reports a positive history of malignancy in other family members of unknown types.
Right lower lobe cavitary mass, with associated right hilar bulky lymphadenopathy, highly concerning for recurrent bronchogenic malignancy.
Either the right lower lobe mass, or multiple stations of lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum would be amenable to bronchoscopic biopsy.
Extensive peribronchiolar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, small nodular and ground-glass opacities throughout the right upper lobe, and to a lesser degree in the right middle and lower lobes.
Infection involving the cavitary mass in the right lower lobe superior segment could also be considered, along with superinfection of a preexisting cavitary mass.
Subtle thickening of interlobular septae in portions of the right upper lobe and superior segment right lower lobe, worrisome for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Necrotic-appearing 3 cm left adrenal nodule and enlarged 1.6 cm left paraaortic node worrisome for metastatic disease.
Secretions and debris in the left mainstem bronchial stump may be acting as a nidus for infection.
Clusters of atypical stripped nuclei and focal necrosis in a background of reactive bronchial epithelial cells, (see note.)
Note: The atypical nuclei are stripped of their cytoplasm and display regular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin and large prominent nucleoli.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  [**2139-1-18**]:   1.
No evidence of endoluminal filling defects to indicate pulmonary embolus.
However, multiple areas of progressive narrowing and at least one occlusion of pulmonary arterial branches by the infiltrative right hilar mass likely contribute to the described symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2.Interval development of multiple foci of consolidation and peribronchiolar opacities in the right middle and upper lobe concerning for progressive multifocal pneumonia.
Diffuse adenopathy and infiltrative mass involving the right middle and upper lobe with progressive obstruction of the bronchi and pulmonary vasculature.
Enhancing nodule with central hypodensity adjacent to or within the left adrenal gland is consistent with either metastatic involvement of lymph node or adrenal gland.
[**2139-1-20**] Pathology: Right bronchus intermedius mass (for frozen section), endobronchial biopsy (A): Poorly differentiated carcinoma.
No significant coronary artery disease.
No central pulmonary embolism.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Elevated right-sided filling pressures.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo male with h/o lung ca s/p left pneumonectomy, DM2, HTN, admitted for fever, dyspnea and productive cough.
Experienced hypoxic respiratory failure during bronchoscopy, requiring intubation.
He was found to have partial occlusion of RUL bronchus, and biopsy of lung revealed NSCLC.
He was treated with antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia, and also received XRT for his lung CA.
He developed chest pain with EKG findings concerning for myocardial ischemia.
Cardiac catheterization revealed no coronary lesions.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for cough .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypoxic respiratory failure  Secondary: Pericarditis Acute Kidney Injury Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Comfortable.
Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for fever, shortness of breath and sputum production.
You had chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization; your chest pain was ultimately believed to be due to inflammation of the lining around your heart.
