HOSPITAL COURSE:  MRI of the lumbar spine on [**3-8**] showed a compression deformity of L1 vertebral body with retropulsion of bone fragments and narrowing of the central canal by 50%.
Shoulder film of patient's right upper extremity showed no on the neurosurgical service, however, patient was noted to have shortness of breath as well as a large left pleural effusion and decision was made to have patient transferred to the medicine service on [**2187-3-12**] for further management.
In addition, radiation oncology was consulted to evaluate patient for possible XRT, however, felt that this would not be optimal treatment for a likely pathologic bone fracture.
Patient, as well as patient's brother who was acting as [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy agreed to the chemotherapy; however, patient had difficulty making a decision on whether she wanted chemotherapy or not and thus the treatment was deferred for severak days during which daily discussions were held.
As far as pulmonary status, patient was persistently in requirement of increasing amounts of O2.
It was felt that her hypoxia was related to lymphangitic spread of her malignancy and would hopefully respond to chemotherapy.
