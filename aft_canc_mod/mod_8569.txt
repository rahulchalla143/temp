A CT scan was performed and confirmed a solid nodule in the superior segment of her left lower lobe highly suspicious for malignancy as well as a bulla in the right lower lobe with a thickened cyst wall also concerning for malignancy.
This showed that the left lower lobe nodule showed an SUV of 16.4 as well as a left hilar node with an uptake of 9.6.
The lesion in the right lower lobe showed an SUV of 7.5, also suspicious for malignancy.
She also underwent an [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] scan on [**2142-5-24**], that was negative for metastatic disease.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a mediastinoscopy as well as bronchial brushing on [**2142-5-24**].
The mediastinoscopy was negative for carcinoma.
The lesions in her right lower and left lower lobe are likely to represent synchronous primary lung cancers rather than stage IV disease based upon a negative mediastinoscopy and no signs of metastatic disease on her PET/CT scan.
As a result, on [**2142-6-11**], a Left VATS converted to a left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of superior segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph node dissection were all performed.

She developed postoperative Atrial Fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate soon afterwards and her blood pressure was initially 80/40, leading to a transfer to the intensive care unit.
After coming to the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] gradually improved clinically though with persistence of her atrial fibrillation.
