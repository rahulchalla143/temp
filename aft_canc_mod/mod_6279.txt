Day 14 and two subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement  with leukemia.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to  have disseminated fusarium [**Hospital1 2**] in the setting of prolonged  neutropenia.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2157-7-27**] for neutropenic fever and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.
While hospitalized he was treated with a 10-day course of decitabine without complications.

There is minimal soft-tissue thickening in the partially visualized maxillary sinuses.
The patient previously had maxillary sinus disease on prior sinus CT. if further evaluation of sinuses is clinically indicated, consider a repeat sinus CT. [**2157-8-30**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
[**2157-9-2**] Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with inferior hypokinesis.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-8-30**], no change.
No biliary obstruction or other explanation for abnormal LFTs.
Trace perihepatic ascites.
Right pleural effusion.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
Mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement are essentially unchanged since [**Month (only) **], and edema is minimal, if any, difficult to distinguish from relatively symmetric infrahilar opacification which could also be due to mild-to-moderate atelectasis.
There is no pulmonary edema or consolidation in the upper lungs.
[**2157-9-9**] Echo: Normal LV size with low-normal systolic function.
Moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of early hemodynamic effect in inversion of the right atrium, consistent with increased intrapericardial pressure.
No definitive signs of pericardial tamponade.
In the setting of elevated right sided pressures, echocardiographic evidence of tamponade may be absent.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-9-2**], the effusion is slightly larger and there is slightly more pronounced diastolic inversion of the right atrium.
[**2157-9-9**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**9-4**], there is continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with less prominent vascular congestion that may reflect the PA rather than supine AP technique.
Opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region could merely reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
There is left and possibly also right pleural effusion.
Scattered streaks of atelectasis are seen especially at the left base.
Pathology: [**2157-8-20**] left shin biopsy: The sections shows patchy superficial and mid-dermal hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of malignancy in this specimen.
Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are present in the superficial dermis, compatible with relative chronicity of this hemorrhagic episode.
The PAS, GMS, and tissue Gram stains are negative for microorganisms.
Culture growing enterococcus  [**2157-9-2**] Bone marrow biopsy: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by persistent involvement by patient's known acute leukemia.
PERSISTENT ACUTE LEUKEMIA WITH MIXED LINEAGE PHENOTYPE (see note).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1005**] is a 61 yo M with refractory biphenotypic leukemia and history of disseminated fusarium [**Known lastname 2**], on Ambisome and voriconazole in the setting of prolonged neutropenia from induction chemotherapy.
He was recently transferred to the CCU for pericardio-centisis on [**2157-9-14**] and pericardial drain (pulled [**9-16**]).
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3.
Two subsequent marrows all continued to show persistent involvement with leukemia.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium [**Month/Year (2) 2**] in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.
Patient remained persistently neutropenic.
[**9-2**] BM biopsy showed extensive disease.
Following this the patient was noted to have persistence of blasts in periphery and continued to be pancytopenic.
# FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA, BACTEREMIA: pt with low-grade fevers on admission.
Derm biopsy of left shin showed chronic changes, and culture grew out enterococcus (likely seeded from [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] derm).
No new murmurs.
[**2157-8-30**] echo showed no signs of endocarditis.
Patient's legs stable without tenderness.
Bilateral changes appear chronic.
He spiked a fever in the CCU on [**9-14**] after placement of pericardial drain ([**Last Name 788**] problem #4), at which point empiric vancomycin and cefepime were started.
He was discharged on Levoquin for ppx as outpatient, given his chronic neutropenia.
# DISSEMINATED FUSARIUM [**Month/Year (2) **]: occurred in the setting of neutropenia after induction chemotherapy.
# AFIB WITH RVR: On [**9-20**], pt developed new onset Afib with RVR to the 140s in the setting of low potassium (has chronically low potassium [**12-22**] ambisome).
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: pt with evidence of cardiac tamponade in early [**Month (only) **], found on hospitalization to have worsening pericardial effusion and RV collapse.
Repeat echo [**9-2**] showed persistent effusion without signs of tamponade.
Repeat [**9-9**] echo unchanged, with elevated pulmonary artery pressures (therefore, RV pressures are likely high, even if no RV collapse/frank tamponade).
On [**9-14**] pt had pericardiocentesis with placement of pericardial drain, in the setting of starting anthracycline with potential for cardiotoxicity and worsening EF.
Analysis of fluid revealed transudate with reactive inflammatory cells; cx (including mycobacteria and fungi) and cytology were negative.
Repeat TTE on [**2157-9-27**] showed persistence of small effusion.
# PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: pt developed significant BL pleural effusions of unknown etiology, most likely cardiac given pulm vascular congestion.
While pt had no respiratory compromise and maintained normal O2 saturations, there was concern for eventual compromise of lung expansion given severity of effusion.
Pleural fluid analysis showed transudate with reactive inflammatory cells; bacterial/mycobacterial/fungal cultures and cytology negative.
On [**10-7**], left pleural effusion showed interval worsening.
Pt intermittently clinically volume overloaded during hospitalization, likely [**12-22**] his cardiopulmonary issues as well as fluid overload from chemo.
# RV STRAIN ON TTE: After the pericardial drain was place and then later pulled, echocardiogram showed new significant RV strain and volume overload.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: While in the CCU, the patient developed acute renal failure, with creatinine trending up to 2.1 in the context of spiking a fever.
# ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA: [**12-22**] leukemia, as well as autoimmune destruction and splenic sequestration (pt with massive splenomegaly).
# HEPATITIS B: patient with positive surface and core antibodies in [**3-30**].
Pt with mildly elevated LFTs during hospitalization, which improved after Bactrim was discontinued.
# MECHANICAL FALL: pt had mechanical fall while walking from the bathroom on the evening of [**2157-9-26**] with minor head trauma and no other injuries.
STAT head CT showed no acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or skull fracture but was notable for left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
Serial neurologic exams WNL.
Pt suffered no consequent disabilities as a result of this incident.
It is unclear how long it has been present for, but seems to be chronic mass (possibly congenital) that is newly irritated X4-5days by dentures.
MR showed no evidence of enhancing soft tissues or fluid collection.
# MOOD INSTABILITY: Patient has a history of mood instability, managed on olanzapine.

You were found to have a bacteria (called Enterococcus) growing in your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and on skin biopsy and so you were treated with an antibiotic called daptomycin.
