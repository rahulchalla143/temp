Admission Date: [**2113-4-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2113-4-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-1-29**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In summary, this is a 60-year- old woman with history of pineocytoma diagnosed in [**2108**] status post removal in [**2109-8-16**], status post removal of bleeding into the residual tumor and placement of a right ventriculoperitoneal shunt in [**2109-8-16**], who was initially diagnosed in [**2108**] after she developed right ear tinnitus and gait imbalance.
She had slowing word finding difficulties and a change in the quality of her voice.
She eventually had a MRI, which showed a 2 cm by 2 cm by 2 cm pineal mass and had it resected.
Resection was complicated by hemorrhagic stroke in presumably the right posterior temporal region as well as a thalamic pain syndrome.
This in turn was complicated by hydrocephalus and a VP shunt was placed.
She returned in [**2112-12-15**] for lethargy and was found to have a urinary tract infection.
Since then, the patient had a gradual decline in energy with also the ability to communicate.
There have been no fevers.
Pineocytoma as above.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Her mucous membranes were moist.
Her heart was regular with no murmurs.
Extremities showed no pedal edema or rashes.
On mental status, the patient was unarousable to voice or sternal rub.
There was no blink to threat bilaterally.
There were no corneal reflexes and a gag was depressed, but did elicit a slight response.
There was slight withdrawal to painful stimulus in all four extremities and no adventitious movements.
Her imaging CAT scan revealed a very large pineal tumor that had an enlarging appearance with a resultant edema, hydrocephalus and effacement of the sulci.
After discussions with the Ethics Committee and the family, it was decided that she could be intubated, but not to have any resuscitation efforts or CPR.
On hospital day number three, she became very hypoxic and had agonal breathing.
On the evening of [**2113-4-25**] at 9:30 p.m., the patient had a cerebral blood flow scan done which showed no cerebral blood flow, which suggested brain death.
She had no corneals.
She had no withdrawal to pain.
