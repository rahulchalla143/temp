Upper GI bleed: Patient admitted with hematemesis and melena consistent with upper GI bleed.
Given his recent use of NSAIDS and aspirin, gastritis or ulcer were the most likely etiology.
He underwent EGD; a peptic ulcer was found in the distal bulb, and this was clipped.
We held his Aspirin and his NSAID pain medicine.
Leukocytosis: UA suggestive of UTI, although he has chronic indwelling urostomy and no symptoms of infection.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be secondary to stress reaction in setting of probable GIB.
CXR without infiltrate c/f pneumonia.
Leukocytosis resolved and was likley due to acute bleed.
Positive Urinalysis/Asymptomatic Bacteriuria: Patient s/p bladder cancer with urostomy so has chronic indwelling biofilm so UA likely to be persistently positive.
He was asymptomatic during these events.
He did not endorse symptoms to suggest sleep apnea.
