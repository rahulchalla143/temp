The diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not improved, although its heterogeneous texture suggest the development of interstitial pulmonary emphysema.
There is no pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular and right subclavian venous catheters are in standard placement, unchanged.
[**8-7**] CT chest: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Extensive bilateral interstitial and ground glass opacities, most pronounced in the bases, which could be consistent with acute atypical pneumonia, pulmonary edema versus ARDS.
[**8-5**] UGIS: No evidence of leakage at the anastomotic site.
[**7-26**] CXR: Bilateral small pneumothoraces; Dilatation of the stomach, which is fluid filled.
New asymmetric consolidations in the lungs (left > right).
[**7-24**] UGIS: No evidence of leak at the anastomotic site.
Started on clears [**7-25**]: Desaturation & increasing O2 requirements.
CXR showed markedly distended gastric bubble & bilateral infiltrates [**7-26**]: Taken to OR for replacement of NGT under direct visualization, and readmitted to SICU [**7-27**]: Developed rapid atrial fibrillation requiring electrical cardioversion.
Given sips of clears [**8-6**]: Transferred to floor in good condition after tolerating PO's without complication [**8-7**]: Transferred to TSICU after developing respiratory distress (pO2 48) [**8-9**]: Reintubated for bronchoscopy [**8-12**]: cardioverted for rapid a fib [**8-14**]: started steroid pulse for empiric treatment for pulmonary fibrosis [**8-16**]: cardioverted for rapid a fib [**8-20**]: percutaneous tracheostomy [**8-21**]: cardioverted for rapid a fib  NEURO: Acute on chronic pain issues.
Currently treated with methadone, clonidine & prn ativan CV: intermittent rapid A fib, requiring cardioversion because of recalcitrant hypotension.
avoiding amiodarone due to pulmonary issues.
RESP: severe respiratory failure, presumably from pulmonary fibrosis (etiology aspiration pneumonitis vs amio toxicity vs occult infection) FEN/GI: sustained by tube feeds & on meds via LUQ J tube.
