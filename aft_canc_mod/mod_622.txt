Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position.
Abandoned epicardial leads are again noted on the left lower hemithorax/left upper quadrant, stable.
Evidence of basilar fibrosis is again seen.
There is persistent blunting of the costophrenic angles and trace effusions would be difficult to exclude.
No new focal consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.

Patient not to have escalation of care, will only treat with acute blood loss through transfusion and supportive care.
Also, lab draws will be limited to daily, even in setting of transfusion for decreased Hematocrit.
# Melena/Dysplastic Adenoma: In ED, initial hct 18, which rose to 26 with 1 unit PRBC.
Her daughter and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] stated that her mother would not want to have another colonoscopy or endoscopy.
Patient has a known malignant colonic mass and gastric varices.
The colonic mass was proven malignant on biopsy, but GI felt that endoscopic resection carried a high risk of perforation (documented in [**10-31**] d/c summary).
[**11-27**] she had a drop in her Hct with a large melanotic BM.
Patient had one more episode of a 5-point hematocrit drop to 21, which bumped up to 32 after two units of packed red cells.
Thrombocytopenia has been stable in the 50-70s range and may be secondary to medications (?meropenem).
# [**Last Name (un) **]- patient had worsening creatinine through her stay.
Urine eosinophils were negative and there was no peripheral eosinophilia.
# Thrombocytopenia: patient had worsening thrombocytopenia beginning on admission.
Fibrinogen was normal and she had no schistocytes.
Octreotide was stopped [**11-29**] as there have been case reports of octreotide-associated thrombocytopenia.
# Nocardia PNA: Diagnosed from BAL on previous admission.
Treated with imipenem and bactrim as outpatient for two weeks based on suspicion of possible dissminated Nocardia.
Patient to follow up with ID as outpatient for future management.
# Altered mental status: Mental status waxed and waned, sometimes more confused, but generally oriented to person, place and year.
It was felt that for most decisions she had decision-making capabilities.
# Systolic congestive heart failure, chronic - Per [**2137-8-26**] Echo, mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%) systolic function.
Does not appear volume overloaded on exam presently.
Echo on [**11-14**] shows dilated right heart, severe TR, moderate MR w/ functional mechanical prosthesis.
# Mechanical MVR Valve: Anticoagulation held indefinitely after lengthy discussion with patient and HCP, as noted above, despite risks of annual stroke given mechanical mitral valve.
# Bullous upper extremity rash:Continued hydrocortisone 1% cream.
# COPD/IPF: continued nebs and steroids.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: gastrointestinal bleeding colonic mass nocardia pneumonia acute on chronic kidney failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital for an acute gastrointestinal bleed.
It is likely that this bleeding originated from the colon, where it is known that you have a mass.
Also, you have a history of esophageal varices and these may bleeding as well.
After multiple discussions with the MICU/medical and GI teams in conjunction with your daughter in law, you have decided to not pursue any further diagnostic or interventional procedures.
We have also treated your pneumonia with antibiotics, which you will continue until you follow up with infectious disease physician as an outpatient.
