Bedside echo without signs of tampanade.
Pt has not had any more diarrhea since admission, until this morning, when she had 3 episodes of watery diarrhea.
She had had abdominal crampy pain throughout hospitaliziation, which she feels is getting better.

No evidence of colitis, or intraabdominal pathology.
Enlarged gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Ossifications within the spleen consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
Specifically, no evidence of infectious or ischemic colitis.
There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema.
2-cm aneurysmal dilatation of the splenic artery.
* Colonoscopy [**2155-4-18**]: Erythema and granularity in the ascending colon (biopsy).
Biopsy results: A. Terminal ileum biopsy: Fragments of  granulation tissue with acute and chronic inflammation consistent with ulceration and a fragment of ileal mucosa with reactive and atrophic changes.
Right colon biopsies: Colonic mucosa with focal atrophic and reactive changes.
C. Left colon biopsies: No significant pathology.
Ulceration may be seen in chronic graft versus host disease but may also be seen in ischemia, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.
Immunostains for CMV are negative with appropriate positive control, and no viral inclusions were seen on routine sections.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo woman with PCV s/p mini allo-BMT on [**9-30**] , admitted with sepsis now resolved, w/ persistent diarrhea.
A GI source of sepsis was suspected, which could have been predisposed by gut GVHD, through a cytokine mediated event.
Other potential etiologies were considered including dehydrational state from emesis/diarrhea vs adrenal insufficiency, or a combination of factors.
Factors supporting a "late" acute GVHD were her recent skin changes of GVHD and precipitation of diarrhea (>500cc/day) when cellcept and solumedrol were abruptly held in the ICU.
In addition, symptoms improved following re-initiation of these meds.
CT scan was performed which was negative for intra-abdominal pathology.
No evidence for micro-perforation, ischemia, or colitis was seen.
The GI service was consulted, and plan was made for potential biopsy if diarrhea continued to evaluate for GVHD vs. CMV.
She therefore underwent colonoscopy as her abdominal pain and diarrhea were persistent and worsening.
This showed a nonspecific acute on chronic inflammatory process, particularly in the terminal ileum, which could be consistent with acute on chronic GVHD versus infection versus IBD.
Pt began to improve somewhat and increased her ambulation, which also seemed to result in improvement of abdominal pain.
Her diet was advanced, and her abdominal pain got better.
Pt still had diarrhea on discharge, but stool output was only about 200cc/day.
POLYCYTHEMIA [**Doctor First Name **] S/P ALLO-BMT [**9-30**] - >100 days out.
CAD - Presented wtih lateral changes on EKG with rapid afib.
Remained chest pain free throughout her admission.
Bedside echo in unit was without tamponade signs.
Pt had no further cardiac issues after the resolution of her sepsis.
5. atrial fibrillation - Presented with Afib with RVR in ED in setting of fever, hypovolemia.
Now in sinus rhythm, with no further issues.
FEN - Pt was begun on TPN as her albumin was in the 2's, and it was thought that she would likely not be able to manage adequate nutrition in the setting of continued abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
