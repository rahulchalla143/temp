Interval increase in size of pulmonary metastases.
MRI/MRA Head - [**2196-9-19**] -  In spite of the recent CT scan report, the lesions suspected of being metastatic in etiology do not exhibit overt enhancement, arguing against this diagnosis.
They do reveal susceptibility effects, which are consistent with blood products or calcification.
In view of the patient's age, perhaps these lesions represent ischemic/hemorrhagic events, rather than metastatic lesions.
Certainly, the present study, and even the prior MR scan of [**2188-8-14**] exhibited areas of high T2 signal within the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with chronic small vessel infarction.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Considering the eight years between scans, there has been negligible change in ventricular size.
There does appear to be a posterior angulation of the odontoid process relative to the body, a finding which was not observed on the prior MR study.
There does not appear to be any prevertebral soft tissue swelling in this locale.
It should also be mentioned that there is some loss of definition of the atlanto-dental articulation.
There is limited imaging of the distal vasculature, likely due to reduced cardiac stroke volume.
There are no overt areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm identified.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Two hyperdense lesions identified, stable since [**2196-8-23**], and consistent with known metastatic disease.
Evaluation for additional metastatic lesions is limited on non-contrast head CT. For restaging, CT with contrast or MRI of the brain can be obtained on a nonemergent basis.
No focal, lateralized, or epileptiform discharges were noted.
The fracture gap measures 5 mm, and this does not change with flexion or extension.
There is anterolisthesis of the superior fracture fragment in relation to the base and angulation posteriorly; also unchanged with flexion or extension views.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 80 y/o male with metastatic melanoma to the brain and Parkinson's disease who was brought to the ED by his family on [**2196-9-19**] because of several days of altered mental status.
He was transferred to the MICU on [**2196-9-19**] for hypoxia secondary to aspiration and transferred back to the medicine floor on [**2196-9-23**].
After his episode of aspiration pneumonia, his clinical status worsened significantly with increased difficulty clearing his secretions and declining mental status.
Given patient's clinical worsening and multiple meetings with the Primary Team and Palliative care team,  comfort measures only were initiated per the family's request.
On Friday, [**9-30**], Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] died from likely cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to metastatic melanoma and end stage Parkinson's Disease complicated by aspiration pneumonia.
Metastatic Melanoma: Likely progressive given woresening poor functional status.
Given progressive clinical worsening, patient was changed to comfort measures with no further plans for chemotherapy or radiation.
Altered Mental Status: The etiology of his initial altered mental status may have been exacerbated by the whole brain radiation which he received prior to admission, in addition to dehydration, acute renal failure, metastatic brain lesions, worsening Parkinson's Disease, and malnutrition.
Dysphagia Patient had progressively worsening dysphagia over his admission.
PEG tube placement was attempted by IR on [**2196-9-26**] but could not be completed secondary to overlying stool.
Given patient's worsening clinical status, surgery was declined and patient was made comfort measures only very shortly after.
Posterior displacemnt of odontoid process During work-up of patient's altered mental status, head MRI noted posterior displacement of odontoid process.
Cervical CT spine was obtained [**2196-9-23**] which showed non-united fracture involving the dens, with the base of C2.
Cervical x-ray series showed no change of fracture with flexion or extension and anterolisthesis of the superior fracture fragment in relation to the base and angulation posteriorly which does not changed with flexion or extension views.
ARF: Patient was admitted with acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine to 1.1, thought likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Metastatic Melanoma.
Aspiration Pneumonia.
Old C2 fracture with retrolisthesis of C1 on C2.
