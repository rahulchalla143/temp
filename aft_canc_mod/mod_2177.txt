Admission Date:  [**2163-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-7-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-1-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: B/L life threatning leg ischemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2163-7-8**]  1.
Right femoral thromboembolectomy.
He now presents with  limb threatening  ischemia of both legs, right greater than  left.
Past Medical History: Past medical history is significant for lung cancer that is metastatic to the neck and hilum that is being treated with chemotherapy and is being monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] from The Cancer Center of [**Location (un) 86**].
Also past medical history is significant for pancytopenia with anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia  He also has a history of pericardial infusion with approximately 1200 cc of bloody fluid removed from the pericardial sac in [**Month (only) 1096**] without recurrence.
Past surgical history is significant for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, exploratory laparotomy for cancer, and questionable partial colectomy for diverticulitis.
His neck was supple without evidence of jugular venous distention or carotid bruits.
The heart was sinus tachycardia without murmer without evidence of murmur.
Lungs scattered rhonchi  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.
His extremity examination revealed the right lower extremity to be somewhat cool and paler from the left with decreased sensation.
non - palpable femoral pulse b/l non - palpable [**Doctor Last Name **] puls b/l left le -  dopplerable signals in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries.
BP (mm Hg): 70/40 HR (bpm): 113 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2163-7-14**] at 03:21 Test: TTE(Focused views) Doppler: No Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2003W275-0:0 Test Location: West Echo Lab Technical Quality: Suboptimal   INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows.
Conclusions: Large somewhat echo dense region around the heart (particularly the apex) consistent with an organized pericardial effusion/mass.
No atrial collapse is seen (pericardial effusion/mass smaller around the right atrium).
[**2163-7-13**]  INDICATION FOR CONSULT: INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION REACTION  INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT: Investigation of transfusion reaction  CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old man, s/p left axillobifemoral bypass for bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
He developed fever and respiratory distres during the transfusion of a unit of RBC on [**2163-7-13**].
According to the note from nurse and on-call resident, before tranfusion, the patient had two episodes of fever (>101.4) over the previous 48 hours, and a few hours before transfusion, he was noted to have shortness of breath and tachycardia.
[**2163-7-13**] 4:03 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: f/u CHF  CHEST AP PORTABLE: Comparison is made to the prior study obtained on [**2163-7-12**].
The heart is again noted to be mildly enlarged.
There is no significant change in overall pulmonary vasculature pattern.
There is residual bilateral lower lobe infiltrate/atelectasis.
Again noted is a bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left.
IMPRESSION:  Persistent CHF, with bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left.
There is no significant change from the prior study.
[**2163-7-12**]\  ECG Study  Sinus tachycardia Low voltage Incomplete right bundle branch block pattern Early precordial QRS transition with prominent R wave in lead V2 - consider posterior myocardial infarct of indeterminate age Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with slight ST elevation - cannot exclude in part injury/ischemia.
Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2163-7-10**]: sinus tachycardia rate has increased.

FINDINGS: The angiograms showed occlusion of the abdominal aorta just below the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) 899**]).
The celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and single right and double left renal arteries are opacified.
The distal common femoral, profunda femoris, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries are patent with no severe stenosis, and their opacification appears earlier than on the left side.
The tibioperoneal trunk and posterior tibial arteries are faintly opacified.
Occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta just below the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] takeoff.
Patency of the bilateral SFAs and popliteal arteries, with slower flow in the right than the left side.
Brief Hospital Course: pt admitted [**2163-7-7**] for acute rle ischemia  Heparin started stat  [**2163-7-7**]  Pt underwent a:  1.
He was sedated on a variety of drips for blood presssure control.
[**2163-7-9**]  One day  after  left  axillobifemoral  bypass for bilateral lower extremity ischemia, right greater than left.
Mr [**Known lastname **] right foot still was fairly  mottled and there was concern of distal thrombus.
In addition,  there  was a clear difference between the left and right foot, indicating potential for a unilateral problem.
Mr [**Known lastname **] then underwent a second procedure for his ischemic limb.
Right femoral thromboembolectomy.
During the procedure it was thought that  there was nothing technically that could be  fixed,  this  was  either  related to spasm of the distal vessels from chronic ischemia and the pressors, or related to thrombus  in  the distal vessels.
At  this  point, the decision was made to do nothing further, since there was no bypass situation that could be expected to be successful.
To note, pt remained slighty tachycardic.
His heart rate was in the 140's, with low BP SBP 90's.
There was a low threshold for reintubation (bi-pap).
[**2165-7-14**]  Pt spiked temperature to 102, became more tachycardic with SBP in the 70's.
CXR showed r plueral effussion.
Pt developed PEA - ACLS protocol was initiated.
two liters of transudate recoverd.
F/U CXR showed no effussion or pnuemothorax.
Pericardial centesis performed ( 10 cc non pulsatile blood )  Cardiology consulted - echo rechecked.
