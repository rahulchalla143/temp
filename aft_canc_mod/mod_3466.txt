Admission Date:  [**2171-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-1-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: mediastinal [**Hospital3 32582**] failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endobronchial/endotracheal stenting  History of Present Illness: 22 yoM with a h/o Germ cell tumor of mediastinum with airway obstruction s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia, pseudomonal pneumonia, and pseudomonal abscess at the site of a central line who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 2177**] for airway stent placement.
Patient initially presented to OSH in respiratory distress and was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass on CXR, confirmed by CT.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2171-7-22**] per request of family   According to family, patient was in his usual state of health until he started to have generalized symptoms 6 months prior to presentation to OSH including sore throat, cough, and respiratory symptoms.
Patient had been treated for 2 weeks for bronchitis without resolution.
At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for acute respiratory distress and started on APRV ventilation.
Patient had multiple episodes of desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better ET positioning.
On bronchoscopy, anterior mass was noticed to cause trachea narrowing and obstruction of mainstem bronchi bilaterally.
Patient was extubated on [**8-23**] but then required reintubation on [**8-30**] due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He underwent u/s guided bx of his anterior mediastinal mass on [**7-23**].
Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**].
Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol, dexamethasone, and IV fluids.
Chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions on Neupogen.
Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF.
Both were continued with the addition of fluconazole for neutropenic precautions following chemo.
Patient then developed an abscess in his R groin at the site of a prior line which was I&Ded by surgery on [**8-16**] and was also the source of the above mentioned MDR pseudomonas sepsis.
Patient had pseudomonas in blood, urine, and R groin abscess cultures.
This was continued after 14 days secondary to neutropenia.
Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in sputum and urine.
Also on empiric flagyl for diarrhea and elevated WBC.
C diff was negative x 3 and was thought to be secondary to chemotherapy.
A CT scan was obtained on [**9-15**] showing ileocecal thickening and ?
typhlitis (necrotizing enterocolitis) as well as some ?
intusseception fo ascending colon, although there was no evidence of obstruction.
From a renal perspective, ARF thought to be secondary to pseudomonas sepsis and hypotension on [**8-8**].
Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor response.
Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal.
Quinton eventually clotted on [**8-25**] and he recent emergent dialysis through a newly placed left femoral line.
He then went to IR for possible L quinton placement for HD, but was discovered to have bilat DVTs in IJs which prevented placement.
He eventually responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection.

DR. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16277**]  CT Chest [**2171-9-18**] - PRIOR to stent placement: Final Report CT CHEST REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of patient with known anterior mediastinal germ-cell tumor.
No prior exams were available for comparison.
TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced MDCT of the chest from thoracic inlet to upper abdomen was obtained with subsequent 1.25 and 5 mm collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal reformat.
FINDINGS: Generally prevascular soft tissue mediastinal mass is heterogeneous, 9.5 by 10.0 x 5.0 cm in diameter.
The mass extends towards the left lower neck with right tracheal displacement.
The carina is markedly narrowed as well as the main bronchi origins with almost complete collapse of the left main bronchus by the markedly posteriorly displaced aorta.
Large right lower paratracheal mass most likely a lymph node is at least 3.0 x 3.3 cm in size although precise determination over the boundaries is difficult due to absence of contrast enhancement.
SVC can be followed to the superior margin of this mass and then and no obvious SVC continuation is demonstrated within the limitation of this unenhanced study.
The lungs demonstrate multiple subpleural and central parenchymal nodules and and subpleural consolidations, the largest one in LUL,  up to 1.6 cm in left lower lobe,  2.7 cm in left upper lobe,  and 2.0 cm in  right lower lobe mass representing metastatic spread of the disease.
The heart size is mildly enlarged with small pericardial effusion.
There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Large anterior mediastinal mass consistent with known diagnosis of germ- cell tumor, which significantly deviates posteriorly the mediastinal structures with subsequent tracheal encasing and narrowing up to almost complete occlusion of left main bronchus.
Multiple lung metastases in both subpleural and central location.
Small pericardial effusion.
5, 1.25 mm collimations images and coronal reformations were provided and reviewed.
Bibasilar posterior atelectasis is new.
There are no short term interval changes in the large anterior mediastinal mass, lung metastasis, and small pericardial effusion.
There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pneumomediastinum.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 22 yoM with a h/o Germ cell tumor of mediastinum complicated by airway obstruction, pseudomonal pna and groin abscess transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway stent placement.
# airway obstruction: secondary to mediastinal tumor.
Currently ventilating without difficulty.
- Check baseline CXR - cont AC support pending stent placement - sedation with fentanyl, midazolam - albuterol/atrovent MDIs .
# Germ cell tumor: s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy as above.
- vanco for staph on Quinton tip - cefepime, amikacin for pseudomonas - caspofungin for empiric fungal coverage - pan-culture if spikes - ID consult if patient remains in house after tomorrow .
# pseudomonal abscess: wound seems to be improving.
# pancytopenia: Hct and platelets reportedly stable from OSH recs.
- trend CBC .
# diarrhea: on empiric flagyl despite negative C diff cultures.
At risk given recent neutropenia.
Patient afebrile currently.
No tenderness on exam.
- cont IV antibiotics - serial abdominal exams .
# hypertension/tachycardia: secondary to agitation according to OSH recs.
Can increase prn as BP will tolerate - treat pain with methadone, fentanyl gtt .
Replete lytes prn - nephrocaps .
# ACCESS: PICC .
The interventional pulmonologists (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]) and ICU team here at [**Hospital1 18**] recommend trach and peg placement for this patient as it is felt that the patient would be difficult to extubate in the setting of his tumor burden and prolonged course of intubation.
Please return to [**Hospital1 18**] or the emergency department for any difficulty breathing or any other healthcare concerns.
