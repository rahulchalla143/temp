# Dry Gangrene:  Vascular surgery has followed this patient throughout the duration of this hospitalization.
He needs an amputation of his left toes, debridement of the dry gangrene over the dorsum of his left foot and a bypass to revascularize the remaining portions of his lower extremity.
He received daily wound care.
Likely [**3-3**] hypoglycemia but possibly a 2nd insult; seems to be slowly improving by day.
The patient may have underlying cognitive impairment at baseline.
He will have a follow up appiontment with gastroenterology and possible future palliative polypectomy.
# Anemia of chronic disease: [**Month (only) 412**] also have an element of iron deficiency due to his rectal mass.
#######################################################   Chief Complaint: initially presented with L foot gangrene, acute renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Carbon dioxide angiogram   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 73 y.o.
M with no past medical history due to no medical care who is being transferred from the vascular service to the medical service for acute renal failure.
Patient was admitted to OSH ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital in Havervill, MA) on [**1-27**] for FTT after his son noticed patient was increasingly lethargic and brought him to medical attention.
There he was noted to have L foot gangrene.
Per patient, had been experiencing spreading erythema and foot pain while walking x3 months.
Also noted to be guaiac positive and to have a rectal mass, and to be frequently stooling.
While on the vascular service, patient was started on IV Vancomycin for presumed osteomyelitis and oral flagyl for presumed c. diff infection (although has had 3 sets of negative toxin assays), and recommended angiogram.
Renal was consulted for ARF on [**2-13**], and thought it was due to AIN due to antibiotics or PPI.
Therefore, it was recommended that steroids were initiated (prednisone 40 mg PO daily), PPI be d/c-ed and changed to H2 blocker, and to schedule a renal biopsy if renal failure continued to worsen.
Vancomycin has been held since [**2-12**], with trough still elevated at 30.9 on transfer on [**2-15**].
No blood in stools or toilent.
No food insults.
No exposures to small children.
No recent ingestion of peanut butter or hamburgers.
No fevers, chills, or weight loss or recent travel.
No problems with clothes or shoes fitting.
No blood in urine.
He was transferred to the medicine service for management of his acute renal failure, diarrhea, and management of his multiple medical problems including diabetes and hypertension.
On the floor, patient became delirious, refusing PIV and blood draws.
Past Medical History: ETOH abuse Rectal mass - not fully worked up Anemia - not worked up  Social History: Widower, who lives alone, on meals on wheels.
NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: CTA, BS BL, No W/R/C ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
Markedly abnormal first toe with extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
No definite underlying bony abnormality.
Focal 6 mm lucency along medial base of first metatarsal could represent a small focus of osteomyelitis, though is remote from the area of subcutaneous emphysema and from the clinical area of concern in the lateral foot.
Faint area of relative lucency along the medial aspect of the medial cuneiform likely represents artifact.
Renal u/s - [**2-12**] - IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
There are no focal defects to suggest infarct or embolus.
IMPRESSION: No defects to suggest renal infarct or embolus.
CXR: LLL retrocardiac opacity c/f PNA (noted on [**2132-2-15**]) => repeat CXR showed improved of opacity, with small bilateral effusions.
A patent abdominal aorta that is diffusely diseased, but     no areas of flow-limiting stenosis.
CONCLUSION:  The patient would need a femoral to above-knee popliteal artery bypass, along with a left transmetatarsal amputation to achieve a satisfactory wound healing in the left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 73 yo M with poor medical care, originally admitted to the Vascular Surgery service, transferred to the Hospital Medicine Service on [**2-15**] with acute renal failure, HTN, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, healthcare associated pneumonia, L foot gangrene/osteomyelitis, and delirium.
Was very calm during the daytime, so likely sundowning, which was responsive to zyprexa with stable QTc interval around 450.
Underlying causes were treated individually (pneumonia was treated with antibiotics, hypernatremia was treated with maintenence fluids, acute interstitial nephritis with steroid treatment, vancomycin and PPI were held, and ranitidine was renally dosed).
Patient also has history of EtOH abuse, but there was no evidence of EtOH withdrawal.
No evidence of rhabdomyolisis.
The patient was transferred to the MICU after one of these episodes where he was found to be profoundly and persistently hypoglycemic.
He was able to be extubated without difficulty.
#Acute Renal Failure: Likely secondary to acute interstitial nephritis (Vancomycin versus PPI related), both of which were held.
Renal scan without focal infarcts/emboli.
Sputum culture showed staph aureus.
Angiogram was performed after renal function improved, and showed a L superficial femoral occlusion with some collaterals above the popliteal artery.
Vascular recommended a fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and a transmetatarsal amputation, which was postponed given altered mental status.
This continued to be addressed as his mental status cleared, and eventually the decision was made to defer this until his deconditioning and nutritional status improves.
# Leukocytosis: Likely multifactorial, due to pneumonia, gangrene, steroid use, and generalized inflammation from acute renal failure.
# Hypernatremia: Likely in setting of diarrhea, diuresis from hyperglycemia, and poor PO intake.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: New diagnosis for this patient, but likely had chronically.
No evidence of microalbuminuria.
Hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%, so either onset of DM is relatively recent or blood sugars in 400s were acute exacerbated by prednisone.
Continued beta-blocker and started simvastatin given low HDL levels.
Course was complicated by hypoglycemic coma after starting glyburide, requiring transfer to the MICU on [**2-27**].
Likely related to rectal mass and chronic retention of stool.
Other etiologies include giardia, but no evidence of fresh water ingestions or recent camping.
Patient reports fatty stools, but lipase values are normal and patient is without abdominal pain and tolerating a full diet, so unlikely pancreatic enzyme deficiency.
Pt had flex sigmoidoscopy performed here for assessment of rectal mass.
Had colonoscopy at OSH showing multiple colonic polyps in the ascending and sigmoid colon (1 with high grade dysplasia) and rectal mass (villous adenoma, no adenocarcinoma identified).
Based on biopsy and impox stains obtained from OSH, GI suggested that the rectal mass can be excised via endoscopic transanal approach as an outpatient.
Patient also may have uremic platelets in setting of ARF.
# HTN: initially controlled with metoprolol and amlodipine, later discontinued.
Meds will need to be resumed as outpatient as he was hypertensive prior to discharge.
Obtained GI follow-up as outpatient for palliative polypectomy.
# Peri-anal cysts: chronic.
continued wound care.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 49**] - [**Location (un) 50**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PVD Left foot gangrene Acute Renal failure- likely AIN Anemia of chronic disease Rectal mass diabetes mellitus type II- new diagnosis hypertension- will need meds  Discharge Condition: alert, oriented to person & place, tolerating ground solids but appetite poor, still with significant diarrhea  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a diagnosis of acute renal failure and left foot gangrene and a pneumonia.
Your renal failure was though to be due to an antibiotic called Vancomycin or a proton pump inhibitor.
Vascular surgery recommends revascularization of your left foot, but due to a flexion contracture of the left leg, they would like you to go to rehab for 2 weeks before the procedure.
Your pneumonia was treated with antibiotics and resolved.
You were also noticed to have hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus.
You have a rectal mass and chronic diarrhea.
Your diarrhea is likely due to the rectal mass.
Your stool cultures were negative for toxins or bacterial infection.
Please return to the ED or call your primary care physician if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, inability to make urine, abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea, worsening of the foot gangrene, fevers, chills, loss of consciousness, or any other symptoms not listed here that warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 13054**].
