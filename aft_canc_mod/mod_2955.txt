Admission Date:  [**2200-5-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-5-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2154-5-21**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45 year-old female with a past medical history significant for metastatic melanoma to the lung, liver, pancreas and bone who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with dyspnea.
She had a pleural tap one and a half weeks prior to this admission at [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] when 650 cc of fluid was removed.
She had also been complaining of severe baseline constipation for which she uses Fleet enemas every other day.
The patient arrived to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room on the morning of admission when she had a chest x-ray showing a large right sided pleural effusion.
A pleurocentesis was performed in the Emergency Room, yielding 1000 cc of bloody fluid, with a post procedure chest x-ray showing decreased size in the effusion and no pneumothorax.
At about 3:30 p.m. on the day of admission the Intensive Care Unit team was called to see the patient secondary to decreased oxygen saturations.
(On arrival to the floor the patient was sating 96% on 6 liters after which she proceeded to have undetectable oxygen saturations).
She had increased work of breathing with shallow breaths.
An echocardiogram done at the bedside prior to transfer to the unit showed right ventricular dilatation with mild to moderate right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The patient remained hypotensive despite titrating up the neo-synephrine to 2.45 micrograms per kilogram per minute.
Her anemia was thought to be secondary to her hemothorax given the increased effusion on her chest x-ray and recent intervention.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and a right sided chest tube was placed, which drain 2 liters of dark bloody fluid.
The patient was felt to be in DIC secondary to a consumptive coagulopathy secondary to ............ of her coagulation factor and the large collection of blood in her pleural space as well as a dilutional coagulopathy secondary to intravenous fluid resuscitation with large amounts of intravenous normal saline.
A repeat arterial blood gas after resuscitation with fluid and blood products was pH 6.96, PCO2 68, PO2 124.
She was thought to have a respiratory acidosis and a dilutional anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to large amounts of intravenous normal saline.
The patient was given two amps of sodium bicarb after which her pH increased to 7.27 and then 7.33.
A bronchoscopy was performed on the day of transfer to the MICU showing some degree of airway edema, erythematous and hemorrhagic mucosa.
Her sedation was subsequently increased along with her paralytics with a slight decrease in her blood pressure and peak inspiratory pressures.
Her melanoma was initially located on her left scapula.
In [**2200-3-1**] a PET scan showed metastasis to the lung, sternum, left humerus, three lumbar vertebra, left proximal femur, liver and nodal metastasis.
A chest CT performed in [**2200-3-1**] showed a region in the right hilum with associated adenopathy.
L3 compression fracture.
Allergic rhinitis.
Malignant hypercalcemia treated with Pamidronate.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had prostate cancer.
Uncle had a thoracic malignancy.
Sclera anicteric.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs decreased breath sounds throughout the right lung anteriorly, left lung was clear to auscultation.
Abdomen slightly tense and distended with mild left lower quadrant tenderness.
There were decreased breath sounds throughout.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit showing interval enlargement of right pleural effusion with only a small amount of residual aerated right lung.
There were left lower lung nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, T wave flattening in 3, AVL and V2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 45 year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma to the spine, lungs, liver, pancrease, presenting with increased dyspnea from [**Hospital3 **].
She was found to have a recurrent large right pleural effusion status post pleurocentesis with removal of 2 liters of fluid about one and a half weeks ago.
The patient was found to be hemodynamically unstable several hours after her pleurocentesis with hypotension, shallow and labored breathing.
A repeat chest x-ray showed increased size of her pleural effusion after her tap, a 14 point drop in her hematocrit.
Her hypotension and respiratory distress were likely secondary to blood loss and hemothorax as a complication of her procedure.
The patient was also found to be increasing coagulopathic likely secondary to consumption of her coagulation factors by large collection of blood in her thorax as well as a dilutional coagulopathy secondary to resuscitation with large amounts of bicarbonate free fluid.
Hypotension:  The patient was initially hypotensive secondary to massive blood loss likely secondary to distributive shock.
However, septic shock was also a contributing factor, given that the patient was immunocompromised and reported rigors and chills with fevers on admission.
She was also placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with intravenous Levaquin, Flagyl and Vancomycin to cover for the possibility of septic shock.
The patient had intermittent episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures into the 70s, which responded well to intravenous fluid boluses.
Toward the end of her Intensive Care Unit stay it was decided not to administer any more intravenous fluid boluses as the patient was becoming increasingly edematous, which was decreasing her chest wall compliance and impairing ventilation.
She was placed on AC ventilation initially with intermittent increased CO2 levels, which corrected with increasing respiratory rate on the ventilator settings.
During her hospital stay the patient was noted to have increased peak inspiratory pressures.
A transesophageal balloon was transduced revealing that her increased peak inspiratory pressures were likely secondary to extrinsic compression secondary to her increased abdominal distention and decreased chest wall compliance secondary to chest wall edema from massive fluid resuscitation.
Her PEEP was increased to 20 to allow for increased alveolar recruitment.
The patient was not sent down for a CT angiogram to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism as she was deemed to be too unstable to go to the CT scanner.
It was decided not to treat her with Lasix for her total body volume overload as she was felt to have leaky capillary secondary to an inflammatory response.
Toward the end of her hospital stay she started stooling with decreased abdominal distention.
On [**5-19**] the patient's ventilator alarm secondary to high pressures.
She subsequently became asystolic on monitor with no pulse.
Infectious disease:  The patient reported fevers and chills at rehab with a bandemia on admission.
She subsequently had decreased white blood cell count suggestive of sepsis versus dilutional secondary to massive fluid resuscitation.
She grew out one out of two bottles positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Possible sources for sepsis included her pleural effusion, a hidden infiltrate or pneumonia under her effusion, versus an abdominal source given her obstipation and potential feeding of bowel.
An abdominal ultrasound was done, which showed no ascites.
Toward the end of her hospital stay she spiked high temperatures to 103 and 104.
Potential sources were thought to be her left femoral line, which was removed.
She was given Tylenol prn for her fevers.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had abdominal distention and tenderness on admission.
An initial KUB showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
She was broadly covered with Vanco, Levo and Flagyl to cover a possible abdominal sources for sepsis.
Hematology:  The patient was initial anemic secondary to blood loss and coagulopathic secondary to consumption by large amount of sequestered blood in her thorax as well as dilution secondary to massive fluid resuscitation.
The decrease in her white blood cell count was also thought to be secondary to sepsis versus dilutional.
Her coagulopathy improved, but persisted.
The patient transferred her oncology care from [**Hospital1 2025**] to [**Hospital1 1444**] secondary to dissatisfaction with care.
Endocrine:  A.M. Cortisol level was checked and was 29 ruling out adrenal insufficiency as a cause of her hypotension.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess hemodynamics revealing increased pulmonary artery pressures to 50/30, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22, with a cardiac output of 6 and cardiac index of 3 and SVR of 665 indicating that the patient was retaining sufficient fluid in her intravascular space, but was still demonstrating ............ physiology secondary to a systemic inflammatory response.
She was also hypocalcemic initially secondary to massive resuscitation with blood products.
Toward the end of her hospital stay they decided that they did not want any pressors, CPR or defibrillation or ventilator changes.
