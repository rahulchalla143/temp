Admission Date:  [**2143-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-9-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Aspirin / Motrin / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Right Frontal Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2143-3-29**]: Right frontal crani for mass resection with cranioplasty   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 73F with PMH significant for breast cancer s/p mastectomy in [**2118**], now with right frontal brain mass.
Past Medical History: s/p right mastectomy for breast cancer [**2118**](no chemo/radiation), Anxiety, Hypothyroid, Dyslipidemia, s/p bilateral eye surgery(for unk drainage problem),Hypertension  Social History: non-contributory  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Exam on Discharge: Awake alert oriented x 3 / non focal neurological exam.
COMPARISON: MR of the head of [**3-29**], performed earlier in the morning and CT of the head, [**2143-3-26**].
A small amount of extra-axial fluid is noted overlying the dura.
Tiny foci of hyperdensities are seen, consistent with expected minimal postoperative hemorrhage.
There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Pneumocephalus is overlying the right frontal lobe causing mild mass effect.
There is persistent leftward shift of midline structures of approximately 5-6 mm, unchanged.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the previously identified intra- and extracranial mass has been resected.
There is some meningeal enhancement seen.
There is no residual nodular enhancement identified.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
No acute infarct.
No acute infarct.
CT Torso [**2143-3-30**];  FINDINGS:  CTEST:  Evaluation of the lungs demonstrate a large confluent mass in the left upper lobe with heterogeneous enhancement and prominent interstitial thickening that involves both the left upper lobe and a smalll part of the superior segment left lower lobe.
This constellation of findings are highly suspicious for consolidative metastatic mass with lymphangitic spread of cancer versus lymphatic obstruction within the lung, and lymph node involvement in the neck.
A small left pleural effusion is present.
Minimal layering debris is identified within the trachea.
The brachiocephalic veins, superior vena cava, and visualized inferior vena cava appear unremarkable.
Atherosclerotic changes are noted within the aorta.
No aneurysm is identified.
The pulmonary arterial trunk, central major branches, and segmental branches do not demonstrate any intraluminal defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.
No pericardial effusion is identified.
ABDOMEN:  A small paraesophageal hernia is identified.
Simple cysts and lesions too small to characterize but probably cysts are seen in both kidneys.
Nonspecific calcifications are seen in the right kidney which has a linear morphology and most likely are vascular in nature.
There is fusion of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies with some loss of height anteriorly.
No osseous metastases identified.
Left upper lobe and left lower lobe confluent heterogeneous enhancing mass with interstitial lung thickening consistent with metastatic disease probably with lymphangitic spread.
Left neck soft tissue mass incompletely evaluated on this study; however, highly suspicious for shotty adenopathy.
Small periesophageal hernia.
No liver lesions are identified.
Severe scoliosis of the thoracic and lumbar spine with congenital abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 73F electively admitted to NSURG on [**3-29**] for a right frontal craniotomy for mass resection, and frontal cranioplasty.
She is refusing to follow up with thoracic surgery for her lung mass but has their phone number if she chooses to do so.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for ANXIETY.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Brain and Skull Mass   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS YOU [**Month (only) **] RESUME YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION WOUND CARE: ??????
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**9-26**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
