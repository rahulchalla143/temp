1. hypoTN: likely combination of bleeding and sepsis.
Pt was originally started with amp/levo and flagyl with continued hypotension and intermittent fever, abx changed to vanco/levo and flagyl.
Despite being on broad spectrum of abx, pt remain hypotensive and developed DIC with high d-dimer and increased FDP and coagulopathy, and required neosyn and levophed for BP suppor till expired.
Bleed from hepatoma lesions s/p embolization, hct relatively stable throughout hospital stay.
2: tachy afib with CP: s/p amiodarone and digoxin loading, ECHO showed global hypokinesis with EF 10%, likely had a MI.
3. acute on chronic renal failure: initially improved with rehydration and transfusion, likely pre-renal, urine Na<10, UreaN521 Cr84 osm364 FENa=0.2% but later increased again from 1.7 to 2.2 to 3 to >7, likely combination of hepatorenal and ATN from the dye loading and hypotension.
Pt expired on [**5-30**], intern was called for asystole, pt with rare sporadic respirations which ceased w/in approx 10 min.
Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by biopsy in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2156**].
Hepatitis C contracted by blood transfusion during CABG.
Chronic atrial fibrillation, but not on Coumadin.
