Admission Date:  [**2118-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-1-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-1-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: weakness, SOB with exertion and left sided chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial drainage with pigtail catheter Left thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 46 y/o man with a hx of positive PPD, and a recently diagnosed NSCLC who presents with 3 day hx of weakness, SOB with exertion and left sided chest pain which radiates to his back and he describes saying "it feels like someone is poking me."
He also reported night sweats and weight loss, but denied fever and shortness of breath.
A chest CT was performed in [**11-15**] which showed a 3.1 x 1.7 cm cavitary mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe in addition to multiple large mediastinal lymph nodes.
There were also several lytic lesions in the thoracic and lumbar spine which were concerning for metastases.
Spirometry was performed and was consistent with a severe obstructive defect.
Sputum cytology was negative for AFB and malignant cells but transbronchial needle aspiration showed atypical epithelioid and inflammatory cells suspicious for malignancy and precarinal LN and bronchial washings were both positive for malignant cells, consistent with NSCLC.
In the ED, the pt was found to have an elevated pulsus paradoxus at 15-20.
An echo showed a large echodense pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There was RV diastolic collapse, consistent with tamponade.
In the cath lab, 1500cc of grossly bloody pericardial fluid was drained and a pericardial drain was sutured in place.
The pericardial fluid cytology was positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell metastatic carcinoma.
The pt was also found by CXR to have a large consolidation in the left lower lobe with small bilateral pleural effusions, and evidence of pulmonary edema.
His repeat ECHO showed greatly decreased size of pericardial effusion and the pericardial drain was pulled.
In the MICU, pt has also had 2 episodes of episode of A-fib.
Finally, the pt had thoracentesis before coming to the floor.
No history of hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease.

Brief Hospital Course: # Pericardial effusion - Pt is a 46 y/o man with a hx of positive PPD, and a recently diagnosed NSCLC who presents with 3 day hx of weakness, SOB with exertion and left sided chest pain which radiates to his back and he describes saying "it feels like someone is poking me."
In the ED, the pt was found to have an elevated pulsus paradoxus at 15-20.
An echo showed a large echodense pericardial effusion consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There was RV diastolic collapse, consistent with tamponade.
In the cath lab, 1500cc of grossly bloody pericardial fluid was drained and a pericardial drain was sutured in place.
The pericardial fluid cytology was positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell metastatic carcinoma.
A post-drainage echo showed a moderate sized residual pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
# PNA - On presentation, the pt was also found by CXR to have a large consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Pt was treated with 7 days of CTX and 4 days of azithromycin for his Left lobe PNA.
Pt continues to have non-productive cough and reports left sided chest pain with coughing, but this cough is unchanged from the pt's prior cough.
He was afebrile from [**1-5**].
3 induced sputums were obtained.
# Afib - In the MICU, pt has also had 2 episodes of episodes of A-fib.
Pt will continue Amiodarone as he is at risk for further episodes of a-fib secondary to irritation of the RA from his pericardial effusion.
# Low EF - Pt noted on inital echo to have a normal EF, but on poist-drainage echo to have a low EF at 30%.
# NSCLC - Pt diagnosed w/ NSCLC [**12-22**] and is followed by Heme/Onc.
Pt likely has  stage IV disease given presence of malignant pericardial effusion and osteolytic lesions in spine.
Head MRI showed no evidence of brain metastases.
For ostoeolytic lesions, pt was loaded with Vitamin D and Calcium and received one dose of Zometa on [**1-9**].
# Pleural Effusions - Bilateral pleural effusions were noted on presentation.
Pt is s/p thoracentesis of left effusion, found to be exuadative by protein criteria and  positive for malignant cells, with no AFB staining.
Since pt was not symptomatic with pleural effusions, no drainage of rt sided effusion or pleurodesis was required at this time.
A repeat CXR on [**1-9**] showed resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.
# Thrombophlebitis - Pt developed L forearm thrombophlebitis, with a warm, erythematous, tender cord.
Pt was treated symptomatically with warm compresses and the eryethema and tenderness resolved.
# Elevated LFTs - Pt's LFTs increased the day following admission.
Etiolgy likely hepatic congestion secondary to cardiac tamponade/failure.
# Anemia - Hct drop likely from bleed into pericardial space.
Plan was to transfuse pt for Hct<21 but pt's Hct has increased without transfusion.
Nl SPEP, UPEP, so no evidence of myeloma.
# Difficulty walking - On admission, pt's wife reported that he was having leg pain and difficulty walking.
Pt reports that he has had ankle pain but that he had been able to walk without difficulty.
PT reports that no further acute PT is needed at this time.
# Code - Status changed to DNR/DNI, but pt requests aggressive treatment for NSCLC   Medications on Admission: cough medicine  Discharge Medications: 1.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade PNA Pleural effusions **************** NSCLC +PPD   Discharge Condition: Stable, pericardial effusion stable with no signs of tamponade   Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical care if you develop lightheadedness, shortness of breath, increasing chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
