The tumor was largely asymptomatic initially and underwent a stereotactic biopsy.
The patient recently became symptomatic with progressive headaches and it was felt that ventricular entrapment contributed to this particular situation.
Past Medical History: DM type II CAD hyperchol.
Extraocular movements are full; there is  no nystagmus or saccadic intrusions.
Motor Examination: He does not have a drift.
He does not have a Romberg.

Since the previous tracing earlier on [**2140-12-16**] no change.
Small LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA   PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined  MRI of brain: Residual mass within the left lateral ventricle demonstrates patchy enhancement that has decreased in size compared to the preoperative study, now measuring approximately 2.7 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm, previously 2.9 x 2.2 x 2.8 cm.
There is a new tract that extends through the left frontal lobe to the left lateral ventricle with surrounding signal abnormality and enhancement.
No new masses are identified.
There is mild ethmoid mucosal thickening.
Post operatively he was noted to have some expressive aphasia.
On POD#1 he was transferred to the surgical floor and later that evening he went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response thought to be related to hypervolemia.
on [**12-16**] CTA chest showed consolidation in the lower lobes bilaterally as well as less prominent in the upper lobes.
The distribution is suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
no PE, no DVT was seen on lower extremity dopplers.
He ruled in for an MI by troponin.
[**12-15**] MRI Head: Residual tumor in the left lateral ventricle.
He had difficulty voiding and required a new foley catheter.
