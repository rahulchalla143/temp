MICRO: RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2100-11-7**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
No aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism.
Persistent tumor encasing the posterior mediastinum, carina and right hilum.
The overall extent of this tumor appears to have decreased from the previous study with resultant improved patency of the airways and resolution of right upper lobe and lower lobe atelectasis.
New bilateral lytic rib lesions consistent with metastatic disease.
There is also a new pathologic left posterior eighth rib fracture.
Tumor involvement in the posterior mediastinum is inseparable from the esophagus and there is a large volume of ingested material seen in the proximal esophagus.
This finding raises concern for aspiration.
Bone Scan: [**11-5**] IMPRESSION: Multiple osseous metastatic lytic foci involving the thoracic ribsthe right femoral neck with associated pathologic fracture involvingthe left posterior 8th rib as can be correlated on recent CT/radiographs.
Innumerable lytic lesions throughout the sacrum, bilateral iliac bones, and proximal femurs.
There is rarefaction of the medial aspect of the right femur medially at the site of the lesion which is at risk for pathologic fracture.
Interval development of ascites in the abdomen.
Overall progression of subcarinal and paraesophageal mass with occlusion of the distal unstented portions of the right middle and lower lobe bronchi.
Subtotal occlusion of the esophageal stent in its mid portion with associated distention of the proximal esophagus.
Marked interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis at the lower lobes.
Brief Hospital Course: # Metastatic Lung Cancer.
Continued growth resulted in esophageal compression as well as invasion into the bronchial tree.
Furthermore, patients additional presenting complaint of right hip weakness found to result from tumor infiltration of right intertrochanteric space.
Provided with prescriptions to minimize pain, decrease nausea, decrease anxiety and improve work of breathing.
# Hemoptysis: Secondary to endobronchial tumor burden.
Pt with continued slow bleeding initially, embolized by IR.
s/p IR procedure no further episodes of active hemopytsis.
# Esophageal obstruction: Tumor was found to be compressing espogeal resulting in near occlusion.
Unfortunately CT scan on day following stent placement revealed subtotal occlusion of distal esphagus.
# Pelvic lesion.
Initially discussion of possible operative intervention vs XRT.
However after much discussion decision made to treat pain with and forego additional treatment measures.
# Pneumonia.
Patient developed worsening post-obstructive pneumonia after esophageal stent placement.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued treatment of your lung cancer with associated complications of trouble swallowing, coughing up blood, and hip pain.
During this procedure they were able identify the source of the bleed and apply thermal energy to stop it.
You had not further episodes of coughing up large volumes of blood while hospitalized.
You also noted difficulty swallowing.
It was discovered that the tumor was compressing your esophagus making it difficult for you to swallow.
The decision was made to place an esophageal stent in hopes of making swallowing easier.
Unfortunately, the force of the tumor on the esophageal stent caused the area of the stent to lessen only allowing passage of liquids.
Ultimately it was determined that your increased pain was due to tumor involvement in the bones of the hip.
Your pain was controlled with morphine and physical therapy worked with you to optimize your strength and ability to transfer.
You will be discharged with medications to control pain, decrease nasuea and improve breathing: - MORPHINE 5-10mg PO every 2 hours as needed for the pain - ZOFRAN 4mg tablets.
Take one tablet every 8 hours as needed for pain - ALBUTEROL Inhaler 2 PUFFS as needed for shortness of breath - ALBUTEROL Nebulizer treatment.
1 every 6hrs as needed for shortness of breath - LORAZAPAM 0.5 mg SL Q4H as needed for anxiety - Guaifenesin [**4-19**] mL PO/NG every four hours for cough  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27009**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87543**] as needed and contact your hospice program with any questions or difficulties    Completed by:[**2100-11-16**
