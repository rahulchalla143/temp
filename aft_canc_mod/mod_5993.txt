He was on high dose steroid therapy to reduce the cerebral edema and developed a myopathy which prompted the gradual tapering of his steroids.
His daughter notes that since the reduction of the steroids he has had become increasingly lethargic and fatigued.
In addition, she notes that over the past 24 hours he has had several episodes of urinary incontinence and emesis.
She also notes he has had increasing difficulty walking and performing his basic tasks.
His daughter reports that he has been drinking but has had a decreased appetite over the past 48 hours.
He was recently diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT for which he was started on lovenox therapy.
Accoring to his daughter no chest pain, shortness of breath or syncopal episodes today.
ER course - CT of head demonstrated increasing midline shift leftward from the MRI done in [**2172-2-20**]; worsening edema; mass effect on left ventricle; displacement of ipsilateral lateral ventricle although degree of herniation has increased; progressive left peduncle herniation.
CVA ([**2171-6-20**]): internal capsule stroke with residual neurological deficits including aphasia 5.
[**Name (NI) **] turned his business in acoustic ceilings over to his son.
Family History: Father - cerebral hemorrhage Sister - stroke Brother - heart disease Mother - HTN.
Physical Exam: vitals: BP 114/68, P-106, R-20 and T-97 gen - old male appears stated age; lethrgic on exam and answers questions with "yes / no" appropriately; oriented to person and place; speech is mildly slurred with word finding difficulty heent - clear OP; no conjunctival palor cv - regular rate with a normal S1,S2.
No m/g or rub apparent on exam.
abdomen - soft, non-tender, non-distended.
Normal bowel sounds extremities - edema bilaterlly (R>L) in the lower extremities skin - pink with normal turgor neuro - right pupil is 4mm-->2mm and reactive; left pupil is fixed and dilated (old); mild right facial droop; palate and tongue are midline; sensation is intact throughout; 3+/5 strength in RUE/RLE; [**5-23**] otherwise   Pertinent Results: ADMIT LABS ([**2172-4-19**])  CBC: WBC-7.0# RBC-3.13* HGB-10.8* HCT-30.8* MCV-98 MCH-34.4* MCHC-35.0 RDW-15.0 NEUTS-65.0 LYMPHS-30.4 MONOS-3.7 EOS-0.3 BASOS-0.7  MACROCYT-1+  CHEMISTRIES: GLUCOSE-101 NA+-139 K+-4.2 CL--109 TCO2-21 CREAT-1.3*  CT HEAD ([**2172-4-20**]): 1.
Worsening vasogenic edema and midline shift (subfalcine heriation) secondary to large known GBM.
There is increased sulcal effacement of the suprasellar cistern and ambient cisterns on the left, indicating progressive left uncal herniation with early transtentorial migration.
Hypodensity within the left cerebral peduncle, likely corresponds to signal abnormality noted on MRI from [**2172-3-16**].
MRI BRAIN ([**2172-4-20**]): New left to right subfalcine and left uncal herniation associated with a dramatic increase in peritumoral edema surrounding a left temporal lobe lesion.
The lesion itself is only slightly increased in size.
Slow diffusion in small focal areas in this lesion suggests infarction.
Enhancement and FLAIR signal hyperintensity along the sulci in the left cerebral hemisphere are concerning for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
This finding makes associated radiation necrosis less likely.
If clinically indicated, MR perfusion and Spectroscopy imaging could be performed.
CTX ([**2172-4-20**]): Increase in the right pleural effusion and/or adjacent atelectasis.
Astrocytoma: The CT of his demonstrated increasing midline shift along with increasing edema likely accounting for the majority of his symptoms.
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications.
A repeat CT showed "interval decompression and improvement in the amount of mass effect, midline shift, subfalcine herniation, and effacement of the left suprasellar and ambient cisterns" and the patient remained without headache or nausea/vomiting.
His speach aphasic and his right-sided weakness was stable to mildly improved.
At the time of discharge, the plan was for: - Continued dexamethasone, with taper - Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] on [**5-5**] for chemotherapy - Monitoring of mental status - Metoprolol was started for blood pressure control  2.
Steroid Myopathy: Patient had a history of steroid induced myopathy and had presented with an ongoing steroid taper.
Given the amount of edema seen and the symptoms secondary to this, steroids were increased at the time of admission and were continued; upon discharge, plan was for a steroid taper.
Anaplastic astrocytoma  Secondary: 1.
Deep venous thrombosis   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable; persistent aphasia and right-sided weakness.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with mental status change weakness and underwent a surgery to remove a mass in the left temporal lobe of your brain.
