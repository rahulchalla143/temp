Recurrent large cell lymphoma with progressive disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 74 year old Caucasian gentleman who was initially diagnosed with diffuse large cell lymphoma in [**2129-9-12**], when he presented with fatigue, fevers, sweats and a hematocrit of 25.
A CT scan at that time showed diffuse adenopathy in the chest and abdomen and biopsy revealed large cell lymphoma.
A follow-up scan showed a significant response, although there was a question of residual adenopathy and by [**2130-3-13**], there was definite evidence of progression by CT scan.
Most recently, he has been considered for an anti-CD22 antibody treatment in the last month, however, he was being admitted with a near syncopal episode felt secondary to dehydration.
More recently, he has developed thrombocytopenia which is concerning for progressive disease.
He reported feeling well prior to the visit, however, during the visit, he developed shaking chills and was observed to be unsteady on his feet.
He admits to episodes of shaking chills intermittently over the last several weeks or months, but no definite fevers.
He had some anorexia, but no significant weight loss.
His breathing is comfortable at rest and he denies cough, but admits to some shortness of breath with exertion or walking up stairs.
He denies any chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in his stools or bleeding.
No leg swelling or rashes.
He was admitted to the 4-South [**Hospital1 **] for rule out infection before starting his chemotherapy.
Gastric stromal tumor, status post partial gastrectomy in [**2125**].
Chronic right hip and knee pain due to arthritis.
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
He did not appear to be in any acute respiratory distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck supple; no nodes palpable in the supraclavicular area or in the peripheral area.
Cardiac:  S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops heard.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly noted.
Extremities with no significant edema or asymmetric swelling.
Neurology:  Awake and alert but having some difficulty expressing his thoughts.
Gait unsteady with walking, clinically more towards the right side and he was unsteady with turning.
X-rays showed some bibasilar changes and so the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg once a day and Acyclovir 400 mg three times a day because of a small ulcer found in the left nostril.
CT scan of his sinus was found to be negative and his chest x-ray was also found to be not significant and the patient, at that time, was only kept on Levaquin and for treatment of a possible urinary tract infection because his urinalysis showed some white blood cells and some bacteria.
The patient was doing better throughout the next couple of days, however, on [**6-10**], the patient spiked another fever and he was disoriented.
A CT scan of the head was done to rule out any masses or any intracranial hemorrhage and a lumbar puncture was done which was also found to be not very significant.
The next day, the patient still had rigors and had urinary retention, so a Foley catheter was inserted.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was done without contrast to identify a possible source of abdominal infection secondary to an abscess, however, the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed a splenic hemorrhage or splenic infarction leading to subscapular hemorrhage.
In addition, Surgery was also consulted for management of the patient due to the splenic hemorrhage.
After the patient was transferred back to the Floor, he still remained confused and disoriented and so he was started on Haldol and Ativan to help calm him down.
On [**6-16**], the patient was still confused and we decided to stop his Zosyn in the morning because no significant source of infection was found and also as per recommendation of Infectious Disease, however, that evening he began to rigor and he developed fever and chills, and so the Zosyn was started back on again.
A family discussion was held on [**6-16**], about the status of this patient and that he was uncomfortable and nothing much could be done in terms of his disease and that it has progressed pretty significantly.
Recurrent large cell lymphoma with progressive disease.
Splenic hemorrhage/splenic infarction with subscapular hemorrhage.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was unable to tolerate anything p.o., including his medications and so his family decided that we should try to give him anything in the form of a liquid and in the form of a patch and anything else he needed p.o., they were going to withhold and as a result, the patient was actually sent home on: \ 1.
Augmentin suspension 5 mg per 5 ml, dispensing 120 ml for antibiotic coverage.
Fentanyl patch to help for his pain control.
For breakthrough pain a prescription was given for Roxanol 20 mg per ml, dispensing 30 ml.
