Bone marrow biopsy was nondiagnostic & lymph node biopsy was pending upon discharge.
Physical exam with 2+ LE edema to pelvis with rash over [**Hospital1 **] that has been there for weeks which is attributed to Metformin, [**Hospital1 **] with decreased sensation.
Labs notable for leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and AG = 19.

Massive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy predominantly on the left extending down to the common iliac chain and pelvic side wall.
Findings compatible with known DVT in the left lower extremity and extensive subcutaneous edema in the left proximal thigh.
Several small wedge-shaped hypodensities within the spleen which are of uncertain significance but may represent small infarcts.
CT head w/o Contrast: No acute intracranial abnormality.
LENIs: Occlusive thrombus in the left deep venous system extending to the most superiorly visualized portion of the common femoral vein.
No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Bulky lymphadenopathy abutting greater sciatic foramen and sciatic nerve on the left side without apparent direct infiltration of the nerve.
Imaging characteristics are unusual for lymphoma (diagnosis provided in the history) and if this is the diagnosis then the imaging findings would suggest an aggressive form of lymphoma.
Other possibilities include metastatic disease including melanoma and sarcomatous origin.
PART I:  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY (SLIDE CONSULT RECEIVED FROM [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL, [**Hospital1 **], [**Numeric Identifier 60185**], CONSISTING OF 9 SLIDES ALL LABELED "10-1782" FROM PROCEDURE DATE [**2127-3-24**]) DIAGNOSIS NORMOCELLULAR MARROW FOR AGE WITH TRILINEAGE MATURING HEMATOPOIESIS AND MEGAKARYOCYTIC HYPERPLASIA.
THERE IS NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF LYMPHOMA.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 2.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone.
By outside report, a reticulin stain shows a mild increase in reticulin fibrosis.
Note: Sections are of an enlarged lymph node with complete architectural effacement by a diffuse infiltrate.
The cellular infiltrate consists of sheets of large cells with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, irregular nuclear contour, and vesicular nuclei.
Intermixed with these cells are scattered small lymphocytes and eosinophils.
Occasional mitotic figures are seen, but no necrosis is present.
MIB-1 staining shows a proliferation index of 60%, consistent with a large cell lymphoma.
The above morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are those of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Course c/b DVT, initially on heparin gtt but then discontinued given L thigh hematoma as well as fever and neutropenia.
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Lymph node pathology at OSH with diagnosis of DLBCL, confirmed by pathology here.
Pt had MRI to further eval extension of lymphoma into sacral nerve plexus which showed extensive bulky lymphadenopathy suggesting aggressive lymphoma.
Pt had CT scan which did not show any apparent disease in the chest.
Pt had LP to eval for malignancy within the CNS which was negative for malignant cells.
Pt also had testicular ultrasound to eval for extension of lymphoma into testicle which was reviewed by urology and felt to be unlikely to represent extension into testicle, however, urology felt that ultrasound could be repeated if there is concern in the future about extension into the testicle.
Tumor lysis labs were monitored and were negative except for elevated LDH (pt did recieve allopurinol throughout C1).
LE weakness and left foot drop: Likely [**3-4**] mass effect from tumor burden.
[**Name (NI) **] DVT - Pt noted to have DVT on admission to felt to be secondary to venous stasis from lymphatic obstruction and malignancy.
IVC filter placed due to extensive clot burden and limitations in anticoagulation given hematemesis and thrombocytopenia on admission.
Pt also placed on heparin gtt which was continued until pt developed L thigh hematoma on [**4-18**] at which time heparin was discontinued.
Large L thigh bleed and small R psoas bleed on [**2127-4-18**]: Developed in setting of heparin gtt.
5. fever and neutropenia: pt developed fever and neutropenia after cycle 1 of CHOP.
UTI: on admission pt found to have pan-sensitive enterococcal UTI.
7. subacute lacunar infarct: Pt noted to have subacute lacunar infarct.
Neurology evaluated pt and felt that pt should be on asa if not on heparin or coumadin.
Patient had no further symptoms of abdominal pain or evidence of bleed.
11. anxiety/depression: Per pt and his pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 86476**] was recent med addition in setting of wt loss and ?
Elevated LFTs on admission- most likely from Lymphoma, hepatitis viral loads negative and LFTs trended back to wnl after first cycle of chemotherapy.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: diffuse large b cell lymphoma [**Location (un) **] DVT Left thigh hematoma UTI neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for large b cell lymphoma and a blood clot in your leg.
Unfortuantely you had a bleed into your leg so the blood thinner was stopped.
The lymphoma and blood clot caused weakness in your left leg.
Your hospital course was complicated by a pneumonia and a urinary tract infection for which we treated you with antibiotics.
You tolerated this medication well without any major toxicities.
You can take tramadol 50 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed for pain 4.
