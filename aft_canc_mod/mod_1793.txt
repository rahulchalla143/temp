Left neck mass, excisional biopsy (A-D): Metastatic poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Left neck mass #2, excisional biopsy (E-I): Metastatic poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Note:  The tumor cells are negative for CK-7, CK-20 and TT-1, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year old male with acquired [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23872**] disease in the setting of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia admitted for excisional cervical lymph node biopsy.
1) Excisional lymph node biopsy/Post-op bleeding: The patient underwent excisional biopsy of 2.8 cm left lymph node on [**2191-5-16**].
However, ~ 3 minutes after infusion, bleeding recurred at the incision site.
The [**Last Name (un) 11083**] 7 infusion was stopped [**2191-5-20**] without recurrence of bleeding, and he was transferred to the general medical floor.
2) Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The pathology of the lymph node was consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, unknown primary.
Per ENT, the risk of blind biopsies of the nasopharynx in the setting of acquired [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] deficiency is unacceptably high.
The patient will be discharged to follow-up with oncology as an outpatient  3) Hypertension: Once the patient was transferred to the general medical floor and there was no further evidence of active bleeding, his home anti-hypertensives were resumed.
