Admission Date:  [**2134-9-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-10-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Bactrim Ds  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatic Tail Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy Intraoperative Ultrasound   History of Present Illness: This 48-year-old woman has a history of significant diabetes as well as many of comorbid conditions including Raynaud's, irritable bowel syndrome, peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease and cardiac disease.
It was hypervascular and suggestive of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.
Pertinent Results: CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2134-10-6**] 10:49 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: r/o infiltrate  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with aspiration event 7 days ago, now with fever.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o infiltrate INDICATION: 48-year-old female with aspiration event 7 days ago.
FINDINGS: Heart size cannot be assessed in this examination due to low lung volumes.
The pulmonary vascularity is normal without evidence of CHF.
There is interval marked improvement in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe opacities seen in the prior study.
Interval improvement of right upper lobe and left lower lobe opacities likely due to prior aspirations.
Persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
ART EXT (REST ONLY)  [**2134-10-4**] 11:09 AM  ART EXT (REST ONLY)  Reason: Please perform ABI's/ PVR's/ dopplers and segmental pressure  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman s/p lap distal panc with Hx of DM, Raynauds, toe amp - now with pain and ischemic right 2nd toe REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform ABI's/ PVR's/ dopplers and segmental pressures including the mets and toes ARTERIAL DOPPLER LOWER EXTREMITY  REASON: Painful toes.
Pulse volume recordings show drop off at the ankle level and approximately 6 mm at the metatarsals.
IMPRESSION: Significant bilateral tibial artery occlusive disease, right greater than left.
CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2134-10-4**] 3:30 PM  CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  Reason: dynamic airway CT to eval for malacia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48F s/p aspiration PNA< with ?
tracheomalacia on bronchoscopy REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: dynamic airway CT to eval for malacia CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
The patient had difficulty cooperating with the various components of the examination including end inspiration, dynamic expiration and coughing, somewhat limiting the evaluation.
Images obtained with instructions for end inspiration demonstrate slight extrinsic compression of the proximal trachea from the right brachiocephalic artery near the thoracic inlet level.
The remaining intrathoracic trachea and main bronchi are of normal caliber without intrinsic or extrinsic compression or stenosis.
During dynamic expiratory imaging, there is excessive collapsibility of the trachea and main bronchi which meet criteria for tracheomalacia.
Please note that these measurements may underestimate the degree of malacia due to apparent submaximal inspiratory level.
Within the lungs, there are multifocal patchy areas of consolidation and ground glass attenuation, which are overall improved compared to the recent chest CTA of [**2134-9-30**].
During dynamic expiratory phase of respiration, there is a moderate degree of air trapping with a lobular pattern.
Mediastinal widening due to excessive mediastinal fat is incidentally noted.
There are multiple small calcified lymph nodes as well as numerous subcentimeter mediastinal nodes.
They are likely hyperplastic in the setting of diffuse pulmonary abnormalities.
Calcified hilar nodes are also present.
Small pleural effusions are present in a dependent location.
No suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal lesions are identified within the imaged portions of the skeletal structures.
Tracheobronchomalacia, diffuse in distribution and mild in degree.
However, due to submaximal inspiratory level, the severity of tracheobronchomalacia may be underestimated on this study.
Improving multifocal consolidation and ground glass opacities, as compared to recent CTA [**2134-9-30**].
Considering rapid development between [**9-29**] and [**9-30**], this may represent a massive aspiration event complicated by aspiration pneumonia.
Asymmetrical pulmonary edema is also within the differential diagnosis.
Hyperdynamic LVEF.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
ARDS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ARDS vs infiltrate CHEST PORTABLE  INDICATION: 48-year-old woman with desaturation, evaluate for RDS versus infiltrate.
The heart size is difficult to evaluate due to consolidation in both lungs.
In the right lung, there is increasing consolidation in the middle lobe.
IMPRESSION: Increasing consolidation in the right lung as described above.
Differential diagnosis includes aspiration and multifocal pneumonia.
Asymmetric pulmonary edema is included in the differential diagnosis.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2134-9-30**] 1:28 PM  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  Reason: assess venous flow  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman s/p lap distal panc with Hx of DM, Raynauds, toe amp - now with pain and ischemic toe REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess venous flow HISTORY: 48-year-old female with recent surgery and increasing lower extremity pain and ischemic toe.
Assess venous flow.
No prior comparison exams are available.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2134-9-30**] 11:56 AM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  Reason: eval for pe  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48F pod #1, with desats REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for pe CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CTA OF THE CHEST  CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old woman postop day #1 post-resection of pancreatic tail lesion, with desaturation.
Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
TECHNIQUE: Multiple transaxial images of the chest were obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast, utilizing the pulmonary embolism protocol.
No intraluminal filling defects in the main pulmonary artery or its proximal branches.
Several, prominent and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, some of which are partially calcified, measuring up to 10 mm in the short axis diameter (sequence 4, image #30), adjacent to the left pulmonary artery.
There is extensive, bilateral, dependent airspace disease involving nearly the entirety of both lower lobes and a portion of the right upper lobe.
While this could represent extensive atelectasis, in this patient with recent surgical history, aspiration and associated pneumonia is more likely etiology.
No pleural effusions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, as clinically questioned.
Severe, bilateral airspace disease for which aspiration and associated pneumonia is likely etiology.
US INTR-OP 60 MINS  [**2134-9-29**] 7:36 AM  US INTR-OP 60 MINS  Reason: PANC MASS ,LAPAROSCOPIC DISTAL PANCREATECTOMY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with pancreatic abnormality REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy [**2134-9-29**] 9:30am CLINICAL INDICATION: A small hypervascular tumor of the distal pancreas seen on CT scan, for localization and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.
A 7 x 8 mm hypoechoic nodule was seen in the distal body of the pancreas, corresponding to the lesion identified on CT scan.
This nodule is hypoechoic, solid and homogeneous with increased internal vascularity, consistent with a small islet cell tumor.
The site of the tumor was localized visually and a surgical clip was placed for a reference, during mobilization for distal pancreatectomy.
After resection across the body of the pancreas by the E/A stapler device, and completion of mobilization and freeing up of the distal pancreas, the specimen was rescanned in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] and the nodule was identified within the surgical specimen with generous pancreatic margins on both sides.
CONCLUSION: Eight-mm tumor of the distal body of the pancreas with successful localization and laparoscopic resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as described.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

A CXR on [**10-1**] showed increasing R lung consolidation.
It was suspected that she had a silent aspiration event.
She responded well to Lasix that helped with lung atelectasis.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender and non-distended.
Her small lap incision was C,D,I.
A urine analysis and culture were done for fever on [**2134-10-6**] and showed UTI.
