On Tuesday given concerns about a possible infection due to declining blood pressures, penile irritation and leukopenia his decadron was decreased from 4 mg to 2 mg po qd 2 days prior to presentation.
In preparation for his PET scan he ate fatty foods and subsequently developed diarrhea [**12-19**] loose bms.
He did not have nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
He usually drains 1-2L of fluid from his abdominal pleurex catheter daily but it has decreased to 1L per day.
He does have a stage II decubitis which has become more irritated in light of the diarrhea.
He has not had any fevers, chills or cough.
He is currently being evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for treatment of his portal hypertension.
He is s/p liver bx with hepatic venous pressure gradient also performed.

LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2138-1-9**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2138-1-6**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
MODERATE GROWTH.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2138-1-11**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
No new FDG-avid disease identified.
Bilateral perinephric and left periureteral soft tissue lesions are not well assessed on the present study and were fully described on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2137-11-15**].
Increased moderate ascites.
Decreased small bilateral non-FDG-avid pleural effusions.
Slightly increased small pericardial effusion.
Unchanged mild left hydronephrosis.
Relatively increased FDG-uptake in the T2-T11 vertebral bodies could be due to either recent radiation to this aspect of the spine, or prior radiation to the remainder of the spine.
Echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease.
Multiple stones in left kidney with hydronephrosis which has worsened since the prior MRI in [**2137-11-5**].
No definite obstructing stone seen.
This examination is limited somewhat by lack of administration of contrast; however, there is interval increase in size of the perinephric deposits surrounding the left kidney in particular suggestive of disease progression.
The overall moderate hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter in the left kidney is grossly unchanged when compared to prior imaging.
Moderate volume intra-abdominal ascites also noted.
No calculi identified in the ureter.
[**2137-12-25**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process to explain patient's altered mental status.
[**2138-1-1**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume overload.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-11-21**], there is interventricular septal flattening consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The pericardial effusion is slightly smaller.
[**2138-1-1**] Portable CXR: IMPRESSION: Right basal opacity could reflect aspiration or pneumonia.
Since [**2138-1-2**] right upper pneumonia has worsened and moderate to large right pleural effusion persists.
Left lung is clear, no effusion.
Large volume ascites.
Right pleural effusion.
[**2138-1-7**] Echo: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2138-1-8**]  abdominal US w doppler: Kidneys are extremely echogenic and there is reduced corticomedullary differentiation suggesting significant impairment.
Mild fullness of the proximal ureters are seen, but there is no good evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is likely a left-sided nephrostomy.
There is a lower pole 9 mm right-sided non obstructing calculus.
Extremely echogenic kidneys.
[**2138-1-8**] RUQ US: CONCLUSION: Findings suggestive mid TIPS stenosis and narrowing, although the TIPS remains patent.
Large volume ascites.
[**2137-1-11**] CXR: Multifocal consolidations appear unchanged on the right and slightly worse on the left.
There is potentially slight interval decrease in right pleural effusion, although it might reflect semi-upright position of the patient as opposite to supine with layering of pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M with h/o MM/plasma cell leukemia which was progressive despite therapy c/b portal HTN of unknown etiology admitted originally with diarrhea and acute renal failure with prolonged hospital course complicated by significant RP plasmacytomas, TIPS procedure which subsequently stenosed, obstructing left ureteral stone s/p nephrostomy, respiratory failure requiring intubation/ventilation, enterobacter/enterococcus septic shock requiring levophed/vasopressin and renal failure requiring CVVH.
Please see below for a short summaries of the main problems of his course.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Septic shock with multi-organ failure: He was intubated on [**1-2**] in setting of likely aspiration event and respiratory decompensation and started on pressors for refractory hypotension.
Required vasopressin and levophed to maintain pressures, eventually at max-doses with continued refractory hypotension resulting in worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, and liver failure.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated [**1-2**] for acute respiratory failure following likely aspiration event.
Sputum had GNRs and yeast at the time of enterobacter bacteremia, however then consistently grew [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.
In the final days before he died, he had increasing requirements on the ventillator to maintain his sats, and chest xrays showed new infiltrates that were likely due to ongoing aspiration events.
# Renal failure:  found to be in acute renal failure, with creatinine continuing to trend up.
He has a known history of L hydronephrosis, and given his worsening liver failure, there was also concern for hepato-renal syndrome.
The patient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide initially for hepatorenal syndrome while in the ICU, with doses being titrated up because of no improvement in his renal funciton.
His BUN/creat ultimately kept climbing, and because of his worsening mental status, he ultimately was started on HD.
Pt then developed sepsis (see above) and was unable to tolerate HD, so he was transitioned to CVVH on [**1-3**].
Given his septic shock, at that point it was thought that there was really no chance of renal recovery, but CVVH was continued per request of the family after discussion of goals of care.
# Portal hypertension, liver failure: Known to have portal hypertension, thought to be secondary to nodular regenerative hyperplasia, unclear etiology.
Possibly due to his underlying hematologic malignancy.
The patient was s/p TIPS on admission to the MICU, and on ultrasound to evaluate TIPS patency, there was some initial evidence of stenosis.
His liver enzymes began to rise slightly as septic shock set in, and his labs showed evidence of liver failure with decreased synthetic function (namely, an elevated INR).
# MM AND PLASMA CELL LYMPHOMA: Pt with refractory disease despite bone marrow transplant and numerous aggressive therapies.
BMT continued to follow the patient throughout hospitalization, but unfortunately treatment options for his myeloma were exhausted.
