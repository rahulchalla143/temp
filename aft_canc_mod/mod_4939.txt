He was apparently able to walk to the ambulance of his own volition, but became obtunded, tachycardic and hypoxic en route to the hospital.
Head CT was done, which revealed a significantly sized right fronto-parietal mass, and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive neurosurgical care.
He reports since that time, he has had subtle personality changes.
Within the last six months, had become progressively socially recluse, to the point of neglecting self care.
Lungs: bibasilar coarse crackles Cardiac: RRR no M/G/R Abd: Soft, NT, BS+ Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhagic transformation.
Persistent hypodensity in the right frontal and temporal lobes, unchanged.
Perfusion study demonstrates decreased cerebral blood volume in the right MCA territory with increased MTT, consistent with prior right MCA infarct.
His CT scan revealed a 7.5 x 5.3 cm mass in the right middle and anterior cranial fossa with midline shift and uncal and subfalcine herniation.
The procedure was technically difficult due to the large size of the mass and the proximity of the MCA.
However, the tumor was able to be decompressed well with no complications.
It revealed expected post-operative fluid within the resection cavity, decompression, and decreased midline shift.
Additionally a psych consult was obtained to determine if the patient was competent to make his own decisions and to give his brother permission to assist him with his affairs.
On [**11-27**] the patient was noted to be more obtunded and then began to have respiratory distress he was immediately transferred to ICU.
He was found to have a hypercarbic acidosis.
Further imaging showed a RLL consolidation and a right mca hypodensity.
Perfusion studies were performed for hypodensity on CT.
This showed decreased cerebral blood volume in the right MCA territory with increased MTT, consistent with prior right MCA infarct.
He was without neurologic deline but he continued to have cognitive impairment.
A blood gas was obtained and he was found to be hypercarbic acidosis.
After further titration of his non-invasive support, his acidosis was corrected, and mental status improved.
