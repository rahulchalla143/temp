HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37 year old white female with a long history of pulmonary issues, well known at [**Hospital1 69**] and to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**], now here for weaning of her ventilator.
She was admitted to [**Hospital3 33538**] on [**2131-4-17**] from [**Hospital1 188**] status post a Medical Intensive Care Unit admission for pneumonia.
Her weaning was complicated by her anxiety and tachypnea with this anxiety.
Her EKG showed no changes.
Renally, she has a chronic hyponatremia.
GI: She had constipation with many laxatives prescribed.
Hematologic:  She had a persistent leukocytosis with a normal B12 and folate.
Psychiatric:  She had anxiety and depression on Olanzapine; the patient did confirm this history.
She did not complain of any SI, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough or headache on admission.
She did complain of increased fatigue.
She also complained of night sweats times two days and mild stomach pains since she was started on her tube feeds prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 190**].
Biventricular congestive heart failure with cor pulmonale for her right heart failure and a question of tachycardia induced left heart failure.
History of a Pseudomonas pneumonia in the Spring.
Status post left pneumectomy secondary to Aspergillosis of her left lung.
Tuberculosis in [**2121**].
History of anxiety and depression.
History of syncope in [**2131-2-16**], that was questionable vasovagal.
History of supraventricular tachycardia in the 150s when she is hyperkalemic and junctional bradycardia in the 50s when she is hypokalemic.
Hyponatremia secondary to congestive heart failure and diuresis.
Unknown what her reaction to sulfa and oxacillin was.
She was in no acute distress.
She had rhonchi and coarse rales in the right lower lung field.
Left lung fields had transmitted breath sounds status post pneumonectomy.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
She had T wave inversions in V1, V2, half mm ST depression in V2 through V4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 37 year old woman with multiple pulmonary problems including a history of a left pneumonectomy, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%; chronic hypercapnia, who was admitted for a wean from her ventilator.
PULMONARY:  [**Known firstname 1356**] had a long history of severe lung disease.
She had a history of Hodgkin's disease status post CHOP and x-ray therapy which was complicated by Histoplasmosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, status post left pneumectomy for Aspergillus and had a recent admission this past Spring for a pneumonia.
She had failed to wean from this with barriers that were thought to be her volume status secondary to her cardiomyopathy.
She needs to have a permissive hypercapnia for her to be able to ventilate sufficiently.
She has shown no signs of clinical effects from hypercapnia.
[**Known firstname 1356**] had a tracheostomy revision on [**2131-7-2**], and was found to have a posterior tracheal ulcer that was very early a TE fistula.
A recent bronchoscopy has shown that her ulcer has healed.
CARDIAC:  [**Known firstname 1356**] has a history of biventricular congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy which brings her ejection fraction to 20%.
Her left heart failure is thought secondary to tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy and her right heart failure is thought secondary to cor pulmonale.
[**Known firstname 30613**] resting pulse rate ranges from 100 to 120 in sinus tachycardia and any decrease from or increase from this resting heart rate sends her into respiratory distress and decompensation.
She is very volume sensitive and given that component of her congestive heart failure, was causing her failure to wean from the ventilator.
She remained at her baseline weight of 119 to 120 pounds on this diuresis regimen and had no episodes of respiratory distress.
With hyperkalemia she develops junctional bradycardic rhythms in the 60s which put her into respiratory distress and decompensation.
Her junctional bradycardia was quickly resolved with calcium gluconate, insulin, glucose, bicarbonate, nebulizers and Kayexalate.
With potassiums less than 3.0, [**Known firstname 1356**] can go into supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation to the 170s and 180s.
This also causes respiratory distress and decompensation.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As stated above, the patient has a volatile potassium level.
With constipation, she develops a hyperkalemia from inability to excrete her potassium through her GI tract.
[**Known firstname 1356**] has a baseline metabolic alkalosis with bicarbs of 40 to 50 to compensate for her severely impaired and decreased ventilation.
She had been on Percocet for her pain that she had been experienced at her tracheostomy site.
These had exacerbated her constipation, which resulted in potasium levels up to 7.9 and junctional bradycardic rhythm that sent her into respiratory distress.
Her pain is relieved with Tramadol, ibuprofen and Tylenol.
It is thought that she uses narcotics occasionally as a crutch and not for her analgesic effects.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted on inhaled Tobramycin for Pseudomonas prophylaxis.
She has a chronic leukocytosis from 12 to 20, but no signs of infection.
Otherwise, she has no current Infectious Disease issues.
PSYCHIATRY:   [**Known firstname 1356**] has a history of anxiety attacks, which complicate her respiratory failure.
It was thought that the anxiety is a large component of her respiratory failure.
for acute anxiety and should receive this preferentially over p.r.n.
When she is deemed ready for discharge home, she will be discharged home on her home ventilator with blow-by tracheostomy, oxygen in the days and question of pressure support at night if she cannot be weaned from her pressure support during this hospitalization.
