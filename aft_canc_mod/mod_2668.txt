Admission Date:  [**2151-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-7-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-4-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, dizziness, poor PO intake  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is a 77 year old Portuguese speaking male with PMH of tobacco use, IPMN s/p Whipple procedure in [**10-10**], and recently diagnosed NSCLC in [**4-16**] after a biopsy of a RUL cavitary lesion currently receiving palliative XRT and palliative chemotherapy with Taxol/carboplatin also with known brain mets to the right temporal and left frontal lobe s/p Cyberknife with current dexamethasone taper presenting with weakness, poor PO intake, and dizziness.
The patient also reports increased bowel movement frequency with up to 6 loose stools daily.
He was triggered for hypotension associated with low grade tachycardia which normalized after 3L of IVFs.
An EKG on admission showed ST elevations in V2 and V3 with right bundle branch block at a rate of 115.
The patient did not report any chest pain and cardiology felt that these were rate related changes as there were no reciprocal changes.
A repeat EKG once the rate normalized reportedly showed a classic Brugada pattern in V1/V2.
A CXR did not show any acute process and his known lung cancer appeared stable in size.
A CTA to rule out PE given his initial tachycardia and known malignancy history was negative.
The patient also received 1 gram of vanco and 2 grams of cefepime for concern of infection in the setting of neutropenia with low grade temperature to 99.3 and initial tachycardia with hypotension.
Hydrocortisone 100mg was also admission given concern for adrenal insufficiency in the setting of his steroid taper.
On the floor, the patient tells me that his symptoms have been ongoing over the last couple of weeks since beginning his chemotherapy.
Specifically, the patient has been weak, intermittently dizzy, nauseous, poor PO intake, cold with no chills, and has had diarrhea with occasional BRBPR noted on the toilet paper when he wipes.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied vomiting, constipation or abdominal pain.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2 with ST-T wave configuration in those leads raising the consideration of possible ischemia or possible Brugada pattern.
Since the previous tracing of [**2151-6-28**] no significant change.
CHEST [**2151-6-28**] FINDINGS: Evidence of a thin-walled cavity is seen in the right upper lobe, measuring grossly 3.1 x 3.5 cm.
Bilateral pleural plaques and pleural-based nodularity suggest prior asbestos exposure, particularly those which are calcified.
No definite focal consolidation is seen.
While the costophrenic angles are not fully included, no large pleural effusion is seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
Evidence of large thin-walled cavity in the right upper lobe as seen on prior studies, although now appears thin-walled as compared to prior where it was thick-walled, likely due to evolution of the cavity.
Bilateral pleural-based nodularity, some of which is calcified as seen on prior CT, suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
Please note right upper lobe spiculated nodule and previously noted mediastinal and hilar nodularity/FDG-avid lymphadenopathy are better assessed on CT. .
CHEST CTA [**2151-6-28**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence for pulmonary embolism.
Cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe is again seen with increased size of cavity and thinner wall and decreased surrounding hemorrhage.
A right perihilar spiculated mass is again seen.
Extensive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy is seen.
Numerous bilateral pleural based nodules are again seen, some with calcification, suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
Centrilobular and paraseptal pulmonary emphysema is seen.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures, but images of the very upper abdomen show arterial calcifications and are otherwise unremarkable.
There is a focus of sclerosis in the right medial clavicle with intact cortex, overall unchanged since [**2151-4-21**], and non-aggresive in appearance.
No evidence for PE.
Right upper lobe cavitary lesion increased in size, but thinner-walled.
Right perihilar mass and extensive mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Areas of bilateral pleural thickening/nodularity again seen, some of which calcified suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77 year old Portuguese speaking male with PMH of tobacco use, IPMN s/p Whipple procedure in [**10-10**], and recently diagnosed NSCLC in [**4-16**] after a biopsy of a RUL cavitary lesion currently receiving palliative XRT and palliative chemotherapy with Taxol/carboplatin also with known brain mets to the right temporal and left frontal lobe s/p Cyberknife with current dexamethasone taper presenting with weakness, poor PO intake, and dizziness most likely related to hypovolemia.
# Hypotension- The patient was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive on admission likely related to hypovolemia from poor PO intake and diarrhea related to recent chemotherapy.
His tachycardia and hypotension improved after 3L of IVFs in the ED before transfer to the ICU.
However, given neutropenia and low grade temperature, infection was possible and broad spectrum antibiotics were administered in the emergency room with vanc and cefepime.
Antibiotics were continued in the ICU but eventually d/c'd after transfer to the floor prior to discharge as he remained afebrile and was no longer neutropenic.
Of note, his blood culture from the ED grew out coronybacterium in [**2-9**] bottles which was felt to be a contaminant.
There initally was also concern for adrenal insufficency in the given his current steroid taper, however an AM cortisol was done and normal.
Pt was continued on home dexamethasone taper given low likelihood for adrenal insufficiency which he will continue as an outpatient.
# Neutropenia- Secondary to recent chemo.
Was neutropenic on admission but ANC on discharge was 3026 after receiving neupogen [**6-30**].
# Hyponatremia- Sodium of 127 on admission likely related to hypovolemia in setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake, although there may be a component of SIADH given underlying NSCLC.
His urine lytes show elevated chloride and sodium which would point to SIADH, but this was also done after fluid resusictation so may not be accurate.
He was hydrated as above for his hypovolemia.
# Metastatic NSCLC- Patient was recently diagnosed NSCLC with known mets to his brain.
He is also s/p CyberKnife for his brain mets and currently on a dexamethasone taper.
EKG changes- EKG on admission showed initial concern for Brugada syndrome given pseudo-RBBB pattern with ST elevations.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have been secondary to his chemo as well.
# Follow-up/Transitional: -Pt to follow up with primary oncologist on [**7-8**] -Na+ and Hct should be followed as an outpatient given hyponatremia and anemia in-house -EKG changes should be followed as an outpatient -Lisinopril was held in-house and on discharge given hypotension.
8. triamcinolone acetonide  Injection 9. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 58083**],  You were admitted to the hospital for low blood pressure.
We believe this was due to your recent diarrhea and poor appetite.
