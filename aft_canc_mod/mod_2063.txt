Admission Date: [**2111-5-4**]        Discharge Date: [**2111-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-7-21**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  A 42-year old female with right breast cancer proven by core biopsy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42-year-old woman who was found to have a right breast abnormality on a core breast biopsy on [**2111-3-17**] following an abnormal mammogram.
Pathologic review of that specimen showed it to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma with grade III necrosis.
Tumor cells were noted to be negative for estrogen and progesterone and were positive for Herceptin overexpression.
The patient does have a prior history of right breast cancer in [**2107**], at which time a 1-cm mass was removed.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a left ATL repair.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON PRESENTATION:  The patient was described as a healthy-appearing Caucasian female in no acute distress.
This was followed by a plastic surgery breast reconstruction with a SIEA technique.
Throughout this period the flap appeared healthy with both normal capillary refill and dopplerable arterial and venous signals.
The following day, after a final evaluation of her flap by the plastic surgery team, it was felt that there had been a shift in the Doppler signal from her flap pedicle.
Given this change in her exam it was felt necessary to hold her overnight for an additional night of observation.
The following morning the flap was once again noted to be pink and healthy appearing with good capillary refill and no signs of any venous congestion or necrosis.
