Patient and his wife report for the past two weeks the patient has had episodes of staring into space, forgetfulness, confusion and disorientation.
There the patient was noted to have 17mm right frontal mass and right perihilar mass on CT head and chest.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Prostate cancer in [**2120**] treated with resection and radiation Benign parotid tumor resected in [**2115**] Bladder diverticula requiring resection Aspirin allergy, nasal polyps--?Samter's triad.
Inguinal hernia   Social History: Heavy smoking until quit in [**2097**], occasional alcohol, no drug use.
Family History: Both parents with lung cancer, father with brain tumor as well.
Physical Exam: general: pleasant, comfortable, NAD HEENT: PERLLA, EOMI, anicteric, no sinus tenderness, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules lungs: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, harsh 3/6 systolic murmur abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly extremities: no edema skin/nails: no rashes neuro: AAOx3.
[**2122-5-1**] Portable AP Right lower lobe/parahilar mass or consolidation with satellite nodules, is better evaluated on concurrent CT. No pneumothorax, post-biopsy.
Right hilar opacity demonstrating calcification and adjacent bronchiectasis and satellite nodules, most suggestive of an infectious process, of which tuberculosis is of concern.
Left adrenal adenoma.
BONE SCAN [**2122-5-1**] No evidence of osseous metastases.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 12:14 AM Large, partially cystic and solid right frontal lobe mass.
In a patient of this age, either a primary brain tumor, likely a glioma or a solitary metastatic deposit, the latter a much less likely diagnostic consideration, could be present.
73 y/o with remote prostate cancer and new right lung mass.
[**2122-5-4**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-6**] 8:07 PM Post right frontal mass resection and frontal craniotomy, with postoperative changes and small amount of hemorrhage, persistent vasogenic edema and shift of normally midline structures.
Again seen is a 4-cm cystic and solid mass centered within the right frontal parasagittal region, with marked compression of the corpus callosum and contiguous lateral ventricles.
There is a sickle shaped area of fluid attenuation within the left sublenticular region, which is unchanged and may represent a chronic small vessel infarction or unusually configured sublenticular cyst.
There is mucosal thickening of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and slight mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses, inflamamtory in origin.
Limited study for preoperative planning.
Large cystic and solid right frontal mass with prominent surrounding edema and compression of the genu of the corpus callosum and adjacent lateral ventricles.
[**5-6**] brain biopsy: #1, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear): METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, consistent with metastasis from lung primary.
#2, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR RESECTION: METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, consistent with metastasis from lung primary.
[**5-8**] cxr: IMPRESSION: Increasing size of right perihilar mass and associated right lower lobe consolidation.
There is also a new left pleural effusion.
There has been a right frontal craniotomy.
There is no new large intracranial hemorrhage.
Small amounts of blood layering posteriorly within the occipital horns of lateral ventricles appears similar to slightly decreased compared to [**5-8**].
There is slightly leftward shift of the normally midline structures anteriorly, possibly in part related to slightly decreased pneumocephalus.
A large area of vasogenic edema involving the right frontal lobe appears similar as well.
There is partial opacification of the ethmoid sinuses, and a rounded hyperdense structure containing air within the left side of the frontal sinus appears similar.
There is slightly more air within this structure today.
No new large intracranial hemorrhage.
Small amounts of intraventricular blood are similar to slightly decreased compared to [**5-8**].
Brief Hospital Course: 73yo male with R frontal brain mass and R perihilar mass.
#Brain mass - 17 mm right frontal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and midline shift.
Pt had been having short episodes of confusion lasting minutes with resolution, likely related to small seizures, pt started on kepra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] day two of admission.
The patient began to improve and have less confusion and weakness, and did well with the continuation of keppra for seizure prophylaxis and steroids for decreasing edema.
The brain biopsy pathology revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, presumptively from the lung (+adenoCa on bronchial washings as well), and he has follow-up with neuro-oncology and will at that time decide on a definitive treatment plan.
#Right perihilar mass - Initial differential diagnoses included metastasis vs infection vs primary cancer.
He had a bronchoscopy and initial bronchial washings showed 0 PMNS and 0 microorganisms.
His bronchial brushings returned positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
# Pneumonia: During the patient's course he developed RLL crackles on exam, cough and a CXR with interval increase in RLL opacity.
He was afebrile at discharge and will complete his course of antibiotics.
# Left foot swelling/DVT: The patient was noted to have asymmetric swelling of his left foot and on US was noted to have and occlusive thrombus from the popliteal vein to the mid superficial femoral vein on the left.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurosurgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] from oncology advised starting heparin without a bolus and having a low PTT goal.
# Atrial fibrillation.
The patient has a history of afib controlled prior to admission with digoxin and verapamil.
Decisions regarding long term anticoagulation for PAF should be addressed after treatment of DVT is complete based on risk/benefit ratio at that point, as well as chronicity of Afib.
# Hypertension.
# Hyperglycemia.
Thus his current hyperglycemia likely reflects the effect of steroids on top of his baseline insulin resistance.
# BPH: The patient has a history of BPH and was continued on doxazosin.
# Left adrenal adenomatous mass on abd CT: On abdominal CT the patient was noted to have a 2x2 cm mass, benign in appearance.
# diarrhea: The patient likely developed diarrhea from his antibiotics.
Right frontal brain mass possible adenocarcinoma 2.
Perihilar lung mass possible adenocarcinoma 3.
Pneumonia 4.
Left lower extremity DVT 5.
Atrial fibrillation 6.
Steroid induced hyperglycemia 7.
Left adrenal mass 8.
You have a lung and brain mass that will be further investigated and explained at the brain tumor clinic.
You are at increased risk for bleeding and should notify your doctor of falls or new bleeding.
Call your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5162**], chills, vomiting, headache, worsened mental status, bleeding, falls, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain and any worrisome signs.
