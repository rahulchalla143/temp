Pt seen on [**4-28**] complaining of increasing dry cough and shortness of breath despite a 12 day course of azithromycin.
It was felt that her cough was possibly due to her chronic GVHD so her prednisone was increased from 20 to 30mg.
She denied any fever or chills, SOB at rest, chest pain, tightness, PND, orthopnea or LE edema.
Shortness of breath has been very slowly progressing over the past 2-3 months but much worse over the past week.
She also had a chest CT on [**4-28**] which showed left lower lobe infiltrate.
Her dyspnea on exertion continued over the week and after being seen in clinic today with tachypnea decision was made for admission for further workup.
Initially diagnosed secondary to whooshing sound and    ear pain with white count of 3.68 with 28% blasts, crit of    25 and 18,000 platelets.
Received    7+3 induction, prolonged hospital course with neutropenia,    fever neutropenia with Imipenem, Vancomycin, Ambazone with    negative culture workup.
Also received HIDAC consolidation - s/p Allo BMT for AML (brother was donor) [**4-16**] with ongoing graft versus host disease involving her eyes and mouth.

Family History: 2 Aunts with breast cancer, father 76 with hx of CAD, mohter age 71 with DM and CAD, uncle with [**Name (NI) 1932**]  Brief Hospital Course: Shortness of breath-Infiltrate on chest CT was thought to represent CAP although pt at risk for PCP and fungal PNA with chronic immunosuppression.
It was less likely viral in origin with focal infiltrate.
Chest tube was placed by CT [**Doctor First Name **] but she cont to have an air leak so Heimlich valve was placed on [**5-11**].
SOB was not acute in nature and no effusion seen on chest CT so CHF and PE were unlikely although we obtained TTE which was normal.
We initially started her on levofloxacin to cover CAP and added vancomycin when GPC seen on BAL but these were stopped on [**5-9**] since she was never febrile and CXR's showed no infiltrate.
There was thought to be a component of GVHD to her SOB with possible bronchiolitis obliterans but we tapered her prednisone to 15mg [**Hospital1 **].
There also appeared to be some airway inflammatory component with wheezing so we cont on outpt inhalers with addition of nebs.
We treated her cough symptomatically with robitussin with codeine and humified air.
GVHD-Pt eye symptoms appeared worse per her report, although unilateral nature suggested acute injury.
HTN-Pt was hypertensive on admission so we changed carvedilol to procardia XL with good response.
Pt then became tachycardic of unclear etiology although she is mildly hypoxic with known lung disease and pain associated with chest tube.
ECG revealed sinus tach with TSH normal and will consider CTA as part of tachycardia workup.
Aniety-Cont on outpt celexa and ativan prn .
HSV-Pt has no oral lesions at this time but will cont famvir for px .
