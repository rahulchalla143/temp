Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 62482**] for hepatic encephalopathy which improved with lactulose and rifaximin.
Since discharge, he was noted to have some leg wounds which were biopsied by Derm on [**11-20**] and found to be fungal infections; no treatment has yet been started.

Course complicated by Portal Vein Thrombosis, Cholelithiasis with likely choledocholithiasis, transudative pulmonary effusion s/p tap, concern for DIC physiology (though thought unlikely given lab derrangements in context of cirrhosis), as well as hypercalcemia.
Other potential causes: MS changes [**12-25**] fungemia given reported fungal derm infection, bleed (but no recent trauma), mass effect or lyphomatous spread to the meninges, drugs (denies drug use).
Low suspicion for meningitis or infection with white count at 5.4, afebrile.
There are case reports of neoplastic syndromes secondary to CNS lymphoma (including in this hospital), but these are diagnosed by brain biopsy and exclusion.
Hepatic encephalopathy worsened until patient's ultimate demise.
Of note, CT Abd reveals 8MM stone noted in CBD and ductual dilitation, but no improvement s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**11-30**].
In addition, CT abd reveals no evidence of flow through portal vein in contrast to [**7-31**] study at which time flow was still visualized.
Lacutlose and Rifaximin given good results with these medication on last admission with same presentation.
Effusion: Patient's original R sided effusion tapped on [**11-25**].
Labs not consistent with empyema.
CT Chest s/p tap on [**11-28**] shows moderate Right pulmoary effusion with underlying consolidation/collapse of RLL (4mm nodule is unchaged from before and requires follow-up as outpatient).
Fluid analysis transudative, non-infectious thus far.
No apparent underlying organizing process on CT, but moderate right pleural effusion with underlying consolidation/collapse of the right lower lobe noted immediately after tap.
#Fungal infection:  Histopath showed hyphal elements in the inflammatory component and deeper skin structures.
# FEN: low sodium diet.
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen .
