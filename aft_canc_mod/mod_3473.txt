# Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patient's CT scan on presentation was concerning for omental "caking" and metastatic cancer.
Omentum core biopsy was taken and showed hepatocellular carcinoma.
Oncology was consulted and initially recommended workup for hemochromatosis and viral hepatitis.
Oncology considers future treatment with sorafenib, however given GI bleeding may not be a good candidate for this therapy.
Patient did not accept news well and became depressed and withdrawn.
# Moderate Malnutrition / Failure to thrive Patient had poor appetite given abdominal pain and likely secondary effects of cancer.
IV therapy was continued into rehabilitation to provide IVFs for maintainance.
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastrointestinal Bleeding Patient was admitted to the MICU and stabilized.
*ischemia: aspirin and plavix were held given massive GI bleeding.
Patient did experience lower leg edema.
# Acute Renal Failure on CKD III Unknown baseline, however clearly with some element of chronic kidney dysfunction.
# Type 2 DM Controlled Sugars have been stable without need for insulin.
Likely due to impaired liver function.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Hepatocellular carcinoma 2.
Gastrointestinal bleeding Minor: 1.
CAD 2.
CKD, baseline ~ 2.0   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you were experiencing dark stools, vomiting blood, and had a low hematocrit.
You were also diagnosed with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
You had a biopsy of your omentum (fat on stomach), and several paracenteses (fluid withdrawal from abdomen).
