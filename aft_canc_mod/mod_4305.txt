Admission Date:  [**2119-8-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-3-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: lung cancer obstructing right mainstem bronchus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Rigid bronchoscopy.
Mycoplasma coagulation.
Four weeks prior to admission the patient complained of productive cough and dyspnea on exertion.
The patient was thought to have bronchitis, and was treated with Azithromycin with no improvement.
Subsequent CXR showed RML consolidation and was concerning for pneumonia.
After 8 days of Moxifloxacin, patient was still dyspneic, and complained of night sweats, worsening cough, and fever.
He presented to the ED, and CT chest on [**8-30**] showed a large hilar mass 4.2cm x 6cm invading and partially occluding R mainstem bronchus and tracheal carina, with metastases to the trachea.
CXR on [**8-31**] showed a small right apical pneumothorax, at most 10%, and complete occlusion of right mainstem bronchus since [**8-30**].
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of IP procedure to relieve airway obstruction and debulking.

CXR PA and lateral [**2119-9-1**]: The current study demonstrates right mediastinal shift in combination with abrupt termination of the right main bronchus as well as irregularity in tracheal column.
In addition, there is a small right pneumothorax.
Findings are consistent with known history of extensive right lung cancer with right main stem obstruction and subsequent complete collapse of the right lung.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Large right hilar mass encasing right main and upper lobe bronchi in addition to bronchus intermedius.
There is pretrachial adenopathy and a subcarinal mass which may represent contiguous tumor or adenopathy.
The assessment of the local extent of the mass is somewhat limited by extent of adjacent pulmonary opacity and volume loss.
A small residual anterior pneumothorax is noted.
Opacification with air bronchograms in the right lower lobe, which may represent infection, hemorrhage, or atelectasis.
No prevascular, left mediastinal or left hilar nodes are identified.
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
A small lipoma is present within the right frontal scalp and a small fat deposit/hemangioma in the right side of the anterior arch of atlas.
Bone scan [**2119-9-3**]: Focus of increased uptake in the right manubrium, concerning for isolated metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo M with new diagnosis of NSCLC and large R hilar mass compressing mainstem bronchus, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for endobronchial debridement of the obstructing mass.
The debridement was complicated by perforation of the bronchus intermedius and pneumothorax, requiring a chest tube.
# Non small-cell lung cancer: The patient was diagnosed at an outside hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ridid bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement of the tumor, which was obstructing the right mainstem bronchus.
The debridement was complicated by perforation of the bronchus intermedius and pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube.
Given this complication and the fragile nature of the patient's airways, the interventional pulmology team felt that the patient was not currently a candidate for chemoradiation.
A bone scan and head MRI were done for staging purposes and were notable for a focus of increased uptake in the right manubrium, concerning for metastasis.
The procedure was complicated by airway perforation and PTX.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient was treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with clindamycin and levofloxacin.
# Coffee ground nasogastric tube output: While in the ICU, the patient had some bloody/coffee ground aspirates from his NG tube.
There was no further evidence of bleeding.
# Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive peri-intubation.
This was thorugh to be due to sedation.
# Normocytic anemia: Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient had some coffee ground nasogastric output in the ICU, but this quickly resolved and did not result in hemodynamic instability or a significant hematocrit drop.
# Depression: Continued paroxetine.
# Insomnia: Continued trazodone.
# Thrush: The patient was noted to have oral thrush and was started on Nystatin.
# Communication: Healthcare proxy is patient's brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87249**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87250**].
# Pending labs at time of discharge: There is a pending blood culture from [**2119-9-2**].
All other culture has shown no growth.
Please evaluate for pulse dose for portability.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

While you were in the intensive care unit, you had some bloody output from a tube that was in your stomach.
You had no further bleeding and your blood counts remained stable.
During your hospitalization, you had an MRI of your head and a bone scan in order to look for metastatic disease.
The MRI was negative, but the bone scan showed an area of increased uptake in the right side of your breast bone.
START pantoprazole to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers and GI bleeding START albuterol and ipratropium inhalers as needed for shortness of breath.
This is a sedating medication, and you should not drive or participate in other hazardous activities while on oxycodone.
START nystatin swish and swallow for yeast infection in mouth You have been given presciptions for a stool softener called Colace and laxatives called senna and Miralax.
You can use these as needed for constipation, which tends to happen with oxycodone.
