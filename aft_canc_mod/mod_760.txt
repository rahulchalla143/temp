She had a week of SOB PTA but on [**6-16**] had acute onset of SOB when at home, with fever, without cough, and no abd pain, no dysuria.
Oncologic course has been complicated by b/l hydronephrosis thought to be [**3-8**] malignancy, as well as utereral obstructions requiring right nephrostomy tube.
CTA was deferred due to elevated Cr.
Non-con belly scan was ordered and bedside u/s showed normal fast, no pericardial effusion, no right heart strain, mild left hydronephrosis, normal right kidney.
She had an elevated pro-BNP but normal trop, and no right axis deviation on ECG or on u/s: was not a candidate for TPA.
On arrival to the MICU, she does not c/o any pain, but is still feeling SOB, better when supine as opposed to sitting up.
She denies CP, HA, abdom pain, pain upon deep inspiration, pain in calves/thighs.
Adds that on day of admission, she felt more SOB fairly abruptly while sitting outside; at baseline, has no h/o heart problems or SOB when walking.

IMAGING: [**2181-6-16**] CXR:IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
New stranding around the left kidney is noted which may represent new inflammation versus forniceal rupture.
Urothelial thickening is noted on the right, with increase in renal pelvis dilation but no gross hydronephrosis.

She p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of one week of dyspnea and fatigue, which was initially concerning for PE.
Further w/u ended up ruling out PE, and her SOB was likely in the context of her fever and GNR bacteremia, which were likely [**3-8**] urinary source.
# Dyspnea: Pt p/w acute onset SOB, and was found to be in sinus tach with elevated d-dimer and BNP in setting of malignancy, although bedside u/s showed no e/o R heart strain.
She did not undergo CTA due to elevated Cr, but was started on a heparin gtt in the ED.
Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had no Si/Sx of hemodynamic or respiratory collapse.
ACS, PNA or pulmonary edema were r/o.
A VQ scan was subsequently performed, and it was low probability for PE and the heparin was d/c'd.
Her dyspnea was most likely due to her anemia as she significantly improved after transfusion of 2 units pRBCs for a HCT of 18. .
# Fevers and UTI: UTI was likely cause for her fevers to 102.3 and diff with 91% PMNs.
Pt has a h/o b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**] ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right nephrostomy tube, and all UA's have been positive with pyuria and hematuria since [**2-15**].
She received vanc/cefepime in the ED; her past urine Cx's have grown E coli sensitive to cefepime.
Per past urology notes, her R kidney is not functioning as well as the left, and no other urological interventions were necessary; she is scheduled for a left stent change in [**7-17**].
Her blood cultures speciated as pansensitive E. coli and she was transitined to oral ciprofloxacin, also to complete a 14 day course, priro to dishcarge.
She remained afebrile and stable on oral antibiotics for 24 hours prior to discharge.
Likely prerenal etiology given fever and UTI and FeNa of 0.9%.
She has a h/o obstruction, but had been maintaining good UOP from urethra and nephrostomy.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with Hct 24.9 and MCV 102 on admission; baseline Hct is in high 20's.
She had no Si/Sx of active bleeding upon admission, although the pt endorses small amts of blood in stool while on avastin, known to heme-onc.
She had a 6-point Hct drop after admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no identified source; her Hct bumped appropriately after 2U PRBC's.
