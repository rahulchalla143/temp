Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2160-12-12**] extended right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy   History of Present Illness: Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] operative note: 71-year- old female who underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileocolostomy primary anastomosis performed on [**2160-7-10**], by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for a high-grade poorly- differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right colon.
CT scan on [**2160-6-18**], demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver.
Postoperatively, she developed right upper quadrant abdominal pain as an outpatient and underwent an MRI that demonstrated multiple rim enhancing lesions in the right lobe of the liver.
The largest lesion within segment 5 measured 2.5 x 1.7 with an additional lesion in the dome in segment 8 measuring 1.4 x 1.1 cm.
A liver biopsy on [**7-23**] demonstrated focus of poorly-differentiated carcinoma consistent with colon primary.
A follow-up CT scan on [**11-10**] demonstrated progression of disease with a 3.7 x 3.3 cm lesion in the dome of the liver in segment 8, a segment 5 lesion measuring 6.3 x 5.3 cm, a segment 7 lesion measuring 4.1 x 3.7 cm and a new segment 7 lesion measuring 1.4 cm in diameter.

Operative findings revealed several large masses in the right lobe of the liver with the lesion in the dome of the liver in segment 8 extending into the segment 4A and abutting the middle hepatic vein.
There were no lesions in the left lateral segment or the caudate lobe.
Metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with colonic primary origin.
No calculi or tumor.
Postop, she remained in the PACU overnight due to low bp and pain control issues.
She received IV fluid boluses, a neo drip and 2 units of PRBC for a drop in hct with improvement in her bp/hct.
