Admission Date:  [**2197-10-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-11-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2137-1-4**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer diagnosed in [**2191**] with a lesion that was too small to be excised, though it was biopsied and metastasis to bone and brain were apparently found at the time of diagnosis.
In [**2197-4-25**] she was found to have a tonic-clonic seizure and was started on Dilantin to which she developed a rash to, and she was switched to Depakote.
Also sometime in the past she was given radiation to the right parietal lobe and excision of the left cerebellum, and she has undergone chemotherapy.
MRI showed pathologic fracture at the L5 level and compression of L3 and narrowing of L5-S1, but no real cord compression.
Metastatic breast cancer.
L5 vertebral metastases.
Helicobacter pylori ulcer disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, she was alert, cooperative, and in no acute distress.
Throat showed no lesions.
There was no nystagmus.
No breast masses were palpable.
Heart showed no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was mildly distended.
No organomegaly, masses, or tenderness, with active bowel sounds.
Extremities showed 2 to 3+ pitting edema in both legs.
Neurologically, she had terminal dysmetria, prominent on the right and mild on the left.
There were rapid alternating movements and had poor heel-to-shin with the left leg and better with the right leg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2197-10-27**], the patient underwent L4 to S2 laminectomies with L4 to S1 pedicle screw fixation and allograft without intraoperative complications.
On [**2197-10-30**], the patient had elevated coagulations with an INR of 3.2, PT of 21.5, and PTT of 38.7.
The patient did not have a drop in hematocrit and was no longer actively bleeding.
They opted for conservative management given her spinal surgery and her elevated coagulations.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
She was intubated, and her coagulopathy was corrected with 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K with no further problems with her coagulations.
The patient was also ruled out for a myocardial infarction and seen by the Cardiology Service for the congestive heart failure.
Cardiology attributed her ischemia as to being multifactorial due to low hematocrit, coagulopathy, and stress of being hospitalized.
It was a suboptimal study but was consistent with anterior septal and apical hypokinesis.
Cardiology attending agreed that it was most likely ischemic anterior changes with a slight troponin leak.
On [**2197-11-1**], the patient was also seen by the Pulmonary Service for her respiratory failure and need for intubation.
It was unclear from their point of view why she developed congestive heart failure; although, they felt it was multifactorial, and the goal of treatment was to wean her from the mechanical ventilation as soon as it was tolerated and diurese her.
Her motor strength in her lower extremities revealed she was 4+ in the bilateral iliopsoas, 5 in the quadriceps, a 1 in the left AT, and a 4- in the right AT and numbness in bilateral feet.
The patient was also seen by the Hematology Service and worked up for a possible transfusion reaction to the fresh frozen plasma which may have been the reason for the rapid onset of congestive heart failure post fresh frozen plasma transfusion.
for afterload reduction.
Hematologically, her coagulations were within normal limits since being transfused with fresh frozen plasma and given vitamin K.  From a neurosurgical standpoint, the patient was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to require rehabilitation prior to discharge to home.
