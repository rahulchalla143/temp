Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 20 yo female with Type I DM, ESRD on HD, h/o PE in [**8-11**] on coumadin, parathyroid adenoma, admitted for hypertensive urgency.
It remained unclear if hypertension was due to medication noncompliance (patient says she reliably takes all meds) versus chronic underdializing and fluid overload.
She was then transferred back to the ICU for hypertensive urgency again.
She was also started on additional oral BP meds including hydralazine and minoxidil (avoided clonidine for concern over reflex hypertention if there is medication non-compliance).
At HD on [**10-26**] she was noted to have rigors and subsequently developed a ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII bactermia and growth from her tunnelled cath tip (after it was removed).
Patient reports unilateral throbbing headache associated with photophobia and nausea.
It was not clear if her headache was due to hypertension or if she was having a migraine.
She was treated also with Dilaudid and morphine IV for pain which generally controlled her pain.
Parathryoid adenoma.
Parathyroid scan on [**2116-10-2**] showed anterior mediastinal parathyroid adenoma.
Patient will need surgical removal of adenoma in future given that hypercalcemia likely contributes to both her headache and recurrent nausea.
She was recommended to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26030**] as an outpatient with an appropriate anesthesiology pre-operative evaluation given the severity of her hypertension.
Patient had PE at OSH in [**8-11**] and is on Coumadin.
