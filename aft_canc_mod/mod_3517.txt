Yesterday the patient had worsening SOB and cough productive of clear sputum associated with low grade fevers to 99.
Pt reported no chest pain other than pressure with cough, + chronic back pain, no abdominal pain, no diarrhea or constipation, no headache.
A CTA was negative for PE but showed diffuse centrilobular nodules b/l and some consolidation in the RML and LL b/l, c/w infection or mets.
Pt was improving in terms of oxygenation and weaned to nasal cannula, but started to have increased tachypnea and tachycardia and with concern for fatigue in setting of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], NIF was checked and found to be -22 and Vital capacity of 1.2L.
Was intubated for impending respiratory fatigue.
Neurology was consulted with concearn for flare-up of his Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]; Tensilon test was positive; neurology recommended increase Mestinon from 60TID to 80TID and no indication for IVIG or plasmaphoresis.

CT angio [**3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Interval development of innumerable, diffuse, ill-defined nodules which appear to be in a centrilobular pattern, some of which are arranged in a tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern.
These findings are most suggestive of a small airways atypical infection, such as fungal, mycobacterial, or mycoplasma.
3) Multifocal areas of consolidation within the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left lower lobe, findings which may represent atelectasis or multifocal infectious process.
4) Slight interval decrease in size of the right middle lobe pulmonary mass.
5) Stable appearance of bulky axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
CT head [**3-15**] (noncontrast): IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
EEG [**3-16**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and  subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and  infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
A tachycardia was  noted.
Respiratory failure - etiology was multifactorial, due to a multifocal pneumonia, RSV bronchiolitis, and myasthenia crisis.
Neurology was consulted early, and a tensilon test could not rule out myasthenia crisis.
His NIF was measured daily, and increased to about -27 without increased effort.
He did well for a few days off any ventilatory support, and then on [**2191-3-28**] became hypotensive and went into hypercarbic respiratory failure.
A head CT did not reveal any acute intracranial process.
An EEG showed changes consistent with encephalopathy, thought to be due to metabolic causes.
An LP was eventually performed to rule out a meningitis, which was negative.
3.  tachycardia - Pt was noted to be tachycardic, between the 90s-120s during most of his hospitalization.
There was no clear etiology; pt's EKG was consistent with sinus tachycardia.
There was a loose association between his fevers and tachycardia, but pt remained on the tachycardic side whether or not he was febrile.
4.  anemia - Pt's baseline Hct was around 28-30.
GI was consulted and it was thought that if he had a true GI bleed, pt would have melena or BRBPR, neither of which he had.
Pt was guaiac positive but not frankly melenic or with BRBPR; this was thought to be due to the small amount of oral bleeding pt demonstrated in the context of gum disease.
6.  myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] - Due to an equivocal tensilon test, pt was treated with 5 days of IVIG.
He was maintained on the pyrdidostigmine throughout his course and it was felt the myasthenia contributed to his poor respiratory status.
7.  fevers - Pt was consistently febrile throughout his hospitalization.
Low-grade fevers were thought to be consistent with pt's underlying CLL and were consistent with his low-grade fevers at home.
Blood cultures were repeatedly negative, with the exception of a myco/lytic blood culture bottle ([**12-27**] blood cultures from that day, [**3-11**]) grew Enterococcus faecium, which was sensitive to vancomycin.
Pt's sputum cultures did not grow any bacteria; however, repeated nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for RSV antigen and he was treated with ribavirin and palivizumab x 2.
Pt's nasopharyngeal aspirates grew HSV-1 on viral culture, but this was not thought to be a pathogenic source.
He was treated with acyclovir for his HSV infection as he had oral ulcers.
Pt developed increasing bilateral pleural effusions.
8.  adrenal insufficiency - Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was borderline positive, thought likely in the context of sepsis.
G-CSF and neutropenic cautions were stopped.
Daily ANC revealed a down-trend, though not to neutropenic levels, but he was felt to be functionally neutropenic.
Pt was also thrombocytopenic and anemic, thought to be due to his recent chemotherapy.
He became transiently hypernatremic in this setting, but this resolved with free water flushes.
Goals of care: HIs clinical picture worsened on [**2191-3-28**] when he became hypotensive and had acute repsiratory failure.
