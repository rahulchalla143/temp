man with a known history of metastatic melanoma who comes in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today with a chief complaint of headaches and vomiting.
Per the patient's wife and son, who are with him today, he was diagnosed with melanoma 2 years ago when he found a lesion on his right anterior neck.
He then underwent excision and biopsy of this lesion and has subsequently had chemotherapy x 2 and high-dose IL-2.
Since this time he had undergone regular disease surveilance, and has been found to have metastatic disease to the lungs and abdomen.
However, he has a been having b/l frontal headaches over the past week, which have been minimally relieved with OTC pain meds.
At 1:30 AM on [**11-2**] he woke up and vomited 3-4 times and complained of excrutiating pain in the back of his head and neck.
He was then taken to an OSH for evaluation and found to have an intracranial lesion on CT.
His wife and son deny any recent behavioral or mental status changes, recent memory loss, or motor weakness.
They do, however, report some imbalance and unsteady gait.
Of note, he had an MRI of the brain in [**2173-5-27**] that did not show any intracranial masses.
HEENT: Pupils: pinpoint and minimally reactive b/l  EOMs: full Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

Mild associated mass effect as described.
Large relatively acutely hemorrhagic lesion in the posterior right temporoparietal region.
This has surrounding zone of vasogenic edema and slight mass effect with evidence of "trapping" of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
There is melanin, or perhpas, more subacute hemorrhage at the dorsal aspect of the lesion, with only a faint "blush" of enhancement, anteriorly.
The overall appearance is suggestive of hemorrhagic melanoma metastasis.
No other hemorrhagic or enhancing focus.
CT Torso([**11-3**]) Multiple pulmonary nodules are little changed from [**2173-10-1**] except for slight increase in size of posterior right lower lobe nodule.
Pleural-based nodules on the right are decreased in size.
No new focus of metastatic disease is seen.
Interval substantial improvement in paraaortic retroperitoneal fat stranding and soft tissue density compared to [**2173-10-1**].
Colonic diverticulosis.
He has PMH significant for known metastatic melanoma.
His pain was well controlled initially with IV, and then PO pain medication.
On POD 1, an MRI was obtained and showed "resection of right temporal mass with mild residual enhancement."
There was no evidence of acute infarction and there was a small amount of blood products seen at the surgical site.
He was instructed to follow-up as necessary with all of the physicians who are caring for his cancer needs.
