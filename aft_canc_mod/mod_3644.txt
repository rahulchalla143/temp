Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: percutaneous liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: 68 year-old male with recently diagnosed HTN and liver mass admitted for hemodynamic monitoring from intraperitoneal bleed after liver biopsy.
CT abd/pelvis showed subcapsular hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, blood in pelvis.
Liver mass as above 2.
Hypertension (diagnosed two weeks prior, no medications) 5.
Right inguinal hernia status post repair [**5-/2180**] 6.
No prior blood transfusions.
Family History: Brother has prostate Ca, colon cancer, CAD s/p bypass, now dying from cancer metastases.
No family hx of pancreatic/liver disease.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-24**] 3:19 PM CHEST, TWO VIEWS, PA AND LATERAL History of liver biopsy with pneumothorax on post-scan radiograph.
There is a small right pneumothorax.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-24**] 5:02 PM CONCLUSION: Stable right apical pneumothorax as compared to earlier today at 3:30 p.m. .
Again seen is a periportal echogenic vascular lesion measuring approximately 2.2 cm in size.
However, based on its location, it was decided that the best approach for sampling this lesion would be performed by CT fluoroscopy.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave flattening.
Delayed precordial R wave progression.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No active extravasation.
Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver likely related to _____ hematoma and the fact that the patient had heterogeneous perfusion prior to the procedure.
No narrowing or thrombosis of hepatic or portal veins.
Large lesser sac hematoma and hemoperitoneum, as before.
Unchanged appearance of mass adjacent to the caudate lobe.
Decreased size of right pneumothorax with small remaining pneumothorax.
The small right apical pneumothorax is stable or slightly decreased compared to the previous study giving the expiratory technique of the current exam.
The marked emphysema and subpleural bullae are unchanged in appearance.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-26**] CHEST TWO VIEWS PA AND LATERAL History of liver biopsy and pneumothorax.
There is a persistent small right apical pneumothorax essentially unchanged since the previous film of [**2181-4-25**], there are new lung lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male with incidentally discovered liver mass who presented to CT guided liver biopsy, compicated by right apical pneumothorax and peri-hepatic/intrapelvic hematoma, transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
Complicated by pneumothorax and bleeding (see below).
2) Peri-hepatic hematoma/intra-pelvic bleed:  Secondary to liver biopsy.
3) Pneumothorax:  He developed a small right apical pneumothorax secondary to the procedure.
4) Alcohol abuse:  Though he denied significant alcohol use, his platelet count was on the low side, with elevated MCV, and his family reported significant use.
He is somewhat in denial about having a problem with drinking.
Disp:*30 patches* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intrabdominal bleed (subcapsular hematoma of liver, pelvis) Right upper lobe pneumothorax secondary to liver biopsy complications.
Hepatic mass Alcohol withdrawal   Discharge Condition: stable, no signs/symptoms of further bleeding   Discharge Instructions: You had a liver biopsy which resulted in minor collapse of your R lung which is resolving, and some internal bleeding.
Please seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms of further bleeding such as shortness of breath, dizziness or chest pain.
Because of your bleeding, you should not take your baby Aspirin for at least the next week, and probably not until you see your primary care doctor, who should recheck your blood level.
