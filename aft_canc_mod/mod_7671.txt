Admission Date:  [**2136-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-6-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 22408**] is a 47 year old man with a history of obesity, asthma, chronic low back pain, and recent rib fracture who presented to the ED on [**4-14**] for 2 weeks of severe fatigue & dyspnea on exertion.
In [**Month (only) 956**] of this year, the patient was diagnosed with a right lateral seventh rib fracture following incidental trauma (leaning over the arm of a chair).
On [**4-9**], the patient was seen in Pulmonology clinic for progressive dyspnea and bony pain, and his dyspne awas thought attributable to asthma.
, though a CXR was negative for fracture.
His DOE progressed and he developed profound fatigue, along with nightsweats and fevers.
There, he endorsed mild subjective fevers at home, but denied any other B symptoms.
Blood work demonstrated a hematocrit of 25.7 (baseline Hct 45), a new thrombocytopenia to 101, and a WBC of 8.7 with abnormal myeloid cells.
He also had a Cr of 2.2 (baseline 0.8) and was noted to have a new murmur on exam.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management, but on the floor he was ill-appearing and further work-up demonstrated a Ca of 17.7 and Uric Acid of 12.9.
A CT torso demonstrated diffuse lucencies in the bone without associated lymphadenopathy consistent with multiple myeloma, and his SPEP demonstrated a monocloncal IgG kappa spike of 15% of total protein with normal viscosity.
His O2 requirement also continued to rise and a CXR on [**4-17**] suggested a right middle lobe pneumonia so he was started on Ceftriaxone & Azithromycin for CAP.
He appeared uncomfortable and was unable to speak in complete sentences.

Tobacco: None EtOH: None Illicits: None   Family History: Mother: CAD and DM Father: DM [**Name (NI) **] known family history of cancer   Physical Exam: GEN: Ill appearing, diaphoretic, drenching the bed with sweat HEENT: MMM, no OP lesions, no thyromegaly CV: RR, III/VI holosystolic murmur PULM: CTAB, poor effor, prolonged expiratory phase ABD: BS+, soft, distended, NTND, no masses or HSM but exam limited by habitus LIMBS: No LE edema, no clubbing, no tremors LYMPHNODES: No epitrochlear, cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal, popliteal LAD SKIN: No rashes or skin breakdown NEURO: Sleepy, slow to resond to questions but answers appropriately, reflexes are diffusely 1-, toes are down bilaterally  Pertinent Results: TRANSTHORACIC ECHO: The left atrium is elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
No enlarged lymph nodes are seen.
Incidentally noted, but not fully evaluated, there is a round hypoechoic lesion within the left lobe of the liver.
No lymphadenopathy identified.
Left hepatic lesion measuring 1.3 cm, which cannot be further  characterized with ultrasound.
Small precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm in short axis which does not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
The heart and great vessels are unremarkable and there is no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout the lungs bilaterally, sparing the subpleural lung, with a more nodular pattern predominating in the upper lobes.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of normal caliber and there is no pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.
Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the abdominal aorta, otherwise of normal caliber.
Bone windows reveal innumerable small lucent lesions throughout all visualized osseous structures.
A healing right seventh rib fracture is noted anterolaterally.
No vertebral compression deformities are observed.
Findings most consistent with multiple myeloma with innumerable lucent lesions seen throughout all visualized osseous structures.
Diffuse ground glass and partially nodular opacities throughout both lungs is a nonspecific finding, though raises concern for an atypical infection; pulmonary edema alone is felt less likely.
No obvious lucent lesions identified radiographically.
However, the torso CT obtained the same day shows innumerable small lytic foci which are consistent with myeloma.
Diffuse pulmonary parenchymal opacities which require further evaluation.
Degenerative changes in the spine.
Heterogeneous signal intensity in the bone marrow, likely consistent with neoplastic infiltration from multiple myeloma.
Multilevel disc degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine as described in detail above, more significant at L3/L4 and L4/L5 level, causing left side neural foraminal narrowing at L3/L4 and right-sided neural foraminal narrowing at L4/L5.
Disc desiccation and posterior diffuse disc bulge is also noted at L5/S1, apparently contacting the S1 nerve root on the right.
MRI THIGH [**2136-6-10**]:  Diffuse, marrow infiltration in the pelvis and femurs, consistent with known multiple myeloma.
While no definite fracture is evident, there is confluent abnormal signal in the femoral necks bilaterally, which would be susceptible to a pathologic fracture.
2) Two specific areas where the lesion thins and interrupts the overlying cortex -- one in the right iliac bone and one in the right proximal femoral neck posteriorly.
Although no conventional fracture is identified, both areas are associated with areas of complete cortical interruption.
Given the degree of osteoporosis and absence of overlying cortex, these areas are likely at increased risk for pathologic fracture, particularly in the right femoral neck lesion.

# Hypercalcemia: The calcium of 17.7 (ionized 2.13) on admission was thought to be due to an underlying malignant process.
# Multiple Myeloma/ Plasma cell leukemia: Patient with M-protein in both urine & serum identified as IgG kappa as well as end-organ damage manifested as ARF and anemia, diffuse lytic lesions on CT and hypercalcemia suggested a diagnosis multiple myeloma.
Bone marrow biopsy results were positive for myeloma.
Patient had a normal serum viscosity and was without signs or symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome, but a beta-2 microglobulin was 6.8.
He ultimately completed 8 days of Velcade, but peripheral blood demonstrated an increasing number of plasma cells (peak 38% plasma cells).
The patient tolerated cycle 1 of this therapy well and responded appropriately with complete clearing of plasma cells from peripheral blood.
The patient remained afebrile while neutropenic.
Oxycontin with Oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain was initiated prior to discharge.
At the time of discharge, neutropenia has resolved and neupogen was discontinued.
# Lower extremity pain: Prior to discharge, the patient developed lower extremity / hip pain.
MRI of thorasic and lumbar spine as well as left hip was performed and revealed significant disk disease and hyperdensity at femoral neck region which could represent an area more suscpetible to pathological fracture.
However, there was no clear evidence of cortical interruption or pathologic fractures.
In order to evealuate further for pathologic fracture, ORTHO CT of the pevis without contrast was performed and did not reveal any pathologic fractures, however revealed areas of possible cortical interruption in right iliac region and femoral neck, which may be susceptible to pathologic fracture.
# Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Early in the course of his hospitalization, the patient developed an increasing O2 requirement in the setting of known asthma, aggressive fluid therapy, and a new right middle lobe pneumonia with pulmonary edema on CXR and CT chest.
For the pneumonia he was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but upon worsening of his respiratory status was empirically switched to cefepime and levofloxacin, ultimately completing a total of 14 days of antibiotics.
In the setting of an elevated BNP, aggressive fluid hydration, and signs of overload on CXR, he underwent a repeated echocardiograms that demonstrated acute worsening of the patient's pulmonary artery hypertension with a peak pressure of 60mm Hg.
Pulmonology and Cardiology were consulted and felt that his distress was owed to his right-sided heart failure.
# Hyperuricemia: Likely due to rate of cellular proliferation in conjunction with ARF.
As there was no evidence of TLS and LDH / Uric Acid trended down, Allopurinol was discontinued prior to discharge.
# ARF: Elevated Cr on admission (baseline Cr 0.6-0.8) that continued to rise initially during hospitalization.
This was thought consistent with a tumor lysis/myeloma kidney from multiple myeloma, as evidenced by his hypercalcemia / hyperuricemia.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient with a low reticulocyte count, elevated haptoglobin & ferritin.
As his bone marrow biopsy demonstrated significant marrow infiltration, it was felt likely that this was due to ineffective production rather than destruction.
No evidence of TTP or intravascular hemolysis.
The patient had multiple episode of epistaxis during his ICU stay with negligible blood loss that was corrected with Afrin, platelet transfusion, and switching his nasal cannula to humidified O2 via face tent.
These values remained stable prior to discharge and the patient had no further episodes of epistaxis.
