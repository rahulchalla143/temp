She was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for ERCP today with bacteremia and septic picture.
IR wants to confirm biliary obstruction + assess the anatomy before potential PTC tomorrow.
She is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and altered mental status.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] from a nursing home on [**2158-2-26**] with intractable nausea and vomiting and coffee ground emesis.
She was to have ERCP as above today to look at possible dudodenal obstruction with potential palliative stenting.
Metastatic pancreatic carcinoma diagnosed in [**Month (only) **] of [**2156**]-CT scan at [**Hospital3 **] done weeks ago showed mets to liver, lungs, and obstruction of portal, splenic veins 2.
GI bleeding--recent, [**2-16**] at [**Hospital3 **], EGD revealed erosive esophagitis and dudoenal inflammation raising concern for duodenal outlet obstruction.

No pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
Multiple small nodular opacities in both lungs, suspicious for metastasis.
CT may be helpful for further evaluation.
Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation measuring 9 mm in diameter.
Large pancreatic mass with hepatic, splenic, and likely osseous metastases.
Common bile duct and duodenal stent.
Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrated mildly distended intrahepatic biliary ducts and severely distended proximal common bile duct with a large filling defect occupying most of the common bile duct and extending to the ampulla.
10 mm by 94 mm Wallstent was placed across the narrow common bile duct extending from the bifurcation of the common bile duct to the duodenum.
An external internal biliary drain was left in place extending from the peripheral branch of the right intrahepatic biliary duct into the duodenum.
EKG: no acute changes   Brief Hospital Course: # Pancreatic cancer: Ms. [**Known lastname 63057**] has extensive metastatic pancreatic cancer ith gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal obstruction and possible biliary obstruction.
The IR team felt that at some point in the coming weeks, her internal stents will become blocked from her disease so they left the external drain in-place.
It can remained plugged until she develops itching or any signs that the stents are clogged.
# Hypotension:  This was likely secondary to cholangitis/sepsis: with rising LFTs's, tbili, and she has a known biliary obstruction from pancreatic cancer.
She was initially treated with Zosyn, and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after hypotension in the ERCP suite.
Overnight she was treated with IV fluids for hypotension after a central line was placed.
THe following day she had a second stent placement, by IR, and has an external/internal drain in place, draining into the GI tract.
However, her EKGs showed irregular rhythm at times, and appeared to have P waves at times as well.
She was started a low dose beta blocker for HR control  # Recent GI bleeding: Ms [**Known lastname 63057**] had recent GIB at OSH, which now appears to be stabilized.
# coaulopathy: secondary to sepsis vs. liver failure vs. dic.
Followed INR, gave FFP for her IR procedure.
# Code:DNR/DNI--had extensive discussions with [**Doctor First Name 553**] and [**Doctor First Name 2147**] as well as sister [**Name (NI) **].
# Communication: [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63058**] is sister, [**Name (NI) **].
