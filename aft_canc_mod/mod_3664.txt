[**12-2**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval stable appearance of bilateral nodules, and patchy areas of consolidation within the lungs.
Previously noted mild splenomegaly is no longer appreciated, possibly related to slice selection.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or tamponade.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude) Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2126-11-5**], the pericardial effusion is now larger.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated mean right filling pressure along with a magnified right atrial "x" descent along with an attenuated "y" descent.
Following pericardiocentesis (removal of over 320cc of non-bloody fluid) the pericardial pressure dropped to zero with no change in the right atrial pressure or cardiac output.
Moderate pericardial tamponade.
There is a catheter overlying the cardiac silhouette.
There is continued bilateral multifocal opacity indicating invasive aspergillosis this patient with leukemia and neutropenia.
The previously identified pulmonary edema has been slightly improving.
There is continued small right pleural effusion.
There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
No evidence of pneumothorax is identified.
[**12-5**] Abd U/S: No evidence of dilatation of the bile ducts.
Echogenic right kidney suggestive of diffuse chronic parenchymal renal disease.
[**12-6**] KUB: A limited portable supine AP view of the abdomen at 22:15 hours show no evidence of dilated bowel loops to suggest intestinal obstruction.
Mild periventricular hyperintensities due to small vessel disease.
No enhancing lesions seen.
[**12-6**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**12-6**] EEG: This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to the presence of abnormal background rhythms in predominantly the theta frequency range with superimposed delta and theta frequency slowing seen periodically in generalized bursts.
No sharp or epileptiform features were associated with this slowing.
The findings are most consistent with an encephalopathy.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.
[**12-6**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small posterior pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**12-7**] CXR: No significant change in bilateral parenchymal opacities related to pulmonary aspergillosis.
[**12-7**] KUB: A single supine portable abdominal film is compared to previous examination a day ago.
The abdomen appears gasless with fecal material in left hemicolon.
The linear lucencies in the splenic flexure and descending colon is felt to be intraluminal rather than within the wall of the colon.
[**12-7**] Renal U/S: No hydronephrosis or hydroureter bilaterally.
[**12-9**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: Unusual generalized focal FLAIR hyperintensities and possible coincident enhancement.
Although motion artifact or possibly another unusual artifact may be responsible for the apparent sulcal enhancement, meningitis of infectious or neoplastic etiology should be considered in the given clinical scenario.
[**12-9**] Spinal fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells.
[**12-9**] Bone Marrow Bx: Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy: Markedly hypocellular bone marrow with rare maturing erythroid precursors and interstitial eosinophilic material consistent with post-chemotherapy aplasia.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION PERIPHERAL SMEAR Smear quality is acceptable.
Red cells show anisopoikilocytosis with rare schistocyte.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES The marrow biopsy is virtually acellular (<5%) and contains only are small clusters populated by maturing erythroid precursors.
There is a small amount of interstitial eosinophilic material consistent with prior chemotherapy.
She was continued on cefepime and vancomycin, and the doses of her antifungal medication for known aspergillus infection were increased.
The patient developed a new murmur and increased dyspnea and chest pain, and on [**12-4**] an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
She was transferred to the CCU for placement of a pericardial drain and for post-procedural care.
On [**12-5**] the patient developed renal failure.
On [**12-6**] the patien's mental status deteriorated and she became aphasic and less interactive.
Neurology was consulted, and they were concerned for an intracranial process vs. toxic/metabolic etiology.
A head CT without contrast was negative for any acute abnormality.
EEG was consistent with encephalopathy.
MRI was negative for acute infarct, and MRA was negative for any vascular abnormality.
An LP was done which showed an opening pressure of 42; however, this was felt to be falsely elevated due to patient positioning.
Laboratory studies were not consistent with infection, and cultures were negative.
The marrow was hypocellular with no evidence of active leukemia.
After the LP the patient was noted to be in severe respiratory distress and tachycardic to the 170s.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with no ischemic changes.
