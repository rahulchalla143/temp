Admission Date:  [**2198-9-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-9-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2154-5-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Taxol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**] Chief Complaint: Reason for admission to ICU: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 44yo M w/ widely metastatic lung cancer released [**2198-9-14**] from the federal prison hospital in [**Doctor First Name 5256**] on compassionate care, then flew to [**Location (un) 86**] for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where he had syncope at [**Location (un) 6692**] airport.
Pt has been in prison hospital since [**Month (only) 956**], when he was diagnosed with metastatic lung CA.
mult chemotherapies, though only recalled Taxol, which he states he had an allergic reaction to--causing flushing & discomfort.
His current issues include: - Pain involving chest wall, abdomen, and back.
Chest pain is generalized discomfort, non-radiating, not associated w/ palpitations or activity.
Abdominal pain diffuse, no change in bowel or bladder habits.
No blood noted in emesis/stool.
- Hypoglycemia, which has been present for an unknown period, but has been treated with a D5W drip at OSH hospital.
No h/o diabetes.
- Lower extremity DVTs & LUE DVT for which pt has been on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] (per his report).
- Shortness of breath w/ talking or activity associated with dry cough.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile HR 80s & SBP 90s (pt believes his SBP has been in the 90s for a few months).
He had a head CT which showed vasogenic edema, possibly from a met.
CXR showed apical bullous disease & small b/l pleural effusions.
Given 1L NS & SBP increased the 90s.
He was then transferred to the MICU the morning after initial admission ([**9-15**]) for persistent hypotension & tachypnea as well as closer monitoring of his FSBS given reported hypoglycemia.
No HA/vision changes.
+ SOB with exertion or speech.
Possible adrenal/abdominal mets.
History of XRT to chest/abd, ?
[**Month (only) 116**] have some tracheal compression due to CA.
No history of intracranial mets as per patient.
2) DVTs - patient has had DVTs in both legs & left arm.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: 97.2  85  87/44 25 98%RA Gen: ill appearing man, cachextic with LUE swelling, poorly verbalizing HEENT: PER and minimally reactive, tracks; MM mildly dry; no JVD CV: RRR without m/g/r PULM: Physical chest deformity; skin discoloration; minimal air movement and irregular breathing patter; Course BS b/l without wheeze; occasional rhonchi/rales in bases Abd: +BT, thin & retracted, denies TTP Ext: cool, well perfused and without c/c; LUE with 1+ edema to axilla & mild erythematous rash; B/L LE with 1+ edema Neuro: difficult to assess, minimally communicative due to laryngeal nerve involvement; follows commands as able  Pertinent Results: Radiology: CXR [**2198-9-14**] A right-sided Port-A-Catheter is identified in the upper SVC.
There is right apical hyperlucency, most likely representing apical bullous disease.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, which are unchanged.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There are no focal consolidations.
IMPRESSION: Right apical lucency likely secondary to bullous disease.
Unchanged appearance of atelectasis and pleural effusions as described above.
CT Head [**2198-9-14**] There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There is a small focus of hypodensity in the right posterior lobe near the high convexity which may represent a focus of vasogenic edema.
No definite underlying lesion is seen, though evaluation for metastatic disease is limited on this non-contrast study.
No additional areas of similar hypodensity are seen to suggest additional lesions in the brain.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
The calvarium is intact, without evidence of suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.
IMPRESSION: Focus of suspected vasogenic edema in the right posterior frontal lobe near the high convexity, concerning for metastatic disease from patient's known lung cancer.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Acute occlusive DVT involving the left common femoral vein, greater saphenous vein, and superficial femoral vein.
Occlusive thrombus, likely subacute/chronic, involving the right greater saphenous and superficial femoral veins.
Non-occlusive thrombus within the right common femoral vein.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  Study Date of [**2198-9-15**] 8:53 AM Non-visualization of the left internal jugular vein, presumably thrombosed, as well as thrombosis of the left subclavian vein.
T2 hyperintensity of the right frontal lobe involving the right motor cortex surrounding a smaller area of even more T2 hyperintensity, which may show some enhancement.
These findings are suspicious for metastasis.
IVC GRAM/FILTER Study Date of [**2198-9-15**] 6:36 PM Uncomplicated IVC filter placement from the right internal jugular venous approach.
Extensive metastatic disease.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left > right, with bibasilar opacities likely representing atelectasis.
Partially occlusive thrombus within the superior vena cava.
No definite pericardial involvement with tumor.
No definite spinal canal involvement is identified, however further assessment can be made with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10015**] indicated.
Probable area of tumoral cavitation extending into an adjacent small bowel loop (series 3, image 96) with small, contained foci of gas noted anteriorly, which may represent a contained perforation.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS Study Date of [**2198-9-16**] 1:55 PM Enhancing lesions in the right frontal convexity and in the right periatrial region indicative of metastatic disease.
LABS ON ADMISSION:   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 44yo M with metastatic lung cancer (likely adenoca) s/p chemo & radiation who presents hypotension & hypoglycemia with imaging since admit confirming widely metastatic disease including brain mets with course complicated by b/l LE DVTs and subsequent PEs.
Thus, pt's hypotension here may not be far off his baseline.
Suspect his low BP is combination of deconditioning & dehydration w/ potential adrenal insufficiency (given possible adrenal mets).
Low suspicion of infection based on lack of fever & no clear source, though wbc continues to be elevated.
# Brain metastases: CT head demonstrated likely vasogenic edmea and right posterior frontal lobe possibly representing focus of metastatic disease.
MRI revealed enhancing lesions in the right frontal convexity and in the right periatrial region indicative of metastatic disease.
Hold seizure prophylaxis at this time.
- cont steroids for cerebral edema .
Now with confirmed PEs and L UE DVT s/p IVC filter placement.
#Hypercalcemia: Most likely secondary to [**Last Name (un) 2043**] mets, possible PTH-related protein in lung CA.
#Leukocytosis: Pt could possibly have post-obstuctive PNA in LLL, evidence of pl.
Now with decreased WBC to 13.9, this AM newly increased to 17.3.
# Failure to thrive: Pt cachetic, malnourished given cancer & prolonged hospitalization.
# Elevated LFTs: On admission ALT 159, AST 176, Alk Phos 344, now with mild decrease in all values (unclear baseline).
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and malignancy.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
#Pain: due to multiple/diffuse metastases.
Pt lucid at this time, so may make decisions without HCP but could rapidly deteriorate given fragile state.
**Pt treated at [**Location (un) 100109**] in [**Doctor First Name 5256**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100112**] (phone), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100113**] (fax), will attempt to obtain records although likely will not change clinical outcome .
