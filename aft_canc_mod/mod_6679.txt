He presented to his PCP and after [**Name Initial (PRE) **] brief workup was sent for an MRI of the brain which shows at least two lesions in the brain, one 4 x 4 cm lesion in the R cerebellum and a smaller L occipital lobe lesion, most consistent with metastasis as well as dilated ventricles concerning for obstructive hydrocephalus.
He was sent from [**Hospital3 7571**]by EMS for neurosurgical evaluation.
Past Medical History: HTN, HLD, "pre-diabetic", h/o cataract surgery   Social History: previous smoker, approx 70-80 pack-years, previous social EtOH, no illicits   Family History: GM with stroke, prostate Ca in F and uncle   Physical Exam: O: T:  97.3 BP: 160/101  HR: 66 R 18  O2Sats 99%RA Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD HEENT: Pupils: [**2-3**] brisk  EOMI but with mild R nystagmus.
No dysarthria.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally with mild R-beating nystagmus.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally  Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2 2  2  2 Left      2 2 2  2  2  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: dysmetria on finger-nose-finger, worse on R as well as decreased performance of [**Doctor First Name **] on R. Wide based stance with negative Romberg  Pertinent Results: CT CHEST ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, ADDL SECTIONS [**2117-5-8**] 1.
1.5 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm homogeneous pleural based mass in the anterior inferior right upper lobe.
Further characterization with biopsy is recommended given concern for malignancy.
Focal hyperdensity near the left ureterovesical junction in the bladder.
Underlying mural lesion cannot be excluded.
Further evaluation with ultrasound or MRI should be considered.
3 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lung base.
No lymphadenopathy within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
MRI WAND: Enhancing hemorrhagic masses in right cerebellum and left occipital lobe are again demonstrated for surgical planning.
Expected postoperative appearance following right cerebellar mass resection.
Left occipital mass with surrounding edema is again noted, better seen on prior MRI.
The surgical bed includes blood products, thin peripheral rim of restricted diffusion likely representing postoperative  ischemia as well as minimal peripheral enhancement, also likely postoperative (although residual tumor cannot be excluded).
There remains mass effect upon the surrounding structures with effacement of the fourth ventricle and minimal right to left shift of the right residual cerebellar lobe.
This may represent postoperative fluid although the sterility of this collection is indeterminate.
Short interval followup is recommended.
No change in the left paramedian occipital lobe enhancing lesion with surrounding edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o M presents with frequent fall and balance instability was found to have a R cerebellar and L occipital mass.
On examination, patient has minimal dysmetria and ataxia, but is otherwise intact.
Patient was started on decadron and PSA was sent and was elevated at 8.3.
CT torso was done which revealed a mass in both RUL and RLL.
On [**5-11**] he underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and mass resection.
Surgery was without complication and he tolerated it well.
Post op head CT revealed no hemorrhage and good placement of EVD.
On [**5-14**], he remained neurologically intact with only mild dysmetria.
His pain was well controlled on oral medications, he was tolerating a regular diet and ambulated with physical therapy, thus he was deemed ready for discharge home.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-13**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples and a wound check.
