She then complained of nausea and vomiting and became unresponsive quickly thereafter.
He called 911, and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.
CT of the head revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage.

Extensive collateral vascular structures are seen in the region of basal ganglia bilaterally.
The anterior portions of both internal cerebral veins are not well visualized, which could be secondary to blood within the third ventricle and focal mass effect.
Head CT shows intraventricular hemorrhage with dilated lateral ventricles due to hydrocephalus.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates attenuated internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral arteries with collateral lenticulostriate arteries indicative of a moyamoya pattern which could be secondary to vasculitis.
Further evaluation with cerebral angiography is recommended.
Although no obvious aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation is seen but the conventional angiography can provide better information of the arterial structures.
CT Head [**2132-12-28**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval decrease in the amount of hyperdense blood in the left lateral ventricle and third ventricle and fourth ventricle.
There has been decrease in amount of hydrocephalus in the interval since [**2132-12-27**].
A focal area of hypodensity in the right basal ganglia (2:11) is noted.
Linear hyperdensity in the sulci of the left frontoparietal region (2:17) may represent a component of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Bilateral ventricular shunts from a frontal approach are stable in place.
There is minimal subcutaneous gas (2:26).
There is no sclerotic or lytic bony lesion to suggest malignancy.
Minimal mucosal thickening in the posterior right ethmoid air cells are noted.
Interval decrease in intraventricular hyperdense hemorrhage and interval decrease in hydrocephalus and mass effect with interval visualization of the basal cisterns, which were obliterated on prior exam.
Focal hypodensity in the right basal ganglia may represent a focal area of infarction.
MRI [**2133-1-12**] IMPRESSION: Right intraventricular hemorrhage as on the previous CT. Acute/subacute right periatrial white matter infarct as seen on the previous CT examination.
Signal changes in the right basal ganglia could be due to subacute/chronic hemorrhage.
Increased signal in the right side of the midbrain probably due to subacute or chronic infarct in this location.
No other acute infarct seen.
MRA OF HEAD: [**2133-1-12**] Head MRA demonstrates bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery flow signal narrowing indicative of occlusive disease.
Similar findings were seen on the previous CTA examination.
In the posterior circulation, basilar artery is well visualized but diminished flow signal is seen in both posterior cerebral arteries.
Diminished flow is seen in both middle cerebral arteries secondary to supraclinoid occlusive disease.
U/S abdomen: [**1-11**] IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without evidence of cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No new hemorrhage.

CSF was also sent for studies.
She was also being transitioned to Keprra for antiseizure coverage due to elevated LFTs.
A speech and swallow evaluation was declined because of patient's lethargy.

Signal changes in the right basal ganglia could be due to subacute/chronic hemorrhage.
Increased signal in the right side of the midbrain probably due to subacute or chronic infarct in this location.
MRA showed bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery flow signal narrowing indicative of occlusive disease.
Similar findings were seen on the previous CTA examination.
In the posterior circulation, basilar artery is well visualized but diminished flow signal is seen in both posterior cerebral arteries.

Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?Please return to the office in [**5-30**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your [**Date Range 2729**] and a wound check.
Be sure to point out any incisions, which may be covered by clothing at the time of suture/staple removal.
