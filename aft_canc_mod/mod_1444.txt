He was taken to the operating room on [**2124-8-21**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] for the left  neck procedure with excision of melanoma connective tissue from left neck and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] then reconstructed the left neck with a left pectoralis myofascial transpositional flap, with placement of meshed skin graft (1.5:1) measuring 10 cm x 20 cm in area, closure of pharyngeal defect and nasogastric tube placement.
He was started on Unasyn for post operative antibiotic prophylaxis and was made NPO for 2 weeks secondary to the pharyngeal defect repair.
He was transferred to the floor on post operative day 1 and continued to do well, with his vital signs remaining stable, his pain well controlled and the flap/graft continued to be stable.
He developed a hive-like rash on his arms, which was thought to be secondary to the Unasyn.
The Unasyn was discontinued, the patient was started on Clindamycin and the rash resolved within 24 hours.
He continued to do well through his hospitalization, he was afebrile, vital signs stable, flap/graft intact and stable, tolerating tube feeds and pain well controlled on oral medications (Tylenol).
