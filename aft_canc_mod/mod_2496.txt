[**2143-7-30**]: Hepatic Angiogram  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 46M with h/o alcoholic cirrhosis, refractory ascites requiring paracentesis, on the transplant list who was referred to the Emergency Department for altered mental status.
Came in to radiology for scheduled paracentesis but could not perform due to AMS.
The patient denies any cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, fevers or chills.
Does note decreased frequency of BMs over the past few days as well as decreased energy.
Knows he is in [**Hospital1 18**] but confused as to place and gives incoherent, tangential story when asked about why he is currently in the hospital.
Of note, patient was discharged from the hospital last week after being admitted for poor nutition and new compression fracture.
Course was complicated by worsening hepatic hydrothorax requiring thoracentesis and atrial fibrillation with RVR that resolved with switching to propanolol.
EKG with LVH and repol changes similar compared to prior.
Chest x-ray with slightly enlarged moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
ROS: per HPI, notes increased gingival bleeding, constipation and bloating; denies bone pain, hematochezia, melena   Past Medical History: - Alcohol cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices (grade III) with bleed s/p banding in [**7-/2142**], ascites/SBP ([**5-/2142**]), encephalopathy, rectal varices - Alcoholic hepatitis [**2-/2141**] - Recurrent hepatic hydrothorax - Hemolytic anemia on prednisone - Type 2 diabetes mellitus - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Strep viridans and MSSA bacteremia s/p Vancomycin X 2 weeks [**5-/2142**] - Alcohol abuse (last drink [**2142-3-13**]) - GERD - Depression/anxiety - OSA on CPAP - Atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion not on anticoagulation  Social History: Currently lives at a rehab facility, where per documentation he requires assistance with most ADLs (bathing, ambulating, dressing) though he can eat independently.
dried blood around mouth and on tongue CARDIAC: RRR with slight SEM, hyperdynamic precordium, JVP halfway up neck LUNGS: decreased breath sounds on right ~[**4-14**] of the way up, no crackles on left ABDOMEN: Distended but soft, non-tender to palpation or percussion.
Dullness to percussion over dependent areas but tympanic anteriorly.
No HSM or tenderness appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: no edema b/l.
2+DPs, cool at fingertips, no clubbing or cyanosis NEUROLOGY: no asterixis, CNs intact, strength intact throughout    Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2143-7-19**] WBC-10.2 RBC-2.57* Hgb-9.6*# Hct-29.2* MCV-114* MCH-37.3* MCHC-32.9 RDW-17.7* Plt Ct-59* PT-38.7* INR(PT)-3.8* Glucose-112* UreaN-29* Creat-0.7 Na-135 K-4.0 Cl-100 HCO3-28 AnGap-11 ALT-32 AST-66* AlkPhos-172* TotBili-14.8* DirBili-6.4* IndBili-8.4 Albumin-2.9* Calcium-10.9* Phos-2.9 Mg-1.9 TSH-1.2 T4-2.5* PTH-49 At Discharge: [**2143-8-8**] WBC-6.6 RBC-3.00* Hgb-10.0* Hct-29.9* MCV-100* MCH-33.4* MCHC-33.6 RDW-18.1* Plt Ct-85* PT-10.5 PTT-28.9 INR(PT)-1.0 Glucose-186* UreaN-23* Creat-0.6 Na-136 K-4.4 Cl-101 HCO3-30 AnGap-9 ALT-78* AST-25 AlkPhos-110 TotBili-1.1 Calcium-8.5 Phos-3.7 Mg-1.4* tacroFK-8.8  CT HEAD: FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or infarction.
Mucosal thickening in posterior left ethmoid air cells remains.
Tiny hepatic cyst measuring 9 mm is seen in the left lobe.
A hypoechoic indeterminate lesion is seen in the right lobe measuring 8 x 7 mm.
Sludge and stones are seen in the gallbladder with mild mural thickening and wall edema which is nonspecific in the setting of ascites and underlying cirrhosis.
Small right pleural effusion and a small to moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites are again demonstrated.
Doppler assessment with spectral analysis of the hepatic vasculature was performed with patent main portal vein and right and left major branches with hepatopetal flow.
Main hepatic artery is patent with brisk systolic upstroke and appropriate waveform.
Cirrhotic liver with unchanged small to moderate ascites and splenomegaly with patent vessels.
Right pleural effusion.
Wall edema is nonspecific in the setting of underlying liver disease and ascites.
8mm hypodensity in the right lobe, indeterminate - further assessment by contrast enhanced CT or MRI is recommended on a non-emergent basis when clinical circumstance allows.
There is again seen a compression deformity at T9, which appears relatively stable allowing for differences in positioning and technique since the prior study.
No additional compression deformities are seen.
There is generalized demineralization.
Brief Hospital Course: 46M with EtOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, varices, SBP, ascites, and hepatic hydrothorax on the transplant list admitted with altered mental status with hallucinations concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
#ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: He was admitted with reduced attention and impaired orientation with asterixis on exam.
His [**Year (4 digits) **] were presumed to be due to hepatic encephalopathy.
RUQ U/S revealed patent portal vasculature.
Thoracentesis of pleural fluid with cell count not consistent with spontaneous bacterial empyema and culture negative.
Several urinalysis were bland and culture negative.
Multiple blood cultures negative.
There was limited ascites on ultrasound to sample.
He was found to have worsenig hypercalcemia.
He was given frequent lactulose and continued on rifaxamin with slow improvement of his mental status.
#BRBPR: Patient was noted to have bright red blood per rectum on [**7-25**], felt most likely to be from lower source.
Exam showed bright red blood around rectum without stool.
NG lavage was performed which was not suggestive of upper GI source.
He remained hemodynamically stable without tachycardia or hypotension.
Lasix was held out of concern for hypovolemia due to high volume of diarrhea.
At the time of surgery, the patient was noted to have  a small shrunken cirrhotic liver.
He had marked portal hypertension.
A repeat was obtained two days later, with new report of absent diastolic flow seen in the region of the main hepatic artery.
No arterial waveforms could be identified in the right or left lobes of the liver.
Per the angiogram report, there is no signifcant hepatic arterial anastomatic stenosis and no thrombosis.
The patients lateral drain has been removed, however the medial drain has continued with high volume output..
Most recently the drainage is approximately 1 liter dialy of serous ascitic fluid.
#HYPERCALCEMIA: This is longstanding and thought to be secondary to hyperparathyroidism from adenoma.
Hyperkalemia: Post transplant the patient has had elevated potassium recently.
The tube feeds were changed to a low K formula and the patient was started on florinef with good results and normalization of the potassium.
AFib: Patient has history of atrial fibrillation.
#T9 COMPRESSION FRACTURE: Patient is on chronic steroids though most recent DEXA was negative for osteoporosis.
He was continued on vitamin D. Continued on lidocaine patch for pain control.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID:PRN constipation Hold for loose stools 17.
Also please call if the drain output stops suddenly, turns green in color, becomes bloody or develops a foul odor.
Monitor the drain exit site for redness, drainage or bleeding.
