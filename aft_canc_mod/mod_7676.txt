At that time, lasix was stopped and atenolol was switched to metoprolol as there was concern that blunting of tachycardia could be contributing to falls.
Per report from the ER, patient has had confusion at home x 3 weeks, though no family accompanies her to corroborate this story, and patient denies this.
This morning, the patient denies headache, blurry Vision, numbness, tingling or weakness.
No increae LE edema.
No nausea, vomiting.

Family History: Mother: DM Father: DM Sister: HTN  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission: Vitals - 98.4 144/72 64 97%RA GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing female in NAD , awake and alert HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Finger to nose not preserved, however may be secondary to poor understanding of the test.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Many lymphocytes, including scattered larger atypical lymphoid cells.
No carcinoma is seen.
Note: Sections show fibrillary tumor with necrosis.
Tumor cells are pleomorphic with irregular nuclei.
STUDIES: [**6-2**] CT head: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation within the right thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule, with mild mass effect, which is new compared with [**2138-3-4**], and may represent a recent infarction.
No acute fracture or new subluxation of the cervical spine.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The mediastinal contours are notable only for tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
[**6-4**] MRI: Multiple foci of abnormal signal in the corpus callosum, the largest is centered in the left splenium.
These lesions demonstrate bright T2 FLAIR signal as well as mild slow diffusion and are hypodense on CT.  MRI with contrast is suggested for further characterization.
Differential diagnosis includes a metastatic disease with high cellularity, or lymphoma.
A demyelinating process is much less likely.
Very limited MRA examination demonstrating possible severe narrowing of the distal right M1 segment  [**6-4**] MRI with add'l sequences:  Multiple enhancing lesions along the corpus callosum as described above as well as in the suprasellar region, pineal gland, and right thalamus.
Differential diagnosis involves metastatic disease or lymphoma  CT chest/abd/pelvis [**6-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Heterogenous thyroid gland, which may be further evaluated with ultrasound if clinically warranted.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Air within the bladder may represent recent instrumentation.
Main pulmonary artery measures 3.6 cm, unchanged since [**2137-9-17**], raising the question of pulmonary artery hypertension.
Status post left occipital approach biopsy with hypoattenuation in this region, which could represent postprocedural edema versus infarct, which could be further delineated by MRI.
Similar distribution of metastatic lesions in the corpus callosum, suprasellar cistern, right thalamus, and left splenium, better depicted on preceding MRI dated [**2139-6-4**].
EEG [**2139-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of 29 brief electrographic seizures in the left parietotemporal region as is described earlier under continuous EEG.
A few of these seizures had clinical correlation with rhythmic movements of lips.
In addition, in the interictal phase there are nearly continuous left parietotemporal periodic epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) indicative of an active  epileptogenic focus in this region due to an underlying acute necrotic pathology.
Furthermore, background is diffusely slow indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction on non-specific etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY:  78 year old female with PMHx HTN, dCHF, diabetes, atrial fibrillation on coumadin with past ischemic stroke, presents with altered mental status, found to have new brain lesions.
A CT was done and revealed a likely subacute ischemic stroke in the right thalamus/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] neuro was contact[**Name (NI) **].
difficulty with spatial orientation, no dysarthia.
Following the neurology consult she received an MRI/MRA as there appeared to be persistent edema associated with the lesions on CT that would be atypical of a stroke.
The MRI revealed multiple enhancing lesions along the CC and elsewhere concerning for metastatic process versus lymphoma.
It was subsequently done under IR and was remarkable for a high protein and atypical cells.
The cytology showed many lymphocytes, including scattered larger atypical lymphoid cells.
Post-op head CT showed a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Overnight from [**Date range (1) 95249**] she became less responsive and then developed rhythmic eye movements to left side and generalized shaking.
She was given ativan 1mg x 2 after which she developed tonic gaze deviation to the left and continued to be unresponsive.
She subsequently became hypotensive and desaturated.
She also developed a fib with RVR.
# NEURO: She remained intubated on a propofol drip overnight with resolution of clinical seizure activity.
On the am of [**6-12**] she was noted to have some rhythmic eye blinking with left eye deviation and was given 2mg ativan IV.
EEG showed frequent left-sided PLED's which occasionally evolved into runs of rhythmic theta.
She continued to have some intermittent rhythmic eye blinking which was treated with ativan when persistent.
She had no additional further evidence of seizure activity.
Her home lasix was held due to her volume depletion upon admission.
# Respiratory: She remained intubated pending pathology results and discussion regarding goals of care with her family.
# Renal/GU: Mild renal insufficiency improved with gentle IVF suggesting hypovolemia, likely from decreased PO intake in setting of mental status changes.
She developed transient hypernatremia to 152 which resolved with free water flushes and IVF.
# FEN/GI: She remained NPO due to her mental status.
# Endocrine: She was maintained on fingersticks and ISS for blood glucose control.
