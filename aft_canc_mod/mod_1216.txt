Small amount of left pleural effusion is new as well.
Patient is in mild interstitial edema.
Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle.
TTE [**2199-4-30**] There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
A paravalvular aortic valve leak is probably present.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen (with holodiastolic flow reversal demonstrated in the descending thoracic aorta in suprasternal notch views).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  TTE [**2199-5-1**] Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
An eccentric anterior perivalvular jet of at least mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-30**], the severity of aortic regurgitation is now reduced.
A paravalvular aortic valve leak is present at the aorticopulmonic crux/septum.
A component of intravalvular regurgitation cannot be excluded.
The aortic regurgitation appears moderate (2+) by color flow Doppler.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-1**], the appearance of aortic regurgitation by color flow Doppler is increased.
TTE [**2199-5-3**] The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-2**], no change.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

# Aortic stenosis s/p [**Age over 90 **]: 2 corevalves were placed due to complicated aortic anatomy.
He received a third unit PRBC on arrival to CCU for Hct 25 and bumped appropriately, after which his Hct stabilized and he required no further transfusions.
Bedside echo post-procedure showed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.
Repeat echo on POD#4 showed mild to mod aortic regurgitation and on POD#6 showed mod AR.
# AR: expected to improved somewhat post-procedure as pt stabilizes out.
# Anemia: pt lost approximately one liter of blood during procedure, received 3 units with appropriate increase to Hct 31.Pt also experienced some oozing at the site of his neck catheter and was thought to have a hematoma there.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2173**] with patent LIMA-LAD: continued ASA.
When Hct stable and there was no evidence of bleeding at the swan ganz catheter site, coumadin was restarted at home dose with heparin subQ for DVT ppx.
# confusion: pt intermittently experienced mild confusion at night and in early AM in ICU, thought to be mild delirium [**1-17**] pt not sleeping well at night.
# Hypertension: restarted metoprolol on POD#2 as above  # Hyperlipidemia: continued pravastatin  # h/o renal artery stenosis: s/p stenting so pt started on lisinopril as above for HTN/cardioprotection  # foley catheter: nurse had trouble getting foley out on POD#3.
able to deflate the balloon a little more with large empty syringe but it never fully deflated and a small ridge persisted where the balloon was supposed to fully deflate.
