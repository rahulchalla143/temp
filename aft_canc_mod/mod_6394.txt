History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 487**] [**Known lastname 12303**] is a 79-year-old left handed man with a history of right fronto-temporal anaplastic astrocytoma, atrial fibrillation, s/p ablation, DVT/PE on Lovenox, and asbetosis who presented with 30 minutes of seizure.
Patient history began on [**2155-9-28**] when he developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and MRI revealed a large mass in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
He was transferred to [**Hospital6 **] and was hospitalized there for 3 weeks, but he developed complications of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.
However, the slides from [**Hospital3 **] were reviewed in pathology and showed anaplastic astrocytoma WHO Grade III.
On the afternoon of admission (unknown exact time) at nursing home, patient was found to have generalized-tonic clonic seizure and was transferred to OSH.
There he was loaded with phosphenytoin 2400 mg and found to have pneumonia; started on vancomycin 1 gram IV and ceftriaxone and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
He had a sister who died of pneumonia while another has bladder cancer.
One brother died of lymphoma while another has skin cancer.
He has 2 sons, one has hypertension while another has Sapo syndrome.

The first abnormality suggests an acute significant abnormality in the right hemisphere predominantly frontal and probably cortical irritability in this region.
The other abnormality suggests subcortical dysfunction of the right hemisphere.
MRA [**2156-1-12**]: IMPRESSION: Subacute hematoma with edema around the hematoma in the right temporal lobe probably related to biopsy.
Diffuse T2 hyperintensity in the right frontal and temporal lobes does not enhance after contrast  administration and is similar in appearance to prior study.
Findings may represent a glioma.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Stranding and tiny hematoma surrounding the right common femoral vein.
Bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema superimposed on moderate emphysema.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 79-year-old left handed man with a history of right fronto-temporal anaplastic astrocytoma, atrial fibrillation s/p ablation, DVT/PE on Lovenox, and asbetosis who presents with a 30 minute GTC on Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was found to have pneumonia, and was started on vancomycin 1 gram IV.
Repeat CXR on admission showed diffuse prominent interstitial markings but no pneumonia, so the antibiotics were discontinued.
MRI/MRA Brain showed subacute hematoma with edema around the hematoma in the right temporal lobe probably related to biopsy, and the previously seen diffuse T2 hyperintensity in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
On examination, he was found to have right IP and quadriceps weakness consistent with femoral neuropathy, and there was palpated a 2 cm hematoma in right groin.
There was concern for an retroperitoneal bleed versus hematoma around lumbar plexus, especially given recent catheterization for atrial fibrillation ablation, as the cause of his hypotension.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma, but there was stranding and a tiny hematoma surrounding the right common femoral vein.
A repeat EEG in the NeuroICU showed right hemisphere and right frontal slowing, and an occasional isolated sharp and slow wave discharges in the right frontal region.
Patient has experienced nausea with these treatments which has responded well to compazine and low dose Zyprexa.
Of note, patient noted to have loose stool prior to discharge.
We were unable to send a stool culture for Clostridium difficile toxin and would recommend that this is done at rehabilitation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  Generalized tonic clonic seizure, anaplastic Astrocytoma Secondary:  History of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, history of atrial fibrillation now status post ablation, history of asbestosis, and history of Hepatitis C.  Discharge Condition: Stable.
If you experience fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain please contact your oncologist or primary care physician or go to the emergency department for further evaluation.
