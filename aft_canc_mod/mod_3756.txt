A CT scan on [**2125-3-2**] at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed a cecal mass and lymphadenopathy, as well as multiple hepatic lesions in both lobes of the liver.
There were six lesions in the left lobe, all but one in the medial segment, the largest measuring 3cm within Segment IV-A.
There were 10 lesions in the right lobe, the largest measuring 6.3x4.8 cm.
Serial CT scans demonstrated that there was a decrease in the size of multiple liver lesions with no new hepatic lesions and a decrease in the prominence of the cecal mass.
The right lobe volume actually decreased to 750 cc and the left lobe volume increased to 980.
Therefore, Segments I, II, and III are now 629 cc, which was predicted to provide adequate liver volume for right hepatic trisegmentectomy.
Past Medical History: PMHx: OSA, Hypercholesterolemia, BPH, depression, and an asymptomatic heart murmur (no prophylaxis for procedures)  PSH: varicocele repair, vasectomy, perianal abscess drainage   Social History: Regular diet.

The medial drain continued to be serosanguinous and had a bilirubin of 0.7.
An ERCP was performed on postoperative day #8, which showed contrast extravasation from left intrahepatic biliary duct branches at the site of resection.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was monitored overnight for signs of pancreatitis.
The his amylase and lipase were markedly elevated postprocedure, the patient was completely asymptomatic.
Also of note, the patient's pathology was returned, which showed that an omental biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma, a poor prognostic sign.
