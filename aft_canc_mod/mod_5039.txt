He had an endoscopic biliary stent placed, but developed stent failure and cholangitis.
Past Medical History: PMH: Pancreatic head mass, obstructive jaundice, RCC, CAD, ^chol, HTN PSH: R nephrectomy [**2127**], CABG [**2146**]  Social History: He stopped smoking over 40 years ago and he does not drink alcohol.

He has no scleral icterus.
CV: RRR, no murmurs.
Sternal wound well healed.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-6-4**] 3:27 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2148-6-5**] 2:58 PM IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Pt transferred back to floor on following day and unresponsive episodes did not reoccur  GI/Abd: He was NPO, with IVF and a NGT.
Event [**6-4**]: pt found unresponsive, however his vitals were stable--> stat CT head/CT torso.CT Head [**6-4**]: No evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect  CT Torso:  1.No pulmonary embolism.
Multiple pancreatic masses unchanged.
CAROTID ULTRASOUND [**6-5**]: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Neuro consult obtained: His exam was notable for anisocoria but reactive pupils and asterixis.
The asterixis indicates that there is likely a metabolic abnormality which may be the etiology of these episodes.
Infectious causes have been ruled out by negative U/A and chest CT. Seizure is very unlikely, given the closed eyes, lack of eye/head deviation, absence of motor activity, and absence of post-ictal state.
Vascular issues are also very low probability, given that he is lying in bed during the events, has a normal blood pressure, and has no other abnormalities suggesting brainstem localization on exam (other than anisocoria, but normal EOMs).
Medications may be a cause, especially the Lyrica or Neurontin.
There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
