HISTORY: Left lower lobectomy and chest wall repair, left upper lobe wedge resection.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-30**]: Left posterior air and fluid collection in the region of chest wall resection has increased in size, predominantly in the anteroposterior dimension from roughly 31 to 39 mm in diameter, still between 10.5 and 12 cm in length, and now contains a large component of fluid.
There is no appreciable layering left pleural effusion or significant pneumothorax along the other pleural margins.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the left supraclavicular soft tissues has diminished.
Small right pleural effusion is stable.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2123-8-31**] 11:13 AM Reason: eval for swallow prophiciency.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for swallow prophiciency.
INDICATIONS: 81-year-old man with left vocal cord paralysis following thoracic surgery.
TECHNIQUE: Videotaped oropharyngeal swallowing study.
Due to poor bolus control, premature spillover was observed into the piriform sinuses with thin liquids.
Laryngeal valve closure was mildly impaired, and the left vocal cord showed paralysis.
Mild penetration with sips of thin liquids was observed with spillover, but throat clearing was effective.
A moderate amount of silent aspiration was observed with multiple sips of thin liquids, related to spillover, and cough was not effective at clearance.
Also, there was reduced sensation with a lack of spontaneous cough.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aspiration with larger boluses of thin liquids, with only penetration into the vestibules seen at smaller boluses.
Paralysis of left vocal cord.
SUMMARY: Pt presents with a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia.
He demonstrated aspiration and penetration with thin liquids during the examination, however, small bolus sizes were effective at preventing aspiration when pt was focused on the swallowing task.
Pt also demonstrated deep penetration with small straw sips of thin liquids.
In consideration of pt's left vocal cord paresis, it is very likely that this is the cause of his poor valve closure and thus compromising his airway protection with larger boluses.
Therefore, based on this examination, it is recommended that pt continue with a regular PO diet with thin liquids while taking small sips of thin liquids and NO STRAWS.
Lung, left lower lobe and chest wall: Squamous cell carcinoma, see synoptic report.
New margin, lateral chest wall: Skeletal muscle, no carcinoma seen.
L10 nodes: No carcinoma seen.
L11 nodes: No carcinoma seen.
EXTENT OF INVASION  Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor of any size that directly invades any of the following: chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium; or tumor of any size in the main bronchus less than 2 cm distal to the carina but without involvement of the carina; or tumor of any size associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.

The specimen is  sectioned to reveal unremarkable fatty cut surfaces.
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 32953**] [**Name (STitle) 10165**] is as follows: "lateral chest wall margin: positive for non small cell carcinoma."
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is as follows:  "new lateral chest wall margin, negative for carcinoma."
Part 4 is additionally labeled "left lower lobe with attached chest wall" and consists of a left lower lobe of lung, portion of upper lobe, and chest wall.
The specimen has been oriented with a white suture at the superior posterior aspect of the chest wall.
The specimen is sectioned to reveal a largely necrotic tumor mass within the left lobe of the lung with extension into the soft tissue.
It comes to within less than 1 mm of the soft tissue margin, within 0.5 cm of the stapled upper lobe margin, and to within 1 cm of the bronchial and vascular resection margin.
H=vascular margin, I=stapled upper lobe margin, with adjacent nodule, J=hilar lymph nodes, K=soft tissue margin between ribs 5 and 6, L=soft tissue margin between 6 and 7, M=soft tissue margin between 6 and 7, N=soft tissue margin internal to rib 6, posteriorly on the pleural surface, O=tumor in relationship to normal lung and pleura, P=tumor with necrosis with relationship to vessels.
Part 5 is additionally labeled "L10 lymph nodes" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.4 cm anthracotic lymph node, which is bisected  and entirely submitted in cassette Q.
Part 6 is additionally labeled "L11 lymph nodes" and consists of multiple anthracotic lymph nodes measuring in aggregate 2.5 x 1 x 1 cm.
Patient's pacemaker was interrogated for abnormal rhythms and found to be normal.
[**8-27**]: Patient's L IJ CVL (3 lumen) was withdrawn 2cm because of improper placement ,patient became hoarse shortly thereafter.
