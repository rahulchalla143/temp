Admission Date:  [**2169-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-12-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6180**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis Left Subclavian central line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo male with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, on Xeloda therapy since early [**Month (only) 216**], who presented with fever and weakness.
Per pt and daughter had been having increasing SOB for last two weeks with increasing jaundice, abdonimal pain and swelling of abdomena nd LE extremities.
She has also noticed increasing jaundice over the last week.
No sick contacts, some minimally productive cough and increasing SOb and DOE although less activity.
Fevers noted at home last week, but attributed to chemo so did not come in for eval sooner and stopped xeolda which he had started [**Last Name (un) 7162**] this week.
This mornins in the ED after fluid resuciattion, he had increasing abdominal pain in RLQ.
Also had been scratching left hip mass which started bleeding today.
Abdomen became acutely distended.
Seen by surgery and plan for medical mgmt of pt with likely SBP and poor surgical candidate.
Preliminary CT abdomen showed -new left pleural effusion -marked ascites, increased since [**2169-8-14**]; new splenic infarctions; patent splenic, portal and superior mesenteric veins -bowel wall thickening likely related to ascites/low albumin; patent proximal celiac axis and SMA -unchanged liver masses; enlarged left hip mass.
Here is very thirsty, discomfort with NGT in place, short of breath, lower abdominal pain, but improved from the morning.
Past Medical History: PMHx: 1) Oncologic:  Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in [**2167**] after 1 year of RUQ abdominal pain, elevated AFP, and liver lesion noted on MRI  [**2167-5-13**] which revealed presence of a 1 x 1 cm lesion in segment 8 of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension, esophageal varices and splenomegaly.
Patient has chronic thrombocytopenia [platelet count- 47] which has been thought secondary to splenomegaly.
He was sent for US guided biopsy of the lesion in late [**2167**], however the lesion was not localizable on biopsy due to it's small size, and it was therefore decided to follow expectantly with serial CT and AFP measurements.
In early [**2168**], however, he was admitted in [**Country 651**] for an episode of hepatic decompensation, and subsequently in [**9-17**] a CT abdomen showed a new 2.5 cm mass in the liver.
In early [**2169**] he developed a mass on his L hip that was biopsy proven to be a hematoma, without malignant cells.
He tried amicar in [**4-18**], however unable to tolerate secondary to itching.
Platelet transfusions failed to elevate his platelet count significantly.
Most recent CT on [**8-21**] demonstrated an increase in size of the liver lesion to 4 x 3 cm, also with increase in soft tissue component of L hip hematoma worrisome for metastatic disease.
2) Hepatitis B 3) Nephrolithiasis 4) cholelithiasis 5) type II diabetes - Diet controlled 6) H/O Tuberculosis   Social History: Chinese immigrant, came to the US in early [**2163**].
Has 2 healthy children.
Family History: No history of hepatocellular carcinoma.
There is no pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions may be present, right greater than left.
There is no free air under the diaphragm.
Massive ascites, increased since [**2169-8-14**].
New left pleural effusion.
Generalized bowel wall edema, likely related to ascites and low albumin state.
More focal and more severe edema in the wall of the right ascending colon, which is concerning for colitis.
Interval enlargement of the mass in the soft tissues of the left thigh.
EKG: NSR at 89bom, , TWI in v1, flattening III  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo man with metastatic HCC and cirrhosis admitted with septic shock, sub fulminant hepatic failure with extensive ascites, respiratory distress and left thigh hematoma secondary to extensive malignant disease.
He was orginally treated in the ICU and was stabilized however due to his extensive malignant disease that was not amendable to treatment, it was decided that making him comfortable was the best option.
His respiratory status worsened and he was given IV morphine as needed for discomfort until the time of his death.
