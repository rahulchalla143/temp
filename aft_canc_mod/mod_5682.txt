Since then she has had a complicated course including several MICU stays for SOB at times requiring BiPAP, ultimately requiring urgent intubation on the medical floor on [**3-31**] for resp failure and somnolence thought [**1-29**] hypercarbic resp failure.
Of note, she was also hypotensive requiring levophed on [**4-19**].
She has had multiple ID issues and has been followed by ID consultants.
She has been treated for MRSA PNA, Klebsiella UTI, candidemia (c. dubliniensis) from bld cx on [**3-8**], Zoster diagnosed [**3-29**].
She complained of some shortness of breath beyond her baseline the evening of [**4-9**]; her ABG was 7.4/45/95.
This evening she again complained of shortness of breath although she was noted by the floor night float residents to be appearing somewhat more alert and in less distress than on [**4-9**].
She was transferred to the MICU for further monitoring of her respiratory status.

## Respiratory distress, hypercarbia: Bilateral pleural effusions likely contributing most to chronic dyspnea.
ABG indicates mostly compensated chronic respiratory acidosis, likely from hypoventilation, especially given methadone.
Given her history of COPD, she may have been receiving more O2 than necessary, further depressing her respiratory drive.
Pt is baseline tachypneic and is not in enough respiratory distress to warrant intubation at this time.
Bilateral pleural effusions could also easily be hiding new pneumonia vs. tracheobronchitis.
During her hospiotalization she was intubated three times for respiratory distress.
She had several bouts of ventilator associated pneumonia and sepsis requiring pressors, sputum positive for MRSA.
## Endstage liver disease - From hepatitis C. Now with hepatocellular carcinoma.
