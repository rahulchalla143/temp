Patient was transferred on [**2165-12-24**] after prolonged course at OSH requiring multiple endovascular and open surgical procedures for left common iliac aneurysm and associated complications of retroperitoneal hematoma and femoral embolus.
During this course, patient had intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and nausea, but not very bothersome.
Patient reports that prior to her surgeries, she visited the ER several times for abdominal pain and nausea, with occasional vomiting of bilious fluid.
During her current admission, CT scan performed to evaluate her hematoma and surgical sites revealed significant small bowel dilation.
A concurrent work up for possible periampullary mass prompted NGT placement for decompression and subsequent ERCP.
She remains without abdominal pain.
She denies recent constipation, change in stool caliber, melena, and malaise.

Patient had a prolonged ileus and intestinal, colonic and left ureteral compression by the hematoma, finally requiring an exploratory laparotomy with Hartmann's procedure.
On POD1 patient had acute ischemia to bilateral lower extremities and CTA showing occlusion of the aortobifem graft, needing to go emergently to the OR for ax-bifem bypass graft to revascularize the lower extremities.
Postoperatively patient did poorly with persistent pressor requirements, progressive renal failure, liver failure and possibly a spinal cord infarct not able to move the lower extremities.
On POD 3 from the last operation patient was not making substancial improvements and given the multiorgan failure and poor overall prognosis, the family decided to make her CMO.
