No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**5-12**] CTA head- 1)  Large left middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from just above the carotid bifurcation to and throughout the left middle cerebral artery.
2)  No evidence of dissection, aneurysm, or occlusion within the right carotid artery, right and left vertebral arteries, and the remainder of the vessels of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (estimated ejection fraction ?35-40%).
No apical thrombus is seen (however the apical aneurysm is a potential cause of thromboembolism).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] Year old woman presents with global aphasia, left eye deviation and right hemiparesis and NIHSS ~22 treated with tPA.
Repeat CT scan on [**5-13**] showed evolving left MCA infarct, small vessel disease and chronic left parietoccipital infarct.
CTA revealed a distal left ICA thrombus that extended in the M1 segment of the left MCA.
Her exam did not improve after tPA and she remained unresponsive with with flacid right hemiparesis.
Per daughter the patient had been on coumadin in the past and repeat TTE revealed an apical aneurysm with telemetry no revealing any atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin was initially held for placement of PEG on [**5-15**] but plan was made for NO anticoagulation due to the patient's poor prognosis and risk of bleeding.
Given poor prognosis for functional recovery, episodes of apnea, and hypoperfusion of extremities, her daughter decided to transfer the patient to hospice for comfort care.
