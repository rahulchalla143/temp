Admission Date:  [**2105-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-3-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Right ventricular infarct  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra-aortic balloon pump  History of Present Illness: 62 yo M with K-ras WT moderately-differentiated mixed carcinoid/mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma metastatic to peritoneum with peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, iritecan and most recently C3D15 Cetuximab ([**2105-11-26**]), s/p colonic stent placement [**2105-12-7**] for malignant obstruction, also s/p LRD-Renal Xplant [**2080**], HCV, x-fer from [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital1 **] for management of large inferior wall STEMI with BMS to prox RCA, with revascularization resulting in TIMI-1 flow caused by cardiogenic shock.
Pt was hypotensive during procedure  requiring pressors due to large infarct of his right-dominant system, on Dopamine, Levo and Neo, with IABP in place and temporary pacer.
Per pt's wife, he had been complaining o intermittent abdominal pain for several days with recent [**Hospital1 2025**] admissions (discharged [**11-30**] and [**12-16**]) for management of colonic obstruction, first with NGT decompression, then with palliative stenting (on [**12-7**]).
He again complained of severe abdominal pain radiating to his back, nausea and vomiting, so was taken to local ED in [**Location (un) 47**] for evaluation.
Initial EKGs showed ST elevations in II,III,AVF concerning for inferior STEMI so pt was taken emergently to catheterization lab where 100% thrombotic proximal occlusion to large dominant RCA was seen.
Cath showed R-dominant system w/ 100% prox thrombotic occlusion in RCA and 90% culprit stenosis in proximal to mid vessel treated with single BMS.
As pt was progressively bradycardic thorughout procedure, temporary pacing wire was placed via R femoral vein.
On arrival to CCU, pt was intubated but not sedated, unresponsive to commands or painful stimuli, had bilateral fixed blown pupils, mottled skin, and cold extremities.
On the floor, he is not responsive to verbal or tactile stimulation.
Pathology from the procedure showed a mixed tumor containing carcinoid and adenocarcinoma invading the appendiceal wall and penetrating through the visceral peritoneum (pT4) with perineural and venous invasion.
An MRI of the abdomen on [**2100-6-6**] showed fatty infiltration of the liver, but no evidence of metastatic disease.
Pathology showed goblet cell carcinoma in the mesenteric fat and a <2 mm focus of GIST in the cecal wall near appendiceal stump.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] was treated with weekly adjuvant 5-FU and leucovorin from [**0-0-0**], but treatment was discontinued after five weeks because of diarrhea and an increase in his creatinine.
In [**1-/2104**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] reports developing abdominal pain and hematochezia.
Later that month, he became increasingly fatigued and anemic despite using Procrit.
A colonoscopy on [**2104-2-18**] showed a partially circumferential 3-cm mass located 11-13 cm proximal to the anus which appeared to be a metastatic lesion growing through the bowel rather than a primary lesion.
A CT scan of the abdomen on [**2104-2-24**] revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis most evident in the omentum, a small amount of ascites, and rectal wall thickening consistent with the mass seen on colonoscopy.
A chest x-ray on [**2-27**] was negative, and on [**2104-2-29**], a percutaneous biopsy of an omental lesion revealed moderately differentiated metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastatic colon cancer.
Renal failure was due to E. coli infection.
Hepatitis C Osteoarthritis Benign brain tumor which caused partial paralysis of the face on the right side.
No coffee or alcohol or tobacco.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the inferior septum.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is prominent ascites.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal RCA distribution leading to RV infarction as well).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
CARDIOGENIC SHOCK- Etiology of cardiogenic shock is large RV infarct (proximal RCA) of a large R-dominant system, leading to hypotension that requires use of 3 vasopressors.
Pt initially unresponsive w/ fixed dilated pupils b/l, repeat exam w/ some purposeful movement, pt able to squeeze hands b/l and wiggle toes b/l on command.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS- [**3-17**] lactic acidosis as lactate >7 from ischemia and hypotension.
MUCINOUS APPENDICEAL ADENOCARCINOMA- mixed carcinoid/mucinous tumor metastatic to peritoneum, (peritoneal carcinomatosis) s/p FOLFOX, FOLFIRI and irinotecan/cetuximab (stopped for diarrhea and disease progression, respectively).
Per Heme/Onc fellow pt's disease has progressed beyond further chemotherapeutic options and likely focus will be on palliative efforts.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE- Chronic allograft nephropathy now complicated by multifactorial acute renal insufficiency, with recent chemotherapeutic regimen nephrotoxicity combined with decreased renal perfusion from hypotension [**3-17**] inferior wall MI and cardiogenic shock contributing to acute decompensation.
