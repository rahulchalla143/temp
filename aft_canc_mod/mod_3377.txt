She was started on broad antibiotic coverage in the ED for a suspected aspiration-related pneumonia since she is a clear aspiration risk.
CXR on admission demonstrated trace left pleural effusion, but no pneumonia.
On discharge, patient remained afebrile with WBC count trending down and with O2 sats in high 90s on room air.
She was discharged without any antibiotics given no suspicion for pneumonia.
# Hypernatremia and hypokalemia:  Electrolyte imbalances secondary to poor PO intake.
# Hypertension: It seems unlikely that she is able to take her PO anti-hypertensives (HCTZ and amlodipine), but she is also on clonidine, which seems to be keeping her relatively well-controlled.
She was mildly hypertensive in the ICU.
# Goals of care re: Multi-infarct/vascular dementia and metastatic GB carcinoma:  Patient is non-responsive and non-verbal at baseline.
Family reported that her condition was worse this AM compared to now.
compliance with PO medications given difficulty swallowing  Discharge Medications: 1. clonidine 0.3 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly Sig: One (1) Patch Weekly Transdermal QTHUR (every Thursday).
4. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.

Chest X-ray showed fluid around the lung on the left side, but no definite pneumonia.
The lab tests showing dehydration also improved after receiving the IV fluids.
