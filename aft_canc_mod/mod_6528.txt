Skin Biopsy [**2126-5-13**]: DIAGNOSIS: Skin, left abdomen, punch biopsy (A):     Vacuolar interface dermatitis with satellite cell necrosis and scattered eosinophils (see note).
Note: The findings raise a histologic differential diagnosis that includes acute graft versus host disease and a drug eruption.
Features consistent with involvement by acute graft vs. host disease; see note.

Features consistent with involvement by acute graft vs. host disease; see note.
No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
Features consistent with involvement by acute graft vs. host disease; see note.
No viral inclusions identified on immunostain for CMV.
Note: The biopsies demonstrate focally prominent crypt apoptoses, rare crypt abscess, and focal cryptitis with only a mild associated mixed inflammatory infiltrate, consistent with involvement by acute GVHD.
Cardiac silhouette exaggerated by a mild pectus deformity is top normal size.
There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or evidence of central adenopathy.
This may have no clinical significance but is sometimes seen when thrombus develops at the tip of the catheter.
Unilateral Upper Extremity U/S [**2126-5-8**]: Within this limitation, the right internal jugular vein, axillary vein, brachial veins x 2 and basilic veins were all patent.
Limited views of the right subclavian vein were obtained due to patient's bandage.
The vein appears to be patent but the useful assessment for clot cannot be made.
Chest radiograph from [**2126-5-8**] showed the tip to lie over the region of the brachiocephalic confluence or proximal SVC.
Venogram demonstrating no clot in the inferior portion of the right brachiocephalic vein and in the SVC.
Differential diagnosis includes inflammatory, infectious and ischemic etiology.
No evidence of free fluid, free air or pneumatosis.
Bilateral renal hypodensities.
1.5-cm pericardial effusion.
MRI Head W and W/O Contrast [**2126-5-11**]: FINDINGS: There are scattered areas of white matter hyperintensity on the FLAIR images in both the deep and subcortical white matter.
These suggest chronic small vessel ischemia.
The remainder of the brain appears normal with no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
There are no diffusion abnormalities.
There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia.
No evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, or infection.
Chest Radiograph [**2126-5-13**]: IMPRESSION: No change or evidence of acute pneumonia.
Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
New widespread interstitial opacities are likely due to acute interstitial edema.
CT Head W/O Contrast [**2126-5-17**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Liver/GB Ultrasound [**2126-5-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is interval development of left lower lobe opacity that is concerning for infectious process.
New extra-hepatic biliary ductal dictation.
No evidence of choledocholithiasis in the visualized portions, however the head of the pancreas and distal common bile duct are not well visualized.
It is seen to the level of the ampulla, with no definite stone.
Abnormal appearance of small bowel loops in the right lower quadrant and distention of the splenic flexure of the colon.
These findings may be related to graft versus host disease.
No central pulmonary embolus.
Severe respiratory motion limits evaluation of the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, especially in the lower lobes.
Multifocal pulmonary opacities, predominently ground glass, with areas of consolidation in the bases.
While these findings are consistent with given history of pneumonia, drug toxicity or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia could have a similar appearance   CXR [**2126-6-18**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-14**], there is increasing opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac area, as well as some increasing opacification at the right base.
This is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of a developing pneumonia  [**6-23**] RENAL U.S.
PORT; DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Markedly limited Doppler examination, probable gross venous patency although if renal vein thrombus were of significant clinical concern then CT or MR would better evaluate.
Echo [**2126-6-24**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
There is now evidence of impaired ventricular filling.
However, the patient is now ventilated with a high PEEP which may explain these findings.
Increasing intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No cholelithiasis or stone seen within the proximal or mid CBD, but  visualization of distal CBD is limited.
Distended gallbladder with interval appearance of sludge and questionable gallbladder wall edema.
The findings are nonspecific given hypoproteinemia and biliary distention but acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded; HIDA scan could be performed for further evaluation of biliary tract function.
[**6-29**] Echo Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is very brief right atrial invagination, but no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Right ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction.
Right-sided central venous catheter, nasogastric tube, left IJ central venous catheter, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male who presented on D+27 of matched unrelated donor non-myeloblative allogeneic stem cell transplant with worsening GVHD and weakness found to have worsening acute GVHD.
# Acute Graft Versus Host Disease: The patient presented with worsening rash but no diarrhea and normal bilirubin and transaminases.
As his rash had not improved on prednisone and he was having primarily weakness and some mental status changes at presentation concern for severe, acute GVHD was low and concern for infection was much higher.
Unfortunately, within the first five days of presentation the patient developed severe diarrhea with >1500 ml of stool per day.
This led to strong suspicion of acute GVHD being the primary cause of his presentation and symptoms and the patient was put on 1 mg/kg methyprednisolone on [**2126-5-13**] and made NPO.
GI biopsies were performed on [**2126-5-15**] with flexible sigmoidoscopy, which were consistent with GVHD and negative for CMV while skin biopsies of his rash from [**5-13**] were non-dignostic.
Bilirubin peaked at 7.3 on [**5-25**] but then began to fall along with the patient having decreased volume of diarrhea and improving rash.
His symptoms continued to worsen, along with increasing of his LFTs.
ERCP was held off secondary to respiratory issues.
# Weakness/Cough: At presentation the outpatient oncologist was quite concerned these symptoms could indicate occult infection given the patient was less than 1 month post transplant.
Culture data remained unrevealing and UA and chest radiograph were benign and and respiratory viral screen was unremarkable.
On [**2126-5-17**] the patient was briefly febrile and had rigors so cipro/metronidazole was discontinued and vancomycin/ pipercillin-tazobactam were started for empiric coverage of a possible enteric infection.
These were briefly restarted after another fever on [**5-23**] but weaned off by [**5-26**] as once again cultures remained negative and no source of fevers were found.
The patient remained afebrile thereafter, until [**2126-6-15**] when he spiked a temp and was started on cefepime and vancomycin for suspected pulmonary source.
The patient's respiratory symptoms quickly progressed.
A CT of the chest was performed on [**2126-6-17**] which showed bilateral infiltrates.
Was intubated due to hypoxia and SOB.
Found to have parainfluenza on viral culture.
Also found to have highly positive PCR in blood for adenovirus, and was started on cidofovir on [**6-21**] with pretreatement of renal protection with probenicid.
Also had sputum and mini-BAL from [**6-20**] and [**6-21**] showing GNRs identified as STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA sensitive to SMX TMP.
BMT decreased steriods, cellcept and cyclosporine due to infection.
# Respiratory Distress: On the evening of [**2126-5-17**] while having his hickman changed the patient developed acute shortness of breath during the procedure associated with an anxiety attack.
The patient is quite claustrophobic and reacted poorly to being placed for the procedure but also developed brief hypoxia that resolved with supplementary O2.
Chest radiograph from the time of the procedure showed interstitial edema and it seems likely the patient had flash pulmonary edema in the context of volume overload and being placed flat.
The patient had another episode of respiratory distress on [**2126-6-17**] after being diagnosed with bilateral multifocal pneumonia.
He became acutely hypoxic and was transferred to the medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) as above on [**2126-6-18**].
On [**6-30**], his respiratory status declined and he had worsening acidosis and hypoxia.
Pt gradually became bradycardic.
On exam, pt had no pupillary reflexes, breath sounds, or heart tones.
# Hypotension: During ICU stay patient developed hypotension.
Patient was started on Levophed for support, which was transitioned over to Phenylephrine due to tachycardia.
Etiology of hypotension most likely sepsis from infections as described above.
Patient was weaned off pressors but then became hypotensive and pressors were restarted.
# Acute Renal Failure: Patient developed renal failure following cidovir dose which is a known nephrotoxin.
Renal ultrasound was preformed which demonstrated no obstruction.
Renal failure did not improve significantly throughout his ICU stay, .
# Confusion: On presentation the patient's wife was concerned about mild deficites in memory and concern about his mental status.
Imaging of the head (CT and MRI) were benign and these deficits resolved over his first 3-4 days in the hospital so no further work up was pursued.
Most likely this represented delirium in the setting of acute illness.
# Cardiac status: The patient intermittently complained of dyspnea, particularly when standing up though he had no problems with laying flat.
His BB was weaned down over concern his dyspnea could have been due to difficulty augmenting his cardiac output in the context of standing with beta blockade but this wasn't particularly helpful.
Ultimately, there was suspciion his shortness of breath was primarily due to deconditioning/anxiety once other pernicious etiologies were excluded.
In the ICU, pt had afib with RVR, tx with amiodarone.
# Myelofibrosis s/p BMT: The patient's counts remained relatively stable throughout his hospitalization with low platelets and relatively stable anemia but no leukopenia or neutropenia.
There continued to be abnormal forms in his peripheral smear presumed due to his myelophthisic process (despite this GVHD and resolution of his previous splenomegaly both suggest significant graft versus tumor effect).
# Hematochezia: After his flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies the patient had hematochezia for the following two days.
He remained hemodynamically stable and anemia did not worsen during his hematochezia.
# Hypertension: The patient initially required increased nifedipine dosing in the context of his increased steroid dosing and secondary worsening of hypertension.
During [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay patient became hypotensive and all outpatient HTN medications were held.
# Pain: The patient has chronic low back pain secondary to degenerative joint disease.
# Prophylaxis: On presentation the patient was on voriconazole for fungal prophylaxis as there was concern fluconazole had worsened his rash.
Acyclovir was briefly stopped out of concern it contributed to rash but he remained on this throughout most of his hospitalization for viral prophylaxis.
He never demonstrated signs or symptoms of herpes reactivation.
