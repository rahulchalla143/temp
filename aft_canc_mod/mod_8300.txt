History of Present Illness: The patient is an 88M with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and recurrent left sided pleural effusions.
He states that he had a chest xray done in his rehabd center recently, which showed recurrent left pleural effusion, and was taken to the ED for care.
At this point, the patient says he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation for possible surgical treatment.
Available records indicated that he had been started on levaquin and fluconazole, as well as a prednisone taper.
The patient has a L cephalic PICC line in place, that he says was placed while he was at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital because he needed blood draws and IV fluids/medications.

Blood cultures x 6 no growth Urine cultures no growth  Imaging: CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2117-4-13**] 1:17 AM: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now a severe left-sided pleural effusion that occupies more than half of the left hemithorax.
Subsequent left basal atelectasis and blunting of the cardiopulmonary interface.
At the left lung bases, the pre-existing opacities have minimally increased in extent.
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2117-4-16**] 4:36 PM: The left hemithorax is not completely opacified with complete collapse of the left lung and likely adjacent pleural effusion.
Completely collapsed stomach, with loop of transverse colon interposed between the greater curvature and the anterior abdominal wall.
Dense consolidation at the left lung base, incompletely imaged.
Small right pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4 cm, and spanning approximately 5.7 cm craniocaudal.
Atrophic kidneys.
Marked degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
Again there is opacification on the left consistent with pleural fluid.
In addition, there is substantial volume loss with some shift of the mediastinum to the left.
Some of this apparent shift may be due to the combination of scoliosis and mild obliquity of the patient   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted from OSH with recurrent left pleural effusions s/p thoracentesis showing hemothorax.
GS showed 2+PMNs, no micros, and culture was negative at OSH.
Post op CXR showed a complete white out of his left hemithorax c/w proximal mucous plug.
Subsequent flex bronchoscopy showed mucous plugging in multiple left lobes.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without bradycardia or desat.
His pain was well controlled during most of his hospital stay.
It was quite obvious that he had difficulty clearing his secretion giving his overall nutritional and functional poor status.
On POD3 patient had worsening aeration on CXR, particularly on the left, with increasing supp O2 requirement.
Underwent a bedside bronch showing thick mucous plugging bilat.
BAL ultimately grew OP flora and therefore was nondiagnostic.
On POD4 patient continued to have difficulty clearing excessive secretions, and again had consolidated L lower lobe.
Multiple thick mucous plugs were removed by bedside bronch.
On POD7, Vanc and zosyn were started despite previous negative cultures given high probability of LLL aspiration PNA.
Subsequent CXRs showed mild worsening of LLL consolidation quite similar to pre bronch imaging during the prior week.
At this point it was quite clear that his poor respiratory status was not going to improve quickly.
Patient did require lasix intermittently for mild volume overload as evidenced by exam and pulmonary edema on CXRs.
GI:  Patient failed a speech and swallow eval post op.
Patient was started on vanc/zosyn POD7 given persistent LLL consolidation concerning for aspiration PNA despite prior negative BALs.
His incisions were without erythema or significant drainage.
Post op patient continued to have elevated INR requiring vit k supplementation.
A hematology c/s was obtained for thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
His thrombocytopenia is from a chronic myelodysplasia (prior BM bx at OSH) currently followed by his outpatient hematologist.
No new recs.
They agreed that his elevated INR was likely related to severe nutritional deficiency requiring vit k supplements and TFs.
He received 2u platelets and 1uPRBCs POD9 given anemia and a small amount of hemoptysis following suctioning.
Patient had severe nutritional deficiency with FTT prior to presentation.
He did have mild hypernatremia post op successfully managed by D5W and late free H20 boluses via the gtube.
