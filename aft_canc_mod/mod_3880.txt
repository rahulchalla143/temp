Hypoxia--We thought that her hypoxia was a result of her gettting a small dose of Dilaudid after having taken a questionable amount of methadone and benzodiazapines recently and even in the EW.
LBP-We controlled her pain with NSAIDS and the pain service reommended that she be discharged with a small amount of oxycodone along with close follow up with the pain clinic at [**Hospital6 **].
She was thought to have questionable borderline personality disorder along with probable narcotic dependence since she had been prescribed 40 pills on [**12-5**] and one week later the bottle was empty.
She had also been acquiring narcotics from two sources in direct violation of her narcotic contract.
In light of this opiod overdose we thus decided it best that the patient obtain all of her care at [**Hospital6 **] to which the patient was in agreement.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
The patient was suspected to have obstructive sleep apnea as she required CPAP at night.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: [**2-19**] Capsules PO bid prn as needed for constipation.
Morbid Obesity.
