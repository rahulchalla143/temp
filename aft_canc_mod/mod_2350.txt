She reports photophobia without scotomata.
She denies any neurologic symptoms including numbness/tingling of arms or legs, slurring of speech, or facial asymmetry.
CT head was performed and did not demonstrate any acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Cardiac enzymes were sent due to mild lateral ST segment depressions; CK was 30 with troponin 0.25 (no prior in our system).
She received morphine 2 mg X 2 for pain as well as aspirin 325 mg X 1. .
She denies nausea or vomiting.
ROS: She reports recent diarrhea and right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
She says that her recent hospitalization for shortness of breath was complicated by constipation for one week.
She has also had intermittent right upper quadrant pain without an obvious trigger.
She denies any chest pain or palpitations.
She denies dysuria and hematuria.
Past Medical History: * Type I DM - since [**2098**] * ESRD on HD (MWF in [**Hospital1 789**]) * Pulmonary embolism on coumadin (diagnosed 1 month prior per patient) * Hypertension * Hyperlipidemia * Retinal detachment L eye * bilateral cataracts   Social History: The patient lives at home with her parents and younger sister.
Family History: No history of headaches or migraines.
Physical Exam: PE: T: 97 BP: 148/103 HR: 91 RR: 17 O2 98% on 2L NC Gen: Pleasant, young female in no acute distress HEENT: PERRL on right, L eye opacified.
No scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor.
No thyromegaly.
Difficulty with flexion of the neck, reports pain in left ribcage and cannot touch chin to chest even with passive flexion.
Soft systolic murmur at the LLSB.
LUNGS: crackles which clear with cough at the bilateral bases.
ABD: Soft, no organomegaly.
+ tenderness to palpation in right upper quadrant, negative [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
Also reports tenderness to palpation in epigastrium.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and cerebral atrophy.
Phthisis bulbi of the left globe.
Near complete opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally.
No acute hemorrhage.
PARATHYROID ULTRASOUND [**2116-9-24**]: No enlarged parathyroid gland identified.
2 hour delayed pinhole image shows washout of activity from the thyroid with no persistent focus in the neck.
Sestamibi uptake indicates tissue with high blood flow.
In light of the clinical scenario this would most likely represent a mediastinal parathyroid adenoma.
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with an anterior mediastinal parathyroid adenoma.
No persistent uptake identified in the neck.
Hilar fullness is significantly decreased from prior exam.
A small left pleural effusion is stable in size.
Stable, small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 20 y/o F with ESRD secondary to type I DM on HD here with headache X 6 days.
# Hypertensive emergency:  The patient presented to ED with BP of 190s/100s and was initially started on a nitroprusside drip.
This was switched to a nitroglyercin drip in the ED due to her renal failure and concern for cyanide toxicity.
# Headache:  The patient presented with a severe [**10-14**] headache, neck stiffness, nausea and photophobia.
She received two non-contrast head CTs which were negative for acute hemmorhage.
On presentation she was anticoagulated for pulmonary embolism with coumadin and her INR was elevated.
There was no blood found in the CSF and preliminary cultures have been negative.
She received zofran and compazine for nausea with good improvement.
Upon discharge, her headache had completely resolved.
# Type I Diabetes Mellitus.
Patient has long standing type I diabetes.
Her lantus was decreased given concern for hypoglycemia initially but was quickly increased back to her usual dose.
She has diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.
She may well have a component of diabetic gastroparesis as well given her persistent nausea with PO intake.
# Anemia: On presentation the patient's hematocrit was 32.7.
This was intitially thought to be secondary to dilution as all cell lines were decreased.
Iron studies were consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation.
The patient has not been getting erythropoetin at her dialysis sessions because of her hypertension.
Patient has low grade temperatures with hemodialysis on two occasions with the highest being 101.6.
No source of infection was found on blood cultures or on chest X-ray.
This should be followed closely the next time she goes for hemodialysis with obvious concern for a line infection.
# Hypercalcemia.
She underwent a nuclear medicine scan which showed an affected area in her mediastinal region suggesting a single mediastinal parathyroid adenoma.
Patient has nausea and vomiting for past day.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to headache and hypertension.
The patient was started on reglan PRN for nausea/vomiting, and nausea was subsequently controlled with no further need for antiemetics.
# ESRD secondary to type I DM.
# Hyperkalemia.
Hyperkalemia improved with dialysis.
# History of pulmonary embolism.
The patient was continued on Coumadin but held on occasion due to supratherapeutic INR.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for headache for 10 doses.
Prochlorperazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea for 10 doses.
Disp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: vna of care [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  Hypertensive urgency, headache Secondary: DM type I, End Stage Renal Disease on hemodialysis, hyperparathyroidism - parathyroid adenoma, hypercalcemia, Pulmonary embolism on coumadin, hyperlipidemia, Retinal detachment L eye, bilateral cataracts   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile and tolerating oral medication and nutrition.
Discharge Instructions: You have been hospitalized for severe headache and uncontrolled hypertension associated with nausea and vomiting.
You have been evaluated with imaging of your head that did not reveal any abnormalities and lab tests to monitor your electrolytes and check for infection.
While you were in the hospital you were found to have a brief fever on two episodes after hemodialysis.
You had an elevated INR (or Coumadin level) while you were in the hospital.
Because you had high levels of calcium in your blood, some of your medications were changed to help lower this level.
More importantly, you had a special X-ray done (or nuclear medicine/sestimibi scan) which showed that you have what is likely a benign tumor (called a parathyroid adenoma) in your neck which is causing this elevated level.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 40069**] should you notice fever, shaking chills, headache not controlled by medication, or inability to tolerate adequate oral fluid intake.
Or, for any other symptoms for which you are concerned.
Follow-up with your Endocrinologist in the next 1-2 weeks to discuss further management of your hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia.
