Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2113-1-26**]:  Right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with en bloc right upper lobe posterior segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] is a 58-year-old gentleman who was found to have a right lower lobe mass.
This workup initially began in the summer but he had a delay before he had been referred here for thoracic surgical evaluation.
He was admitted following right video-assisted thoracotomy right lower lobectomy   Past Medical History: Diabetes Hypertension  Social History: Lives in [**Location 2498**].

Lung volumes have minimally decreased.
There is no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
[**2113-2-1**]: There is a subsequent increase in severity of the pre-existing massive parenchymal opacities, predominating at the left lung apex and the right lung base.
No opacities have newly appeared.
Slightly decreasing is the large right lateral chest wall air inclusion.
Status post right lower lobe lobectomy and right upper lobe posterior segmentectomy.
Acute pulmonary embolism originating at the ligated right lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into the right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
Diffuse bilateral honeycombing which is new since [**12-6**].
Right-sided subcutaneous edema.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal inferior septum, akinesis of the basal inferior free wall, and dyskinesis of the basal posterior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] was taken to the operating room on [**2113-1-26**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with en bloc right upper lobe posterior segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, for a right upper lobe mass.
Neuro: The patient was initially on dilaudid PCA for pain which was transitioned to oral tylenol, dilaudid, tizanidine.
On POD 4, tizandine was increased but stopped secondary to hypotension and dilaudid changed to oxycodone with good control.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers and mucolytics along with lasix, were continued for lung opacification which had appearance of infection vs. inflammation.
Despite optimum medical management on the floor the patient became increasingly hypoxic and confused on [**2113-1-30**].
He developed respiratory failure with oxygen saturations of 70% 6L NC.
A CTA revealed right middle lobe pulmonary embolus.
Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia 100-120's and lopressor was titrated.
On [**2-1**] he had brief episode of atrial fibrillation 150's with hypotension.
Lopressor was continued, amiodarone stopped secondary pulmonary side effect.
Foley removed [**1-30**] he voided without difficulty.
ID: Emperic Vancomycin and Cefipime were started [**2113-1-31**] but discontinued on [**2113-2-2**] since he had no fevers or leukocytosis.
