There is a small amount of postoperative pneumocephalus and a minimal postoperative hemorrhage at the surgical bed.
There is no significant mass effect, shift of normally midline structures.
Small pneumocephalus is also present along the left frontal lobe.
IMPRESSION: Anticipated postoperative pneumocephalus and minimal hemorrhage at the post-left parietal craniectomy surgical bed.
Preop MRI: There is an enhancing lesion within the left posterior parietal lobe.

There is no change in edema seen.
No acute infarct is identified.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal white matter are unchanged and indicate mild changes of small vessel disease.
Subtle residual enhancement is seen at the deeper portion of the surgical cavity and along the medial aspect.
Pneumocephalus and postoperative blood products are seen.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or acute infarct.
