/ Theophylline / Nystatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p Cardiac Catheterization (stable CAD, no intervention)   History of Present Illness: 76 year old female with history of CAD status post CABG in [**2145**] (SVG-LAD/D1), CHF (EF 30%), DM2, [**Hospital 109679**] transferred from [**Hospital1 56809**] for consideration of cardiac cath.
The patient says that 2 nights prior to admission, while straining to have a bowel movement she suddenly became short of breath.
She describes associated chest pain over her left precordium without radiation, as well as bilateral shoulder pain, abdominal pain, and back pain.
She did have associated dizziness and diaphoresis, as well as nausea and vomiting.
On arrival at Sturdy, she had mild rales, with CXR demonstrating mild CHF.
EKG demonstrated old LBBB, without new ST/T changes.
Unfortunately no documentation is provided for the proceding 36 hours, however per report from the family, over the course of the following day she experienced several episodes of shortness of breath associated with chest pain.
She was thought to be having episodes of acute pulmonary edema and was given extra doses of bumetanide.
On the night of [**7-15**], however, her shortness of breath was severe enough to require ICU transfer for BIPAP initiation.
It was eventually decided to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization to rule out ischemia.
Of note, about 1 month ago her cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] cut her bumetanide dose in half secondary to rising creatinine, and her aldactone was discontinued completely secondary to hyperkalemia.
Also of note, P-MIBI in [**4-17**] revealed a fixed large severe defect in the LAD territory, as well as a reversible small mild defect in the PDA territory.
She underwent catheterization in [**6-17**] which demonstrated an unchanged chronic 90% lesion in the non-dominant proximal RCA, diffuse disease in the LAD with a 50-60% mid-distal lesion, with likely total occlusion of D2, as well as diffuse disease in the LCx and LPDL.
No intervention was performed.
[**2154**]: CATH:  Patient presented with recurrent angina and underwent catherization, which revealed moderate LAD disease, a 60-70% OM stenosis, and a 90% stenosis proximally in a diminutive non-dominant RCA.
Subsequently, patient underwent relook procedure and found to have patent DCA site.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal, anterior and mid and apical lateral and apical inferolateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis.
Fixed, large, severe defect involving the LAD territory.
Reversible, small, mild defect involving the PDA territory.
Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis and anterior and apical akinesis.
[**6-17**] CATH:  Patient admitted to outside hospital for CHF excaerbation and underwent cardiac catherization.
The cath showed the following results: LMCA demonstrated a 30% mid vessel stenosis, the LAD showed diffuse disease throughout the vessel with a mid-distal 50-60% lesion along with a likely total occlusion of the D2, the LCX showed diffuse plaguing with a 30% stenosis at two hinge points in the major inferolateral OM, the LPDA and LPL were small in diameter with diffuse disease, and the RCA was a very small non-dominant vessel with a chronic 90% proximal lesion.
Resting hemodynamic measurements showed elevated right and left filling pressures (mean RA 8mm Hg / mean PCWP 18mm Hg / LVEDP 25mm Hg)and mild pulmonary hypertension pulmonary artery pressure 48/17.
2) CHF:  Last echo [**4-17**] with resting regional wall motion abnormalities including septal, anterior and mid and apical lateral and apical inferolateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis, EF 30%.
3) DM2 4) Hypercholesterolemia 5) Lower extremity DVT x 2, last > 1 year ago 6) Anxiety disorder 7) Cataracts 8) Metastatic breast cancer to ribs, vertebrae, and pelvis.
9) Status post cholecystectomy [**70**]) Pulmonary nodule   Social History: Denies any smoking history, occasional alcohol, no IVDU.
Family History: + CAD at the age of 70 in her father.
LUNGS: Mild rales at the bases bilaterally.
GROIN:  No bruits.
EXTR:  No edema.

Left axis deviation Left bundle branch block with ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing, no significant change .
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include the akinesis of the apical portion of the LV with anteroseptal and mid inferior wall akinesis 3.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-14**], no obvious change in wall motion or overall EF.
MRA ([**2167-7-17**]): No significant renal artery stenosis bilaterally, however, the distal renal arteries are not well seen due to patient motion.
Small posterior plaque just beyond the ostium of the left renal artery, but only estimated to represent a 5% stenosis.
Dilated biliary tree without definite cause.
Osseous metastatic disease.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrated no significant change in her coronary lesions.
Specifically the right coronary artery demonstrated a 70% proximal lesion with normal flow in the distal portion of the vessel.
The LAD demonstrated mild disease with a 50% mid vessel lesion along with a totally occluded D2.
The LCX also demonstrated mild disease throughout the vessel.
Limited hemodynamics demonstrated a mildly elevated central pressure (140/50 mmHg).
Small nonobstructing bilateral renal stones .
No acute change from multiple prior studies.
No evidence of new intra-abdominal/thoracic infection.
Unchanged sclerotic lesions in bone and prior radiation in right lung apex.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old female with history of CAD status post CABG in [**2145**] (SVG-LAD/D1), CHF (EF 30%), DM2, [**Hospital 109679**] transferred from [**Hospital1 56809**] for consideration of cardiac cath in the setting of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and chest pain, thought to be acute pulmonary edema.
1) Dyspnea/chest pain:  Story consistent with episodes of acute pulmonary edema, likely attributable to worsening diastolic dysfunction in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension.
Her episodes occur frequently in the setting of valsalva/straining, with acute increase in afterload.
Unstable angina thought possible, though less likely, given the p-MIBI about 1 year prior with a large fixed defect in the LAD territory and only a mild reversible defect in the PDA territory.
An echo was done ([**2167-7-17**]) prior to cath which showed no new changes except mild increased elevation PA pressure.
She was evaluated for renal artery stenosis as a cause of her recurrent acute pulmonary edema by MRA, which demonstrated no stenotic arteries.
Cath showed no new lesions and no further intervention was recommended.
On [**2167-7-21**], patient experienced additional episodes of chest pain, but unlikely to be of cardiac origin.
EKG taken during episode showed no new changes.
Etiology likely due to anxiety, metastatic breast cancer or GI disease, which could be further worked up as an outpatient.
2) Febrile episode x 2 recorded on [**2167-7-19**].
Given her prior history of S. Aureus in her cultures, patient was sent for renal ultrasound, which was negative for renal abscess.
Additionally, TTE done on [**2167-7-20**] indicated no valvular diseases.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] those cultures are positive, it may be advisable to have her Port-A-Cath changed.
3) Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine at baseline of 1.5, clearance is approximately 30.
On the morning of [**7-18**], patient experienced episode of hypotension after am dose of hypertension meds.
Patient experienced an additional hypotensive episode and has been discontinued off Bumex.
Due to elevated PTT (>150), heparin had been withheld.
However, it was determined that access (Port-A-Cath) contributed to falsley elevated PTT and access was established on dorsum of hand.
6) Pancytopenia:  All cell lines are depressed at baseline, possibly secondary to chemo versus MDS.
Procrit discontinued on [**2167-7-20**] due to febrile episodes x2.
The patient's oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109680**] recommended a torso CT scan with contrast to evaluate for possible additional metastases and other pathology.
8)Regurgitation: Throughout hospitalization, patient had episodes of regurgitation after eating.
CT scan indicated no new lesions.
Exemestane 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO qHS () as needed for breast cancer.
