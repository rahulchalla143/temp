History of Present Illness: 59 y/o M with severe COPD and lung cancer s/p left VATS + wedge resection X 2 ([**2105**] and [**2106**]) complicated by subqemphysema, admitted electively to [**Hospital3 26615**] hospital and underwent left VATS + LUL wedge resection on [**12-7**].
He came out of surgery with one chest tube then on POD # 2 noted to have increasing SQ emphysema with CT showing pneumopthorax for which a 2nd anterior chest tube was palced.
On POD # 9 ([**12-16**]) developed dyspnea found to have pneumothorax again and 3rd chest tube was placed.
On POD # 12 ([**12-19**]) developed confusion and spiked fever to 101 with WBC to 15,000, noted to have purulent discharge from surgical wounds.
On [**12-20**] patient developed dyspnea and respiratory acidosis and was intubated, noted to have quasi-purulent drainage from ET tube.
never got radiation or chemo - langerhantz histiocytoma 5 years ago treated chemo - COPD: FEV1 = 0.9   Social History: - Tobacco:  heavy past smoking > 80 pack years, quit recently.
HCP [**Name (NI) **] wife [**Numeric Identifier 92554**]   Family History:   NC   Physical Exam: 99.7/" 89 129/68 24 99% CMV 50% 14x450 [**8-6**]  GEN: sedated, diaphoretic CV: RRR, no m/r/g, nml s1/s2 muffled heart sounds Resp: diminished breath sounds on L diffusely, upper airway sounds, scant crackles on R base, 3 chest tubes in place all w/ frank pus expressing from sites most noticeable from CT 2 and 3, chest tubes 2 and 3 with purulent material in pleurovac containers, chest tube 2 with audible air leak at entry site into chest, erythema noted around entry sites, with some induration, subcutaneous air palpated cross anterior chest wall and extending into left neck, surgical site noted to be red, inflammed and with purulent fluid freely expressible from lower edge of surgical wound.
Abd: distended, soft, tympanic, nontender although difficult to determine given sedation, no masses palpated, large hematoma appreciated on r lower quadrant Ext: 2+ edema in all extremities, no cyanosis or clubbing, no splinter hemorrhages appreciated, R medial forearm with demarcated area of erythema, no crusting or exudate appreciated.
No discrete abscess.
Small left pleural effusion and small left pneumothorax have slightly increased in size since the [**2109-12-21**] study.
Improvement of extensive subcutaneous air along the entire thorax.
Areas of loculated air and fluid are again seen on the left, though comparison is difficult since the current study is supine rather than [**Last Name (LF) 92555**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] that the air-fluid levels are not appreciated.
Patchy opacification at the left base is again seen.
Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along both lateral chest walls.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o M w/h/o COPD and lung cancer transfered from OSH on POD 14 s/p left VATS + LUL wedge resection complicated by pneumothorax and pneumonia requiring 3 chest tubes.
Required intubation for this pneumonia and pneumothoraxes post-op.
His subcutaneous emphysema slowly resolved over the course of his MICU stay.
His posterior chest tube was removed without incident.
A repeat CT scan showed a persistent fistula between lung parenchyma and the chest wall.
He had no further dyspnea or pneumothorax but he clearly had an undrained fluid collection in the left anterior chest.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.
He was up and walking with assistance and still had oxygen requirements with ambulation.
The Pulmonary service was consulted for recommendations for his COPD and Advair and Spiriva were added to his nebulizer treatments.
He had some urinary retention after his Foley catheter was removed and finally passed his second voiding trial.
As the patient was noted to have had some eosinophilia a few days earlier during his hospital course, the Nephrology team concluded that his rising creatnine could be secondary to allergic interstitial nephritis (possibly related to prior Zosyn or Protonix use), although it was more likey attributed to TIN secondary to prior Toradol administration.
At the time of discharge the patient was able to tolerate a regular diet in moderation but continued to have a decreased appetite.
He was afebrile with overall stable vital signs although with some periodic sinus tachycardic on exertion.

Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital for care of your left chest infection after your recent surgery.
You required an operative treatment to wash out the infection and since that time you have been improving on a daily basis.
You remain afebrile and your antibiotics were stopped on [**2109-12-31**].
Unfortunately due to your lung disease and recent surgery you still require oxygen.
