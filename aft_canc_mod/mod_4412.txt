# R Oropharyngeal mass: Initial concern was for peritonsilar abscess.
He had some oozing in the OR, but overnight, he had no bleeding and physical exam in the morning only showed dry blood in the mouth.
# Lactate 4.1: Patient with high lactate in ED.
Pt continues with tachycardia HR of 110 on admission, and the concern would be for peri-tonsillar abscess causing systemic signs of inflammation.
What is reassuring is that the patient does not have have leukocytosis or bandemia, hypotension or even significant pain at the site of the mass.
# NASH cirrhosis, c/b recurrent ascites: s/p TIPS [**5-14**] and TIPS redo [**2200-7-3**].
Last EGD in [**2200-5-16**] showed erosive esophagitis/duodenitis with grade 1 esophageal varices and portal gastropathy.
He was given Lactulose to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
He had increasing swelling due to the fluids he received in the ED as well as from the blood products he received.
Chronic Issues: # Diabetes Mellitus: controlled on metformin at home and changed to SSI while inpatient.
#thrombocytopenia - likely [**1-16**] cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Patient required one unit of PLT prior to OR biopsy.
#anemia - pt without obvious signs of bleeding but presents with HCT 5 point drop at 32.8 from 39.7 on [**2200-7-3**].
Recent EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] showed small Gr1 varices.
Hct trended down while inpatient, with small oozing after biopsy.
Furosemide 20 mg PO DAILY PRN weight gain > 3 lbs, leg swelling, shortness of breath (NOT REQURING) 3.
Lactulose 15-30 mL PO TID titrate to [**2-16**] BM per day   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Tonsillar Mass  Secondary Diagnosis: NASH cirrhosis complicated by recurrent ascites s/p TIPS on [**5-14**]  Hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Initially, there was concern that this was an infection, however on CT imaging we became increasingly concerned that there was a tumor in the area.
You tolerated the procedure well and did not appear to have persistent bleeding afterwards however your blood levels came down due to some mild blood loss accompanied by the large volume of fluids and plasma products delivered.
Then resume weighing yourself daily and take lasix on an as needed basis for weight gain >3pounds.
