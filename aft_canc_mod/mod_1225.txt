hip pain, and increasing difficulty walking.
He has been taking naprosyn 2 tablets per day for the past 2 days, and today noted abdominal pain in the "pit" of his abdomen - points to suprapubic, infraumbilical region.
He was brought to the ED, and there found to be AF, with VSS, but noted to have guaiac positive stool and hct of 17.  s/p PRBC transfusion, EGD with injection and cauterization, briefly in MICU.
Past Medical History: Chronic Anemia, HCT 28-31 Chronic Hyponatremia s/p colectomy for volvulus CAD, s/p LAD stent, old LBBB BPH Vertigo Parkinsons Disease, atypical presentation, medication unresponsive Hypercholesterolemia Tuberculosis 50 yrs prior  Social History: The patient lives at home with his wife.
The patient walks two miles a day with no shortness of breath.
Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: On transfer, T 97.9  HR 80  BP 121/48  RR 26  O2Sat 94%RA GEN: pleasant, reclining in bed, NAD HEENT: PERRL, MM dry CV: distant, no MRG appreciated Lungs: +air movement anteriorly Abd: soft, NTND, +BS Ext: w/wp, no edema Neuro: alert, non focal  Pertinent Results: Chemistries [**2105-5-13**] 06:15PM   GLUCOSE-111* UREA N-63* CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-135 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-14 [**2105-5-13**] 06:15PM   ALBUMIN-3.5 .
Head CT IMPRESSION: 1) No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2) No CT evidence of an acute major territorial infarction.
Erythema in the stomach compatible with gastritis.
CXR IMPRESSION: 1) Persistence of right upper lobe consolidation, present since at least [**2105-3-18**].
Its persistence is concerning for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, although other entities such as an atypical infection or recurrent aspiration are also possible.
2) New opacities at both lung bases, which may represent atelectasis versus aspiration.
4) Extensive gas within the colon and small bowel.
Bronchoscopy cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma; favor adenocarcinoma.
Possible compression fracture of L3, though metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 y/o man with a history of CAD s/p PTCI [**11-25**] complicated by GIB while anticoagulated, with subsequent colonoscopy that was not diagnostic [**2-25**] poor prep, a history of ?parkinson's disease (atypical presentation, medication non-responder) presents with multiple recent falls including one day of difficulty walking presents with complaints of 'weakness' found to have Hct of 17, guaiac pos stools.
This showed a normal esophagus, a difficult to visualize stomach raising the question of hernia, gastritis, a nodule and erosions in the cardia, and an ulcer in the lesser curvature of the stomach with stigmata of recent bleed which was injected and cauterized.
There were also non-bleeding ulcers in the duodenum.
RUL Opacity on CXR This radiologic finding had been unchanged since [**2105-2-24**]; the patient underwent a chest CT for further evaluation which showed an increased RUL opacity but additionally new lucencies in the thoracic spine which were read as lytic lesions.
Additionally he had sputum cytology sent which was negative for malignant cells.
He undewent a thoracic and lumbar spine MR which confirmed multiple involved vertebrae without any cord compression.
Falls The patient has a history of recent falls in the context of gait disturbances and a possible diagnosis of parkinson's disease for which he has been followed by the neurology service.
It appears that he did not respond to Sinamet or Mirapex ([**2-25**] GI difficulties).
His recent history of falls is likely multifactorial, including parkinsonism complicated by severe anemia and resulting orthostatsis, as well as spinal involvement of infection vs. tumor.
Given his complaint of right hip pain on admission, he had plain films of the right hip that did not show fracture or dislocation.
A bone scan was done out of concern for mets and showed increased uptake in both the spine and ribs.
Pt was given vicodin for his hip pain.
Anemia In addition to the patient's acute GIB, he has a chronic normocytic anemia with a baseline HCT between 28-31.
He has been on B12 repletion, but Fe studies sent on admission were consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia, with appropriate B12 and folate levels.
CAD s/p stenting The patient had a mid-LAD stent placed in [**2102**] and a repeat cath in [**2103**] without instent restenosis.
He was not restarted on his aspirin on discharge given the GI bleed, and after his EGD/colonoscopy in [**Month (only) **], can discuss with the GI doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] his [**Name5 (PTitle) 3390**] whether to start plavix instead for secondary CAD prevention as it has been associated with less GI bleeding risk than ASA.
Hypertension The patient has an EF of 60% per a [**2103**] cath that also showed a patent stent.
Proph Once out of the MICU, the patient was initially prophylaxed for DVT with pneumoboots.
However, given the concern for metastatic malignancy and the resultant hypercoagulable state, heparin SQ was added.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
