Admission Date:  [**2167-12-22**]       Discharge Date: [**2167-12-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-12-7**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU GREEN TEAM  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia, status post right middle lobe wedge resection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old female, with a history of primary pulmonary hypertension diagnosed in [**2167**], presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past year.
The patient states that the dyspnea has worsened since [**2167-3-7**], for which she was admitted four months later with a diagnosis of dyspnea.
She was initially treated with Flolan, given her diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension.
Echo and cardiac catheterization were notable for increased pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient was admitted primarily for work-up of new chest x-ray and chest CAT scan findings which were diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, bibasilar thickening of the interlobar septa with honeycombing.
Therefore, the patient was admitted to have a right lobe wedge resection performed for pathologic studies.
The differential at the time of this surgery primarily included pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease versus pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.
She complained of pleuritic right-sided chest and back discomfort.
She also noted feeling short of breath.
She was persistently nauseated, and she had vomited bilious emesis x 1 on the day of transfer to the MICU.
The patient also noted a cough productive of dark blood 2-3 times a day.
Chest x-ray upon transfer to the MICU was notable for a new right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with air space disease, most likely lung injury.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for any pulmonary processes.
There is a family history of coronary artery disease.
Exam was notable for anicteric sclerae.
Pulmonary exam - decreased breath sounds at bases, no crackles, no wheezes.
Cardiac exam - regular, tachycardia, S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Extremity exam -  1+ pretibial edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally, positive clubbing of the upper digits, no calf tenderness, no swelling.
STUDIES [**2167-10-5**]:  Echocardiogram - ejection fraction 55-60%, right ventricular dilatation, moderate global right ventricular hypokinesis, moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  As mentioned, CAT scan notable for ground glass opacities bibasilar.
Chest x-ray notable for a new right lower lobe infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM - 1) PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, STATUS POST RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION FOR WORK-UP OF NEW RADIOGRAPHIC LUNG FINDINGS AND PROGRESSIVE DYSPNEA ON EXERTION:  The patient was initially treated with Flolan with a short course of inhaled nitric oxide treatment in the setting of her acute dyspnea.
The patient's pathology was notable for evidence of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.
Given the overall poor prognosis in this diagnosis, the patient was maintained on supportive regimen including Flolan, doxycycline for its presumed effects on decreased metalloproteinase activity, and lasix to further reduce preload in the setting of increased filling pressures on the right side.
Her cough became dry without any evidence of hemoptysis.
Additionally, the patient's exercise tolerance increased during her hospital course, and upon transfer to the regular floor, the patient was able to ambulate without feeling short of breath.
2) CARDIAC:  From an ischemia standpoint, the patient did not have any active issues.
She, however, did remain tachycardic throughout her hospital course, but denied any symptoms of chest discomfort, and did not have any evidence of ischemia on her EKG.
The patient did have a recent cardiac catheterization from [**2167-11-4**] which did not reveal any evidence of critical stenoses in her coronary arteries.
She did have evidence of increased right ventricular filling pressures and moderate right ventricular hypokinesis.
However, in the setting of an acute bleed in the right lung, her Coumadin was held and continues to be held upon transfer to the floor.
4) GI:  The patient did not have any active issues.
5) POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AND BACK PAIN:  The patient, at baseline, has back pain in relation to her disk disease for which she takes amitriptyline.
In the setting of having had her chest surgery, she was given morphine sulfate on a prn basis, as well as po percocet, to which the patient reported adequate pain control.
Thereafter, the patient was maintained on Tylenol treatment prn for her pain.
DISPOSITION:  To the floor with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for potential treatment of her primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.
