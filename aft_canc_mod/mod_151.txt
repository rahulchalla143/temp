Incision and drainage.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old male with medical history significant for gout involving the left ankle for 8 years, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and gout, who presented in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on [**2143-1-18**], and was later found to have MSSA bacteremia.
During the admission, he required Medical ICU monitoring for neurochecks and further evaluation of epidural abscess.
When seen by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was SOB and found to be in afib with rapid ventricular response.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital3 2568**] ED, where the patient was evaluated by orthopedics who felt that the patient had a painful left ankle with somewhat preserved passive range of motion, and that his exam could be consistent with cellulitis of the lateral aspect of the ankle.
He was started on Ampicillin/sulbactam for antimicrobial coverage for possible cellulitis overlying gout.
He had x-rays of the left ankle that showed no acute fracture, and LENI was negative for DVT.
CTA was done at that time which showed no PE, but showed pulmonary nodules.
Subsequently, blood cultures in [**12-29**] bottles grew out MSSA bacteria, and she was switched to oxacillin 2g IV q4hrs.
TTE was done, which was poor quality, but showed no vegetations.
Imaging done at that time was concerning for an epidural collection and possibly abcess in the L2 , L3 and L4 level.
The patient was evaluated by the Neurosurgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 3704**], who recommended that the patient be transfered the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] as the patient requires more MRI of the Spine (Thoracic and Cervical) and a MRI brain to rule out any more extensive pathology.
He endorses back pain and neck pain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Past Medical History: -Coronary artery disease with a negative stress in [**2140-12-26**] -atrial fibrillation -hypertension -hypercholesterolemia -gout -depression -recent colonoscopy in [**2142-3-25**] -Bilateral knee arthroscopy   Social History: - Tobacco:  70 year pack hx (smoked 2ppd for 35y, quit 16 years ago) - Alcohol:  5 bottles of wine/week - Illicits:  used cocaine 30 years ago, denies recent drug use.
Family History: Father died of an MI at 72.
Mother died of an MI at 68.

Bilateral LE pitting edema 3+.
Area of external malleolus is erythematous and outlined but erythema extends beyond borders of outline.
Range of motion of L ankle passive motion is limited by pain  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: General: Alert and oriented in no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, PERRL Neck: thick neck girth CV: irregular rate, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: obese, soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing.
Bilateral LE pitting edema 2+.
Left ankle swelling greater than right.
Mild pain with active and passive range of motion of the left and right ankle L>R.
Minimal decrease in intervertebral disc spaces noted, predominantly at the L1-L9, [**12-28**] levels with anterior osteophytosis.
Sclerotic line of the medial malleolus may represent a nondisplaced fracture if there is a history of trauma.
Slight widening of the medial tibial talar joint space.
No focal airspace disease, or pulmonary vascular congestion.
No pneumothorax.
CTA [**2143-1-18**]: Findings:  There are no filling defects within the pulmonary arteries and their segmental branches to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is suboptimal evaluation of the subsegmental branches.
There are ill-defined densities in both lung apices, which may reflect post-inflammatory or infectious changes.
There is a 4 mm nodule in the left upper lobe (image 56 of series 3), a 6 mm ground glass nodule in the right upper lobe (image 45 of series 3), and a 5 mm nodule in the right lower lobe (image 35 of series 3).
There is no pleural effusion.
There is no axillary, mediastinal, or perihilar lymphadenopathy.
There are no thyroid nodules.
No pulmonary embolism in the main and segmental pulmonary arteries.
Ill-defined densities in both lung apices, which may reflect post-inflammatory or infectious changes.
Multiple 4 to 6 mm pulmonary nodules.
LENI [**2143-1-18**]: Impression:  No deep vein thrombosis.
Diffuse increase echogenicity of the liver is seen concerning for hepatic cellular steatosis.
Limited evaluation of the common bile duct which measures 6mm.
The pancreas is not visualized due to rule bowel gas and patient habitus No mass of the pancreas is seen.
No hydronephrosis or mass of either kidney is noted.
TTE [**2143-1-19**]: This was a technically difficult study secondary to poor penetration.
Moderate left atrial enlargement.
There are no regional wall motion abnormalities seen.
Trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are noted.
There is no evidence of a significant pericardial effusion or an intracardiac mass.
EKG:  [**1-19**] from [**Hospital3 **] EKG read (no EKG present) Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Possible Inferior infarct (cited on or before [**0-0-0**]) Abnormal ECG When compared with ECG of [**0-0-0**] 07:42, Atrial fibrillation has replaced Sinus rhythm Vent.
rate has increased BY  43 BPM Left posterior fascicular block is no longer Present ST now depressed in Anterior leads Nonspecific T wave abnormality, worse in Inferior leads T wave inversion no longer evident in Lateral leads  [**Hospital1 18**] IMAGES: L ankle film ([**1-21**]): FINDINGS: No previous images.
There is diffuse soft tissue prominence about the ankle joint.
There is substantial narrowing of the tibiotalar articulation, though no definite erosions are appreciated.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] w/ and w/out contrast ([**1-21**]): IMPRESSION: Extremely limited study with motion; although there is no large epidural abscess seen or prevertebral abscess identified or obvious evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis seen.
Subtle changes within the spinal canal could not be excluded.
If there is continued clinical concern, a repeat study preferably with sedation can help.
MR T- and L-spine w/ and e/out contrast ([**1-20**]): IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous pattern of enhancement identified in the lumbar spine posteriorly, likely consistent with an early epidural phlegmon or epidural abscess formation, extending from L2/L3 through L4/L5 levels, causing significant narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly.
There is also evidence of fat stranding and edema in the paravertebral soft tissues at L3, L4 and L5 levels as described above with loss of the muscular plane and fat on the left at L4 level.
The examination is limited due to the patient habitus and epidural lipomatosis, grossly in the thoracic spine, there is no evidence of spinal cord compression or intrinsic signal changes within the thoracic spinal cord.
CXR ([**1-21**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Extremely low lung volumes are responsible for considerable anatomic distortions, including crowding of pulmonary vasculature and widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
Nevertheless, there could be a mediastinal adenopathy though there is also undoubtedly a contribution of fat deposition.
There is no focal pulmonary consolidation, but there could be mild generalized interstitial abnormality.
I would strongly urge conventional chest radiographs and if serious questions of abnormality remain clarification by a chest CT scan, if that is justified clinically.
No pneumothorax.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggested to assess the valves.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 52 yo man with h/o CAD, HTN, A-FIB (Coumadin) who presented with back pain, found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess s/p drainage, with a hospital course complicated by Acute Renal Failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia, which both improved prior to discharge.
# Sepsis seconary to MSSA epidural abscess: The patient initially presented to his internist's office and was referred to an outside hospital, prior to the diagnosis with Staph bacteremia and was later with an epidural collection consistent with abcess.
MRI at OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with epidural abscess L2-L4/5.
Patient underwent OR drainage of the abcess by ortho spine.
At the time of diagnosis with hospital-acquired pneumonia, the patient was transitioned to Vancomycin and Cefepime, but was transitioned back to nafcillin and later cefazolin for ongoing treatment of his epidural space infection.
The patient initially required q4h neuro checks given risk of epidural hematoma formation, and required medical ICU coverage earlier in his hospital course.
Patient subsequently developed a drug rash lattributed most likely to the nafcillin, at which point he was switched to cefazolin.
He is being followed with the infectious disease specialists and they will monitor him for the length of his antibiotic coverage.
# MSSA septicemia: The patient initially presented with evidence of sepsis with tachycardia, to the outside hospital, in the setting of positive blood cultures with MSSA.
TTE was without signs of endocarditis.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] did reveal MSSA, but later in his course, serial surveillance cultures did not show bacterial growth.
Although there is no identifiable source for his bacteremia it is likely secondary to skin breakdown.
# Left leg gout: LLE edema > R and erythema and tenderness.
No evidence of DVT on LENIs.
No evidence of bacteria on gram stain of joint tap, but many negative biorefringent crystals consitent with a gout flare.
Colchicine was held given worsening renal function.
After transfer to the medicine floor the patient had worsening left ankle pain and swelling.
He also complained of right ankle and left elbow pain.
Presentation is consistent with polyarticular gout.
The patient will be sent out on prednisone with a taper until his symptoms improve.
A second arthrocentesis performed the left ankle to insure that he did not have a septic arthritis as he was at risk to do his bacteremia and previous arthrocentesis.
# Afib with RVR: Started on po dilt at OSH after initiation of dilt gtt for afib w/ RVR.
Amiodarone was briefly started, but was discontinued as it was felt that concerting the pt to sinus rhythm would produce an increased risk of thromboembolism.
He remained stable on the floor and had no episodes of rapid ventricular response.
#Drug rash: Prior to his discharge patient developed a rash on his extremities consistent with a drug rash.
While there was concern for the potentialcross-reactivity with the cefazolin, the type of hypersensitivity reaction, as well as the desire to maintain a bacteriacidal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] led the team to continue with cefazolin with planned careful monitoring.
#Ileus:  Pt developed a post-op ileus following episdural abscess surgery.
On the day prior to transfer to the medicine floor he had three large BM's and had a significant decrease in his abdominal pain.
On the floor the patient had no nausea or vomiting had regular bowel movements and tolerated a regular diet.
#Healthcare associated pneumonia: After the patient's surgical intervention he began to have increased harsh requirements and hypoxia as well shortness of breath and fever.
The patient's chest x-ray was consistent with pneumonia.
There is no clear cause for his anemia but he remained stable multiple days prior to his discharge.
#Delirium: Patient had an episode of delirium on the medical ICU and required intramuscular Haldol.
================================================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================================================  # Pulmonary nodules: monitor as outpatient, follow up --> to ensure resolution # Drug rash: Need to monitor for worsening or new rash.
