History of Present Illness: 66 y/o M with hx of laryngeal CA with treatment by right hypopharyngeal excision and s/p chemo and XRT in [**2119**] presents with increasing SOB, hoarsenss and stridors.
In [**2121-11-24**], the patient was noted to have some increasing SOB and was taken to the operating room which revealed some airway edema and fungal infection.
He was doing well but still continued to have some mild SOB.
Starting 3 days prior to admission, the patient noted worsening symptoms and came to the ED today for evaluation.
The visualizaiton showed some swelling of the false vocalcords.
He was hypertensive with SBPs in 170s to 200s while in the OR.
On the floor, he was guiac positive as well.
He was coughing frequently with bloody sputum being expelled from his trach tube.
He complains of pain around the trach site.
He denies hx of black or bloody stools.
No hx of GI bleed.
Recent EGD in [**Month (only) **] showing gastritis and duodenitis when he had his PEG tube placed.
No colonoscopy on record.

he has some pooling of greenish secretions in piriforms and post cricoid region.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2122-1-31**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2122-2-2**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2122-1-31**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2122-2-2**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
There is no evidence of PTX and some right basilar atelectatic change is visualized along with a similar-appearing opacity adjacent to the right heart border.
The latter may be due to scarring as it is quite similar to the film from [**2121-12-29**].
[**2122-2-3**] EGD Antral gastritis and small superficial erosion in the stomach Bulbar duodenitis and small superficial erosion Duodenal biopsy to rule out celiac disease No active bleeding source identified Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
[**2122-2-4**] PORTABLE CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a ill-defined opacity at the medial bases of the right lower lobe.
There also is a minimal right-sided pleural effusion and a basal right atelectasis.
No signs of overhydration.
Under video fluoroscopy, patient was observed to swallow barium of various consistencies.
There was mild premature spillover of thin liquid which penetrated the patient's laryngeal vestibule.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Swallow initiation was timely and velar elevation was normal.
However, laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure were moderately reduced.
Mild residue was seen in the vallecular and piriform sinuses.
Bolus propulsion was moderately impaired with mild residue seen on the lower posterior pharyngeal wall.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Material penetrated into the laryngeal vestibule during swallow due to impaired laryngeal valve closure and a small amount penetrated into the airway.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by impaired laryngeal valve closure which resulted in penetration and trace aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: #Hypoxic respiratory failure - Evaluted in the ED by ENT who diagnosis limited vocal cord mobility, masses over the vocal cords bilaterally, and airway obstruction.
He was taken to the OR for emergent tracheostomy, direct laryngoscopy, and esophagoscopy which revealed postradiation changes throughout the laryngopharynx, no evidence of tumor in the hypopharynx or disease on the supraglottic surfaces, fixed arytenoids with limited ability to rotate, some ulceration near the right arytenoid which was biopsied, but no clear neoplastic changes.
#Aspriation pneumonia - As the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with a normal WBC#, augmentin was continued for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
#Acute blood loss anemia - The patient had an asymptomatic 10% decline in hematocrit over 1 month and guaiac positive stools on admission.
Flushing the PEG tube did not produce a bloody or melanotic return.
Colonscopy revealed a benign-appearing ascending colonic polyp which was biopsied.
EGD revealed antral gastritis and duodenitis with superficial erosions, but no source of active bleeding.
If his anemia does not recover over time, and his stools remain guaiac negative, he may benefit from an outpatient capsule endoscopy.
Video oropharyngeal swallow study on [**2122-2-5**] revealed moderate pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by impaired laryngeal valve closure which resulted in penetration and trace aspiration.
It was recommended that the patient remain NPO due to the substantial aspiration risk.
He understood the risks inherent in taking food by mouth, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary 1) Hypoxic respiratory failure 2) Aspiration pneumonia 3) Fungal laryngitis 4) Acute blood loss anemia  Secondary 1) Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma 2) Status post percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement 3) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs and respiratory status.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with airway obstruction, likely due to respiratory tract infection.
Please continue taking the antifungal medication as prescribed through Friday, [**2-13**] to treat your vocal cord infection.
You had another swallowing study which showed muscle weakness and a high risk for aspiration even with ground solids and nectar-thickened liquids.
You had an upper endoscopy on [**2122-2-3**] which showed a small amount of irritation in the stomach and small intestine.
However, no source of active bleeding was identified.
Colonoscopy showed a benign-appearing polyp which was nonetheless biopsied.
Please call your physician or return to the Emergency Department if you experience fever, chills, sweats, dizziness, lightheadedness, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, palpitations, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or bloody or dark stools.
