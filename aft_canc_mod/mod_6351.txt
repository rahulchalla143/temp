History of Present Illness: This 79-year-old lady, who has been found to have a cystic lesion of the pancreatic head causing outflow obstruction of her duodenum.
This lesion was found incidentally as she was being worked up for a diarrhea problem by her gastroenterologist.
This has been worked up with endoscopic ultrasound and she was found to have atypical cells on an aspirate of this lesion.
There was no bile duct dilation.
Never smoked or drank EtOH.
Physical Exam: [**2159-5-11**] Pre-Admission Examination by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: On physical exam, her abdomen is soft, but she has diffuse mild tenderness.
There is focal tenderness in the left abdomen.
There is no evidence of any mass effect.
Her inguinal and genital exam shows no evidence of any masses or hernias and a rectal exam was deferred today.
LUNGS: CTA(B) COR: RRR ABD: Upper midline incision with staples c/d/i; lower incisional wound approx.
Predominantly cystic-appearing pancreatic head mass causing mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The cystic masses appear to enhance and differential includes mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, the appearance is atypical for adenocarcinoma, however due to soft tissue findings below this has to remain in the differential diagnosis.
The pancreatic duct is mildly dilated.
There does not appear to be involvement of the superior mesenteric vein.
There is no vessel thrombosis.
There is no evidence for metastatic disease involving the liver.
Soft tissue is also seen in a periaortic distribution at the level of the celiac, and superior mesenteric arteries.
If repeat CT imaging is to be performed, would recommend plain abdominal radiographs to ensure passage of barium from the stomach and bowel loops.
The findings are consistent with adenocarcinoma of pancreaticobiliary origin.
The entire tissue is frozen and diagnosis of "lymph node with metastatic adenocarcinoma" is rendered by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on for planned resection of a pancreatic head mass.
On [**2159-5-15**], the patient underwent exploration of retroperitoneum, gastroenterostomy, jejunostomy tube placement, and portal lymph node biopsy for staging, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
She was NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with the previously-placed PICC, a foley catheter and a J-Tube to gravity drainage in place, and Dilaudid IV PRN and an injection of intra-thecal morphine for pain control.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with the single dose of IT Morphine as well as Dilaudid IV PRN, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
