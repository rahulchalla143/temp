He was assessed by the trauma team upon arrival and thought to have only head injuries.
He had elevated ICP so the decision was made to take him to the operating room.
Toes mute  CT head: 1) large comminuted calvarial fracture with apparent depression     in parietal region.
mass effect on right lateral ventricle.
suprasellar    cistern appears irregular, concerning for impending    uncal/transtentorial herniation 3) hemorrhage along lateral left globe  Assessment/Plan: 60 year old male w/SAH, SDH with mass effect and concern for impending herniation.
He also has a large comminuted skull fracture.

67 year old man who is s/p MVA with resulting traumatic brain injury, including: depressed right skull fracture, subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural hemorrhage, and sagittal sinus laceration.
He underwent right-sided hemicraniectomy, evacuation of hematoma, and dural repair of the superior sagittal sinus.
His hospital course was complicated by what was thought to be a superior saggital thrombosis, and interval development of fevers without a clear microbiological source.
He has had a single positive blood culture with coag positive staph growing - his CVL was removed and has no growth to date.
He has had three sputum samples, two with MSSA and one with E. Coli, all in the abscence of radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
He has also had a progressive leukocytosis with a peak at 22.6, his differential is left-shifted, but there is no eosinophilia.
He also had a morbiliform rash on his trunk.
The patient was felt unlikely to have an infectious source of his fevers and these were thought more likely to represent drug reaction or central fevers.
The patient had repeat pan-culture (blood, urine and sputum) revealing negative blood and urine cultures and sputum growing Staph and E. Coli as known prior to transfer.
Further antibiotics were held and the patient was maintained off of dilantin (as this may represent a component of dilantin hypersensitivity syndrome).
The patient was afebrile for >48 hours prior to discharge.
# Transaminitis.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service with a transaminitis, benign abdominal exam and no signs on abdominal imaging (abdominal plain film and ultrasound) of an acute process.
This was also felt consistent with a drug reaction (again possibly dilantin hypersensitivity syndrome).
Hypotensive shock liver was considered, though the patient did not have a prolonged hypotensive episode.
# Pancreatitis.
Likely chemical pancreatitis secondary to numerous acute issues and/or drug reaction.
# Traumatic brain injury with bleeding complications.
Patient with a question of mental status changes on the day of transfer.
Head CT revealed no interval change.
The patient's earlier diagnosis of saggital sinus thrombosis was called into question as the saggital sinus was found to opacify with dye with extrinic compression causing luminal irregularity.
The patient was continued on valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis and underwent an EEG which showed encephalopathy but no active seizure activity.
His mental status and neuro exam was monitored and unchanged throughout his remaining hospital course, with the exception of occasional eye opening to voice.
This can be stopped if overt bleeding occurs.
# Question of saggital sinus thrombosis, though now not to be the case.
# Normocytic anemia.
The patient was trace guaiac positive in the setting IV heparin when thought to have sagittal sinus thrombosis.
Iron studies were inconsistent with iron deficiency and hemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis.
Patient with lower extremity edema and left upper extremity anasarca.
Likely secondary to low albumin.
# Code Status.
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) MVA resulting in traumatic head injury with subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, lacerated superior sagittal sinus from depressed right-sided high parietal/high frontal skull fracture crossing midline.
--s/p Right-sided hemicraniectomy, evacuation of hematoma, repair of sinus 2) Fevers - query drug hypersensitivity 3) Chemical pancreatitis (perhaps secondary to #2) 4) Transaminitis/hepatitis (perhaps secondary to #2) 5) Thrombocytosis - query secondary to #2 6) Moderate malnutrition 7) Anemia of inflammation, no evidence for hemolysis, with some mild blood loss - occult blood positive stools 8) Hypertension 9) Elevation of alpha-1-antitrypsin - query significance - would repeat when acute inflammatory state subsides   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CRANIOTOMY/HEAD INJURY ??????
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of         infection ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
Your hospital course was complicated by fevers, rash and elevations in your liver and pancreatic enzymes.
Avoid new antibiotics unless there is a clear source of infection to be treated.
Have your liver and pancreatic enzymes monitored on blood work within 5 days of discharge to ensure normalization of these values.
Call your doctor for any new fevers, change in mental status or rising liver or pancreatic enzymes.
Followup Instructions: Have your blood drawn within 5 days of discharge to ensure resolution of your liver and pancreatic enzyme abnormalities.
