She had a right temporal grade I meningioma resected by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**4-/2176**], proton beam irradiation to left parietal parasaggital meningoma at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2176**], a left parietal resection by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**4-16**], cyberknife rdiosurgery right parietal cavity [**5-16**], CT guided LUL lung bx [**3-17**] positive for lung cancer, shoulder surgery for bone spur [**7-17**], portacath [**11-17**].
She then presented to the emergency room on [**2192-5-8**] for right lower extremity spasms.
Her epileptologis, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 623**] feels that the spasms are focal seizures from a small menigeoma.
The patient has stopped driving and feels that her seizures may be originating for the lesion seen on the left parasagittal region on her head.
Currently she complains of increased seizure acitivty.
She also has symptoms most likely unrelated to meningioma of shuffling gait and numbness bottom of right foot.

Family History: Mother died at 95 from CHF  Physical Exam: On Admission: AF VSS Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
The patient is status post right parietal craniotomy, with persistent irregular area of enhancement in the right parietal lobe and vasogenic edema.
Unchanged oval-shaped enhancing lesion in the left parietal convexity, likely consistent with a meningioma and unchanged area of uniform enhancement in the left parietal region as described above.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-19**] 1:39 PM There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There is extensive edema present similar in comparison to the comparison study performed in [**2192-5-8**].
There is intracranial air located in the left frontal region, which is expected postoperatively.
There is no evidence of any new abnormalities.
Post-surgical changes related to recent left parietal meningioma resection.
Susceptibility artifact in the left vertex, likely represents pneumocephalus, better seen on CT exam one day prior.
There is minimal enhancement within the resection bed.
No intracranial infarction.
Post-surgical changes related to remote right parietal glioblastoma resection.
The surrounding vasogenic edema has mildly increased since prior exams, which may represent progression of treatment changes or underlying disease  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old female who presented electively on [**2192-7-19**] for a left sided craniotomy for mass resection.
Given the patient's complaints of mild abdominal pain and history for eroded esophagus, the patients steroids were discontinued as discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient had a post operative MRI of the Brain which was consistent with post-surgical changes with  minimal enhancement within the resection bed.
