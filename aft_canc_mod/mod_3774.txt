She was intubated on [**2170-1-1**] for respiratory distress.
On bronchoscopy revealed a  mass above the carina, extending onto the left mainstem bronchus.
On [**2170-1-2**] Resection of endobronchial tumor (Yag laser) and endoscopy showing a ulcer at the GE junction.

No LAD on L.  Trachea midline.
FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)  [**2170-1-17**]  INTERPRETATION: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a right pharyngeal mucusal soft tissue mass measuring 2.2 x 2.8 cm, with an SUV max of 11.8.
There is no FDG-avid neck lymphadenopathy.
There is no FDG avid parenchymal lesion within the lungs.
There is a moderate right and small left effusion.
There is no abnormal FDG avid lesion within the abdomen and pelvis.
Note is made of dependent fluid layering in the presacral and perirectal space along with diffuse and dependent subcutaneous edema within the lower abdomen and pelvis.
Physiologic uptake is seen in the heart, liver, spleen, GI and GU tract.
Abnormal markedly FDG-avid subcarinal mass consistent with pathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.
No additional FDG-avid mediastinal, hilar, or lung lesions.
Worrisome FDG avid right pharyngeal mass concerning for separate malignancy given patient's history and location.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-1-19**] 10:24 AM  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of mass, abnormal enhancement, hemorrhage, or abnormal signal intensity in the brain.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable with mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinus and small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells.
There is no diffusion abnormality.
The cystic lesion in the left mandible is partially included and shows low signal on T1 without ehhancement.
No evidence of metastasis.
Mucosal thickening in ethmoid sinus and within the mastoid air cells.
Left mandibular cystic lesion.
There is asymmetric soft tissue measuring approximately 2.5 x 2.0 cm in the right hypopharynx at the tonsillar pillar, corresponding to the FDG- avid mass, suspicious for neoplasm likely a primary tumor rather than metastasis.
There is no significant mass or asymmetry in the nasopharynx.
There is no significant lymphadenopathy.
There is a 2 x 1 cm fluid-containing cystic lesion in the subcutaneous tissue anterior to the mandible.
In the left internal jugular vein, there is tubular filling defect measuring 4 mm in diameter, and -30 [**Doctor Last Name **].
In the visualized portion of the lung apices, there are bilateral pleural effusion and patchy opacities in the lungs.
There are degenerative changes of a cervical spine.
Soft tissue mass and asymmetric in the right hypopharynx, corresponding to FDG-avid tumor, suspicious for primary neoplasm such as squamous cell carcinoma.
2 x 1 cm fluid-containing cystic lesion anterior to the left mandible.
Hypodense tubular small filling defect in the left internal jugular vein.
The Hounsfield unit is somewhat too low for thrombus or turbulent flow, however, if clinically indicated, please perform ultrasound for further evaluation.
Bilateral pleural effusion and patchy opacities in the apices.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2170-1-21**] 3:56 PM FINDINGS: There is a conglomerate nodal mass centered at the level of the carina, extending superiorly to the level of the aortic arch and inferiorly to the azygoesophageal recess.
This lesion encases the mainstem bronchi with extension peripherally to the hilar regions, with possible encasement of the upper and lower lobe bronchi.
Although this mass encases the central airways, there is no evidence of significant airway narrowing or endobronchial lesion.
No evidence of diffuse mediastinal gas.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions are seen, with atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma.
Mild paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema.
A small pericardial effusion is seen.
Large conglomerate nodal mass with its epicenter at the level of the carina, encasing the central airways.
Given possible hypopharyngeal primary malignancy identified on PET/CT, this conglomerate nodal mass may represent a metastatic site.
Focal small extraluminal gas collection lateral to the trachea at site of stent.
This may represent a small localized/contained perforation.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of adjacent lung parenchyma.
Multifocal areas of subtle peribronchiolar ground-glass opacities, may be infectious or inflammatory (e.g.

[**12-23**] they did an xray chest which showed b/l LL infiltrates.The CT scan revelaed L endobronchial narrowing, mediastinal abnormalities,  extensive compression of the left main stem bronchus and the esophagus.The patient continued to have worsening respiatory status and had to placed in BiPAP,her PH at this time was 7.33 but pco2 had gone upto 82.
On [**2170-1-1**] she continued to have hypercapneic respiratory insufficiency and had to be intubated.A bronchoscopy followed demonstrating a mass above the carina,extending into the left mainstem bronchus.The right side was clear.Biopsies were taken from the area which showed non small cell lung cancer.On [**1-2**] she got a YAG laser resection of the endobronchial tumor with resultant opening of 40% of the L main stem bronchus.She also got an endoscopy which showed a benign appearing ulcer at the GE junction.No tumor was seen.A trial for extubation was made on [**1-7**] but she could not last too long of the breathing machine.
There are no lingering surgical issues at this time, and the patient's Y-stent has functioned appropriately at this time.
