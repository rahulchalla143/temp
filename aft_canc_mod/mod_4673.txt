Admission Date:  [**2146-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-9-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**] Chief Complaint: Cardiogenic shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -proctocolectomy -Tracheal intubation -cardiac catheterization [**2146-12-6**]: thrombotic LAD stent with no flow, and thrombotic Cx stent with TIMI 3 flow.
RFA Perclose   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old man with CAD s/p PCI w/ BMS to LAD and LCx on [**2146-11-4**] with a recent diagnosis of colorectal cancer with plan for bowel resection today.
However, he developed cardiac arrest during surgery requiring defibrillation and subsequently found to have ST elevations on EKG.
Patient had apparently stopped both plavix and aspirin on [**11-30**] prior to his surgery today.
Per report, patient became hypotensive on pressors with MAP in 40s and tachycardic to 120s after prone jackknife positioning.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where TEE showed global LV hypokinesis and a normal RV, while the rhythm strip showed large ST elevations anteriorly.
In cath lab was found to have thrombotic LAD stent with no flow, and thrombotic Cx stent with TIMI 3 flow.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hyperlipidemia 2.
With successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD with BMS and the proximal LCx with BMS -[**2146-12-6**]: Cath revealing thrombosis of both stents s/p export with POBA - PACING/ICD: None 3.
He is independent in his activities of daily living and has no difficulties with walking.
He formerly owned a small construction business and retired within the last  year.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
No tenderness illicited   Abd aorta not enlarged by palpation.
No abdominial bruits.
1+ DP/PT pulses.
Right groin catheter site c/d/i SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Stent thrombosis of CX and LAD stents.
ECHO [**12-6**]: LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Severely depressed LVEF.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with near global LV severe hypokinesis/akinesis; the basal septum and basal lateral wall have relatively preserved function (overall LVEF= ~15-20 %).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
P-R interval prolongation.
There is a single wide complex beat, probably ventricular.
Low limb lead voltage.
There is an intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block type with prominent inferior and lateral ST segment elevation.
ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo male with CAD s/p LAD/LCx BMS in [**10/2146**] presenting with STEMI in setting of stopping asa/plavix prior to colorectal surgery, s/p cardiac arrest on table, on IABP, pressors, CVVH.
Echo showing EF 15-20% with severely depressed LV function.
ECG showing q waves and low voltages indicating extensive non-recoverable myocardial injury.
Despite interventions, pt continued to be cardiogenic shock as below.
# Shock:  Pt with echo showing severely depressed LV systolic function with EF 15-20% in setting of STEMI.
He was also started on vanc/zosyn for possible septic component.
# Ectopy:  Pt noted to have frequent multifocal PVCs on tele overnight [**12-6**] and was subsequently started on amio ggt.
Continued to have ectopy throughout admission and was continued on amio until support was weaned .
