Admission Date:  [**2168-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-12-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: new lung mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 71F with a history of hypertension, anxiety, abnormal LFTs, macular degeneration, GERD,fibroid uterus, urinary incontinence, hyperlipidemia, and pancreatitis who is admitted today following a newly diagnosed RLL lung mass.
She was recently discharged form the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2168-11-10**] after presenting with 1 day of blood-streaked sputum, mild dyspnea and wheezing in the setting of 6 months of a non-productive cough.
At that time, she denied chest pain or syncope.
A CXR at that time showed a RML pneumonia with a new ill-defined opacity noted overlying on of the mid-thoracic vertebral bodies.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], she noted no further hemoptysis and an improvement in her mild dyspnea and wheezing.
A repeat CXR on [**11-30**] showed a persistent infiltrate/atelectasis in the RML; it also showed a mass-like enlarged right hilum and a new 8-mm nodular density projecting over the left lung apex.
The CT on [**12-7**] showed bulky mediastinal adenopathy with collapse of the right middle bronchus, occlusion of the right superior pulmonary vein, encasement/constriction of the right main pulmonary artery and inferior pulmonary veins, displacement/deformation of the left atrium, and narrowing/invasion of the superior vena cava.
It noted a 3.5 x 3cm mass in the right lower lobe, presumed to be the primary tumor.
A 7mm apical nodule was deemed consistent with a granuloma.
No pleural or pericardial effusions were seen.
The liver was noted to likely be cirrhotic along with intraabdominal ascites.
Her PCP sent her to the ED for expedited workup and management.
Her exam was notable for wheezes in the right lung field.
ROS: Reports one week of excessive fatigue.
Reports mild increase in abdominal girth.
Denies any recent fevers, cough, dyspnea, or wheezing over the psat 3 weeks.
She denies any recent chest pain, pedal edema, exertional or rest dyspnea.
Past Medical History: hypertension GERD uterine fibroids hyperlipidemia anxiety disorder macular degeneration urinary incontinence pancreatitis in [**9-/2167**] colonoscopy on [**2168-11-30**] showed several adenomatous polyps normal EGD on [**2168-11-30**]   Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 83347**] grew up in [**Location (un) **].
Family History: Ms. [**Known lastname 96582**] father died of coronary artery disease at age 69, her mother has diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
Physical Exam: T 96.8  BP 156/100  HR 96  RR 20  Sat 96% on 2L Gen: mildly Cushingoid, pleasant, no acute distress HEENT: clear OP, no icterus, EOMI, PERRL Neck: no carotid bruits, no wheezing/stridor, no thyromegaly Chest: faint expiratory wheezing in right middle lung field Breasts: patient declined examination CV: regular rate/rhythm, normal S1S2, no murmurs, no S3 or S4 heard Abd: protuberant, soft, nontender, moderately distended, tympanic, ?dullness to percussion in R flank Back: no CVA tenderness Extr: no edema, 2+ PT pulses Neuro: A&O x3, CN 2-12 intact, [**6-17**] grip strength bilaterally, [**6-17**] arm and shoulder flexion/extension bilaterally, [**6-17**] hip/knee/ankle flexion/extension Skin: ?mild hyperpigmentation, no rashes/lesions  Pertinent Results: CT Chest ([**12-7**]): The hilar component of a 6 x 5cm, mass involving the right hilus and middle mediastinum, obstructs the right middle lobe bronchus, producing collapse of the RML, significantly narrows the upper lobe bronchus and protrudes into the bronchus intermedius, narrowing it as well.
The mass occludes the right superior pulmonary vein and encases and constricts the right main pulmonary artery and inferior pulmonary veins.
It displaces and deforms the left atrium, obliterating adjacent fat planes; no pericardial effusion is present.
Mediastinal tumor in the right paratracheal station from the right upper lobe bronchus to the level of the aortic arch, up to 4.5cm in diameter, severely narrows and invades the superior vena cava.
A 3.5 x 3 cm mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe is most likely the primary lung cancer.
A 7mm left apical nodule is most likely a granuloma.
Mild emphysema is predominantly apical.
The pleural surfaces are smooth and there is no pleural effusion.
Hypodense renal lesions are likely cortical cysts.
There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
CT head ([**12-8**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
ECG ([**12-8**]): sinus rhythm at 101 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, ST depression in II, V2-V5, no Q waves, no ST elevations   Brief Hospital Course: Pt's chest CT was concerning for malignancy.
Pt was seen by Interventional Pulm who placed a stent in her RML bronchus ~[**12-8**] and obtained a biopsy which revealed small cell carcrinoma.
She continued to have hypokalemia and hyperglycemia causing concern for an ACTH secreting paraneoplastic syndrome.
On [**12-15**] at 6AM she was noted to have diarrhea with blood.
Of note on [**11-30**] she underwent an EGD notable for mild gastritis and a C-scope notable for several adenomatous polyps.
Repeat EGD was unremarkable for source of acute bleeding.
However, pt's diarrhea contained only modest melena/red streaks.
Pt's WBC was <0.5 raising concern for neutropenia, thus GI deferred colonoscopy again on [**12-19**].
Given ongoing bleeding, and decsision to defer colonscopy, pt underwent nuclear scan on [**2169-12-22**] which showed ?focus of abnormal activity on RLQ.
pt was then discussed with IR, with plan for angiography +/- embolization if possible, however tagged rbc scan was negative.
On [**12-23**] decision was made to pursue colonoscopy given ongoing active bloody stools without obvious source of bleeding, which showed apparent several cm long region of infiltrating tumor ~60cm from anus, c/w  infiltrative folds, with a single very large ulcer was seen in the colon at the area of infiltrated-appearing folds at 60cm from the anus, suggestive of either metastatic disease vs primary colon cancer.
#  Metastatic ACTH-secreting small cell lung CA: Pt has mets to liver and adrenals.
Vanco/Zosyn were started on admission empirically for post-obstructive pneumonia, however these were d/c'd on [**12-18**] as pt was without fever, wbc, or sputum production.
On [**12-21**] pt was noted to have fever to 100.4.
Rad/onc initially had plans XRT post chemo, which were to be deferred until resolution of GIB.
# Thrombocytopenia - was felt likely secondary to chemo and dilution from 10+ units of PRBC's.
# Hypokalemia/Hypernatremia - most likely secondary to ACTH-secreting SCLC (cortisol 167).
# Hyperglycemia - likely related to ACTH secretion from lung cancer, pt was continued on RISS.
In addition, she was started on glypizide on [**12-21**] given her likelihood of continuing to have elevated FSBS [**3-17**] ACTH secretion.
# Hypertension: BP well controlled despite holding atenolol for active GIB.
# ARF (baseline 1.2-1.3) thought to be prerenal azotemia; Creat subsequently trended down to 1.0.
Elevated BUN may be secondary to hypovolemia from GI bleed.
# Ascites/?cirrhosis: LFTs mildly elevated likely related to metastatic diasese to liver, and per daughter ascites on [**12-18**] was better than baseline obese habitus.
no dullness to percussion on exam throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, and LFTs unremarkable.
# Anxiety.
Pt had episode of delirium thought to be secondary to high dose ativan.
She remained anxious on [**12-17**], but A&Ox3.
Did not feel this represent delirium as pt was A&Ox3 and able to focus appropriately.
No intervention was felt necessary, and pt was subsequently intubated and sedated for colonoscopy.
# dispo - pt expired on [**12-23**] after goals of care changed to CMO during family meeting.
