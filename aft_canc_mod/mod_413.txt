HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old male with history of metastatic melanoma with brain metastases who presents with a complaint of fatigue for several days.
He also had pancreatitis on IL-2 and IL-12 therapy.
He recently developed brain metastases and has undergone whole brain XRT, Decadron and was also started on an six weeks course of temozolomide finished on [**2105-11-30**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 11193**] has been seen in the [**Hospital **] Clinic on [**2105-11-30**], where he complained of fatigue, dysuria and frequency.
and patient was started on a five day course of ciprofloxacin for presumptive urinary tract infection.
One day after having been seen in the Clinic the patient reported a dramatic increase in sense of fatigue and lack of energy.
Denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, sputum production, flank pain or skin rash but notes persistent dysuria and polyuria.
Notes mild abdominal distention but denies any pain and has had regular bowel movements and flatus.
Blood pressure remained in the high 80's systolic despite three liters of normal saline with no change in the urine output so dopamine was started via peripheral IV with blood pressure climbing to the 95-100 range systolic.
Malignant melanoma diagnosed in [**2097**] with metastases to lung and brain status post bio-chemotherapy treatment, status post resection of lung recurrence in the right lower lobe  status post IL-2, IL-12, s/p Gleevec trial with observed progression of disease, status post whole brain XRT on Decadron, currently with week six of eight of temozolomide.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, comfortable in no acute distress, chronically ill-appearing.
Oropharynx erythematous with persistent whitish plaques.
Neck:  Multiple palpable supraclavicular nodules versus supraclavicular lymph nodes on the right.
No nuchal rigidity.
No jugular venous distention.
Slightly tachycardic.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen mildly distended, soft, non-tympanitic, non-tender, positive bowel sounds, palpable, subcutaneous nodules.
Extremities:  2+ pitting edema over the lower extremities bilaterally, 1+ pedal pulses.
Skin:  No rash.
IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 59-year-old male with history of malignant metastatic melanoma failed multiple regimens complicated by brain metastases status post XRT and Decadron who presents with complaints of fatigue and subsequently found to be hypotensive and minimally responsive to volume resuscitation.
Hypotension:  Given the warm extremities and lack of response to volume resuscitation, the hypotension was felt to be a distributed etiology either due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency.
Intravenous fluids were continued as were the stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics and the dopamine was slowly weaned over the next several days with gradual improvement of urine output as well as pressures.
He underwent abdominal CT which showed no evidence of fluid collections or free air suggestive of perforation or abscess.
Hematology/Oncology:  Patient with significant metastatic melanoma with increased tumor burden on abdominal CT underwent echocardiogram on [**2105-12-7**], which showed a mass in the left ventricle consistent with thrombus versus metastatic melanomatous lesion.
Pulmonary:  Patient had significant oxygen requirement with subjective dyspnea without oxygen by face mask or by nasal cannula.
Code Status:  After a lengthy discussion with the family, social worker and palliative care team, it was felt that goals of care would now be for comfort only and would not pursue any active resuscitation or intubation if the patient's condition were to significantly worsen and for this reason he will be listed as a DNR/DNI.
Metastatic melanoma.
Hypotension likely secondary to sepsis.
Patient is comfortable and currently without any focal complaints and may be discharged to a hospice facility for further management and end of life care.
