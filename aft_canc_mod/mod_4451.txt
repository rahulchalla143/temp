These findings appear most likely to represent medication effect.
The overall impression is that of an encephalopathy, likely due to the medication.
There were no focal abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
Moderate right frontal subgaleal hematoma.
Pansinus disease with mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses.
Soft tissue densities in the inferior maxillary sinuses may represent mucus retention cysts.
No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
Mild degenerative changes without appreciable canal narrowing.
Fragment of bone at C7 spinous process noted, without soft tissue changes indicating old trauma or unfused apophyses.
No fracture or traumatic injury to the torso.
Moderate dependent atelectasis in the lungs, without consolidation or effusion.
No peripancreatic inflammatory change.
Note that this does not rule out pancreatitis.
In the absence of IV contrast, cannot assess for sequelae of pancreatitis.
8-mm right adrenal adenoma.
2.4 cm lobulated low-attenuation cystic structure adjacent to the left ovary, likely a paraovarian or ovarian cyst.
Ultrasound may be useful for further characterization, but the ovary is located high in the pelvis and may be difficult to visualize.
No imaging findings to suggest IBD.
Moderate diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Gallbladder likely filled with sludge, although without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
8 mm nodular density in the left lower lobe appears to have supplying and draining vessels, although respiratory artifact limits assessment.
Contrast enhanced chest CT recommended for further assessment, after recovery from acute event.
There was no further seizure activity noted; eeg was notable for encephalopathy.
At the time of discharge, serum sodium was  HEME: The patient was noted to have a microcytic anemia.
B12 levels where elevated (post IV vitamin supplementation).
She should have a CBC and  ID: Ms. [**Known lastname 86386**] had low grade temperatures.
Urine and blood studies where without evidence of ifection.
