Admission Date:  [**2139-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-7-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture ([**2139-1-22**])   History of Present Illness: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72M left handed psychiatrist with h/o ESRD s/p ECD renal transplant [**2131**] complicated by bx-proved BK nepropathy treated with cidofovir now with failing graft (Cr 3.5), diffuse large B cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (1) 95198**]) and 2xIT MTX and 2xIT ARA-C with bone mets, CAD and CABG x3 [**2130**], CHF with EF 30% and 2+ MR, DM, depression, and laryngeal ca who presents from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of altered mental status.
His wife notes some paraphasic errors in his speech and difficulties with abstraction over the past year, but not major cognitive deficits.
He was able to walk with a cane, but had progressively worsening gait from neuropathy secondary to diabetes and vincristine.
Recurrent falls thought to be multifactorial with a degree of spinal stenosis and neuropathy.
After this improvement, however, his mental status became progressively worse.
Per wife, today's hospitalization results from cumulative decline and was not precipitated by an acute event.
Wife does not recall any recent medication changes or acute illnesses other than above.

No ankle clonus.
Sensation - LT, temp, vibration symmetric b/l over UEs.
Decreased LT and vibration sense over dorsal aspect of R foot.
The main differential consideration is lymphomatous infiltration.
Small vessel chronic ischemia may co-exist.
EEG- [**2139-1-20**]- This is an abnormal routine EEG due to intermittent left temporal theta slowing and right temporal sharp waves.
These findings suggest subcortical dysfunction on the left and cortical irritability on the right in the temporal regions.
No electrographic seizures were noted during this recording.
CSF - [**2139-1-22**] WBC 2, RBC 2, Protein 54, Glucose 98 LDH 87 Gram Stain Negative Culture negative Cytology: Rare atypical cells in a background of mature lymphocytes and monocytes.
Protein electrophoresis (SPEP): No oligoclonal bands VZV PCR negative Cryptococcal Ag negative [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] Virus negative  EKG ([**2139-1-25**]): Sinus tachycardia.
Left atrial abnormality.
Prominent QRS voltage suggests left ventricular hypertrophy, although it is non-diagnostic.
ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy but clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2138-12-16**] sinus tachycardia is now present and QRS voltage is less prominent.
Renal US ([**2139-1-27**]): No hydronephrosis.
Linear calcifications within the transplant kidney may represent non-obstructive calculi.
CXR ([**2139-1-19**]): No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
No definite acute focal pneumonia.
There could be a small region of new opacification at the base of the right lung above the elevated right hemidiaphragm, probably mild atelectasis or superimposition of normal structures.
There are no abnormalities convincing for pneumonia.
Incidental note is made of possible acute fracture of the left eighth rib more obvious on the chest radiograph from [**1-25**], and distortion of the right seventh rib posterolaterally that looks more like a healed fracture.
[**2138-2-13**] CXR-FINDINGS: Improvement in degree of pulmonary edema with residual perihilar haziness.
An asymmetric area of alveolar consolidation in the right infrahilar region.
The latter may be due to a resolving area of asymmetrical edema, but infection is also possible in the appropriate setting.
Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally as well as atelectatic changes in the left retrocardiac area.
LENI [**2-15**]-IMPRESSION: No DVT identified within bilateral lower extremities.
There is no evidence of interval occurrence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course: Dr.[**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
This was felt to be flash pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension with BPs 220s/130s.
No MTX yet.
NEUROLOGY: Altered Mental Status - Upon presentation, Dr. [**Known lastname **] had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of orientation, frequently talking as if his daydreams were reality.
Focal exam deficits included impairment of downward gaze, right facial droop, right arm and leg weakness.
MRI with contrast was concerning for metastatic lymphoma.
Uremic encephalopathy not likely in setting or low-for-pt BUN and Cr as well as continued hemodialysis.
Seizures - Given concern that the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status could suggest seizures, EEG was initially obtained and revealed intermittent L temporal theta slowing and R temporal sharp waves, but no seizure activity on EEG.
On [**1-24**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] had several episodes of unresponsiveness to voice and reports of left leg and arm shaking, clinically concerning for seizure.
He was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, and the episodes appear to have resolved at the time of transfer to the BMT service.
CNS Lymphoma - After the MRI with contrast raised concern for metastatic lymphoma, a follow-up LP was performed.
Cytology demonstrated a few atypical lymphocytes.
SPEP showed no oligoclonal bands.
Beta-2 microglobulin was noted to be elevated in the CSF..  Intrathecal methotrexate was considered but neuro-oncology expressed concern that this would not adequately reach the subependymal region where the metastatses were seen.
He had a transaminitis most likely from the methotrexate which resolved.
Shingles - On [**1-22**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] developed a rash in the right C3-C5 distribution ending midline.
Derm was consulted and suspected Shingles; DFA which was positive for VZV in setting of immunosuppression.
Dr. [**Known lastname **] developed fevers during admission and repeat urine studies revealed E. Coli (>100,000 colonies, pan-sensitive except to Bactrim) and Enterococcus (10,000-100,000 colonies).
This was initially treated with ceftriaxone ([**1-26**]), and then switched to cefepime ([**1-27**]) in the context of bacteremia (see below), per ID recs.
ID also recommended a renal ultrasound to check for GU reflux in the context of oliguria; demonstrated no hydronephrosis.
They also recommended considering abdominal CT to further evaluate the kidneys if renal ultrasound was unrevealing......  Bacteremia / Fevers - Blood culture [**1-25**] grew gram-negative rods, pan-sensitive.
CXR was performed but did not show evidence of an acute lung process.
He was started back on HD in [**Month (only) 1096**] for concern for uremic encephalopathy.
After he received cycle 1 of methotrexate, he was dialyzed on several consecutive days to aid in methotrexate clearance....  NSVT - Dr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have 10-12 beat runs of VTach on telemetry, which seemed to coincide with seizure activity.
CK was WNL and Troponin 0.08 in setting of renal failure.
The episodes appeared to resolve once Keppra was on board......  Rib Fracture - CXR did show what appeared to be an acute rib fracture of the 8th rib and an older fracture of the 7th rib.
There was no history of rib fractures, and the patient does not appear to be in pain from this......  Pressure Ulcers - Dr. [**Known lastname **] has two sacral pressure ulcers which are being monitored by the wound consult nurse.......
