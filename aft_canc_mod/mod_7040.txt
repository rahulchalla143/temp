RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2186-3-24**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
[**3-17**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
[**3-17**] CXR:  As compared to the previous examination, the lung volumes have minimally decreased.
Although this leads to the visualization of air bronchograms in the retrocardiac lung areas, there is no safe evidence for the presence of pneumonia or aspiration.
No pleural effusions.
The alignment and configuration of the lumbar vertebral bodies are maintained with no evidence of spondylolisthesis or distraction.
There is no evidence of loosening of the orthopedic hardware, allograft bone material is noted anterior to the vertebral body at L4/L5 and L5/S1.
No fluid collections or hematomas are detected.
Left perihilar opacities have minimally increased.
The retrocardiac atelectasis has improved.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
Right-sided PICC tip projects over the distal SVC with no pneumothorax.
No interval change since prior chest radiograph on the same day.
[**3-27**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-25**], there is some poorly defined areas of increased opacification at the bases.
It is unclear whether this could represent some atelectatic change or early elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, or be a manifestation of developing bilateral consolidations as suggested by the clinical history.
