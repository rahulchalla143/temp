Admission Date:  [**2110-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-8-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement ERCP s/p sphincterotomy and stent placement in common bile duct IR guided liver biopsy Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 82-year-old female with a history of HTN, Hyperthyroidism, likely cholangiocarcinoma, recent PE/DVTs on coumadin p/w progressive dyspnea.
Patient was recently admitted for dyspnea on [**2110-4-6**] and found to have RUL segmental branch PE on CTA.
CTA also showed a liver lesion with scattered pulmonary nodules concerning for malignancy.
Subsequent MRI showed a large ill-defined heterogeneous mass concerning for an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with multiple satellite nodules.
Biopsy not done due to need for anticoagulation for acute stage of PE.
Notably, patient c/p progressive dyspnea since her last admission.
Over the course of the past 3-4 days she has had increasing dyspnea on exertion, where walking [**9-2**] feet caused significant dyspnea.
She does admit to decreased appetite, abdominal fullness, and persistent right leg swelling.
On the floor, the patient appears quite dyspneic, but after sitting for some time, her tachypnea and dyspnea improved.
Patient states she has problems with her liver, but per her family is not aware she has cancer.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse or overt tampoande is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination.
There remains no overt tamponade.
The degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has slightly increased.
Apparent slight increase in right pleural effusion with predominantly subpulmonic distribution.
Persistent collapse of right middle and right lower lobes.
Persistent peripheral left mid lung opacity probably due to infarct in the setting of known pulmonary embolism.
[**2110-5-20**] Pleural Fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Generalized non-specific repolarization abnormality.
Delayed precordial R wave progression of indeterminate significance.
The immunophenotype and morphology are consistent with a tumor of pancreatico-biliary origin in the appropriate clinical setting.
[**2110-5-9**] CT Head:  No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of metastases or acute hemorrhage.
New pulmonary embolism within a segmental left pulmonary artery extending to the left lower lobe.
Large thrombus in the lower infrarenal IVC extending into the proximal bilateral common iliac veins.
Right common femoral, superficial femoral, and deep femoral veins thrombosis as seen on recent lower extremity ultrasound.
Stable appearance of multiple nodules throughout the lungs, concerning for metastatic disease.
Stable appearance of moderately sized right pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Stable appearance of known cholangiocarcinoma with intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Stable dilatation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct.
Moderate ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 13004**] is an 82 year old Cantonese speaking female with history of DVT, PE, pulmonary nodules, and liver lesions concerning for malignancy who presented with progressive dyspnea found to have extensive thrombus burden despite therapeutic INR.
Dyspnea:  Likely related to her numerous and progressive PE's in setting of therapeutic INR.
This showed extensive clot burden and the superior aspect of the thrombus could not be appreciated by ultrasound as it extended into the patient's pelvis.
A CT torso was then performed which showed extensive clot burden with a large thrombus in the lower infrarenal IVC extending into the proximal bilateral common iliac veins.
A new pulmonary embolus was also noted.
Since the patient was continuing to develop thrombus in the setting of a therapeutic INR, it was felt an IVC filter should be initiated immediately.
Regarding the patient's left pleural effusion that may be contributing mildly to dyspnea, IP was consulted.
She was tachypneic and required 6L NC to maintain sats.
A CXR revealed progressive accumulation of effusion and she requires a thoracentesis which drained 1.2 Liters of transudative effusion.
Pleurex catheter placement was considered for a subsequent right-sided pleural effusion but it was felt there was not enough pleural fluid to warrant placement.
Cholangiocarcinoma:  She had a new diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma on this admission.
Given the need to decompress the patient's bile ducts to reduce the risk of cholangitis with a liver guided biopsy, an ERCP was performed [**5-14**].
Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreatico-biliary origin.
She was not felt to be a candidate at this time for chemotherapy given her respiratory status and overall weakness.
Hypothyroidism: Her dose of levothyroxine was increased due to a high TSH.
