IMPRESSION: In comparison with the prior examination dated [**2153-10-31**], there is evidence of mild decrease in size of the lateral ventricles, the previously intraventricular hemorrhage identified on the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is no longer visualized.
Mild intraventricular hemorrhage is identified in the left frontal ventricular horns and adjacent to the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
No detrimental changes are identified in the interim.
No complication.
History of diffuse SAH, intubated for airway protection.
No pneumothorax has developed.
No acute parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and thus chest findings are unaltered in comparison with a previous study.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced MDCT-acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases show mild dependent atelectasis.
No other focal hepatic lesion is identified.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is moderately severe right-sided hydroureteronephrosis secondary to an 11 mm stone in the proximal mid ureter (2:43).
The intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain a normal caliber without evidence of obstruction.
There is no lymphadenopathy, free air, or free fluid.
The abdominal aorta shows mild atherosclerotic calcification.

Degenerative changes are seen involving the lower lumbar spine most notably involving L5-S1 with disc space narrowing, marginal osteophyte, and endplate sclerosis.
IMPRESSION: Moderately severe right-sided hydroureteronephrosis secondary to a 11 mm stone in the proximal mid ureter.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No masses or vegetations on mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis, but cannot be fully excluded due to subotpimal images.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic root dilation.
There was no apparent change in the background to external (including noxious stimuli).
ABNORMALITY #2: There were less prominent bursts of generalized delta slowing.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal or lateralized abnormality, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
