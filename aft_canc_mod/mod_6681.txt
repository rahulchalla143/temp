Microbiology: - Blood culture ([**2135-6-19**]): pending - Urine culture ([**2135-6-19**]): negative   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 24yoF with metastatic breast cancer currently on chemo/XRT who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for laryngoedema, and who was found to have supraglottic edema likely related to her therapy.
# SUPRAGLOTTIC EDEMA:  Her globus, odynophagia, and dysphagia are driven by the edema noted on her laryngeal examination.
The inflammatory effects of radiation therapy compounded by chemo-induced emesis and recent thrush are probably causing this edema.
She was instructed to have a follow up with her primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week of her discharge  # POSITIVE UA:  She has leuks few bacteria on UA.
Due to her poor immune status from chemo, she received a dose of ceftriaxone in the ED.
# METASTATIC BREAST CANCER.
Poor prognosis with widely metastatic disease, undergoing palliative chemo/rads.
She had Dilaudid for pain control.
