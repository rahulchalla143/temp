Differential diagnosis includes seizure, syncope, infection, intracranial mass.
Description of episode, LOC without immediate recovery is more consistent with seizure than syncope.
Pertinent negatives include normal CSF, CT scan unchanged without any acute bleed or midline shift.
Episode seems less likely to be syncope given association with headache, however she was placed on telemetry.
EEG for 20 minute showed short runs of sharp waves concerning for seizure activity, and so 24-hour EEG was recommended.
Patient denied any seizure activity or loss of consciousness.
(2) Headache:  Patient with 1-2 months of headaches that are increasing in frequency and now associated with loss of consciousness and vomiting.
Patient has a history of migraine headaches prior to diagnosis of breast cancer.
CT scan ruled out acute bleed or midline shift.
CSF with no evidence of infection.
She was started on morphine 2-5 mg q 4hrs prn pain with continuation of gabapentin prn and cyclobenzaprine as needed.
This oral morphine seemed to control her pain well and pt was satisfied with pain control regimen.
No evidence of infection (unchanged chest X-ray, normal CSF, normal urinalysis, denies fever, chills, or nightsweat).
Patient's oncologist informed who believes this is most likely secondary to Neulasta and dexamethasone.
(4) Metastatic Breast Cancer:  Patient is s/p lumpectomy with chemo and radiation therapy.
Metastatic disease to lung, [**Month/Year (2) 500**], brain, leptomeningeal disease.
(5) CAD s/p MI with Stent: - continued ASA, crestor - Plavix on hold for possible blood patch, this was restarted as the pain service does not want to pursue a blood patch.
