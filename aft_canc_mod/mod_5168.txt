Microscopic dissection.
The patient is a 76-year-old retired physician who was referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] for a recurrent atypical melanoma that has metastasized to the paranasal sinus.
He now returns with progressive obstruction of airway and imaging revealing an extensive metastasizing tumor growing in the paranasal sinus.

Pertinent Results: CT [**2131-5-14**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post bifrontal craniotomy for extirpation of extensive metastatic (melanoma) involvement of the cribriform plate and paranasal sinuses.
Post-surgical changes including bifrontal craniotomy and cranialization of the frontal sinuses, with osseous metallic plates unchanged in configuration although and mild increase of complex fluid is demonstrated within the intracranial post-surgical bed.
Degree of pneumocephalus has decreased since prior study, yet right frontal subgaleal air has increased in the interim.
Linear region of calcified hyperattenuation separating the cerebral hemispheres from the post- craniotomy fluid collection remains stable; however, the degree of mass effect upon the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles has decreased, suggesting decreasing edema within the cerebral hemispheres.
No shift of normally-midline structures is demonstrated.
A large amount of hemorrhage and opacification is again demonstrated within the right maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses extending into the posteriorly-deroofed frontal sinuses which is contiguous with the intracranial postsurgical bed.
An unusual linear collection of air is demonstrated within the post-surgical fluid collection, possibly collecting underneath a faint septation or fibrous band (2:23).
No intracranial drain is identified to otherwise account for this finding (and none is mentioned in the operative report).
Mild increase in complex fluid within the post-surgical bed with shift of pneumocephalus, extracranially, to the right frontal subgaleal space.
Decreased effacement of bilateral frontal horns suggests decreased edema within bilateral cerebral hemispheres, with decreased mass effect.
No new intracranial herniation or shift of normally-midline structures demonstrated.
MRI Head [**2131-5-12**]: FINDINGS: There is an enormous collection of gas, with a 2-tiered fluid level, with T2 hyperintense components superiorly and T2 hypointense components on the more dependent side of the fluid collection.
This area/fluid mixture lies in the extradural compartment, and presumably connects with the operative bed.
There is a considerable amount of fluid within the right maxillary sinus, with loss of aeration of the sphenoid sinus, particularly on the right side, as well as considerable high T2 signal, with some fluid levels within the mastoid sinuses.
Within the operative bed is a mixture of T2 signal, some of which appears similar in distribution to the preoperative images of the tumor seen near the posterior aspect of the right cribriform plate.
The large frontal air-fluid collection causes marked compression of the brain, with telescoped appearance of the corpus callosum.
Marked compression of the frontal horns is seen, but there is no subfalcine or transtentorial herniation.
There is considerable pachymeningeal enhancement throughout the supratentorial region.
There is no area of pathological enhancement within the brain parenchyma itself.
CONCLUSION: Large intracranial gas/fluid collection posteriorly displacing the frontal lobes.
Mild increase in complex fluid within the post-surgical bed with shift of pneumocephalus, extracranially, to the right frontal subgaleal space.
Decreased effacement of bilateral frontal horns suggests decreased edema within bilateral cerebral hemispheres, with decreased mass effect.
No new intracranial herniation or shift of normally-midline structures demonstrated.
EKG [**5-16**]: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature complexes in bigeminy pattern Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes,No previous tracing available for comparison   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 93 156 90 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 64685**]    Brief Hospital Course: Patient was electively admitted on [**5-10**] for previously planned bifrontal craniotomy with Drs.
On [**5-13**], he continued to have persistent lethargy and a repeated head CT was performed, revealing some sulcal effacement.
On [**5-16**] he had a short burst of bigeminy, remaining normotensive.
On the morning of [**5-18**], he was discharged accordingly with instructions to follow up with his home oncologist; and instructions for suture removal.
