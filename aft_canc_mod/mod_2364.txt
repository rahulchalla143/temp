Admission Date:  [**2178-9-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-10-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2142-5-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Blue Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 43972**] is a 36-year-old male with a past medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated approximately 15 years ago with staging laparotomy, splenectomy and nodal sampling followed by x-ray radiation therapy, the subsequent diagnosis two years ago of ITP with evidence of splenosis by CT scan, which was treated with Prednisone IgG, and recently treated with Rituxan with good effect.
He presented approximately one month ago with severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis and started on coumadin after being heparinized.
He presented to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2178-5-27**] with 2-3 day history of increasing abdominal pain on the right side.
CT scan was obtained from an outside hospital which demonstrated a focal area of small bowel wall thickening, portal vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
It was felt at that time that patient was experiencing worsening mesenteric ischemia and was admitted for exploratory laparotomy to assess the viability of his small bowel.
5) Restless leg syndrome.
Abdominal exam showed a firm abdomen with right sided tenderness, no shake tenderness, no cough tenderness.
The CAT scan on admission from the outside hospital again showed small bowel wall thickening, portal vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
This scan showed new free fluid within the abdomen with the same focal area of small bowel showing signs of ischemia.
Given the severe pain and clinical exam as well as CT findings, consent was obtained to proceed with the exploratory laparotomy.
Exploratory laparotomy was performed with the preoperative diagnosis of ischemic bowel.
It was found that all other small and large bowel was viable .
The patient was left intubated following his operation, given his bowel edema and otherwise guarded status.
Hematology/Oncology was asked to see the patient for management of his portal vein and splenic vein thrombosis and his new diagnosis of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis given his history of Hodgkin's disease and ITP.
At that time the patient's goal PTT should be 55, to maintain adequate anticoagulation given his venous thrombosis.
Overnight from [**2178-9-27**] to [**2178-9-28**] the patient was extubated and began to complain of pain at incision.
Heparin previously at 1400 units had only elevated his PTT to a value of 45.2.
The patient was also noted to have a declining platelet count from 88 to 66.
There is concern at this time that given the patient's history of prior exposure to Heparin, his current Heparin drip, the patient might be experiencing Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
The patient continued to do well the day of [**2178-9-28**] with continued complaints of incisional pain.
Overnight from [**2178-9-28**] to [**2178-9-29**] the patient was noted to have a mild amount of delirium.
Given the concern about the patient's possible platelet decline being due to Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was begun on Lepirudin on Tuesday, [**2178-9-28**] and was continued to [**2178-9-29**].
On day of [**2178-9-29**] the patient continued to do well, his pain was better controlled with increased PCA dose.
Also on [**2178-9-30**] the patient's Heparin induced thrombocytopenia came back negative and it was decided to restart his Heparin at that time.
The patient was also noted to be coughing up a small amount of bright red blood on [**9-30**] and it was felt at this time this was old clot and did not represent active bleeding in this patient.
On [**2178-9-30**] the patient's negative Heparin induced thrombocytopenia panel was felt that his platelet drop was most likely due to recurrence of his ITP and it was decided at that time to give IVIG of 1 gm/kg in a divided dose over approximately two days.
The patient was also restarted on his Heparin drip which was elevated to 1800 units per hour at which time was found to have a PTT of 47.9 and it was decided at this point to increase Heparin dose to [**2176**] units per hour.
On the day of [**10-1**] the patient continued to do well, however, his bowel function was again found to be slow to return.
His NG output was noted to be moderately decreased over the day and it was decided at that point to discontinue his Foley catheter and continue to try and get his Heparin to a therapeutic PTT value.
However, complained of increased abdominal distention during the day.
He was having low residuals from his clamped NG tube but it was at that time just replaced back to continue suction.
After replacing the tube to continuous suction approximately 200 cc of bilious fluid was obtained.
The patient had a bowel movement shortly after insertion of the Dulcolax suppository.
The patient was noted to have elevated white count to a value of 24 on [**2178-10-4**].
A recheck of the patient's PTT several hours later demonstrated a value of 46.
He was tolerating full liquid diet, his pain control is with oral pain medications, he is therapeutic on a Heparin drip with a PTT value of 84 this morning.
From a GI standpoint the patient is status post exploratory laparotomy with resection of 50 cm of mid to distal ileum for mesenteric ischemia, most likely induced by venous congestion.
Pathology showed no evidence of recurrent lymphoma.
The patient had a low platelet count down into the value of the teens.
From an anticoagulation standpoint the patient was noted to have PTT value with a slightly elevated stay into the 80's.
It was decided that the patient will need long-term anticoagulation given his history of a portal venous splenic vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
The patient's wife has demonstrated proficiency with administering the subcutaneous Lovenox in the past.
