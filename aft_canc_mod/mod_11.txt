#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21 most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of Neulasta use.
Two possible sources of infection existed including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered while gardening.
She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased ostomy output.
As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate.
She was continued on Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than 48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding to IVF boluses.
This is most likely related to her underlying infectious process.
She was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension.
Most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at home doses.
