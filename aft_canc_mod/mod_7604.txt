The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on [**8-19**] after imaging revealed that she had a small bowel obstruction.
Post-operatively she was transferred to the SICU for monitoring and extubation, given her EF of 30% and intra-operative volume resuscitation.
The patient complained of nausea and had emesis so diet wasn't advanced past clear liquids.
Her hematocrit trended from 30.9, 27.7, 23.9 and patient was transfused with 2 units packed red blood cells at which time she was transferred back to the ICU for a lower GI bleed.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended discontinuing warfarin secondary to risks outweighing the benefits, and holding aspirin and plavix until bleeding has resolved.
Patient had serial hematocrits drawn, and on POD 8 her hematocrit was 23 and she received an additional 2 units packed red blood cells.
Her urine culture grew Klebsiella so the patient was started on appropriate antibiotics.
On the day of discharge, we marked the erythema on your abdominal incision in order to monitor if it worsens.
The patient will continue on PO Bactrim for 3 more days for her urinary tract infection.
