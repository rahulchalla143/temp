He reported shortness of breath, worse on exertion, but not worse than baseline.
He also had a GI bleed.
His chronic kidney disease was exacerbated and he was intitiated on HD via a R subclavian tunneled HD cath placed on [**2133-7-2**].
He had been on coumadin for his history of A-fib, but that was stopped in the setting of the GI bleed.

<br>IMAGING: <br>ECHO [**2133-7-17**]:The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No change otherwise.
<br>Pacer U/S [**2133-7-16**]: Limited [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale evaluation of the left chest wall demonstrates a hypoechoic fluid collection surrounding the pacer leads.
<br>   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  <br>MRSA septicemia: The most likely source of infection was thought to be the dialysis catheter placed [**2133-7-2**].
Blood cultures taken at rehab [**7-15**] grew out gram + cocci and cultures were positive for MRSA.
At presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was hypotensive and was started on levophed.
A new R IJ catheter was placed for temporary use during HD with the plan to place a tunnelled line when the patient was no longer septic.
After starting vancomycin, the patient was no longer febrile.
Blood cultures taken on [**7-19**], and [**7-21**] showed no growth.
The other possible source of infection considered was pacer pocket infection.
The patient had a preliminary ultrasound of the pacer pocket which showed a small fluid collection which was most likely postoperative.
TTE showed no evidence of vegetations so further workup was not pursued because the patient was clinically improved with no fevers and no leukocytosis.
<br>Pleural Effusions: CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions which were thought to be fluid overload due to his chronic kidney disease and known CHF.
He had a known low baseline but this was below that baseline and in the setting of sepsis he was placed on levophed.
Patient's electrolytes were monitored daily with the plan to give kayexelate for K > 5.7, renagel for elevated PO4.
On the PM of [**7-20**] he was noted to have a rash over his abdomen and as this coincided with the start of flagyl ~1.5 days prior, and flagyl was D/Ced.
He was put on PO vancomycin for the C.diff instead with plan to switch to IV daptomycin if the patient were to have diarrhea or other signs of C.diff active infection.
<br>Abdominal Rash: Blancing erythematous rash on abdomen was noted on the night of [**7-20**].
This was thought to be most likely a drug rash; the patient had been on vancomycin (for MRSA sepsis) since [**7-16**] and flagyl (for C. diff positive stool) since [**7-19**].
The rash was monitored with the plan that if it did not improve off flagyl (thus possibly a drug rash secondary to vancomycin) that both IV and PO vancomycin would be discontinued and he would instead be put on IV dapsone.
<br>Cellulitis: On admission patient was noted to have R lower extremity erythema, possibly consistent with cellulitis.
As he was already put on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis, no further antibiotics were added at admission.
<br> Complete Heart Block with pacer: Electrophysiology was notified of the patient's admission.
His pacer pocket ultrasound showed small fluid collection as per above, and clinical signs of infection were monitored with the plan that if he worsened he would receive chest CT to further work up pacer pocket infection.
<br>Thrombocytopenia: Patient had a history of thrombocytopenia which had been worked up extensively at previous admission and was thought to be most likely secondary to MDS.
