Admission Date:  [**2193-1-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-1-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old female, with extensive tobacco history; rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
She was admitted for presurgery catheterization which showed elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
The patient's symptoms started in [**2188**] when she was hospitalized in [**Hospital1 1474**] for shortness of breath and new onset congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed mild to moderate mitral stenosis, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with good left ventricular function.
Stress test with nuclear imaging showed mild to moderate reversible anterolateral perfusion defects.
Catheterization in [**2189-9-13**] showed increase PA pressures.
The patient had been managed on medical therapy over the past year and noticed worsening dyspnea on exertion (from house to her car) and occasional two pillow orthopnea.
The patient was admitted today for a mitral valve replacement, preoperative catheterization which demonstrated severely elevated PA pressures, with an elevated PA systolic of 115 and wedge of 39 to 40; decreased mitral valve area to 0.8.
She was transferred to the CCU for Swan-Ganz placement and diuresis management to decrease PA pressures.
Rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis.
[**2192-9-12**] echo shows 3+ mitral regurgitation; severe pulmonary hypertension; mean gradient of 22, peak 38; MV area of 1.1 cm squared; ejection fraction of 60% with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Coronary artery disease risk factors:  Age, positive tobacco use for 50 pack years, quit in [**2192-9-12**].
Otherwise, she denies hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes or any family history.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Carotids 2+ with no bruits.
Extremities:  Right groin with no oozing, hematoma or bruit.
+2 dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally.
Coronary catheterization otherwise was with clean coronaries except for obtuse marginal one which showed 20% mid vessel stenosis but otherwise, no evidence of thrombosis in the coronary arteries.
Echocardiogram:  ([**2192-9-17**])  Normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%; left ventricular hypertrophy; severe calcified mitral stenosis with gradient of 22; MHEA area of 1.1 cm squared.
3+ mitral regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Left atrial enlargement.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 62 year old female with extensive tobacco history and rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral stenosis, valve area of 0.8 and 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation.
Elevated filling pressures of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35 with a PA mean of 70.
Admitted to the CCU for medical therapy and diuresis, to decrease her filling pressures prior to MVR.
The patient had minimal to no coronary artery disease on catheterization on [**1-31**] prior to admission.
She has no history of angina or ischemia symptoms.
Valvular:  The patient has severe mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation with a small valve area on most recent catheterization.
The patient was admitted for diuresis and medical management to decrease filling pressures, due to possible mitral valve replacement.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] of cardiothoracic surgery, and in view of other hospital complications such as fever and patient's overall high surgical risk, it was decided that the patient should not proceed to surgery now, given the high risk.
Rhythm:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions.
Pulmonary:  The patient has extensive tobacco history and was hospitalized for pulmonary edema in the past.
Of note, given her pulmonary hypertension, the team did discuss with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of pulmonary whether he would like to try other agents such as Spironolan or Nitrous oxide to further reduce her pulmonary artery pressure but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] suggested that these agents would only further increase pulmonary artery flow and preload and thus increase the patient's wedge pressure.
The patient will be discharged with home oxygen, as she has now had a new oxygen requirement and will need pulmonary rehabilitation as an outpatient.
Other gastrointestinal issues included a routine abdominal ultrasound that was performed for preoperative evaluation prior to her mitral valve replacement to rule out liver disease.
On this incidental ultrasound, two liver lesions were seen, which was questionable for a malignancy versus hemangioma.
The magnetic resonance scan showed two focal lesions in the liver, 30 by 25 by 25 mm and one that was 10 mm that was consistent with hemangiomas.
There were also gallstones and bile ducts which were normal.
Renal cysts and a 15 by 13 mm enhancing mass on the upper pole of the left kidney and likely renal cell carcinoma were also found.
The patient was found to have an enhancing cortical mass in the upper pole of the left kidney.
Urology team was consulted who felt that the mass was concerning for a malignancy, about 70 to 80% chance; however, the urology team felt that her cardiac issues took obvious precedence above this renal mass and the renal mass could be addressed as an outpatient, once the patient decided about her mitral valve replacement and recovered from surgery.
She will most likely need a nephrectomy, partial versus total, as well as an outpatient flexible cystoscopy.
A subsequent ultrasound of the right upper extremity and right neck was positive for a clot in the right subclavian.
She should be transfused for less than 30, given her mitral valve disease.
Infectious disease:  The patient has been spiking intermittent low grade fevers through most of her hospital course.
Upon discharge, she has been afebrile for several days.
The patient initially had a urinalysis that was positive for infection and was put on Levofloxacin for this reason.
A repeat urinalysis on [**2-11**] did not show any signs of active infection with no leukoesterase, 0 to 2 white cells and a negative urine culture.
Blood cultures also did not show any growth to date related to those temperature spikes.
She chronically had low potassium throughout her hospital course and required as much as 40 to 80 meq of potassium a day.
The patient will also need frequent monitoring of her potassium as well as her INR as mentioned above since she tends to become very hypokalemic and will be in a high dose of Lasix as an outpatient.
Prophylaxis:  The patient will be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin for her upper extremity deep vein thrombosis as well as a Proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal stress prophylaxis and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Mitral valve stenosis.
Mitral valve regurgitation, severe on both.
Rheumatic heart disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Urinary tract infection.
