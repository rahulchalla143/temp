Ground-glass opacification of the left mid lung.
Findings concerning for infection with cavitary lesions in the right lower lung.
There was a deep fistula at approximately 35cm with upstream ulceration and visible suture material.
[**2131-3-15**] CXR FINDINGS: Multifocal pneumonia including dense right lower lobe consolidation with abscess has not really changed much since [**2131-3-13**].
A pigtail catheter in the right lower lobe abscess is unchanged in position and presumably within the abscess cavity.
Overall similar size of large right lower lobe complex fluid collection.
Progression of multifocal areas of peripheral lung consolidation consistent with infection.
No acute process in the abdomen or pelvis.
No evidence for leak around the esophageal stent, only the distal two-thirds were fully evaluated.
Smooth narrowing and stricturing at the distal esophagus/gastroesophageal junction, likely related to edema or esophageal dysmotility in the setting of a metallic stent along a large segment of the esophagus.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Contracted gallbladder, without evidence of cholecystitis.
No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 41707**] is a 49 y/o man with a h/o well controlled HIV on Atripla, EtOH abuse, and recent esophageal rupture s/p surgical repair on [**2131-1-1**] at and OSH c/b persistent leak who presented in septic shock to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-2-23**] with large necrotizing lung abscess [**1-11**] esophageal-pleural fistula.
Surgery for the patient's collection was discussed but due to the parenchymal (rather than pleural) nature of his collection it was felt he may require pneumonectomy but did not likely have pulmonary reserve for this large operation, additionally with risk to re-opening his esophageal perforation or disrupting his pulmonary vasculature.
He had several bronchoscopies and abscess cultures while on antibiotics, this grew coag negative staph and yeast.
CT chest concerning for necrotizing pneumonia on right in setting of suspected persistent esophageal leak, possible fistula.
EGD revealed a defect along the right wall of the esophagus at approximately 35cm.
GI consult obtained w/ esophageal stenting performed and PEG placed.
-[**2-25**]: Desaturation to 90% w/ mild-moderate improvement following suctioning of copious secretions.
ID with no change in Rx; Thoracic with hold TF and conservative management.
-[**2-26**]: Continued copious secretions but stable on vent.
OSH blood cultures reported as: 1 bottle NGTD and 1 bottle w/ diptheria and coag negative staph, suspicious for contaminants.
Pan-cultured for fever spike to 101.8.
-[**3-2**]: Fever to 102.4; blood cultures sent.
Given poor sleep/wake cycle and concern for associated delirium, nightly Seroquel started.
Decreased oxygenation in the setting of persistent copious secretions; some improvement seen with increase in PEEP, continued suctioning.
Free water flushes started for hypernatremia (Na 150), with improvement to 145.
-[**3-3**]: bronched, BAL sent; placed on CMV afterwards due to resp distress w/ goal to wean back to CPAP in am, propofol added for intermittent hypertension/tachycardia -[**3-4**]: ID consulted and agreed with current antibiotics/antifungal although they believe that definitive treatment is right pneumonectomy but patient is not a good candidate surgically; Thoracic surgery decided to do bedside trach on [**3-5**]; consents obtained; throughout the day patient would intermittently become agitated/tachypneic resulting in mild desaturation so fentanyl gtt was added to his sedation regimen -[**3-5**]: Bedside bronch and trach, CT chest, TFs resumed, HLIV, weaned levophed; febrile 102.1 - cx sent; -[**3-6**]: R PICC placed; to IR [**3-7**] for drainage of right lung abscess; spiked fever overnight, no new cultures drawn -[**3-7**]: IP did not find a safe spot for US guided drainage- would need CT guided drainage, fever to 101.7, not cultured -[**3-8**]: went to CT-guided drainage although very little was drained ~20ml, sent for cultures; patient tolerated procedure well; per ID consult: sent for B-glucan and Aspergillus Galactomannan Antigen -[**3-9**]: d/c'd fent/prop gtt; started oxycodone, ativan, morphine breakthrough; C. diff sent, loperamide d/c'd - [**3-10**]: weaned peep to 10; - [**3-11**]: afebrile, spent the entire day on trach collar - stable, ambulated with PT/OT, sat in chair - [**3-12**]: afebrile, PT/OT OOB to chair, ID rec'd CT chest and Bld cx x 3, continue current abtx and drainage per thoracic.
RUQ u/s for elevated alk phos - no e/o cholecystitis.
From a GI standpoint he was tolerating his tube feedings but the preparation was changed to Nepro as he had persistent elevated potassium in the 6 range.
Cipro was added to his antibiotic therapy and a chest xray showed some increased opacities in the RUL and LLL.
3. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Date Range **]: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain/fever .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right lung empyema and esophageal-pleural fistula Bilateral pleural effusions Chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a large necrotizing lung abscess secondary to esophageal-pleural fistula.
* You will continue follow up with Thoracic Surgery, Infectiuos Disease and Gastroenterology.
Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] if you experience: -Fevers > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath, chest pain or any other symptoms that concern you.
