History of Present Illness: The patient presented to her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2405**], on her routine follow up with significant amount of weight loss.
She underwent staging scans which demonstrated a large mass involving the fourth part of the duodenum, possibly the first part of the jejunum with some necrotic areas and air within them; in addition, a second small bowel mass involving the small bowel.
Given the location of the retroperitoneal tumor as well as the necrotic nature of the tumor, decision was made to proceed with surgical resection if possible as endoscopic biopsy would not provide adequate diagnosis.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Hypercholesterolemia - Parkinson's disease - Celiac sprue - Diaphragmatic hernia - Osteoporosis - Esophageal web - Hypothyroid - Polyarthropathy - lower extremity neuropathy  PSH: - total abdominal hysterectomy - tonsillectomy   Social History: - No tobacco - Rare EtOH - Widow w/ 7 children, 2 deceased, lives in senior housing.
Physical Exam: Discharge Exam: Absence of heart sounds, absence of spontaneous respiration, absence of pupillary reflexes.
DIAGNOSIS: EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH GRADE T-CELL LYMPHOMA, BEST CLASSIFIED AS ENTEROPATHY-TYPE T-CELL LYMPHOMA TYPE I (ETCL-I), WITH PLEOMORPHIC/ANAPLASTIC FEATURES.
Microscopic description: Sections show a lymphoma infiltrating the small intestinal wall, from mucosa to serosa.
The lymphoma is composed of a pleomorphic population of medium to large-sized cells with hyperchromatic nuclei with variable shapes (round, doughnut-like, indented forms, etc), and moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Frequent apoptotic bodies and atypical mitoses are seen.
A piece of fibro fatty tissue containing lymph nodes, which is attached to one radial margin shows lymphoma cells within the lymph nodes sinuses.
and shows small bowel mucosa and submucosa with extensive involvement by tumor.
Lymphoma infiltrates the subcapsular and medullary sinuses of lymph nodes present in the attached mesentery.
DIAGNOSIS:  EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY HIGH GRADE T-CELL LYMPHOMA, BEST CLASSIFIED AS ENTEROPATHY-TYPE T-CELL LYMPHOMA TYPE I (ETCL-I), WITH PLEOMORPHIC/ANAPLASTIC FEATURES.
Brief Hospital Course: During her elective small bowel resection for lymphoma, the patient was found to have a large retroperitoneal mass approximately 15 cm in diameter lying over the aorta, IVC in the retroperitoneum, deep to fourth part of the duodenum, and pushing into the fourth part of duodenum anteriorly.
The inferior most aspect of this mass was adherent to a mobile part of sigmoid [**Name2 (NI) 499**] which had perforated into tumor and there were some necrotic parts to the tumor present.
In addition, in the mid small bowel, she had a large small bowel mass which was occluding the small bowel lumen.
There were  multiple large lymph nodes on the small bowel mesentry.
There were no additional lymphoid deposits in the peritoneal cavity on the liver, gallbladder, remaining [**Name2 (NI) 499**].
On POD [**2-6**], she had increasing abdominal distension, pain, and discomfort in the left upper abdomen.
On POD 5, a CT demonstrated a collection of fluid and air concerning for an abscess and the patient underwent laparotomy.
She was found to have bilious fluid in left side of her abdomen and a small amount on  right side of  abdomen.
There was bilious fluid leaking through an opening of retroperitoneal lymphoma through which the sigmoid [**Month/Day (3) 499**] had perforated.
There was no intra-abdominal abscess present, though there was a collection of bilious fluid in upper left paracolic gutter along anterior abdominal wall.
In the SICU she continued to have increasing pain and her NGT continued putting out copious fluid.
She had no active respirations, no heart sounds and no pupillary reflexes.
