Admission Date:  [**2130-8-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-4-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Morphine / Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain.
Biliary bypass consisting of Roux-en-Y     choledochojejunostomy.
History of Present Illness: This 83-year-old woman presented initially with obstructive jaundice.
She was found to have a stricture which was a very short segment in her distal bile duct originally.
However, she also had a very significant post-ERCP pancreatitis event.
After all this settled out she met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and discussed the finding of her biliary stricture.
He was convinced that this was amalignant stricture given the fact that there was a double-duct sign including the pancreatic duct.
Unfortunately, in the interim she became floridly septic from a stent migration process.
On a second occasion after this, she also presented with evidence of cholangitis once again.
Past Medical History: PMHx: AF (not on coumadin), CAD, HTN, Hypothyroidism, Type II DM, Hypercholesterolemia, Anemia, h/o Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **], GERD, Dysphagia, h/o Bronchitis, chronic pancreatitis, periampullary cancer.
ABD: Subcostal chevron incision with steri-strips c/d/i with minimal marginal erythema.
serous drainage (just d/c'd today).
Liver lesion (A): Metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma best seen on level 2.
Gallbladder (B-C): Chronic cholecystitis.
Portion of jejunum (D): Small intestinal mucosa, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Note: Given the histology and the history of a pancreatic mass, the findings are consistent with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
[**2130-8-2**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-7-11**] T wave inversions in the precordial leads are slightly more prominent.
[**2130-8-4**] Brain MRI : Gadolinium-enhanced images not obtained secondary to low EGFR limiting evaluation for metastasis.
Foci of hyperintensity in the left temporo-occipital and left cerebellar regions could be due to subacute infarcts given the configuration but metastatic disease cannot be excluded in absence of gadolinium-enhanced images.
Moderate brain atrophy and small vessel disease are identified.
If clinically indicated further evaluation can be obtained with gadolinium enhanced images following informed consent and consultation with renal service.
No acute infarcts or mass effect seen.
No evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis.
*RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
*AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
*MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferoseptal hypokinesis (most c/w CAD).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
No left ventricular thrombus seen.
A palliative procedure was done due to positive liver metastasis.
See Operative note for specific details.
Her pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.
Over the first few post operative days, she was very weak and was unable to do much for herself as she had no stamina.
She was unable to stand with assistance, required a [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift to get out of bed, and had generalized muscle weakness.
The neurology service followed her closely post-operatively, and a brain MRI was done to rule out metastatic disease.
After reviewing the study with the neurology radiologists, it was felt the picture was most indicative of a subacute stroke.
This prompted lower extremity venous studies and trans-thoracic echocardiogram to rule out a source of a thrombus, which were unremarkable.
Pain was initially well controlled with a Dialudid PCA, which was transitioned to Dilaudid PO plus Acetaminophen PRN for pain control with good effect.
A urine performed on [**Last Name (STitle) **]#2 was consistent with a UTI, for which she received a three day course of Ciprofloxacin with symptomatic resolution.
At the time of discharge on [**2130-8-10**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a diabetic regular diet, voiding with assistance due to immobility, and pain was well controlled.
