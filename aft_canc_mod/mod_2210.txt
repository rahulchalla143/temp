The donor was noted to be an antigen B mismatch, noted to have an antigen mismatch as well as to B core positive hepatitis B.
The patient had been doing very well as an outpatient until a couple of weeks ago when she is noted to have some blasts in the peripheral smear.
Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate revealed full both morphological and cytogenetic evidence of disease relapse, noted at that to be 98% donor.
She was rapidly tapered off immunosuppression in order to stimulate the donor T cells to hopefully initiated graft versus leukemia effect.
She has had no clear evidence of GVH at this time, did develop a maculopapular rash and spotty areas around the neck, back, torso, arms, and legs, which was very pruritic, was evaluated by dermatology who thought that perhaps it was an eczematous process possibly brought on by MRI contrast and was not thought to be GVH, treated empirically initially with Lidex ointment and then switched to triamcinolone cream with almost complete resolution of the rash.
She recently has not had any evidence of circulating blasts in her peripheral smear.
The patient reports that the rash had almost completely resolved until a day or so ago when she had recrudescence of some of her symptoms, started to use the triamcinolone cream again and her symptoms have improved.
She does continue to have some mild pruritus in her chest and back.
She notes some pressure behind her right eye and has not really had any headaches over the last couple of days but did have some headaches a few weeks ago.
Otherwise, denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
Denies any bleeding or bruising difficulties.
Denies any fever, chills, or night sweats.
Denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or any other cardiac or respiratory difficulties.
Denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.

Erythrocytes show anisopoikilocytosis with ovalocytes, dacrocytes.
Erythroid precursors are markedly decreased with megaloblastic changes.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and present in small clusters.
Megakaryocytes are decreased with hypolobated forms and cells with disjointed nuclei.
There is borderline left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study images reviewed) of [**2192-6-27**], there is now a small pericardial effusion.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Persistent opacification of the right frontal sinus, anterior right ethmoid air cell, and right maxillary sinus, the latter of which is not completely included in the field of view.
Echo [**2193-2-3**]: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of mildly increased pericardial pressures and global biventricular hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-9**], the pericardial effusion is larger (previously very small) and global biventricular systolic dysfunction are now evident.
These findings are suggestive of myopericarditis or other diffuse process.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion (maximal posteriorly @ 1.9 cm, minimal anteriorly at 0.8 cm).
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
Compared to the prior study dated [**2193-2-6**], there is no change.
These findings are suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressures.
Given the samll IVC size and normal respirophasic variation, a component of intravascular volume depletion should be considered.
She has been pancytopenic and has required platelet and blood transfusions to keep her crit > 25 and plt > [**9-21**].
After MEC a bone marrow was performed which showed a hypocellular marrow with 85-90% blasts.
DLI was not given after the patient became hemodynamically unstable [**1-4**] pericardial tamponade and bilateral pulmonary edema.
A decision was made to make the patient comfort measures and not pursue further aggressive treatment given worsening bilateral pleural effusions and persistent tamponade in the setting of disease recurrence.
Patient remained neutropenic thoughout this admission and started to spike fever >102 on [**1-15**] and was started on vancomycin and meropenem.
On [**1-21**], pt developed a rash and it was thought to be due to meropenem although the patient had meropenem in the past without problem.
On [**1-24**], the patient developed diarrhea and c dif cultures were sent and are pending.
In addition, head CT showed some opacification of ethmoid and frontal sinuses.
The patient was switched briefly to Aztreonam but this too worsened her rash and she was switched back to Gentamicin for gram negative coverage.
Her left subclavian line was discontinued given that it was thought to be contributing to her fevers but the patient continued to spike despite the line being removed.
She was eventually broadened to Posaconazole/Gentamicin/Vancomycin/Flagyl but continued to spike fevers of unclear etiology despite multiple blood cultures.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pericardial tamponade, the patient continued to spike fevers up to 102.
She was found to have recurrent disease in her bone marrow.
A discussion with the patient and her family was held and a decision was made to make the patient comfort care given her aggressive disease and worsening clinical course with worsening respiratory distress from her pulmonary edema and pericardial tamponade.
She was given standing Tylenol to prevent fevers and make the patient comfortable.
# Skin rash- Thought to be due to meropenem which was stopped [**1-23**] and restarted on [**1-26**] for better gram neg coverage as she was still spiking temps.
Dermatology saw the patient and a biopsy showed spongiotic changes which were thought to be more likely consistent with drug rash although GVHD could not be ruled out.
She was given Triamcinolone cream for symptomatic relief and the rash slowly improved when she was switched off Meropenem/Aztreonam to Gentamicin.
# Mucositis- Patient developed mucositis after reinduction with MEC.
She was also being covered for viral and fungal causes with fluconazole and acyclovir.
Her pain was well-controlled with a fentanyl pca and improved during her stay.
# Hypothyroidism- Continued on home dose of levothyroxine.
# History of Hep B positive donor- Continued prophylaxis with lamivudine.
# Pericardial effusion and Tamponade Physiology: On the day of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was found to have increased SOB and increasing O2 requirement.
A chest CT showed evidence of a pericardial effusion and TTE showing RA/RV collapse in diastole.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was monitored with serial echos which showed persistent evidence of tamponade physiology.
The etiology of her pericardial effusion was unclear.
The fluid collection was not thought to be drainable given its posterior location.
She was diuresed as needed for volume overload demonstrated on CXR.
Her echo continued to show evidence of worsening tamponade physiology.
Upon transfer back to the floor, the patient's respiratory status worsened with tachycardia to the 150s, severe pulmonary edema and increased O2 requirement despite diuresis.
The patient was eventually placed on a Fentanyl gtt for respiratory distress and made comfortable.
The patient was found to have aggressive disease with recurrence of AML in the marrow after the patient underwent MEC.
Concurrently, a large pericardial effusion was identified with tamponade physiology and worsening pulmonary edema.
