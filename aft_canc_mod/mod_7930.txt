No evidence for valvular mass or vegetations.
CT head [**2128-8-30**]: No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction is present.
There is no shift of normally midline structures and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears well preserved.
The size and configuration of ventricles appears normal and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
Diffusely heterogeneous and echogenic shrunken liver 2.
Patent portal and hepatic veins without evidence of thrombus.
Slight increase in small volume of perihepatic ascites.
No hemorrhage is present.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
No acute intracranial infarction is present.
There is partial opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells.
Remaining paranasal sinuses appear normal.
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarction.
No new hemorrhage or edema.
CTA head [**2128-9-9**]: No evidence of cerebral edema, territorial infarction, or hydrocephalus.
No evidence of seizure activity.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Assessment for early cerebral edema can be limited on CT and cannot be completely excluded.
MR head [**2128-9-16**]: Aside from a linear tract in the right frontal lobe from the recently removed intracranial pressure monitor, no focal MRI abnormalities within the brain.
Diffuse mucosal thickening and fluid in the paranasal sinuses and mastoids.
Patent main portal vein with hepatopetal flow.
Small volume ascites, appears decreased compared to prior study.
There is markedly worsening severe pulmonary edema.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo F with no significant past medical history who presents from OSH for further evaluation with elevated LFTs and concern for acute hepatitis.
Hepatitis: Patient initially presented from OSH for further evaluation and treatment after found to have elevated AST and ALT into the 1000.
She had an extensive workup to evaluate the cause of the acute process however most tests were negative (please review results section).
However, patient was found to have hepatitis surface Ag positive and core IgG positive with negative viral load for hepatitis B making her a chronic carrier.
She had a liver biopsy showing massive necrosis.
Patient was started on entecavir for hepatitis B.
She developed a MELD > 40.
At that time she started to develop some mental slowing and asterixis.
staph aureus bacteremia - Pt was found to have 5/8 bottles positive for MSSA.
TTE and TEE negative for vegetations.
# anemia - Patient had no evidence of acute blood loss.
Drop in HCT likely secondary to hemolysis.
# DIC:  likely from infection vs. liver failure vs. medication related.
Patient did not respond to NS bolus or albumin.
On [**2128-8-30**], the patient became markedly encephalopathic and was transferred to the surgical ICU under the care of the transplant surgery service.
The following summarizes the remainder of her hospital course:  CT head on [**2128-8-30**] showed no intracranial abnormality.
Hematology evaluated her anemia and found her to be in DIC secondary to liver failure.
On [**2128-9-6**], CVVH was started for acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome.
A suitable liver became available and she was brought to the operating room.
CT head, MR head, and EEG showed no acute intracranial abnormality, aside from hepatic encephalopathy, to explain her poor mentation.
On [**2128-9-16**], she became febrile, and her WBC count increased abruptly, raising concern of infection.
Suspicion for infection was high, although surveillance cultures up to this time had shown no significant evidence of infection.
On [**2128-9-17**], she became hypotensive, requiring the maximum dose of norepinephrine gtt.
She developed ARDS with severe pulmonary edema with worsening respiratory status.
At this point, she was deemed to have a poor prognosis overall and not in a state of health amenable to liver transplantation.
After a brief period of tachycardia to the 180s, she became bradycardic and asystolic within minutes.
