Her postoperative course is summarized below by systems: Neuro: Patient became agitated and confused with hallucinations on POD1, consistent with post op delirium.
Her neurontin and amitriptyline qHS (for peripheral neuropathy) were initially held given her altered mental status and then restarted on POD8.
She did have frequent asymptomatic PVCs and an episode of bigeminy on [**1-6**].
An ECG showed no acute changes from baseline.
Hem: HCT low 30s (chronically anemic), no active issues.
It is encouraged that she follow up with her primary care physician to discuss another colonoscopy given her anemia and h/o GI bleeds.
Electrolytes: She developed a mild hyperkalemia (without ECG changes) and mild hyponatremia.
It was concluded that her episodic hyperkalemia was likely secondary to her episodic hyperglycemia, particularly during TFs at nights.
She also probably has a mild elevation in total body potassium.
Other causes such as RTA type IV and adrenal insufficiency were unlikely sources.
Her hyponatremia was likely caused by mild dehydration - with an appropriate increase in ADH - even though she had adequate UO and no creatinine bump during her postoperative course.
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution [**Age over 90 **]: One (1) mg Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Anterior floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma.
