[**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1924**]<P> [**3-2**]: Exploratory laparotomy and abdominal washout with placement of [**Location (un) 5701**] bag to bridge fascial defect with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**]<P> [**3-5**]: Exploratory laparotomy and abdominal washout, wedge biopsy of left lobe of liver, placement of temporary polypropylene mesh to fascial defect with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**]<P> [**3-9**]: Reopening of recent laparotomy and abdominal washout with complicated delayed closure of abdominal fascia with placement of AlloDerm mesh measuring 128 cm2 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**]  History of Present Illness: 44 yo G0 African American female with history signficant for uterine fibroids s/p UAE [**2180-1-13**] transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for further management of abdominal pain from presumed necrosing fibroids, acute transaminitis, and pancreatitis of unclear etiology.
Pt presented to the referring facility with persistent symptoms of abdominal pain for the past 4 weeks with associated nausea and vomiting.
She had a CT scan and abdominal U/S which showed "significant enlargement of fibroids and further areas of necrosis in left superior fibroids."
In addition, the patient [**Hospital 1834**] an MRI/MRCP which showed "unremarkable biliary and pancreatic ductal system and pancreatic parenchyma," per the discharge summary from the referring facility.
Upon further history taking from patient, it becomes evident that patient has had a fibroid uterus for years.
She reports that since the end of [**Month (only) 404**], she has had LUQ pain and was found to have pancreatitis marked by elevated enzymes at that time.
She reports a workup at that time which indicated that the likely source was her enlarged uterus.
She had a negative endometrial biopsy and opted for treatment with Uterine Artery Embolization on [**2180-1-13**] with hopes of decreasing fibroid size and thus releving the possible mass effect on the pancreas.
Since then, she has been on a variety of medications for pain relief starting with Percocet and Vicodin, changed to Tramadol and Ibuprofen changed to Morphine recently.
She reports multiple hospitalizations during the past few months for general abdominal pain.
As noted above during her most recent hospitalization at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] she was noted to have acute renal insufficiency, transaminitis,and questionable acute pancreatitis with normal MRCP all thought to be due to mass effect by large fibroid uterus.

This large mass is incompletely characterized on this study,  and could partly represent patient's known history of extensive fibroids.
[**2180-2-16**] CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality.

Status post TAH-BSO and GIST tumor removal , there are now multiple fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior pararenal space, within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical resection site at the base of the bladder.
No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and its main branches.
The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism was limited due to motion and poor bolus.
3.High density meaterial around the liver was not present on prior studies and raises the possiblity of leak.
Small left pleural effusion.

She had an abdominal ultrasound which demonstrated no gallstones, no hepatic lesions.
However, a large abdominal mass, extending from the pelvis to the upper abdomen was seen.
Her bilirubin had continued to be markedly elevated in the 4-8 range.
She had undergone a CT scan of the abdomen which revealed the picture of a small bowel obstruction as well as a large abdominal mass undergoing necrotic degeneration.
There was no biliary dilatation.
Due to an elevated WBC count, Fluconazole was added on [**2-22**], as her intraoperative peritoneal culture demonstrated yeast.
[**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1924**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1834**] an exploratory laparotomy with drainage of peritoneal abscesses and a small bowel resection and 2-layer hand-sewn side-to-side anastomosis.

On [**3-2**], she returned to the operating room for an abdominal washout.
Closure of her abdomen was not possible due to bowel edema.
Trophic tube feeds were re-initiated on [**3-5**], but stopped due to high residuals.

Her wound was demonstrating healthy granulation tissue.
Her tachycardia continued, and she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a CT angiogram of the chest as well as studied of the abdomen and pelvis.
There was no pulmonary embolus.
