Admission Date:  [**2200-4-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-4-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: Nausea and Poor PO intake  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 67M with metastatic pheochromocytoma presents with early satiety, decreased appetite, nausea/vomiting.
He states that these symptoms have been ongoing since [**Month (only) **], worse over the past month.
Endorses low grade temps <100 and chills over the past few weeks.
There, a brief fever workup was performed as the patient had endorsed recent subjective fevers and chills.
A UA was negative for UTI, and a CXR failed to reveal an infiltrate.
Laboratory evaluation was notable for a thrombocytosis to 570 and a Hct of 27.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: [**2171-1-18**]: Diagnosed with Pheo in the setting of hypertension, elevated VMA/metanephrine/catechol, and CT scan showing a right-sided 6 cm mass; Surgical resection at [**Hospital **] Hospital and path unavailable.
[**2187-6-18**]: He developed anxiety, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and pain in back head with hypertension with renewed elevation of catechols; CT shows left adrenal lesions and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy; Octreotide scan showed left neck mass [**2188-2-18**]: Resection of neck mass abutting thyroid, found to be paraganglioma or metastatic pheochromocytoma [**2188-10-17**]: Resection of multiple retroperitoneal masses on the right.
Left retroperitoneal mass was unable to be resected due to involvement in proximity of IVC.
[**2196-11-17**]: Restarted CVD for progression and received four cycles with interval response.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of diabetes in the setting of pheochromocytoma, HTN, and history of incisional ventral hernia.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: BS+, soft, distended, NT, no rebound/guarding, no HSM, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Skin: no rashes or bruising Neuro: CNs II-XII intact.
Interval moderate increase of mediastinal and retrocrural lymphadenopathy and left adrenal mass.
Overall minimal-to-mild progression of the extensive metastatic disease in the lungs.
Unchanged appearance of severe T12 compression fracture.
Overall increase in size of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and portocaval lymphadenopathy compared with prior, consistent with progression of disease.
Probable 3 cm rectal mass as described above.
This may also represent a metastatic lesion.
If indicated, protoscopy/sigmoidoscopy or dedicated imaging could be considered to further assess this region.
A comminuted intra-articular fracture of the distal radius is noted.
There is no significant angulation.
The fracture is mildly impacted.
There may be mild scapholunate interval widening of approximately 2.5 mm.
No dislocations.
Intra-articular comminuted distal radius fracture as above.
Possible scapholunate ligament injury with mild widening as above .
Bulky adenopathy also seen in the pelvis, also unchanged compared to the recent MR. 2.
Dilated loop of small bowel in the left flank suggests incomplete small bowel obstruction given the presence of oral contrast distally within the large bowel.
The rectal mass suggested by the MRI is not appreciated on the current study.
MRI PELVIS ([**4-20**]) There is no definite evidence of rectal or anal mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 67yo M w/ pheochromocytoma who presents with poor PO intake and nausea, imaging demonstrates progression of disease.
His hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration, for which he required ICU-level care.
# FTT/Poor PO intake: Likely that poor PO intake and failure to thrive secondary to disease progression.
MRI abdomen showed overall increase in size of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and portocaval lymphadenopathy compared with prior, consistent with progression of disease.
Patient's albumin of 3.9, suggests that poor nutrition alone as the sole cause of weight loss/FTT.
Poorly controlled sugars (as discussed below) also believed to be contributing to patient's weight loss and generalized symptoms.
# Diabetes: Poorly controlled blood sugars likely secondary to progressive pheochromocytoma.
# Hypotension: The evening of admission to the ICU, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
He received IVF boluses to maintain CVP >10 and required Vasopressin for pressure support.
Likely etiology was sepsis from suspected pulmonary source.
He was continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn and his hypotension resolved.
# Abdominal Distension: Patient had evidence of dilated loops of small bowel on imaging prior to his aspiration event, which likely contributed to his nausea and vomiting.
A CT A/P with PO contrast was obtained and revealed a incomplete small bowel obstruction near the left flank.
Initially believed to be secondary to a rectal mass visualized on pelvic MRI, however re-peat MRI demonstrated that this mass was merely collapsed bowel.
# S/P right forearm fracture: On arrival to the MICU, the cast overlying previous forearm fracture appeaered tight related to edema.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for the concern of nausea, poor eating, and generally feeling unwell.
We performed an MRI of your abdomen that unfortunately showed that your disease has progressed.
You also underwent insulin allergy testing, which demonstrated that you do not have an allergy to insulin.
