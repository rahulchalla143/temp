Admission Date:  [**2110-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-5-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Depakote / Ibuprofen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] (ATRIUS)  Mr. [**Known lastname 66658**] is a 42 year old man with history of chronic back pain, spinal stenosis, on chronic pain medications, as well as hypertension, morbid obesity, and asthma, who is admitted with acute exacerbation of his back pain.
He was lying down when he noticed pain in his neck radiating down the spine to his feet/legs.
The pain was so intense that he had to rush to the car (he reports that his son carried him to the car).
He has numbness and tingling in his feet but is able to ambulate with severe pain.
He complained of chest pain, sharp, substernal, without radiation or associated symptoms.
CXR and CTA showed no obvious etiology.
He was given Toradol x 1 and dilaudid x 1 and subsequently admitted to the hospital for further pain control.
Additional information was obtained from the PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a long history of acute episodes of back pain; most of which do not result in admission.
He is quite concerned about the "tumors" in his back (epidural lipomatosis), but his most recent MRI shows no evidence of cord compression.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension, benign -Morbid obesity -Obstructive sleep apnea -Esophageal reflux -Lumbar spinal stenosis: surgery [**2-23**] at BUMC ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.)
L3-L5 decompress lami, L2-S1 medial hemi-faectectomies, debulk lipomatosis [**2105**] extensive w/u for ongoing pain: no further surgical intervention recommended; last MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] [**3-1**] -Epidural lipomatosis -Asthma -Erectile dysfunction -Leukocytosis, unspecified -Plantar fasciitis  Social History: Tobacco: Yes Alcohol: Yes Lives with wife and son   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: General: Well appearing obese man in no acute distress Vitals: T97.4F, BP 118/83, HR 74, RR 20, Sat 97%RA, pain [**8-31**] HEENT: EOMI, PERRL Neck: Unable to appreciate JVP due to body habitus Heart: RRR normal S1/S2, no m/r/g Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abd: Soft, diffuse mild tenderness, + bowel sounds Back: Diffuse spinal tenderness and paraspinal tenderness Neuro: Strength 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
CTA: No evidence of acute aortic syndromes.
Newly occurred bilateral basal areas of opacity.
Although atelectasis is the most likely diagnosis, early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is no STIR signal abnormality.
There is no disc herniation.
There is prominent posterior epidural fat, unchanged, suggestive of epidural lipomatosis.
There is thickening and calcification of the ligamentum flavum at several levels.
There is no abnormal STIR signal in the paraspinal soft tissues.
Sag T2 weighted images of the cervical spine demonstrate normal sagittal alignment and no cord signal abnormality.
There is right neural foraminal narrowing at T2-3 due to prominent calcified ligamentum flavum.
There is no high-grade canal or foraminal stenosis.
Disc bulges are suggested at L4-5 and L5-S1 which do not cause significant canal or foraminal stenosis.
There does not appear to be abnormal enhancement after the administration of gadolinium.
There are some foci of susceptibility artifact in the surgical postoperative bed at the L5-S1 level which appears unchanged.
There is subcutaneous STIR signal abnormality in the area of the lumbar spine which is nonspecific.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of infection involving the thoracic or lumbar spine.
No evidence of drainable fluid collection.
ANKLE FILM: Three views of the foot and three of the ankle show no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
There is a small bony opacification projected between the medial aspect of the talus and the inferior projection of the medial malleolus.
No associated soft tissue swelling is seen.
Small inferior calcaneal spur is seen.
SHOULDER FILM: No previous images.
Degenerative changes are seen about the glenohumeral joint.
Normal thoracic aorta with no evidence of dissection.
One perifissural nodule and one subpleural nodule measuring 4 mm each.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 male with multiple medical problems including obstructive sleep apnea and chronic back pain admitted on [**2110-5-2**] for worsening back pain with hospital course complicated by fever and altered mental status.
BACK PAIN: Patient with a longstanding history of chronic lower back after sustaining a fall s/p multiple spinal surgeries at outside hospital admitted with worsening back pain with relatively normal neurological exam.
During this hospital course, he spiked a temperature to 103 requiring a cooling blanket.
The neurosurgery service was consulted for concern for infectious spinal processes given his back pain and fever.
An MRI was performed that showed no evidence of fluid collection or infectious spinal process or any other process requiring acute intervention.
His pain was controlled with his home dose narcotics in addition to ketorolac, which he received for 48 hours, and lidocaine patch.
On discharge he was ambulating without assistance and felt his back pain was well controlled.
He declined follow up with the pain service to manage his back pain as an outpatient.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: He was given higher doses of opiates in addition to his home neurontin and benzodiazepines for pain control.
He became obtunded responding only to sternal rub.
His mentus improved with narcan and being transiently placed on Bipap given his history of obstructive sleep apnea.
Blood gas in the ICU was consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis.
He was transferred to the ICU given his fever, worsening back pain, and altered mental status.
ELEVATED CK LEVEL: The patient complained of muscle weakness and right shoulder and foot pain during the admission.
As part of evaluation for muscle weakness and myalgia CK have been monitored.
It is possible that he developed rhabdomylosis in the setting of being obtunded and not mobile for >24 hours although renal function was at baseline at that time and electrolytes were largely normal (urine myoglobin pending at d/c).
His exam was not consistent with septic joints and blood cultures were negative.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered given his use of risperidol although there was no evidence of muscle rigidity or autonomic instability.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: His creatinine increased from baseline of 1 to 1.8 also with evidence of urinary retention.
Urinalysis showed trace blood with normal culture.
This was likely due to increased doses of opiates.
His renal function returned to baseline and there he was voiding without difficulty at discharge.
PNEUMONIA: The patient had was found to have a perihilar infiltrate on his chest film when he was being evaluated for altered mental status and fever.
Given the absence of respiratory complaints these were discontinued.
HYPOTHYROID: TSH was borderline high and T4 was pending on discharge.
SHOULDER PAIN: He complained of right shoulder pain in the ICU.
Bacteremia and possible septic joint considered given joint pain and fever but blood cultures no growth to date and exam was not consistent with infectious etiology.
An x-ray showed degenerative changes.
There was rapid improvement in pain and range of motion within 24-36 hours and he was at baseline on discharge.
#ELEVATED LFT: He had a mildly elevated hepatocellular pattern LFTs as well as LDH.
This was likely due to myolysis.
# NOTE: The Chest CTA showed pulmonary nodules that needs to be followed up with interval CT as he is a smoker and at risk for cancer.
