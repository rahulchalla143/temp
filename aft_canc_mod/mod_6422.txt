Admission Date:  [**2159-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-3-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy Intubation Central line placement  History of Present Illness: 58 y/o woman w/ SCLC, metastatic, s/p XRT, CHEMO with recent non-response to chemotherapy admitted to [**Location (un) **] with dyspnea.
She was found to have a right upper lobe collapse, and a pleural effusion.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation and possible tracheal stenting.
Bronchoscopy however, demonstrated extensive involvement of the right mainstem, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe with tumor.
After the procedue she developed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
A CTA was performed of chest/brain to eval for PE and brain metastasis.
No PE was seen, but several large brain lesions were seen including a cerebellar mass with tonsilar herniation.
Manitol coudl not be used secondary to pressor dependance and hyperventialtion also coudl not be performed due to her unerlying lung disease.
COPD - unknown pulmonary function.
Hyperlipidemia Psoriasis  Social History: to be obtained  Family History: deferred  Physical Exam: HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] LUNGS: course breath soudns bilaterally, moves air bilateraly, moreon left than right.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
There is even further diffuse opacification involving the right hemithorax with congestion in the left lung.
The possibility of a left lower lung pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
CXR [**2-13**]: No previous images.
There is extensive opacification of the right hemithorax consistent with some combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis, and pneumonia.
CT Head [**2-13**]: Enhancing mass lesions centered within the left thalamus, right pons and left cerebellar hemisphere, concerning for metastatic disease.
There is mass effect with downward displacement of the left cerebellar tonsil and compression of the third and fourth ventricles with asymmetric dilatation of the posterior left ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
If clinically indicated, further characterization could be performed with contrast-enhanced MRI to assess for small lesions not seen on CT. .
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Known mass replacing the majority of the right lung and significantly compressing both the pulmonary arterial and bronchial trees.
There is extensive associated thoracic adenopathy.
Patchy left lung opacity has an appearance more suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 8049**] is a 58 y/o female with SCLC admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, found to have several large brain metastases with tonsillar herniation on head CT. .
#) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure.
She did receive sedation, but she had a bronchoscopy the day prior with sedation and no subsequent respiratory failure.
Brain lesions may be contributing, but no acute herniation event (pupils still reactive).
No PE seen on CTA.
Mechanical ventilation continued.
Given the size of the masses, they could be removed prior to any pallitive radiation, but in her current decompensated respiratory state, is unlikely to offer benefit, even short term.
# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia.
Seen on bronchoscopy, with elevated WBC and fevers to 102.
# Hypotension: Concerning for both hypovolemia and sepsis.
# Depression: continued citalopram.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Small cell lung cancer with brain metastases Right lower lobe collapse Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure COPD   Discharge Condition: Stable for transfer: AC 330cc x 30 breath/min, 80% FiO2, 10 PEEP   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for rigid bronchoscopy and evaluation of the right lung.
Unfortunately, no stenting could be performed due to the extensive involvement of tumor in the right lung.
You developed respiratory failure after the procedure, and you were intubated; CT head revealed brain metastases, likely from your primary lung cancer.
