Etiology was initially suspected to be a lower GI source, especially given her history of bleeding hemorrhoids and known diverticuli.
Initial treament included placing 2 large bore PIVs and hemodynamic monitoring.
Given active bleeding, Plavix and ASA were held and Neurology was consulted.
Per GI consult, she had a colonoscopy on [**2186-1-25**] which revealed continued bleeding to the ileum without an obvious lesion.
Thus an EGD was performed on [**2186-1-26**] which did not reveal an upper GI source of bleeding.
She has residual R eyelid ptosis and double vision with no new or worsened deficits.
They confirmed that Plavix could be discontinued given the nature of her stent, but that aspirin should be restarted once she was hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diverticulosis Secondary Anemia Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a low blood count.
You had a colonoscopy and an EGD which showed that you had bleeding in your gastrointestinal tract most likely from a diverticulosis.
You also had multiple transfusions for this low blood count and your blood count remained stable in the last 24 hours.
If you have any other symptoms, please call the emergency room or call your PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain, shortness of breath, recurrent bloody stools, lightheadedness, weakness, difficulty speaking, blurry vision, or any other serious concerns.
