No pleural effusions.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with ESRD on HD, RCC and prostate cancer, h/o dementia who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for evaluation and treatment of a lower GI bleed.
Colonoscopy showed a 10 cm area of erythema, ulceration and diffuse oozing/friability from cecum to proximal ascending colon.
Two areas of erythema and ulcerations were noted in the transverse colon with an intermediate normal mucosa.
He went back to the floor post procedure, but that night he redeveloped a GI bleed and was transferred back to the MICU.
At that point he was evaluated by IR and underwent angiogram with coil embolization of a foci of angiodysplasia near the cecum.
The bleeding slowed, and on [**2136-3-9**] he started to have brown bowel movements.
While the floor he did not have any further BRBPR, and remained hemodynamically stable.
#) LEUKOCYTOSIS: White count on admission was elevated at 19.5, given his loose stools prior to admission there was concern for a GI source of bleeding.
His stool was sent for multiple studies, due to concern for possible infection that could have led to a GI bleed.
However, infection with shigella, E.coli 0157 considered although timecourse of over two weeks with sudden change to hemorrhage and absence of constiutional symptoms or abomdinal pain appreared less consistent with is current presentation.
His regular renal medications were continued, but when his phosphorus became low at the time of discharge it was suggested that his calcium acetate be decreased to twice daily administration.
#) ELEVATED TROPONIN: Given the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 47**] risk factors of DM and HTN, cardiac enzymes were trended.
Elevated troponin persisted at 0.17-0.19, with flat CK and CK-MB.
These troponins were therefore felt most likely secondary to ESRD rather than an ischemic event, especially in the setting of no EKG changes.
We recommend that his nifedipine be restarted the day after discharge and that it be held the morning of dialysis since he has had some episodes of low blood pressure while at dialysis.
#) HYPERLIPIDEMIA/CAD: Patient's statin was initially held while in the MICU, and his aspirn and plavix were also held in the setting of his GI bleed.
His plavix was not restarted due to concern about the increased risk of bleeding on dual anti-platelet therapy, and we would recommend continuing to hold his plavix given the severity of his GI bleed, this issue can be readdressed by his primary care physician after discharge.
He did not have any signs of a gout flare during his stay.
#) COGNITIVE DECLINE: Patient was continued on his home dose of donepizil and risperdal, attempted to maintain his day/wake cycle as best as possible to help prevent concurrent delirium while in the hospital.
PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Miralax 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) capful PO once a day as needed for cold symptoms.
Coagulase Negative Staph Bacteremia 3.
End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis Secondary: Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Dementia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 3583**] with bleeding from your GI tract.
The gastroenterologists did a colonoscopy that showed a large ulcer in part of your small intestine, but they could not stop the bleeding.
You required a lot of blood transfusions, but the bleeding slowed down and you were able to be transferred out of the intensive care unit.
Also during  your stay you were found to have a positive blood culture, which we think was due to a line infection, and you were found to have a urinary tract infection.
STOPPED Plavix 75mg daily due to the increased risk of bleeding 2.
