The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in [**2112-2-2**] complaining of [**2-5**] days of a nonproductive cough, as well as increasing dyspnea, mainly on exertion.
The patient had an x-ray done which was suspicious for a right lower lobe infiltrate and was admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia.
A CT scan done during the hospitalization showed right lower lobe and middle lobe post obstructive consolidation.
There was also a complete obliteration of the right bronchus intermedius and narrowing and constriction of the right pulmonary artery.
There were multiple small nodules in the right upper lobe and several left sided ground glass nodules.
It was thought that these findings were likely secondary to cancer, although other granulomatous disease was also possible.
The patient was seen by a pulmonologist at the outside hospital, and it was felt that there was a probable endobronchial mass consistent with lung cancer with obstruction in the right lower lobe, as well as left mainstem bronchi compression and pulmonary artery compression.
This bronchoscopy showed obstruction of the bronchus intermedius and lower lobe, with severe tumor involvement of the carina, as well as right and left sided involvement.
The patient remained intubated after the procedure due to the severity of the condition and a prolonged procedure and was transferred to the medical ICU.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No history of alcohol or IV drug use.
HEENT exam: Normocephalic and atraumatic with pupils equally round and reactive.
Sclerae anicteric and oropharynx clear, with the ET tube in place.
Lungs: Crackles bilaterally and coarse breath sounds.
Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure was secondary to extensive lung cancer and bronchial obstruction.
Due to her extensive malignancy, it was felt that her prognosis would be very poor.
The patient died on [**2112-3-11**] at 5:20 a.m. At that time, she was unresponsive to voice or pain.
There were no breath or heart sounds.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
