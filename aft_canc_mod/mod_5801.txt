Admission Date:  [**2128-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-1-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Indocin / Fosamax / Diltiazem / Norvasc / Motrin / Actonel  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4583**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness (face, arm, leg)   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation x2 Stereotactic brain biopsy Stereotactic brain aspiration IVIG x5 days   History of Present Illness: This is a 77 year old woman with hx MG for >7 yrs on Mestinon only, post-polio syndrome, who presents with several weeks (and possibly months) of progressive generalized weakness.
In [**7-29**], she developed a GI virus and had profuse vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain as well as chills and worsening weakness over several weeks, unable to keep her mestinon down at times.
She had a headache with this and was prescribed percocet and told to sleep in a soft collar at night to help with neck muscle contraction.
The GI virus cleared three weeks ago, but she still felt weak all over, as if her myasthenia was getting worse.
Two weeks ago she had fevers and chills at home for about a week, which have since resolved (one week ago).
She doesn't even want to walk, because it makes her feel markedly weak.
She c/o no new numbness, tingling, diplopia or new visual changes, trouble with hearing or headaches except as aforementioned.
She did fall several weeks ago and struck the right side of her head, but has not had pain at that site since then.
She has had no cp, cough, dysuria, or recent GI sx.
She has baseline fatiguable weakness of delt at times, has not had recent ptosis.
There is no apraxia or agnosia.
Cranial Nerves: There is mild ptosis after upgaze for 45 seconds.
Eye movements are normal, with no nystagmus.
Pupils react equally to light, both directly and consensually - though there is <1mm anisocoria with R eye slightly bigger than L.  Sensation on the face is [**Hospital1 5235**] to light touch, pin prick.
There is a L UMN facial droop.
There is 4+/5 weakness of neck extensors, and 4+/5 weakness of R deltoid, 4/5 weakness L deltoid.
The R deltoid has fatiguable weakness after 30 seconds of abd/adduction exercises is 4-/5.
There is L pronator drift.
Sensory: Sensation is [**Month/Day (1) 5235**] to pin prick, light touch, vibration sense, and position sense in all extremities and trunk, but there is ext to DSS over the L trunk, limbs and face.
Coordination: There is no ataxia.
Gait:  pt declines, feels too weak to walk   Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: pH  7.47 pCO2  37 pO2  113 *air bubble in tube HCO3 28  Lactate:0.9  [**2128-10-4**] 2:46p  141  103  24  137 -------------< 4.2  29  1.6  card [**Last Name (un) **] pending  Ca: 9.6 Mg: 2.1 P: 3.4  MCV 91 WBC 6.6  H/H 10.5/30.1   PLT 221  Imaging: "CT: IMPRESSION: Large mass lesion of low attenuation involving the right temporal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic edema and resulting in mass effect and 10 mm midline shift to the left with early changes of subfalcine herniation of the brain.
CXR: no pneumonia  Video Swallow: Poor bolus control, including aspiration of thin liquids without spontaneous cough.
Pathology: R Temporoparietal mass Note:  The tumor infiltrates predominately white matter.
Scattered tumor cells are elongated with coarse eosinophilic processes.
Glial tumor subtyping and grading will be included in the addendum.
ADDENDUM: Immunohistochemistry was performed and reveals a high proliferation rate MIB-1 (Ki67) with nuclear staining in >25% of tumor nuclei (block B,D).
The tumor cells infiltrate brain and some areas are seen floating in a loose matrix.
The results are consistent with the diagnosis of high grade malignant glioma.
Tumor necrosis and microvascular proliferation are not detected in the small sample.
Based solely on the biopsy specimen, the diagnosis is ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO grade III).
Radiologic studies indicate a ring-enhancing cystic mass suggesting the possibility of higher grade tumor in unsampled parts of the tumor.
MRI head [**2128-10-28**]: The large heterogeneous lesion with necrotic center and irregularly nodular-enhancing periphery in the left temporal region is again demonstrated.
There is no change in the perilesional edema and the mild shift of the midline structures.
No new lesions are noted.
Post-biopsy changes are noted in the right frontal region.
IMPRESSION: Large right temporal lobe necrotic GBM demonstrated for CyberKnife procedure.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, 77 year old woman with history of post-polio syndrome (bulbar weakness) and overlying myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] on mestinon at home with no past complications, who presents with a combination of fatiguable weakness and myasthenic reaction on [**Last Name (un) **], poor NIF/FVC consistent with myasthenic crisis, as well as overlying cortical sensory signs on the left with motor weakness in UMN pattern, suggesting a focal lesion in the brain R hemisphere.
She was admitted to the neurology ICU with myasthenic crisis and new R temporo-parietal mass on head CT.  NEURO: She was subsequently begun on decadron to decrease the cerebral edema associated with the mass and continued intubation given possible worsening of myasthenia crisis.
No know primary tumor and torso CT was negative.
MRI brain with gadolinium showed the right temporal lobe mass being solitary suggestive of a primary malignant glioma or an isolated metastatic lesion.
Pathology showed infiltrating glioma which was confirmed by immunophenotyping to be anaplastic astrocytoma.
Post-operative course was complicated by a Serratia Marcescens pneumonia by BAL that was treated with Ceftazidine x 14 days.
After discussion with the patient and her family, patient was again taken to OR for palliative aspiration of the brain mass in the attempt to decompress the R temporal region on [**10-28**].
Patient tolerated both brain surgeries with flat cardiac enzymes.
Patient was without chest pain throughout hospital course.
ID/PULM: Patient spiked a temperature and on [**10-13**], patient underwent bronchoscopy which showed thick secretions.
Lavage culture grew Serratia marcescens.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Anaplastic astrocytoma (right temporo-parietal mass) Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]  Secondary diagnosis: Post-polio syndrome - soft speech, occas trouble swallowing Hypertension Raynaud's phenomenon S/p total abdominal hysterectomy Mitral valve prolapse   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable.
No ptosis on sustained upgaze.
Left arm and leg weakness 4-/5 and right side 4+/5.
2+ DTRs throughout.
If you have any worsening shortness of breath, weakness in your arms or legs, increased confusion or any other worrying symptoms, please call your outpatient neurologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 43**], MD or return to the emergency room.
