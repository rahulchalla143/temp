Admission Date:  [**2195-7-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-5-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, elevated creatinine   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right heart catheterization with cardiac biopsy Pacemaker evaluation with atrial and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular lead placement   History of Present Illness: 62M with hx of dilated CM (EF 35%), A fib on coumadin, AICD [**2183**] for non-sustained VT, PV, hyperferritinitis, COPD, irritable bowel syndrome with chronic diarrhea, presents with hypotension and increased creatinine.
In the last week, he has had several episodes of diaphoresis, a chronic issue now exacerbated.
He complains of reduced appetitite and reduced PO intake, partially due to fatigue and partially due to feeling full.
He denies nausea or vomiting.
He complains of mild lower back pain of several months duration, no recent changes.
Increased urinary urgency in the last few weeks, no change in frequency or quality of urine.
He was given fluids (total 3L) and remained hypotensive to 85/60.
Lab values revealed a Cr of 2.1, significantly elevated from last known value in [**2194-10-13**] of 0.8.
He denied CP, SOB, palpitations, abdominal pain, vomiting, HA, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
He was comfortable and complained of no chest or abdominal pain, nor shortness of breath.
He denies any symptoms associated with his hypotension and asserts that his cardiologist is comfortable with BP in the 100s/70s.
Digoxin, Metoprolol succinate and Diltiazem were all given with no success decreasing rates below 110s-120s.
On [**7-16**], TTE was done to evaluate for new cardiac dysfunction, and showed new extreme LV restrictive filling pattern.
This is suspected to be related to possible hemochromatosis, as patient has polycythemia, high hematocrit and high ferritin.
Initially had been planning to follow this outpatient at heart failure clinic, but because patient has been persistently tachycardic there is now concern for connection between poor rate control and restrictive physiology.

There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with regional variation.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The left ventricle now displays an extreme restrictive filling pattern.
ECHO ([**7-28**]): Focused study to evaluate [**Hospital1 **]-V Pacer settings Baseline atrial paced AV delay 150 ms: no atrial systolic contribution to left ventricular filling; LVOT VTI = 17 cm  At atrial paced AV delay 200 ms: still no atrial systolic contribution to left ventricular filling; LVOT VTI = 18 cm.
There was no diastolic mitral regurgitation at AV delay of 200 ms, and >90% biventricular pacing was preserved.
Conclusion: post-cardioversion atrial electromechanical dissociation is present; atrial paced AV delay set at 200 ms. Atrial sensed AV delay reprogrammed to 150 ms.

He is co-managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who sees him primarily for AFIB and device follow-up (s/p ICD for low EF & previous VT) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11300**] at [**Hospital6 33**].
When he went into AFib with RVR, TTE showed an EF of 30% and a new extreme RV restrictive filling pattern.
Due to his history of hyperferritinemia (negative genetic testing for hemochromatosis but patient declined liver biopsy in the past) there was concern that iron deposition could be contributing to his heart failure, causing diastolic dysfunction on top of his preexisting systolic CHF.
A right heart catheterization was performed on HD7, which showed moderate LV diastolic dysfunction (PCWP 20), mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP 44), mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures (RVEDP 14), and a depressed cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m1).
#RHYTHM: Patient was hypotensive on presentation, likely secondary to recent diarrhea and uptitration of Metoprolol to 100mg daily, so his antihypertensives were held and he was volume rescuscitated and returned to normotensive status.
Unfortunately, dofetilide caused the patient to have a brief episode of torsades de pointes so had to be discontinued.
He was finally loaded with amiodarone (not used initially due to concern that it may have caused hypotension/pulmonary fibrosis in the past) and the verapamil and digoxin were stopped.
His pacemaker was then upgraded with the addition of atrial and LV leads (DDD mode), and he is now AV paced .
Echo following pacer upgrade showed that he still had suboptimal LV filling with, so AV conduction delay was increased to 200ms.
# Hypotension :  presented with hypotension to the 80s/50s, not resolved following 3L NS in the ED, but improved shortly thereafter on transfer and with holding of metoprolol and his [**Last Name (un) **].
At baseline the patient has blood pressure in the 100s/70s, partially due to liver disease and advanced systolic HF.
He has had episodes of asymptomatic hypotension into the 80s/50s previously in [**2193**] which were found to be due to dehydration and over-medication with anti-hypertensives.
His pressure were in the low 100's throughout hospitalization and he was asymptomatic throughout.
# Acute renal failure:  Cr on presentation 2.1, last measurement in OMR from [**2194-10-13**] is 0.8.
This improved to 1.4 on discharge, was likely result of initial hypovolemia.
# Diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome:  Currently under evaluation by GI with no clear cause despite EGD, colonoscopy, lab testing.
He did not have any issues with diarrhea during hospitalization.
However, as he had been having episodic diarrhea and diaphoresis prior to admission, the question of whether he had a carcinoid tumor was suggested by his gastroenterologist Dr. [**Name (STitle) 23173**].
If his symptoms return and are suspicious for carcinoid, this will be done by his gastroenterologist.
This disease history is somewhat unclear; as above, he will establish care with hematology for further evaluation.
# Obstructive sleep apnea:  Irregularly compliant with CPAP at home, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea events.
# Urinary frequency:  UOP brisk on admission (100 cc/hr).
# Restless leg syndrome:  Continued gabapentin, renal dose adjustment made .
# Depression and anxiety:  Continued celexa .
# Rib pain:  secondary to mechanical fall 3 months ago.
Continued OxyContin home dose  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - heart biopsy f/u - needs echo in 3 months to assess for improved LV filling s/p increase in pacer AV delay, presuming AFib has not returned - may need 24 hour urine collection for metanephrines if concern for carcinoid tumor   Medications on Admission: metoprolol 75mg daily (AM) furosemide 40mg daily (AM) Losartan 50mg daily (PM) digoxin 0.250mg daily (PM) simvastatin 20mg daily (PM) fenofibrate 200mg daily (PM) tamsulosin 0.4mg QHS omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] clonazepam 1mg QHS gabapentin 600mg QHS OxyContin 20mg QHS citalopram 60mg daily folic acid 1mg daily (AM) MVI daily (AM) Vitamin E 400units [**Hospital1 **] thiamine 100mg daily (AM) .
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response ventricular tachycardia compensated dilated cardiomyopathy SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Iatrogenic Hypotension, not shock Acute renal failure compensated chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure Atrial Fibrillation Polycythemia Hyper-ferritinemia (not hemochromatosis) Irritable bowel syndroms, diarrhea predominant   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were referred to the hospital for low blood pressure, most likely caused by your recent diarrhea and recently increasing your blood pressure medications.
Your blood pressure improved with IV fluids, but you then developed a rapid heart rate and irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia).
Because you have heart failure and high iron levels, a cardiac biopsy was also done to determine whether iron deposition in your heart muscle is contributing to your heart failure (a potentially treatable condition).
