Admission Date:  [**2145-11-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-12-8**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post a stent to the right coronary artery three years ago, several bilateral lower extremity peripheral vessel disease, hypothyroidism, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], chronic atrial fibrillation and chronic urinary tract infections who was admitted on [**2146-11-7**] to [**Hospital6 5016**] with acute respiratory distress, fever and hypotension after an episode of substernal chest pressure, nausea and vomiting.
The patient had been on Ciprofloxacin as an outpatient for chronic urinary tract infection.
It was felt at that time that the patient had sepsis due to urinary tract infection verses pneumonia.
She had improvement with decrease in her white blood count to 14 however, she continued to have fevers of 101 to 102 during the hospital course without ever isolating the source.
On [**11-24**] the patient was extubated however, several hours later was re-intubated for tachycardia and tachypnea.
She was unable to diurese secondary to hypotension.
An echocardiogram one on [**11-28**] showed an EF of 55 to 65%, moderate AI and MR.
Bilateral atrial enlargement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic urinary tract infection, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, status post stent to rhe right coronary artery three years ago, status post left clavicular fracture, hypotension, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], history of a Transient ischemic attack, question of a B12 deficiency, bilateral lower extremity, peripheral vascular disease, question of renal artery stenosis by catheterization in [**2144-12-8**], hemorrhoids, status post hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:  Question of an anaphylactic reaction to Marcaine, intolerance to narcotics.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with urosepsis verses pneumonia sepsis.
Hypotension - initially responded well to intravenous fluids but remained hypotensive despite CVP's in the 20's.
Dropped cardiac output with Dobutamine.
Also initially had a court Stim test to which she responded.
We also treated hypothyroidism without improved hemodynamics.
Atrial fibrillation/Sick Sinus - when admitted had atrial fibrillation in the 60's, occasionally up to 100.
However, by [**12-6**] she had no bradycardiac episodes in the last 48 hours and was off the Heparin because she had a bleed at the right IJ Swann site a few days ago requiring one unit of packed red blood cells for a four point hematocrit drop.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] - with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
There was no evidence of a leukemic transformation just a leukemoid reaction.
Pulmonary Status:  The patient was vent dependent with bilateral effusions and pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction, total body overloaded and hypoalbuminemia.
She did have a bronchoscopy done which was normal and no tissue or lavage was done at the time.
Oliguria - the patient was currently oliguric most likely to poor hemodynamics.
The patient was C. diff negative but had pseudomonas in the urine and was changed to Cefepime on [**2145-12-3**] as it was not sensitive to the Ceftazidime that she was initially placed on.
Sputum was growing coag positive staphaureus that was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive so she was started on Vancomycin.
The exam was consistent with sepsis and without the Levophed her SVR dropped to the 500.
A Head CT at the outside reportedly is negative for bleed or stroke.
