He denies any dysphagia and has no pain.
PATHOLOGY: PLEURAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS  OR SPECIMEN: SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:  PORTA HEPATIS LYMPH NODE FS, ESOPHAGUS AND PROXIMAL STOMACH, LEFT GASTRIC LYMPH NODES, SPLEEN, TAIL OF PANCREAS, OMENTUM DEPOSIT (6).
Hyperplasia and lipogranulomas.
Left gastric lymph node (C-L): Three lymph nodes:  No malignancy identified.
Organizing hematoma and fat necrosis.
Microscopic foci of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm with low grade dysplasia (PanIN 1) 3.
The margin is free of dysplasia, and there is no carcinoma.
Glandular metaplasia of the esophagus, consistent with Barrett's esophagus.
Tumor Size     Greatest dimension:  Dysplasia and carcinoma involving distal 4 cm.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:  8 mm.
IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-15**] - Small bilateral pleural effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis versus air space consolidation  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-16**] - Increased pulmonary parenchymal density which may represent developing edema.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-17**] - Clearing of pulmonary vascular congestion.
No other significant interval change  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-20**] - Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions with increasing left basilar atelectasis or, less likely, consolidation  ESOPHAGUS  [**2137-3-20**] - Normal esophagogastric anastomosis without evidence of leak or stricture  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-3-21**] - no pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax  Chest CT : [**2137-3-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Segmental right upper and right middle lobe pulmonary emboli.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes and a tiny 3-mm pleural-based left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lower lobe atelectasis.
Status post left splenectomy.
There is a simple fluid collection anterior to the pancreatic head which probably represents a seroma.
Small 9-mm pancreatic head cyst.
Diffuse pancolonic diverticula.
Adrenal hyperplasia 8.
[**2137-3-25**] CT guided needle aspirate of abd collection: IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided aspiration of a peripancreatic fluid collection anterior to the head of the pancreas.
His pain was controlled with an epidural and PCA.
The acute pain service was following closely.
His PCA was continued and he was eventually transitioned over to dilaudid po, which controlled his pain well.
CV: Patient developed A. Fib on POD#1 and was started on an amiodarone drip.
He was eventually transitioned to PO amiodarone taper and he converted back to and remained in sinus rhythm since [**3-16**].
His follow-up CXRs revealed a left pleural effusion that was tapped by IP on [**3-19**] that resulted in 500cc of serosanguinous fluid.
His pleural fluid had inflammatory cells but was negative for malignant cells.
Subsequent CXRs showed stable bilateral pleural effusions.
His oxygen requirement remained high despite diuresis and a Ct scan was done and subsegmenatl PE's were discovered.
This was most likely secondary to mediastinal oozing post-op and he was transfused 2 units of blood followed by lasix.
ID: spiked temp 101.4 w/ elevated WBC to 22K [**3-15**].
His blood and urine were cultured and were negative for infection.
His WBC eventually returned to [**Location 213**] but on discharge was slightly elevated to 13.9.
However, he was afebrile and did not appear toxic.
A CT scan of the abd was done on [**2137-3-25**] and an abdomen fluid collection at the head of the pancreas was seen and subsequently tapped by IR and was non-infectious.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: GERD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, distal esophageal adenoCA,  Esophageal adenocarcinoma subsegmental pulmonary emboli   Discharge Condition: deconditioned   Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4738**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abd pain.
