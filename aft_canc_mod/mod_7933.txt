Admission Date:  [**2172-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-9-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-11-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: postcoital bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. exploratory laparotomy, periaortic lymph node dissection, supralevator pelvic exenteration, ileal ureteral conduit + redo with side-side reanastomsis (by GU), sigmoid neovagina (by Plastics), low rectal anastamosis, J-flap omentopexy with transverse loop colostomy 2. re-exploration, repair of ileal conduit, rigid rectosigmoidoscopy 3. exploratory lapartomy for partial abd closure with [**State 19827**] patch, maturation of colostomy, tracheostomy 4. exploratory laparotomy, washout and total abdominal closure with mesh 5. reexploration of abdomen, cauterization of perforating vessel 6.
Drainage of pelvic collection with pigtail catheter 8.
Left percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 38 yo G3P1021 s/p radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy on [**2171-10-15**] for Stage Ib1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the cervix, s/p 6 cycles of cisplatin and pelvic radiation for involvement of two regional lymph nodes, who presented with vaginal bleeding.
A Pap smear and biopsy of a right vaginal apex thickening on [**2172-5-21**] revealed recurrent adenocarcinoma.
A PET CT [**2172-5-29**] showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
Social History: Denies T/E/D   Family History: Significant for a father with [**Name (NI) 5668**] cell carcinoma and a maternal grandmother with breast and brain cancer.
Significant findings included an isolated lesion in R cuff and negative periaortic nodes.
As described in the operative note, the ileal urinary conduit was redone due to ischemic bowel.
She went into septic shock on POD#2, with multiple system failure including liver, heme, and cardiac (see systems list).
Findings were significant for a small leak in the left ureteral-ileal conduit junction, but no collections, abscess or ischemic bowel was found.
Infectious disease and general surgery was consulted.
Cultures returned with E. Coli in her peritoneal fluid; her sputum also yielded E. Coli and Serratia.
The pt, however, remained persistently febrile.
Multiple cultures returned with no growth (bacterial or fungal) after [**6-27**]; a RUQ ultrasound and HIDA scan were neg for collections.
Multiple CT torso scans showed sinusitis (cx by ENT was negative), possible fungal ball vs collection in the R renal collecting system (f/u renal U/S was negative); echocardiogram was negative for vegetations.
This was repeated and returned as mildly positive.
Re-exploration for partial abdominal closure on [**7-7**] and re-exploration total closure on [**7-18**] also yielded no significant collections.
Pleural effusions were tapped [**2172-7-15**] with no bacterial growth.
Her fever curve and WBC slowly improved.
She had a brief period of no fevers from [**7-30**] to [**8-1**].
She had another elevated temp on [**8-1**] and the source was found to be Klebsiella pyelonephritis in the left kidney.
However, she developed an aspergillus infection of her wound.
While on the floor she continued to spike fevers and found to have an enterococcus pelvic abscess.
Repeat CT of pelvis on [**9-14**] showed decreased size of fluid collection.
Given pt was afebrile and clinically improving, this fluid was not drained.
Repeat urine culture on [**9-7**] was [**Last Name (un) **] positive for Serratia.
Urine culture on [**9-10**] showed no growth.
Retention sutures were removed by POD#42 and her wound was packed with wet to dry dressings.
On [**8-17**] her wound was noted to be growing fungus, later identified as aspergillus fumigata; ID was reconsulted and she was started on voriconazole on [**8-18**].
The wound was managed by  general surgery.
The wound improved and a VAC was placed prior to discharge.
She also had a significant blood loss after her closure on [**7-18**] that required reexploration by general surgery, where 1 L clot was found in the subcutaneous layer.
The neovagina was inspected by Plastics postoperatively and there was a small separation near the introitus.
She was gradually transitioned to PO pain meds with excellent pain control.
CV: Pt required three pressors postoperatively due to septic shock.
Echo [**6-29**] showed global biventricular hypokinesis likely from sepsis, EF 20%.
Pulm: a. PNA: sputum grew out serratia and E.Coli.
Pulmonary effusions: Pt developed significant pulmonary effusions immediatley postop, which was tapped on [**7-15**].
CT surgery was consulted for possible U/S guided thoracentesis, but the effusions dramatically improved and the thoracentesis was cancelled.
She had no respiratory issues while on the floor.
GI: a. Liver shock: Pt's ALT and AST rose as high as the [**2165**] and her total bilirubin as high as 10 during her septic shock, which slowly resolved over her hospitalization but remained somewhat elevated.
Her LFTs were slightly elevated on [**9-2**] and therefore her Voriconazole level was decreased.
She will continue on this medication until her infectious disease apppointment on [**9-29**].
This showed no evidence of extravasation or reflux.
Due to her persistent hydronephrosis, a loopogram and then lasix urogram were conducted and she was found to have a left kidney obstruction.
On [**8-14**], Interventional Radiology replaced this with a left nephroureteral stent.
[**9-3**] nephrogram was done which showed a stricture in the left ureter.
On [**9-4**] pt was noted to have nephroureteral stent protuding from urostomy,  she also spiked a high fever at this time.
This slowly improved as her fever curve improved.
b. blood loss and dilutional anemia: Hct was kept above 21, which required multiple PRBCs.
LENIs done for persistent fever was negative for DVT on [**7-19**].
Acyclovir 5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Topical  prn as needed for cold sore.
