Her oncologist at [**State 531**] Presbyterian treated her with Femara which made no difference.
At that point he told her that her tumor was "receptor negative" and the Femara was likely not helping.
At this point (approx one month ago) she developed swelling in her right neck as well.
A week after this, she developed shortness of breath which progressively worsened, as well as difficulty speaking/swallowing.
She also has a nonproductive cough but no fevers.
At the outside hospital, CXR demonstrated a mediastinal mass, no infiltrates or effusions.
She was evaluated by Pulmonary, Thoracic Surgery, ENT, Heme-Onc, and Rad-Onc who all agreed that she needed definitive therapy for her extrinsic tracheal compression and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Interventional Pulmonary evaluation on [**7-27**].
She did have a lymph node biopsy of her neck prior to transfer.
Had recurrence at left supraclavicular node s/p excision, refused chemo.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/crxs  DIAGNOSIS: Excised soft tissue, "Tracheal tumor versus granulation tissue."
Fibrinous exudate with admixed inflammatory and scattered atypical cells considered to be reactive.
No malignancy is identified.
Clinical: History of breast cancer.
Tracheal tumor versus granulation tissue.
Gross: The specimen is received in formalin-filled container labeled "[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known lastname 63638**]" and consists of an irregularly shaped tan-white piece of soft tissue measuring 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm with focal areas of hemorrhage.
The specimen is inked in black, serially sectioned and submitted in total in cassettes A-C.   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 63 y/o F w/metastatic breast Ca who presents with airway obstruction.
She was admitted to the ICU and went to the OR tomorrow the following day for rigid bronch with placement of a Y stent by the interventional pulmonary staff.
She tolerated radiation treatments well without evidence of stridor or airway compromise.
She underwent repeat bronchoscopy on [**2140-8-2**] which revealed boggy/infiltrate arytenoid with narrow glottis and proximal trachea.
A tissue flap partially occluding the proximal tracheal stent was excised with forceps.
