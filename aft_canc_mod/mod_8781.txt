Admission Date:  [**2131-10-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-10-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-2-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: Found Down   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 80 year-old F with HTN, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, mild renal insufficiency who had EMS called after she did not make an appearance for days.
Patient was also noted to have multiple old lacerations on her knees and elbows.
EMS placed a cerical spine collar and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Family History: Mother died of alcohol-related disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 96.3 149/73 (140-150) HR 120 (110-120) RR 14 Sats 98% General: patient minimally responsive to name and noxiuos stimuli, NAD, deep respirations HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, 4 mm -> 3 mm reactive pupils, grossly clear OP, dry MM Neck: Cervical collar in place, no tenderness elicited Lungs: CTAB/l without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, hypoactive bowel sounds, no organomegaly, patient with tenderness and guarding over RUQ Back: no spinal tenderness, deformities appreciated.
Skin: multiple abrasions over body, most notable large echomosis over the R lower ribs .
No overt facial asymmetry.
Tone increased in lower extremities.
Large extra-axial right posterior fossa mass with small calcifications suggestive of a meningioma.
There is significant mass effect on the right cerebellar hemisphere and fourth ventricle, but no hydrocephalus is seen.
Tiny focus of hyperdensity along the lateral left frontal lobe, which is likely artifactual.
The patient's right cerebellopontine angle meningioma has dramatically increased in size and now has considerable mass effect upon the underlying cerebellum and brain stem.
There is displacement and compression of the fourth ventricle, however, there is no evidence of hydrocephalus with no change in the configuration of the lateral ventricles from [**2125-11-22**].
Ligamentous injury cannot be ruled out in the setting of limited examination due to severe motion artifact.
Severe spinal canal narrowing at the levels of C2-3 and C3-4 as described above.
Increased T2 signal in the spinal cord at the same level, that could be due to chronic stenosis changes, however contusion of the spinal cord cannot be ruled out in the setting of trauma.
Spinal cord atrophy at the level of C4-5.
CT head [**10-16**]: IMPRESSION: Large right cerebellopontine angle meningioma with mass effect upon the fourth ventricle and brainstem.
The lateral ventricles are slightly more prominent than on the prior examination, which could be a sign of early hydrocephalus.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
F with HTN, CRI, GERD, brought to [**Hospital1 18**] after having found down for presumable several days.
Patient found to be in acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and profound encephalopathy with newly discovered 3x4 cm meningioma.
Her sodium rose slowly to 151 but she could not receive free water due to increased ICP.
EEG was done that was consistent with diffuse encephalopathy.
She was never unstable from a hemodynamic or respiratory standpoint.
On the night of [**2047-10-15**] she triggered for hypotension (sbp in the 80's).
There was concern for early sepsis since [**2-27**] blood cultures were positive for GPC and had MSSA in urine.
Acute renal failure was most likely due to rhabdomyolysis with elevated CK in the setting of prolonged hypoperfusion versus  progressive ATN.
Creatinine continued to trend down during this hospital course though no where near baseline, urine lytes [**10-21**] and renal US most consistent with intrinsic renal disease.
HYPOTENSION:  Patient became hypotensive on floor and was transferred back to MICU for IVF resuscitation.
Likely [**12-28**] sepsis given MSSA bacteremia.
She was on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and MSSA in urine which have cleared.
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis.
NGT blood could be [**12-28**] trauma vs gastritis in setting of steroids vs PUD vs AVM.
Last colonoscopy in [**2127**] showed diverticula and hemorrhoids as well as polyp.Patient was noted to have both blood per rectum and blood return from NGT.
She continued to have guaiac BRBPR and coffee grounds from NGT; however, given goals of care, the team stopped monitoring hct.
5 ENCEPHALOPATHY - Most likely initial event was due to brain tumor causing syncope/seizure, and then she was down for quite some time causing renal failure which led to altered mental status.
Stat CT showed slight increase in size of ventricle and neurosurg was contact[**Name (NI) **].
Given matabolic derangements (ARF) and no evidence of hydrocephalus, there was no plan for VP shunt.
6 Posterior fossa mass - 3.9x3.2cm right posterior fossa mass.
Neurology and Neurosurgery were both consulted in the ED and felt there was no acute issues including impending danger of herniation even with significant mass effect on the right cerebellar hemisphere and fourth ventricle.
There was no hydrocephalus seen.
MRI confirmed larger mass, likely meningioma, with minimal edema.
7 THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Patient's platelets have decreased significantly since admission.
patient is on adequate steroid dose for ITP which also makes this less likely.
Patient does have renal failure, MS changes and thrombocytopenia making TTP concerning, however no evidence of hemolysis on recent labs and no schistocytes.
Could be [**12-28**] nafcillin, however initial platelet drop occurred before first nafcillin dose.
Unable to obtain further history of the incident.
Given this finding she was maintained in C-collar as could not be cleared until goals of care changed to comfort when collar was removed, CXR did not show any rib fractures.
Abraision wounds on extensor surfaces should be dressed as follows: cleanse all ulcers with commercial wound cleanser, pat dry, for elbows and knee apply wound gel to ulcer bases, cover with allevyn foam, change q3days.
9 C-SPINE NARROWING: MRI showed narrowing at C2-C3 and C3-4 and Increased T2 signal in the spinal cord at the same level, that could be due to chronic stenosis changes, however contusion of the spinal cord cannot be ruled out in the setting of trauma.
10 HYPERNATREMIA: This evolved during her hospital course thought to be secondary to free water restriction inate to mental status changes and resolved following IVF hydration with D5 1/2NS.
11 HYPERTENSION - patient was hypertensive on arrival in the unit, which may be due to mass effect seen on CT. Neuro recommends maintaining SBP<160, antihypertensive medications were held to allow autoregulation and her blood pressure actually became of hypotensive as described above.
12  CHF - EF previously 45%, however recent TTE showed normal EF.
currently no signs of volume overload.
13 Hyperlipidemia - her statin was held out of concern for rhabdomyolisis with her fall and not restarted.
