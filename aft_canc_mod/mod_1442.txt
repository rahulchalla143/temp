HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old male, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 7362**] early a.m. on [**2197-9-17**] with the complaints of chest tightness and shortness of breath.
He has known coronary artery disease in the past.
He has had a PTCA with stent to his left LAD in [**2195**], which was complicated by acute renal failure with a creatinine in between 2.5 and 4.0.
He also has critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 centimeter squared in [**2195**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is as follows:  Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2195**] and PCI/stent to the LAD; aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 centimeter squared in [**2195**]; hypertension; acute renal failure after PCI in [**2195**], he was on dialysis, but not presently, with a creatinine of 2.5 to 4.0; hypercholesterolemia; prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy and radiation treatment; anemia, the patient is on Epogen; COPD.
Also, the patient is status post a GI bleed (secondary to infection as per wife).
The patient has diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
His heart has regular rate and rhythm, with a 4/6 systolic ejection murmur.
His abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with bowel sounds.
His extremities are warm with positive pulses, no clubbing, no cyanosis or edema.
His carotid arteries have bilateral murmurs from the heart that radiate up.
LABORATORY DATA:  His chest x-ray was negative for any cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
We will get a Panorex x-ray and Dental consult, have cardiac catheterization, an echocardiogram, and a carotid study, and also have an ID consult to rule out infectious source of his fever and a Hematology/Oncology consult to evaluate his anemia and a possible metastatic workup for his prostate CA.
Carotid ultrasounds revealed no significant hemodynamic lesion in either the left or right carotid artery.
His LAD had a mid 70 percent stenosis, the left circumflex with moderate diffuse disease mid 50 percent, distal 70 percent.
The right RCA demonstrated mild luminal irregularities.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Severe and progressive aortic stenosis, moderate two-vessel coronary artery disease with left anterior descending stent, and severely elevated left-side filling pressures.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2197-9-19**] showed the following results:  Severe aortic stenosis, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation, at least mild mitral regurgitation.
There was no regurgitation present in any other valves.
So, on hospital day number 2, the patient was seen by Infectious Disease for a possible source of infection secondary to increased hematuria and fever, and Cardiac Surgery continued to follow up until given consent was okayed for surgery.
On hospital stay day number 3, the patient had a bilateral lower limb ultrasound Doppler to rule out any DVT for source of fever and possible asymmetry of his calves.
There were no DVTs found on the Doppler examination, no evidence of abnormality, and the day earlier, the patient was seen by Dental and was cleared for surgery as per Dental.
Following a Urology consult, the patient will need a suprapubic tube placed as a urethral catheter could cause erosion of urethra and also need recommendations from Urology to comment on when full authorization for cardiopulmonary bypass is safe status post a placement of the suprapubic catheter.
Throughout the last nine days of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he has been followed by Medicine, Cardiology, Nephrology, Infectious Disease, Physical Therapy, and Hematology/Oncology in the need to find any source of infection following his renal status and following his CHF status and his anemia.
The patient has also received several blood transfusions secondary to a decreased hematocrit during the last week.
On [**2197-9-28**], which was hospital day number 11, the patient had a Foley inserted with the help of cystoscopy and pelvic ultrasound guidance, and was planned for surgery the next day, which would be [**2197-9-29**].
The patient also received aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.
The patient had a specifically low cardiac index.
Examination-wise, the patient was in no acute distress.
He had received 1 unit of packed red blood cells secondary to a decrease in his hematocrit, and we have been slowing weaning his milrinone.
Following his removal of his chest tubes, there appeared to be a small apical pneumothorax, and 5:30 a.m. this morning, which was [**2197-10-2**], the patient developed a subcutaneous emphysema.
Hemodynamically, he was tachycardic at 106, BP 129/54, and oxygen saturation was 94 percent.
The patient reported troubled breathing secondary to pain.
He was weak, but intact with no focal deficits.
He had rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally with a productive cough and yellow sputum.
The patient was also being seen by physicians from [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to his blood glucose and diabetes management better under control.
Today, it was at 2.2 down from 2.5, which shows a continual improvement.
Physical examination was unremarkable besides [**1-6**] plus edema on his extremities.
Lasix was changed to p.o., and the plan was to have Urology consulted to see the patient again secondary to the urinary sphincter, and now that the patient was on p.o.
Lasix, it was probable to remove as long as the patient continues to do well and ambulating and getting out of bed and meets the criteria for discharge.
On postoperative day number 8, which is hospital day number 20, the patient had no events overnight.
The BP was slightly elevated at 153/69, and his respiratory rate was elevated at 24.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated secondary to multiple medical problems when admitted to the hospital, fever, CHF, multiple medical issues that the patient had in the past like chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, and the patient needed to be worked up for all those prior to cardiac surgery.
His lungs were clear to auscultation with decrease at the left lower base.
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Steri- Strips were intact and clean and dry without erythema or drainage.
His right calf incision with the saphenectomy site had Steri-Strips intact and was clean, dry, and intact.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  His discharge diagnoses are as follows: His coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft x2, aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with 21-mm pericardial tissue valve, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency, prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy and radiation treatment, anemia, and the patient is on Epogen, urinary tract revision with sphincter.
