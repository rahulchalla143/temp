Admission Date:  [**2184-2-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2184-2-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2110-1-13**]       Sex:  F  Service:  C-SURGERY  HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old female with a history of critical aortic stenosis with congenital hemangioma of the chest making her what was thought to be an inoperable candidate for aortic valve replacement, who had had an increase of her dyspnea on exertion over the past three to four months with a previous admission in [**2183-9-9**], for congestive heart failure, being treated with Lasix.
She presented in [**Month (only) 956**] with continued increased shortness of breath for which she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for reevaluation for possible aortic valve replacement.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure.
Congenital hemangioma of her chest.
Congenital telangiectasis syndrome which has required upper airway obstruction requiring tracheostomy.
Attempted removal of congenital hemangioma approximately thirty years ago.
In general, the patient is a well developed, well nourished female in no apparent distress appearing stated age, well hydrated.
Face - positive for right face and neck hemangioma  Right eye with conjunctivitis and hemangioma noted.
Normal buccal mucosa with partial upper dentures.
The neck is supple with right submandibular lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, no thyromegaly, with intact tracheostomy.
Chest - mild rales at the right base, no wheezes.
The heart is regular rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, positive III/VI murmur at the right sternal border at first intercostal space radiating to the carotids.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no guarding or rebound.
Extremities are warm, no edema, no cyanosis.
LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2183-9-24**], demonstrated an aortic valve which was heavily calcified with critical stenosis present, peak gradient was measured at 80 to 90 mmHg with a mean gradient of 53 mmHg.
This plan was complicated by an upper airway congenital hemangioma precluding a direct sternotomy approach.
The plan was for first tracheal dilation which would be necessary for appropriate management in a surgical situation.
An apical aortic conduit on femoral femoral bypass was considered for potential approach.
On [**2184-2-16**], the patient had tracheal stoma dilation and a flexible bronchoscopy which was performed without complication.
The patient was noted to have multiple premature atrial contractions and was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day with good control.
Of note, during the tracheal dilation, the patient did have episode of flash pulmonary edema which was treated with intravenous Lasix with good response.
On [**2184-2-20**], it was determined since the patient had issues with pulmonary edema, and was not an immediate candidate for valve replacement, the patient was transferred to the CCU service for medical management.
Upon transfer, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for aortic insufficiency in the setting of critical aortic stenosis which would also determine further management.
The aortic valve area was 0.5, peak gradient 82, mean of 53, left atrium mildly dilated with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild global left hypokinesis, somewhat severe aortic stenosis, 1+ aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient's course remained uncomplicated with the exception of a temperature spike to 101.4.
The patient remained afebrile and no other blood culture became positive.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was discharged home on [**2184-2-25**], with VNA for continued tracheostomy care, respiratory care and management of secretions, as well as assess for any other needs while at home.
The patient was also instructed to call primary care physician should she have any new onset shortness of breath, which may require institution of her usual second dose of Lasix each day.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Enterococcus urinary tract infection.
Congenital hemangioma.
