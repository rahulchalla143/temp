Admission Date:  [**2118-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-4-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**] Chief Complaint: difficulty breathing, R eyelid heaviness/double vision   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Plasmapheresis catheter placement   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 43 yo female w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10332**] [**Last Name (un) 2902**], s/p thymectomy for thymoma in [**2115**] which was found to be metastatic to lung and abdomen.
The pt now presents w/ several weeks of tiredness, several days of dyspnea on exertion, and 1 day of diplopia.
The pt first started feeling tired several wks ago after undergoing 2 biopsies for staging of her thymoma metastes ([**9-18**]).
The tiredness progressed over the next few wks.
Several days ago, the pt then noticed that she became short of breath after walking quickly.
She describes her sensation of dyspnea as "not having enough air" and feeling tired.
Yesterday, she became increasingly short of breath w/ less exertion, e.g.
going up stairs, cleaning the kitchen, and talking; she also required 2 pillows to go to sleep last night due to orthopnea.
The double vision occurred at various times during the day, corresponding to when the pt felt tired, and was worse w/ horizontal gaze and looking at far versus near objects.
The pt denied any associated eye pain and said her L eye felt normal.
This morning, the pt's diplopia had resolved, but she continued to be short of breath w/ minimal exertion, e.g.
talking in short sentences, so she came to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
The pt had similar sx of tiredness and diplopia 3y ago (but never dyspnea) and was subsequently diagnosed w/ MG.  At the time of dx, the pt was found to have a thymoma, so per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], the pt underwent induction of chemoradiotherapy followed by median sternotomy and anterior thymic resection; she was also found at that time to have metastases to the L pleura.
However, despite subsequent trials of chemotherapy, her metastatic disease continued to progress, spreading to the L lung and possibly L retroperitoneum.
In [**9-18**], the pt underwent several staging biopsies of the metastases in the L lung and a suspicious L suprarenal mass (pathology pending).
ROS: Pt noted intermittent palpitations w/ fast walking associated w/ the recent SOB described above.
Pt also notes mild abdominal pain since her bx in [**9-18**]; immediately after the procedure, the pt says she developed an "infection" involving fever and "yellowish stuff" draining from her umbilicus; the fever and discharge have since resolved, but mild pain persists, intermittent and sharp in the epigastric/LLQ area "right under the skin."
Additionally, the pt denies recent depression or anxiety but says that she feels "very sad" whenever she thinks about her children (9y, 11y), because "they are so young and they need me still."
The pt denies fever (except as above), chills, sick contacts, recent URI, HA, dizziness, difficulty chewing or swallowing, dysarthria, neck pain/stiffness, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain (except as above), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, difficulty voiding, extremity pain/focal weakness/numbness/tingling.
Metastatic thymoma, as above.
Onc History: MG; taken off mestinon and prednisone (per taper) in [**Month (only) 216**]; has been symptomatic since [**2115**] -  Metastatic thymoma.
Diagnosed with thymoma when she presented with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], [**8-15**].
Surgical resection of both the large mediastinal mass and left pleural stripping.
One cycle of postoperative carboplatin and Taxol, but carboplatin was discontinued due to infusional reaction.
Documented to have recurrent disease with small pulmonary nodules, [**2-17**].
She denies use of tobacco, ethanol, or other drugs.
Family History: Non-contributory, no h/o MG, diabetes, MS, SLE, or other autoimmune diseases  Physical Exam: T-98.6     BP-123/90     HR-104     RR-16     O2Sat (RA)-98% Gen: Sitting up in bed, some use of accessory respiratory muscles in neck, appears SOB w/long sentences.
Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid bruit.
Back: No point tenderness or erythema.
No CVA tenderness.
CV: RRR, III/VI systolic murmur heard at LSB.
No dysarthria.
No evidence of neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Diplopia noted on upward gaze x 10sec, o/w no diplopia w/ unsustained extraocular movements.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 43 year old R-handed woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] status post thymoma resection in [**2115**], now with recent metastases of malignant thymoma to her lungs and retroperitoneal space, who comes to the ED for increased shortness of breath and episodes of double vision.
NEURO: Patient usually has double vision with worsening of her myasthenia.
However, her shortness of breath was a new symptom and it was unclear whether it related worsening of her myasthenia or tumor infiltration into her mediastinum or pericardium.
Since she did complain of double vision since being weaned off mestinon and prednisone, Mestinon was restarted on [**11-26**] and settled on a dose of 60mg Q4H on [**12-12**] given sweating and chest pressure with the higher doses.
She also received plasmapheresis for a total 5 cycles between [**11-29**] to [**12-6**] as she remained tachypneic and had an O2 requirement a few days into her admission.
RESP: In the ED, patient had a chest CT with contrast which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Throughout the hospital course she ranged NIFs -30-50, VC 1.0-1.5L and was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring overnight on [**11-29**] due persistent tachypnea, a slightly increased A-a gradient and dramatic decrease in VC 2.4 to 1.3.
Chest x-ray showed a paralyzed lateral left hemidiaphragm which was felt to also be contributing to her shortness of breath.
[**Last Name (un) **]/ONC: Thoracic surgery and hematology/oncology were consulted regarding the plan for left  extrapleural pneumonectomy w/ additional resection of L suprarenal mass given her worsening myasthenia and shortness of breath.
Thoracics recommended an abdominal CT with IV and PO contrast which was negative for new metastases; however, the risk of complication with patient's current breathing problems outweighed the benefit of any imminent surgical procedure.
Plan which was discussed with patient, her family and primary team would be to re-evaluate her after treatment of her myasthenic crisis and stabilization after discharge.
CV: Patient's EKG showed PR depression in inferior leads and slight ST depression in lead II concerning for her cardiac process.
Initially there was concern for a possible pericarditis +/- pericardial effusion, myocardial ischemia or most likely infiltrating tumor into the pericardium.
Per cardiology, patient had no signs, symptoms or risk factors for acute coronary syndrome but CT showed metastasis near the pericardium and so recommended a 2D echo which showed 2+ mitral regurgiation (incr'd from prior), normal ejection fraciton >55% and no pericardial effusion.
Was on prednisone [**Date range (1) 10335**] but then tapered off at end of [**Month (only) 216**] (also was on ranitidine for duration of steroid tx).
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Times 1 year   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] Malignant Thymoma   Discharge Condition: Stable, still some mild shortness of breath but O2 sat stable 95-100% on room air, cleared by PT for discharge   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have any worsening trouble breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain, heart racing, weakness, double vision, blurry vision, or any other symptoms that concern you.
