Admission Date:  [**2170-12-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-1-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-8-8**]     Sex:  M   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left upper quadrant abdominal mass and abdominal pain.
This mass was suggestive of adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon or possible lymphoma.
At that time, a 12-cm left upper quadrant mass near the splenic flexure was identified.
Serial computed tomographies at [**Hospital3 14565**] showed stability of this mass but development of an apparent gastric colic fistula.
Of note, the patient has been complaining of persistent left upper quadrant and left flank pain and recently completed a course of antibiotics for his phlegmon without development of bacterial sepsis.
No fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or hematuria.
He has no melena, hematochezia, and no acute changes in the quality of his stool.
Myocardial infarction.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
His abdomen was soft and nontender.
He had positive left upper quadrant tenderness.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Pertinent x-rays revealed a computed tomography scan upon admission which showed a large low attenuating mass in the left upper quadrant encasing the splenic flexure, stomach, spleen, and pancreatic tail; invading the chest wall and diaphragm with a large left pleural effusion, and a small amount of fluid in the left paracolic gutter; tumor probably arose from the splenic flexure of the colon.
There was a fistula from the stomach to the transverse colon, but no evidence of free extravasation of contrast in the abdomen.
There was no evidence of small-bowel obstruction or perforation in the abdomen.
The patient also had left upper quadrant pain with this, and the nurses found his blood pressures at this time to be 70/50 and 80/60.
He was emergently intubated, put in a right subclavian triple lumen and a left groin cordis with blood and fluid resuscitation.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent an emergent endoscopy which showed a large blood clot in the stomach; most likely a bleeding source from the invasion of the tumor.
A chest x-ray also showed a large left pleural effusion compressing the right side of the lung with mediastinal shift, so a chest tube was placed at that time.
The decision was made to have no chest compressions or chemical resuscitation, and soon after that the family decided to extubate the patient and have comfort measures only.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Death secondary to hemorrhagic shock caused by large left upper quadrant abdominal tumor.
