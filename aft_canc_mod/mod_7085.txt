Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.3 BP: 119/62 P: 80 irreg irreg; R: 22 O2: 96 RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress.
Neck: supple, JVP elevated with prominent V wave height 12.5 cm.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, fine dry atelectatic rales at both bases about 1/4 up.Left parascapular thoracotomy scar.
CV: Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, Gr [**1-23**] hololsystolic murmur loudest in midaxillary line 5th ICS, Gr 2/6 SEM at RUSB, no rubs or gallops, prominent parasternal RV lift.

2+ pedal medial malleolar and some pretibial edema.
Ball and cage mitral prosthesis with normal gradient and at least mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Biatrial dilatation with the right atrium being markedly dilated.
No ascites is seen in the left upper quadrant.
There was a large blood clot in the proximal ascending colon at the site of prior polypectomy.
There was a clip buried within the clot.
There was erythema and active oozing seen at the superior aspect of the clot.
Fresh bleeding was noted from the base.
A small visible vessel was noted.
Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo F pt with hx of rheumatic heart disease at age 7, s/p mitral valve replacement ([**Doctor Last Name 1395**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] mechanical prosthesis) [**2104**], complicated by mitral insufficiency, ?
ball variance/and or paravalvular leak, pulmonary hypertension and RV failure,tricuspid insufficiency and normal LV function, admitted for an elective colonoscopy with need for MAC anesthesia and heparin bridging.
# Positive Colovantage test: Patient has not undergone routine screening colonoscopy however she underwent the Colovantage testing which came back as positive on [**2152-4-12**], indicating that she has increased likelihood of colorectal cancer.
She was admitted for IV heparin bridge due to her mechanical valve (pt must be anticoagulated; at high risk for thrombus) starting [**12-23**] days after discontinuing her coumadin (stopped on [**4-30**]).
Colonoscopy performed on [**5-5**] under MAC anesthesia with removal of a single sessile polyp in the ascending colon.
#Loose bloody stools: On [**5-7**], patient experienced loose stools mixed with blood.
However, on [**2152-5-11**], patient's hct dropped to 28 and patient experienced increased bloody stools.
# Mechanical Mitral Valve: Patient is s/p mitral valve replacement ([**Doctor Last Name 1395**] [**Doctor Last Name **] valve) for mitral stenosis/atrial fibrillation in [**2104**].
For her bleeding episodes as stated above her heparin was stopped at given intervals.
She had increasing warfarin requirement from her usual dose of 5.5 mg with slow rise in INR until therapeutic plateau (2.3) was reached with 8 mg of warfarin Q PM likely related to increase in PO nutrients supplemented with Boost.
# CHF: Patient had an ECHO in [**2151-6-20**] with a EF of 50-55% and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulm artery htn noted.
CXR on [**2152-4-12**] performed by her cardiologist revealed probable small left pleural effusion, no evidence of CHF; BNP was 218 on [**2152-4-12**].
Patient presents volume overloaded with systolic ejection murmur; repeat ECHO essentially unchanged from [**6-/2151**], worsening pulm htn.
Her home medications, including nebivolol, valsartan, and diltiazem were discontinued in setting of bleed so that symptoms of blood loss would not be masked.
Patient was without an oxygen requirement and clear lungs throughout the hospitalization.
#Splenomegaly/pancytopenia: Patient presented with thrombocytopenia on admission labs (plts 79); unclear etiology (heme had low suspicion for HIT).
Patient's anemia [**12-22**] hemolysis from mechanical valve (LDH elevated, low haptoglobin).
Valsartan can be associated with leukopenia; further investigation revealed that pt had a cough with ace-inhibitor.
No ACE or [**Last Name (un) **] was rx'd pending consultation i f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
During colonoscopy, pt had episode of AFib with RVR, and required a dose of esmolol.
#Fever: the day prior to discharge, [**2152-5-24**], the patient had a low-grade temperature to 100.4.
She felt well, without cough, diarrhea, abdominal pain or dysuria.
No hypertension was recorded.
Some concern as to whether Valsartan is causing pancytopenia and may want to consider restarting ACE inhibitor instead of Valsartan.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Elective colonoscopy  Secondary Diagnosis: s/p mitral valve replacement [**Doctor Last Name 1395**] [**Doctor Last Name **] mechanical prosthesis diastolic CHF RV failure secondary to Pulmonary Hypertension Mitral insufficiency Atrial fibrillation,chronic Transfusion reaction alloantibody Anti E.   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a planned colonoscopy to follow up a positive Colovantage colon cancer screen.
You required heparin while you were not taking Coumadin because of your mechanical mitral valve.
Your temperature was slightly elevated at 100.4 on [**2152-5-25**], but you had no symptoms of feeling unwell.
If you see any evidence of bleeding please contact your primary care physician immediately or go to your nearest ED.
Also you have congestive heart failure that causes you to hold on to water in your legs.
If you notice increased swelling in your legs or an increase in your weight please contact your primary care doctor or cardiologist.
Please discuss with your cardiologist what medications you should resume for your congestive heart failure.
Please follow-up with hematology for follow-up of your low blood counts and possible bone marrow biopsy.
