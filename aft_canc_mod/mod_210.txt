Admission Date:  [**2133-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-8-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Naprosyn  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**] Chief Complaint: Lower Extremity Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: paracentesis  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] is a 69 year old woman with metastatic HCC who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] ED to [**Hospital1 18**] with slowly progressive weakness.
She was found to have acute renal failure and hyponatremia.
She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the ED.
She has known metastatic disease throughout the chest, abdomen and pelvis with extensive adenopathy and pulmonary metastases.
Initially she thought her arm strength was normal, then thought that she was having some trouble with her handwriting.
She denies incontinence of urine or stool.
She has felt queasy on occasion but no persistent nausea and no emesis.
She reports a "tickle" cough for the past couple of days but no fever, chills, sweats, or sputum production.
She had back pain (chronic) and was given 4mg IV morphine and SBP dropped to high 80s.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - This 69-year-old female was initially diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 09/[**2130**].
At that time, she had pain in her right upper quadrant and underwent an ultrasound to evaluate for potential gallstones.
She went on to have a CT scan, which also showed a very suspicious looking mass concerning for HCC.
- She continued on RAD001 for some time; however, developed a rising AFP and worsening disease on CT scan on [**2132-12-5**] and was taken off of the study.
She had a CT scan [**2133-2-3**] which showed progressive disease so she was taken off of the trial.
Family History: Not contributory  Physical Exam: -- on admission -- Vitals: T 96.6  HR 98  BP 108/59  RR 16  O2 97% on 3L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Distant breath sounds.
No wheezes or crackles CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 3/6 SEM > RUSB, no rubs, gallops Abdomen: Distended but soft, nontender, no guarding or rebound tenderness, normoactive BS GU: + foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, trace pedal edema.
Imaging [**2133-3-25**] LLE U/S  No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
Bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions, essentially unchanged in cross-modality comparison to the CT from [**2133-2-3**].
[**2133-3-27**] Ascites Fluid NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2133-3-27**] IMPRESSION: Small acute infarcts as described above.
Left parietal 1.5cm lesion suspicious for metastasis.
No intravenous contrast given, precluding evaluation for leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
No obvious change in extensive multilevel spondylosis.
Severe spinal canal stenosis with compression of the cauda equina at L2-3.
Moderate spinal canal stenosis at L1-2 and L3-4.
[**2133-3-30**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
There is probably mild aortic stenosis but the severity cannot be accurately determined.
Decrease in bilateral pleural effusions with improved lung aeration bilaterally.
No new opacities in the lung parenchyma.
Stable bilateral hilar and mediastinal masses   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] is a 69 year old woman with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
She was  initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension, hyponatremia and acute renal failure.
She was called out to the floor, but had progressive weakness from severe spinal stenosis, agitation, and respiratory difficulties.
Extensive family discussions were held regarding goals of care given extensive tumor involvement.
# ARF - Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] presented with an acute elevation in Cr (1.5 on arrival, ~1.0 at baseline).
Given history of decreased PO intake and physical exam, thought to be consistent with hypovolemia and prerenal failure.
# Weakness - Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] initially had some focal weakness in her lower extremities, left greater than right.
This was initially thought to be secondary to a metabolic processes.
On the floor, initial exam showed marked weakness.
Scout films that were obtained were able to demonstrate severe spinal stenosis but no evidence of malignancy causing cord compression.
She was continued on Decadron, but her weakness progressed.
# Hyponatremia - Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] has chronic hyponatremia in low 130s and presented with a sodium of 128.
This improved with fluid and albumin challenges and was likely hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to the patient`s known cirrhosis and NASH.
# Hypotension - Resolved after initial fluid challenge in the ICU.
# Cirrhosis - Liver enzymes at baseline on admission.
Significant ascites with recent, rapid accumulation.
No history of encephalopathy.
Given symptoms and patient presentation, patient was tapped in the ICU for 3L to rule out SBP, as well as provide some comfort from symptoms.
Volume on initial tap was limited given possibility of SBP as well as ongoing ARF.
Ascites labs were consistent with a portal hypertensive etiology.
Of note, triglycerides were elevated in the ascitic fluid, consistent with chylous ascites; this is strongly associated with malignancy, consistent with patient's h/o HCC.
# HCC: Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] and her family had extensive discussions about treatment for her HCC.
Her disease had progressed to include new met to the brain and significant disease burden in the mediastinum and lungs.
She and her family met extensively with the primary oncology team to discuss the rapid decline and the role of cancer directed therapy.
Further chemotherapy was not considered to be beneficial given her overall rapid decline and poor performance status.
# Hypoxia: Ms. [**Known lastname 7053**] developed a new oxygen requirement of 4 L while in the hospital.
However, these were eventually stopped when there was no evidence to suggest pneumonia.
She developed significant agitation and pain.
