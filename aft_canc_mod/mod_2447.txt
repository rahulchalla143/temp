Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
Left hilar/infrahilar opacity could reflect combination of effusion, atelectasis and consolidation, however an underlying mass is not excluded and is of concern.
Chest CT with intravenous contrast would better evaluate for underlying mass.
Findings are very concerning for a left lower lung mass with lymphangitic spread and associated loculated left lower effusion.
Diffuse mediastinal, hilar and axillary adenopathy is concerning for metastasis.
There is severe diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
Findings likely represent pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Diffuse severe coronary artery atherosclerotic calcifications.
Scattered subcentimeter opacities in the left upper lung and right lung apex may represent neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory etiology.

The following morning he had increasing oxygen requirements and was again placed on a non rebreather.
He continued to have difficulties with hypoxia.
# LUNG MASS: The mass is suspicious for malignancy with lymphangitic spread.
This is likely responsible for his exudative pleural effusion.
