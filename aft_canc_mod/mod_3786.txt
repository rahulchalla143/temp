No acute intracranial process.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
No evidence of SVC abnormality.
New left lower lobe patchy airspace opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity in the right lung suggests multifocal infection.
Limited evaluation of the known left lower lobe lung cancer with new nodules in the right upper and lower lobes that could represent metastatic disease versus infection.
CXR [**2167-2-8**] Left lower lobe consolidation is again noted slightly more prominent on todays study compared to [**2167-2-5**], but markedly improved since initial presentation on [**1-30**], [**2166**].
There is no pleural effusion.
There is persistent consolidation of the left lung base, unchanged in appearance compared to prior.
No new focal consolidation is appreciated.
Fiducial markers are again seen in the posterior basal segment of left lower lobe overlying an area of known bronchogenic carcinoma.
The bilateral upper lobes and right lung are clear.
There is no vascular engorgement or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the left lower lobe consolidation.

Admission CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia that was treated as hospital acquired with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin; because she was admitted from a rehab facility.
She was admitted initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension requiring levophed and IVF.
Though initially stable, the patient subsequently triggered four times in 24 hours for respiratory decompensation and afib with RVR requiring transfer back to the unit.
During these decompensations, her HR became elevated in the 150's to 160's in Afib and she became hypotensive to SBP's in the high 80's to low 90's with the first 3 episodes (although she maintained mentation and urine output).
#) MRSA Pneumonia and Sepsis: Admission CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia that was treated as hospital acquired with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin; because she was admitted from a rehab facility.
She was admitted initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension requiring levophed and IVF.
Antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomycin / Levofloxacin on [**2167-2-3**] based on sputum culture results that returned positive for MRSA obtained on admission [**2167-1-30**].
WBC count did start to trend up on [**2167-2-7**] and repeat fever work-up including f/u cxrs were done to evaluate for the development of an effusion or abscess and these were none revealing.Wbc trending down on discharge adn elevated wbc count likely due to prednisone.Pt completed a 10 day course of levofloxacin on [**2167-2-10**] and will complete a 14 day course of vancomycin on [**2167-2-13**].
#) Asthma/COPD exacerbation: The patient's pneumonia exacerbated longstanding severe COPD with marked wheezing and tachypnea.
The patient had poor rate control initially on her baseline po metoprolol which had been continued after admission.
During triggers for respiratory decompensation and afib with RVR, the patient was treated with metoprolol IV during the acute episodes, but subsequently changed to diltiazem on readmission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**2167-2-2**].
#) Left-sided CNVII nerve palsey with facial droop: Thought to be new on her admission and seen by neurology.
#)Questionable Facial plethora: There was initial concern that the patient had developed facial swelling in the days prior to her hospitalization.
Continued management per her outpatient physicians.Pt will need a f/u chest CT scan in [**2-25**] weeks to assure resolution of left lower infiltration.
#)Diarrhea: Patient developed loose stools during hospital stay after a bowel regimen was initiated for constipation.
3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
DuoNeb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
11. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
13. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Hypertension Asthma Vitamin D defficiency Adenocarcinoma of lung well differentiated (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Rad/Onc, no plan for chemotherapy), s/p radiation w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] finishing [**2166-12-23**] to LLL.
Atrial fibrillation diagnosed [**12/2166**] Left sided Bell's palsey with facial droop  Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).
You were treated with antibiotics, nebulizers, steroids, advair,spiriva and singulair Your atrial fibrillation was causing a rapid heart rate.
