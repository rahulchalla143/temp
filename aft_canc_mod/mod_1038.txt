HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old male, status post cadaveric renal transplant times two, last in [**2146**], history of polycystic kidney disease, history of CMV colitis/hepatitis, and history of atrial fibrillation, who presents with headache over the right frontal region as well as right eye pain, as well as nausea and vomiting in the setting of high blood pressure.
The patient notes that the symptoms came on this morning and are like symptoms he has had in the past when he has been hospitalized secondary to hypertension.
The patient continued to experience headache and nausea and the Nipride was restarted with pressures dropping to as low as 60 systolic.
The patient denied any associated chest pain or shortness of breath.
No visual changes.
Polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2140**], and [**2146**], baseline creatinine 1.5.
History of intracranial hemorrhage, status post aneurysm clipping in [**2116**].
Atrial fibrillation.
Bilateral cataracts.
History of migraine headache.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Two brothers and one sister with polycystic kidney disease and children with polycystic kidney disease.
He denies any coronary artery disease.
In general, the patient is a middle age male lying in bed somnolent but arousible and in no apparent distress.
The neck is soft, supple, no jugular venous distention.
The heart is irregularly irregular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The lungs reveal bilateral crackles at the base.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Urinalysis shows trace blood, 100 mg/deciliter protein, no red blood cells, no white blood cells.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation in the 90s, leftward axis, poor R wave progression in the precordium.
Q waves in aVF and III noted to be old compared to previous electrocardiogram in [**2147-1-30**].
No acute ST-T wave changes.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate, poor inspiratory effort.
Questionable mild cardiomegaly.
Head CT from the Emergency Department showed no cerebrovascular accident and old lacunar stroke.
IMPRESSION:  A 62 year old male, with history of hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant times two, chronic atrial fibrillation times twenty years, presents to the Emergency Department with nausea, vomiting, right frontal headache and right eye pain in the setting of elevated blood pressure.
Cardiovascular - Ischemia - The patient with no known coronary artery disease.
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes negative times three.
Because suspicion for underlying coronary artery disease was low, no further workup was performed at this time.
The patient did not manifest any symptoms of congestive heart failure despite the elevated blood pressure and diuresis was deferred.
Rhythm - The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with adequate rate control.
In addition, the team discussed the possibility of cardioversion or the addition of antiarrhythmic drugs, however, the patient reportedly had several attempts at cardioversion with only temporary return to sinus rhythm.
Hypertension - In light of the patient's elevated blood pressure, secondary causes of hypertension were explored including renal artery stenosis and pheochromocytoma.
Renal ultrasound was performed on [**2148-4-19**], and showed no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for renal artery stenosis.
In addition, 24 hour urine collection for catecholamines as well as catechol metabolites was performed with sample three submitted to the patient's outpatient primary care physician for analysis.
The patient's symptoms resolved completely by hospital day number two with the concomitant control of his blood pressure.
Hematology - The patient with posttransplant erythrocytosis with a baseline hematocrit approximately high 40s to low 50s.
It was the feeling of the primary team that the patient's elevated hematocrit may be contributing to his symptoms and decision was to phlebotomize one unit of blood from the patient.
In addition, after discussions with the renal team, it was deemed appropriate to start up an ace inhibitor at low dose.
Hypertensive urgency.
Polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant times two.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient was initially to undergo MRA in the hospital, however, this procedure was contraindicated secondary to metal hardware in the patient.
