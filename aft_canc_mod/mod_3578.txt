Started on zosyn [**12-6**], followed by vanc/cefepime/flagyl on [**12-9**] for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Notably, CT chest [**12-11**] showed ethiodol uptake in the lung, concerning for a portosystemic shunt.
She has also been treated with bolus diuresis for acute diastolic CHF.
She states that she felt as if she was improving on treatment as of yesterday but then became more short of breath with minimal exertion, with a cough productive of yellow-light green sputum.
No fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or calf pain.
CXR showed extensive right-sided airspace disease.

- Transarterial chemoembolization of the left lobe of liver.
There is conventional celiac axis anatomy as demonstrated on previous arteriograms.
Common hepatic artery arteriogram demonstrates multiple arterially enhancing masses throughout both lobes of liver.
The left hepatic artery arteriogram confirmed large enhancing masses in the left lobe of liver, which was successfully targeted with the chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**], with 60 mg of doxorubicin, 20 mL of lipoidol, and 20 mL of intra-arterial lidocaine, and one and a half vials of 100-300 micron Embospheres administered.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory left hepatic artery chemoembolization  ====================== IMAGING ====================== [**2189-12-8**] - CT Abdomen/Pelvis: There is dependent atelectasis at the bilateral lung bases without effusion or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Some hyperdensity is newly seen at the lung bases, which most likely reflects systemic ethiodol distribution secondary to small intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
Hyperdense material within multiple right lobe liver lesions is stable from [**2189-11-13**], compatible with sequelae of prior chemoembolization.
Additionally, there is newly noted extensive hyperdense material within the left lobe of the liver and caudate lobe, most concentrated at the sites of previously noted arterially-enhancing lesions, compatible with recent left hepatic artery chemoembolization.
Other than the aforementioned hyperdensity at the lung bases, there is no definite evidence of extrahepatic Ethiodol uptake.
Hyperdense material dependently within stomach appears intraluminal, most likely reflecting ingested medication.
There are no contour-altering renal mass lesions.
The known pancreatic head mass is not well appreciated without intravenous contrast.
Stranding inferior to the pancreatic head is noted, possibly reflecting the sequelae of prior pancreatitis.
There is a metallic common bile duct stent in standard position, with left lobe pneumobilia compatible with stent patency.
There is no bowel distention or bowel wall thickening.
There is no free fluid or free air identified.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified.
Extensive Ethiodol uptake within the left lobe of the liver, most concentrated at the site of previously noted arterially-enhancing lesions seen on [**2189-11-13**].
Hyperdensity at the lung bases is most compatible with Ethiodol, likely secondary to a small intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt.
There is no further evidence of extrahepatic Ethiodol uptake.
Left lobe pneumobilia is compatible with stent patency.
Known pancreatic head mass is not well appreciated given lack of intravenous contrast.
[**2189-12-11**] - Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral annular calcifications are noted.
Low attenuation of the intracardiac blood pool suggests underlying anemia.
There is a right central venous catheter, with tip terminating within the SVC.
A right paratracheal lymph node is mildly enlarged measuring 15 mm, which is larger from prior study, and is likely reactive.
There is interval development of diffuse ground-glass airspace opacities, most severely involving the upper lobes.
The previously seen hyperdense foci within the lower lobes suggestive of  extra-hepatic Ethiodol are less apparent on this study.
The previously seen dense consolidation of the lower lobes are also improved.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Extensive Ethiodol uptake within the left lobe of the liver is again noted.
Osseous structures reveal no suspicious lesion.
Interval development of diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs, most severe within the upper lobes bilaterally.
The differential diagnosis includes infection (including atypical infections from PCP or fungal if the patient is immunocompromised), pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
Previously seen hyperdense foci in the lung bases felt to represent extra-hepatic Ethiodol are less apparent on this study.
Extensive Ethiodol uptake within the left lobe of the liver.
There is no evidence of acute or chronic thrombus at this time .
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremity deep veins on the available images at the time of the study.
[**2189-12-19**] - CXR: Pulmonary consolidation has been severe in the right lung since [**12-13**].
Whether this is pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage is radiographically indeterminate.
Sparing of left lower lobe suggests that it is not edema.
Severe cardiomegaly persists along with mediastinal and hilar vascular engorgement.
No pneumothorax.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2189-12-23**] - CT Chest  Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o with metastatic neuroendocrine CA admitted for hydration prior to TACE on [**12-7**], presented to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to what was thought to be hospital-acquired pneumonia vs acute on chronic diastolic CHF vs pneumonitis secondary to a portosystemic shunt communicating from her TACE procedure.
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 52984**] had a prolonged course in the ICU, requiring ventilatory assitance  # Hypoxemic respiratory failure/Lung infiltrates.
Patient was transferred from oncology service after her TACE for increased respiratory distress with a subacute decompensation, which was initially thought to be from acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, pneumonia, aspiration, hemorrhage or VTE with a small component of portosystemic shunt.
However, subsequent bronchoscopy did not suggest an infectious or hemorrhagic etiology as BAL was negative and bronchoscopy showed mostly clear aspirate.
She was continued on vancomycin which was started prior to her transfer to ICU, and she was started also on meropenem so that both would cover for HAP as well as levofloxacin to cover atypical pneumonia.
Methylprednisolone was initiated at 20 mg q8h for possible pneumonitis as patient's hypoxic respiratory failure persists despite antibiotics treatments.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible VATS biopsy to obtain a more definitive diagnosis to patient's parenchy infiltrates seen on CXR and CT.
As her sepsis improved, she was able to tolerate intermittent dose of lasix to diurese the presumed pulmonary edema as her total length of state fluid balance was positive.
The likely source for the sepsis is pulmonary infection/inflammation based on radiographical evidence as her other culture data have been negative.
No evidence of adrenal insufficiency, thyroid toxicosis, PE.
# Acute Renal insufficiency, likely from pre-renal azotemia secondary to sepsis.
She initially required pressors and IVF boluses for the low urine output.
# Hypernatremia.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF, likely with some component of pulmonary edema which contributes some to the respiratory function.
Diovan and diltiazem were soon held after her arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] secondary to hypotension and requirement of pressor, Levophed.
Her repeat echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic ventricular function, correlating to her distributive shock picture.
Her white count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were stably low.
She did not have episodes of acute bleeding.
# Neuroendocrine cancer.
Her LFT was elevated after TACE, but gradually trended downward during her stay in the ICU.
# Diabetes Mellitus.
She stated that she would not want to have a trach or a PEG prior to [**2189-12-16**].
