Went to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] buffet with friends and felt ill upon returning, went to pine street for his pain meds but it was closed, so he walked to [**Hospital1 336**] ER where he got 10 units regular insulin and 1.5mg total of IV dilaudid for chronic pancreatitis symptoms.
He felt well and wanted to leave, but ER staff was concerned about R forearm redness and cellulitis and requested transfer back for further care.
Regarding his R forearm, he says he had redness and tenderness of R forearm at prior IV site, which was being treated with warm compressess and elevation on day of discharge.
He has no fever, no other new systemic symptoms.

Aureus skin infections in left arm (on outpt abx) Depression  Social History: Graduated from [**Hospital1 498**] [**2160**] - worked for telephone company until [**2166**] and then became homeless with alcoholism.
No tobacco use or other illicits.

CELLULITIS -presented with evidence of possible cellulitis at site of prior superficial thrombophlebitis.
no fever, elevated wbc, or other systemic symptoms.
He was switched to Augmentin to complete a course for cellulitis from prior site of superficial thrombophlebitis  2.
THROMBOPHLEBITIS -superficial at site of prior iv, though presented with evidence of surrounding cellulitis, differential also included chemical (vanc) or septic thrombophlebitis given his recent + blood cultures (Enterobacter) and concern for self-line tampering.
He had no fever, no purulence, and no systemic symptoms to suggest more involved process such as septic thrombophlebitis.
Ultrasound of the forearm was negative for abscess and showed only thrombosis of the superficial cephalic vein which is consistent with clinical exam.
?H/O UPPER EXTREMITY DVT -he carries a diagnosis of upper extremity dvt he says in his Left arm in the setting of an iv or PICC during a previous admit at [**Hospital6 **] and has been on lmwh since [**5-12**].
Since he has likely received at least 2 months of therapy for an asymptomatic upper extremity thrombosis in the setting of an IV which is now removed, there is probably little if any additional benefit to continuing lmwh; therefore, will not continue on discharge.
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS -he complained of his usual pain on admission and requested Dilaudid since it was given at [**Hospital1 336**].
Since he was out of this hospital for less than 24hrs, was eating, ambulating, and resting comfortably, I did not see any clinical indication for narcotic pain medications.
Additionally, he refused to comply with blood draws in his words "if he can't get pain meds" which further complicated efforts to address his medical care.
Additionally, on [**2176-7-18**] he left the floor against staff advice for approximately 1-2 hours, could not be found by security, then returned exhibiting slurred speech, erratic behavior and continued to be verbally abusive and threatening towards staff.
