Admission Date: [**2173-6-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2173-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-8-12**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of right lower lobe stage III, non-small- cell lung cancer of the squamous type who has had two cycles of induction chemotherapy initiated on [**2172-12-22**] and radiation therapy times six weeks.
The patient was planning to have a surgical resection on [**2173-4-26**] but developed a small bowel obstruction requiring an emergent exploratory laparotomy.
Two bowel perforations were found, and postoperatively the patient was sick and in the Intensive Care Unit with evidence of a septic physiology.
He has an occasional dry cough and reports that he had pneumonia while in the rehabilitation facility; however, his breathing is quite good.
Repeat scans showed increased activity within the tumor and within the right hilar and right paratracheal lymph nodes.
The patient was thought to have a poor prognosis despite the addition of surgical therapy; but nonetheless, after discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and the patient's wife, the patient opted for further surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right lower lobe stage III non-small- cell lung cancer of the squamous type; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
History of a small-bowel obstruction.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Thinner than usual but walked without difficulty.
No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymph nodes.
Chest revealed occasional expiratory wheezes.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
A small opening in the inferior umbilical area.
No edema or asymmetric swelling.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-6-23**] the patient underwent a right pneumonectomy, a radical mediastinal lymph node dissection with a muscle flap.
The intraoperative course was complicated by recurrent hypotension into the low 60s.
The patient had an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram which showed multiple areas of hypokinesis with tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dilatation, and an ejection fraction of 40 percent.
Please see the dictated operative note for further details.
The blood and urine cultures ultimately came back negative, but the sputum culture later grew out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Chest physical therapy was continued, and the patient was begun on Lopressor for his tachycardia.
The patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course following his initial temperature spikes in the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day six, the patient continued to require aggressive chest physical therapy for his coarse breath sounds and a productive cough.
On the day of discharge, the patient continued to have rhonchi on the left with a productive cough; however, his oxygen saturations were good at 97 percent on 2 liters with a respiratory rate of 20.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Identical to the admission diagnoses listed in the Past Medical History with the addition of the following:  Status post right pneumonectomy, radical mediastinal lymph node dissection and muscle flap on [**2173-6-23**].
