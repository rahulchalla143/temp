Admission Date:  [**2185-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-3-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation   History of Present Illness: 68 yo M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with dyspnea over the last 4 months.
Patient was having workup done as an outpatient over last several months, which has included serial CT Chest without contrast for pulmonary nodules, the most recent of which was on [**3-3**] which demonstrated new peripheral lung nodules and question of RUL mass which could be soft tissue scarring or malignancy.
Today patient had TTE done which showed multiple abnormaliries, including right ventricular dilation and free wall hypokinesis.
He was also noted to be tachycardic during echo.
In terms of symptoms, patient reports that symptoms of dyspnea started 4 months ago, when he noticed feeling more short of breath while shoveling snow.
She had occasionaly productive cough with white sputum but no [**Month/Year (2) **] hemoptysis.
In the past, he could walk without difficutly and now he feels short of breath traveling less than 500 feet.
Today he was with his wife who was taking a mental health examination, and reportedly rushing more than usual, and this caused him to have more dyspnea than usual.
Cough is worse at night, and he has noticed some orthopnea recently, but denies [**Month/Year (2) **] PND.
In the ED, EKG was consistent with MFAT and demonstrated TWF inferiorly and anterior Q waves with no comparisons.
CT Chest showed acute on chronic bilateral PE.
Patient becomes dyspnic with movement, but is comfortable while lying in bed.

Cervical arthritis.
History of colon polyps (?
Pulmonary abnormalities with CT scan on [**2183-7-21**] showing no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, severe bullous, centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema, and multiple calcified and non-calcified lung nodules.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: He is married and lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 3146**].
Father died at age 74, complications of congestive heart failure.
He reports no history of colon cancer, polyps or coronary disease in his family.
Physical Exam: (Per Admitting Resident) Vitals: T: 97.8 BP: 132/94 P: 96 R: 21 18 O2: 98% NRB 15 L General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, RIght eye blind and opacified over, left eye pupils reactive Neck: supple, [**Name (NI) 22116**] not elevated, no LAD Lungs: crackles left base CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: 1+ bilateral pitting edema bilaterally to knees, warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
Pulmonary embolism involving the basal segments of the left lower lobe.
Partially occlusive thrombus in the pulmonary arterial branches supplying the basal segments of the right lower lobe, possibly chronic given their eccentric appearance.
Severe bullous emphysema with nodule in the right lung apex for which short interval followup is advised.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's known CLL.
Interval resolution of left basilar pulmonary emboli and interval improvement in eccentric clot at the right base.
No new pulmonary emboli.
New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and trace on the left.
Small pericardial effusion, increased from the prior exam and small perihepatic ascites, also slightly increased from the prior exam.
Severe emphysema with right apical nodule.
CT Head ([**2185-3-10**]) - IMPRESSION: No parenchymal edema.
MRI is more sensitive for detection of intracranial mass lesions.
CXR ([**2185-3-11**] - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased.
The changes are consequent of the left lower lobe pulmonary embolism documented on a CT from [**2185-3-10**].
Unchanged radiographic manifestations of extensive pulmonary emphysema.
Emphysema is again demonstrated with superimposed areas of opacity at both lung bases which was slightly improved compared to the recent study.
Small pleural effusion on the left also appears slightly better, and a small right effusion is unchanged.
Within the periphery of the left upper lobe, there is an apparently new focal area of opacity, possibly due to superimposition of structures at the level of the third anterior rib, but attention to this area on followup films is suggested to exclude a developing pneumonia.
Otherwise, no relevant changes since recent study of less than one hour earlier.
CXR PA and Lat ([**2185-3-24**]) - IMPRESSION: Slightly increased effusions.
Continued volume overload.
Brief Hospital Course: 68M with a past medical history of CLL, COPD, HTN presents with dyspnea over the last 4 months and found to have bilateral PE.
# Pulmonary Embolism: Likely acute on chronic PE in the setting of CLL.
TTE with signs of mild right heart strain.
Hemodynamically stable so not considered candidate for tPA or thrombectomy.
Coumadin held briefly for supratherapeutic levels but then restarted.
After transfer back to the ICU and intubation (see below), pt did have significantly elevated INR, requiring vitamin K. INR responded appropriately.
However, on the day of discharge, the patient was noted to have a drop in his INR such that it was no longer therapeutic.
At time of discharge, pt was breathing comfortably but still had an oxygen requirement of 2L.
However, on the following morning, he was noted to have worsening respiratory distress and was transferred back to the ICU service.
It was felt that his respiratory distress was related to a combination of COPD exacerbation as well as pneumonia.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient became increasingly wheezy on exam during the first 1-2 days of this hospitalization and was started on treatment for a COPD exacerbation.
A humalog ISS and PPI were started while he was on steroids.
As above, he had worsening respiratory distress after his inital call-out to the floor, requiring transfer back to the ICU and intubation x 2 days.
It was felt that COPD exacerbation was a likely component of his respiratory distress, so he was kept on his oral steroids.
# Pneumonia: At the time of patient's decompensation and intubation (see above), it was felt that there could be a component of pneumonia contributing.
CXR showed ?retrocardiac opacity.
# Radiologic Findings: CTA performed on admission showed a right apical nodular focus and recommended short interval followup.
CTA also showed left adrenal nodularity with CT or MRI follow-up recommended.
# CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain.
BNP elevated but no prior levels for comparison.
Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22116**] elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
# Atrial Fibrilation: Patient had intermittent irregular tachycardias that on repeat EKGs were felt to be most likely atrial fibrillation (although at some points felt to be multifocal atrial tachycardia).
He was also placed on coumadin/lovenox as above for anticoagulation.
# Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 1.0 likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids.
# Troponin leak: Mild troponin leak to 0.02 on admission likely due to right heart strain from underlying PE.
EKG had some TWIs but no baseline EKG to compare.
# Chest Pain: Brief episode, several days after admission, complained of some chest discomfort while eating, resolved within minutes.
EKG showed some lateral T wave flattening felt most likely [**1-25**] lead placement.
No further episodes of chest pain.
# Leukocytosis: CLL with baseline WBC 25-30.
When he decompensated and was intubated, he did have some fevers and more elevated WBC.
Still had some leukocytosis above baseline later in his hospital course but was afebrile.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) inhalation Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Pulmonary Embolism - Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis - Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) On 2 L of oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the emergency department after you had an echocardiogram with some abnormal findings.
Your hospital course was complicated by worsening breathing, secondary to your COPD and a pneumonia, which required a breathing tube for a short period of time.
