Admission Date:  [**2197-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-4-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**] Chief Complaint: Blood from ileostomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pill enteroscopy (non-invasive)   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 52583**] is a 55 year old male with metastatic renal cell cancer diagnosed in early [**2194**], currently on Avastin therapy, Crohn's disease s/p total colectomy with ileostomy formation in [**2177**], who presents with brisk bright red blood from ileostomy this morning in oncology clinic.
Per report from the patient and notes (though we don't have the actual report), the upper endoscopy demonstrated significant portal hypertension with esophageal and gastric varices.
A subsequent ileoscopy revealed a bleeding, ulcerated mass in the ileum, thought to be the source, with biopsies proven to be metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Of note, he has been on Avastin (BEVACIZUMAB), a chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for his renal cell cancer since [**1-28**], with the known risk of GI bleeding.
There was discussion between the patient and his oncologist at the time of his GI bleeding regarding whether or not to discontinue this medication, however the patient decided to continue.
On the day of admission in oncology clinic the patient noted about 250 cc of bright red blood in the ileostomy bag and was sent to the ED.
Past Medical History: 1) Oncologic history:  Diagnosed with renal cell cancer in early [**2194**] after hematuria noted by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] abdominal ultrasound showed a large left renal mass, two suspicious lesions in the liver and tumor thrombus in the IVC.
Pathology showed a 9cm renal cell carcinoma (granular), grade IV and invading the capsule, perirenal fat and vascular structures.
A liver nodule was positive.
He has been on a number of medical regimens:  Low-dose Interferon [**6-28**], but stopped [**11-29**] due to evidence of progression on CT: opacities in the liver and new right middle lobe and left lung base nodules, both subcentimeter.
[**Doctor Last Name **] drug stopped [**11-30**] due to progression on CT.
Course complicated by intermittent SBO, thought secondary to adhesions.
Has had 2 episodes of bowel obstruction, treated with NPO.
Neck:  No JVD.
Large vertical midline scar, well healed.
Extr:  1+ LE edema to knees b/l (chronic), DP palpable b/l.
Pertinent Results: EKG:  NSR at 80 bpm, no ST/T wave changes.

Found to have hct drop from 29 on [**7-3**] to 23 on day of admission.
1) GI bleed:  Patient with two known possible sources, given known varices, and also known mass in ileum.
Given that NG lavage negative (performed on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]), patient denies hematemesis, and bleed seems to have slowed down, unlikely variceal.
Lastly, patient with Crohn's disease, and has had bleeding in the past, but none for many years, and disease activity has decreased since colectomy - not on any medications.
Most likely source is known necrotic mass in ileum, which presents few therapeutic options, per GI.
Will need to consider embolectomy vs. endoscopic attempt at cauterization if bleeding persists.
For now, no further blood in ileostomy bag.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from surgery was consulted who feels that tumor site 15cm from ileostomy is source of bleeding associated with Evastin.
GI arranged a capsule endoscopy, which showed a few prominent venous blebs in jejunum in ileum as well as a few discontinuous segements of friable mucosa in jejunum and ileum.
3) Crohn's Disease:  Patient with improved disease since colectomy, on no medications.
4) Chronic anemia:  Normocytic.
Previous iron studies borderline - likely mixed picture of iron deficiency and chronic renal disease.
6) Pain:  Patient with chronic low back pain for which he takes tylenol at home.
Medications on Admission: Hytrin QDay Tylenol PRN Avastin  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma GIB due to metastatic renal cell CA(possibly also due to Crohn's Disease)  SEcondary: Crohn's Disease BPH   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: continue taking all your medications.
if you develop worsening bleeding from your ostomy, lightheadedness, vomiting blood, severe abdominal pain contact your physician or return to the ER.
Otherwise arrange for a surgical evaluation for resection of the tumor through your gastroenterologist or primary care physician.
