Admission Date: [**2145-3-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2145-3-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-11-14**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45-year-old male who had slurred speech times two weeks.
He had an uncoordinated swallowing.
The patient attributed symptoms to stress.
He has also had a headache in the back of his head, worse in the morning, constant.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No weakness.
Feels that he has an intermittent murmur and palpitations.
He also has had poor sleep, awakening frequently.
ALLERGIES:  no known drug allergies.
No neurologic diseases.
One cousin that has had an aneurysm in the past.
The abdomen is soft and nontender.
Also depressed and influent.
No right-to-left mismatch.
EOMs full without nystagmus or diplopia.
Right face slightly asymmetric, but no droop.
Poor cough sounds.
A CTA was done, however it showed a large mass in the brain stem.
He had some swallowing difficulties, so a swallow evaluation was done.
He completed a MRI/MRA which showed a well circumscribed hyperintense lesion visualized in the midline pontine region measuring approximately 2 x 2 x 2 cm in diameter.
The mass was of high signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images with a rim of magnetic susceptibility seen on gradient echo sequences.
There is mild edema associated with this mass.
No significant enhancement was identified after administration of gadolinium.
No other abnormal masses were identified.
No aneurysms up to the level of resolution were identified.
No hemodynamically significant areas of stenosis were visualized.
There were no aneurysms identified.
A swallow study was completed that showed some moderate-to- severe oropharyngeal dysphagia.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] spoke with Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his wife and discussed the surgical approach to remove this tumor would have to be either a transoral or a lateral skull base approach.
The risks of developing new symptoms from the surgery were high.
He would be at much further risk for a devastating hemorrhage and have worse symptoms than he is currently having.
Use suggestions from speech and swallow.
He should contact Dr.[**Name (NI) 1907**] office for any neurologic changes, concerns or headaches not relieved by medication.
