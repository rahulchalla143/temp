Since then, he has required six to seven ERCPs due to issues with biliary blockages and strictures and has had numerous stents placed.
He has also had klebsiella bacteremia in 11/[**2151**].
He was subsequently admitted from [**2152-11-24**] through [**2152-12-2**] for evaluation of elevated LFTs and underwent a CT scan which was concerning for pancreatic mass with EUS/biopsies confirming 2.7 x 2.2 cm ill-defined mass consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastases.
He had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 90717**] for nausea/vomitting which improved with antiemtics and hydration.
The patient presented this admission  with AMS, poor appetite, and leukocytosis.
LFTs were also elevated beyond recent baseline but [**Female First Name (un) 7925**]/AP normal.
Per son's report on admission to floor, pt was feeling better at time of discharge, but developed increased nausea and poor PO intake after recent discharge, as well as cough x 3 days (initially dry, now becoming productive).
No fevers at home.
At the time of this procedure, it turned into an open cholecystectomy and since that time he has had discomfort at the surgical site.
Following this, he has required six to seven ERCPs due to issues with biliary blockages and strictures and has had numerous stents placed.
He was admitted from [**2152-11-24**] through [**2152-12-2**] for evaluation of elevated LFTs and during that time had an [**Year (4 digits) **] and underwent a CT scan on [**2152-11-30**] that showed a concerning pancreatic mass.
Based upon that, he went on to undergo an EUS on [**2152-12-1**] that noted a 2.7 x 2.2 cm ill-defined mass in the body/tail of the pancreas.

CXR [**2152-12-17**]:Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflecting areas of atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of hemorrhage in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Unchanged mesenteric soft tissue density, likely representing a tumor deposit, and left adrenal nodule.
Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, unchanged from [**Month (only) **] [**2151**].
Small amount of secretions within the distal trachea.
Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion, increased from [**2152-11-30**].
Moderate nonhemorrhagic intra-abdominal ascites.
Diffuse body wall edema.
[**2152-12-24**]: US LUE IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
M with h/o recently diagnosed metatstatic pancreatic cancer s/p multiple ERCPs and stent placements over past few months who presented with lethargy and mental status changes.
Found to have G+ cocci and G- rod bactermia.
# Cholangitis, bacteremia, and hepatic abscess: Patient developed elevated LFTS (although t.bili remained normal)and presented with leukocytosis and mental status changes.
Blood cultures grew both klebsiella and enterococcus (two species including VRE).
Treated with pip/tazo and vancomycin, then unasyn, then daptomycin & Ceftriaxone as sensitivities of bacteria became available.
During the procedure patient began vomiting and required intubation for airway protection.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and extubated on [**12-19**] without difficulty and returned to floor.
Subsequent imaging revealed hepatic abscesses for which patient underwent percutaneous external drainage on [**2152-12-22**].
Bile grew the klebsiella and enterococcus with the same sensitivities as blood cultures.
# Metastatic pancreatic cancer: Underwent a biopsy of subcutaneous nodules at site of RUQ surgical sutures which were thought to be the source of pain as an outpatient.
Biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.
Given poor performance status and ongoing infectious process he was not a candidate for chemotherapy and goals of care will be supportive with a transition to more palliative approach.
After further discussions with the patient's son and HCP on [**2152-12-26**], he was made DNR/DNI but will continue to treat his infection and support his transfusion needs.
After further discussions with the patient's son and health care proxy on [**2152-12-28**] the patient will not be transferred to an intensive care unit but care will be focused on his symptoms should he become acutely ill. .
# GI bleeding: Stool became guaiac positive on [**2152-12-21**].
Suspect blood loss is from occult metastatic tumor oozing into GI tract.
No role for colonoscopy at this point given palliative approach and his debilitation.
# Anemia: Gradual decrease in hct.
During [**Month/Day/Year **] no clear evidence of upper gI bleed.
# Acute renal failure/hyperkalemia: On admission .
Likely due to volume depletion.
Suspect edema was due to third spacing and albumen<2.
# Chest discomfort & dysphagia: Discomfort was related to dysphagia and eating.
# Pain: Abdominal pain at operative site and upper abdomen.
Was on oxycontin on admission which was held because of MS changes.
Changed to oxycodone 5.0 mg q6hrs and increased prn dose 5-10mg because patient does not reliably ask for prn pain medication.
# Transaminitis: ALT and AST fell after [**Hospital1 **] and stent replacement but alk phos continues to slowly rise likely due to disease progression.
He is assymptomatic and further work up is not appropriate at this time, since his biliary obstruction is stented and he has percutaeous drainage of abscesses.
# ARF/hyperkalemia: On admission.
Likley due to volume depletion.
# Diabetes/hyperglycema: Minimally hyperglycemic.
# CAD: Cannot tolerate ASA due to GI bleeding.
No ICU transfer  # TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - ongoing GI blood loss requiring periodic transfusion - rising alk phos, likely progressive pancreatic cancer - transitioning to a more palliative approach to his care, but still getting IV antibiotics for bacteremic cholangitis with hepatic abscess formation requiring biliary drainage.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with nausea, vomiting, confusion, and an elevated white blood cell count from a severe infection from your biliary tract (Liver, pancreas, and gallbladder)that is due to your pancreatic cancer.
You had bacteria in your blood from the infection and developed a liver abscess.
You have also had problems with bleeding in your stools that has been treated with blood transfusions.
Because there are no treatments for your tumor, we do not recommend further work up for the bleeding but continued symptom [**Hospital1 **] with blood transfusions as needed.
Your pancreatic cancer has continued to grow and we expect that it will cause you more symptoms over time.
