Per the original admission note, the headache and fever had been occurring for 6 days.
She also had photophobia and intermittent nausea associated with the HAs.
A head CT was performed which was reportedly negative for acute bleed/mass.
A CXR showed infiltrates throughout the lung.
Surgery was called for placement of a pheresis catheter.

Per report: Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia CD 10+, CD 19+, CD 20+ with some aberrant monocytic markers but not a bilineage leukemia.
She has had vision problems and per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], worrisome for CNS involvement.
The smear on presentation showed numerous blasts associated with some metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and bands.
She also has diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia likely due to white thrombi.
Around day +21, the patient developed a transaminitis.
Likely due to tumor infiltration, white thrombi +/- HSV pneumonia vs. pneumonitis (see below).
The patient was succesfully extubated but then required re-intubation for airway protection in the setting of declining mental status.
The patient was again succesfully extubated but was found on ABG to be hypercarbic and acidotic.
Chest x-ray after extubation suggests aspiration pneumonia.
Her respiratory status remained tenuous for most of her hospital stay likely in the setting of CHF.
She was diruesed agressively and her breathing improved significantly.
HSV pneumonia (as below) was confirmed on BAL.
Upon transfer out of the ICU, the patient was no longer neutropenic and no longer febrile.
4)Decreased mental status.
The patient developed declining mental status in the early days of [**Month (only) 958**].
The patient had multiple CT scans and MRI's without signs of pathology.
Specifically, the patient had no signs of intracranial bleeding or temporal hemorrhage or enhancement (out of concern for HSV encephalitis).
The patient was keppra loaded out of concern for seizure activity though quickly discontinued as EEG x2 revealed no evidence of seizure activity, instead suggesting non-specific encephalopathy.
Given her diffusely altered mental status without focal neurologic deficits, it was felt (in consultation with neuro-oncology) that the patient likely had a toxic-metabolic explanation for her symptoms.
Specifically, the patient was markedly hypophosphatemic at the time.
CT head revealed an occipital hypodensity.
MR brain suggested diffuse bilateral occipital lobe haziness of unclear significance.
The patient had a renal ultrasound in early [**Month (only) 958**] revealing no hydronephrosis.
The patient was diuresed for volume overload.
The renal team was consulted and this was felt to be consistent with volume overload and likely secondary to relative hypotension.
Likely secondary to Anthracycline toxicity.
Repeat echo on [**2146-4-21**] revealed a normalized EF and beta blocker was discontinued.
Cxrays suggested bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
Repeat ECHO was consistent with depressed EF.
The patient developed a marked transaminitis at the time of transfer out of the intensive care unit with AST and ALT to >200.
Discontinuation of the acyclovir was considered, but, this medication was continued as it very rarely causes liver toxicity and its clinical benefit in the setting of a likely HSV pneumonia confirmed by BAL was clear (and indeed the patient was improving).
The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound revealing no disease.
She underwent an MRI of the liver revealing no signs of hepatosplenic candidiasis or other pathology.
On further history taking, the patient's family described multiple episodes of jaundice in the past.
The patient's LFT's trended downward without intervention.
The patient has a history of transphenoidal resection of an intracranial mass.
Her low bp was felt possibly secondary to early sepsis, however cortisol testing revealed very low cortisol levels (0.8).
The patient also failed her cortisol stim test.
She was noted to have normal TSH, though low T4 consistent with central deficit.
The patient's prolactin was mildly decreased below normal.
11)Mucositis with oral lesions.
The patient developed extrapyramidal signs with rigidity, cogwheeling and masked facies.
The patient was seen by movement disorder service and this was felt consistent with Haldol-induced parkinsonism exacerbated by liver dysfunction.
Review of the limited EEG obtained revealed encephalitis pattern without apparent seizure activity.
