Admission Date:  [**2180-5-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea and hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 77 year old man with metastatic melanoma (to lungs, spleen and adrenals), severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2) with recent valvuloplasty [**4-/2180**], CAD, systolic CHF with EF 30-35%, who presents with dyspnea.
He was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2180-3-2**] after an enlarging right axillary lesion was noted on pre-op workup for valvuloplasty.
He has been admitted several times in the preceeding months ([**3-/2180**], [**4-/2180**], and most recently [**2180-5-4**] - [**2180-5-12**]) to the cardiology service for dyspnea thought to be due to pulmonary edema and CHF exacerbations secondary to his worsening aortic stenosis.
His most recent admission for dyspnea was thought to be due to pulmonary edeam, but also pulmonary metastatic disease.
He was diuresed and discharged on home lasix with follow up in heme/onc clinic to discuss treatment options for his metastatic melanoma.
Upon follow up in heme/onc clinic today to evaluate candidacy for systemic chemotherapy, he appeared ill with dyspnea 94% on 3L and  hypotension BP: 76/52.
UA without RBCs or WBCs.
CXR showed innumberable metastases in bilateral lungs.
CT-A chest confirmed diffuse and significant burden of metastases without clear evidence of consolidation, edema or effusion, NO PE.
He was placed on Bipap for increased work of breathing and tachypnea.
He has not been feeling well lately because of poor appetite (has not been able to eat anything for days due to anorexia).
He has had increased dyspnea and cough.
No abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.
He has ongoing right axillary arm pain at the area of his mass.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Metastatic melanoma BRAF V600E mutated - [**2-/2180**] Scheduled to undergo AVR but was delayed for unexplained leukocytosis.
During his pre-op workup, he noted pain and a "bump" in his right shoulder/axilla.
CTA Chest/R arm with runoff showed  6.2 x 5.8 mass in the right axillary region with mild enhancement and mild surr fat stranding.
Unchanged in size from non-con CT scan on [**2180-3-8**] (Hounsfield units 25 on prior non-con scan) - [**2180-3-23**] Biopsy of the R axillary mass and a pigmented R deltoid lesion revealed melanoma, BRAF V600E mutated - [**4-/2180**] Multiple admission for symptomatic CHF due to AS, underwent valvuloplasty.
Not yet started on systemic chemotherapy (vemurafanib could be considered in future should his cardiac disease stablize and he is hemodynamically stable).
Past Medical History: - CAD with RCA artherectomy in [**2167**], BMS to LAD in [**2177**] - Coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction in [**2169**], [**2177**] - Aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty in [**2180-4-2**] - Hypertension - Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure - Benign prostatic hypertrophy - Prostate cancer- s/p cryotherapy - Bladder cancer- s/p chemoteherapy - Atrial Fibrillation - Hyperlipidemia - GERD .
Father died of an MI at age 51.

No definite pulmonary edema or new confluent consolidation, although subtle changes may be missed due to extensive burden of metastatic disease.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Significant increase in innumerable pulmonary metastases.
Large right necrotic axillary metastasis and increasing intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
Right adrenal metastasis.
ECHO [**2180-5-17**]: IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Compared with the prior study (images) reviewed ([**2180-4-11**]), the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more apparent.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old man with metastatic melanoma (to lungs, spleen and adrenals), severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2) with recent valvuloplasty [**4-/2180**], CAD, systolic CHF with EF 30-35%, who presented with dyspnea and hypotension.
Henodynamic shock was likely hypovolemic in etiology given poor oral intake while taking lasix, low CVP and normal SvO2.
Fluid resuscitation was complicated by pulmonary edema secondary to his systolic dysfunction and aortic stenosis.
Imaging (CXR and CT chest) showed rapid progression of melanoma with extensive pulmonary involvement.
Echocardiogram showed increased severity of aortic stenosis and worsening left ventricular systolic function.
He intermitttently required Bipap for respiratory support.
