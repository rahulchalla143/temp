Admission Date:  [**2145-9-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-7-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Cipro  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 55 yo male s/p allogeneic stem cell transplant for AML [**6-/2143**] with chronic GVHD on long-term steroids, DM, hx of PE on coumadin.
He presents to his [**Hospital 3242**] clinic with fatigue for several days, and anorexia, with about 12-16 hours of worsening shortness of breath.
Endorses increased cough with yellow sputum production and chills, but no fever.
This morning, he reported an acute episode of dyspnea that did not rapidly improved, and occured with little amounts of activity and somewhat improved with rest.
No hemoptysis.
He has had no new rashes, and has not had documented fevers.
He has no diarrhea, but has been nauseated without vomiting.
He reports mild epigastric pain.
He has a mild headache made somewhat worse with light, but he feels that this is very consistent with flares of GVH and not different (has occured he estimates about 8 times).
A bedside "shock" ultrasound US in ED showed no cardiac effusion, no evidence of gross RV overload.
Of note, he was also complaining of left sided shoulder/neck pain associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
Past Medical History: - AML-M7: s/p matched unrelated allogenic transplant on [**2143-6-24**] - Chronic extensive GVHD of skin and liver, liver biopsy [**4-23**] consistent with GVHD, managed with cyclosporine, steroids, periodic CellCept, and has received 1 cycle of Rituxan.
- Type 2 DM - Hyperlipidemia - H/o AVN bilateral hips - HTN - H/o nephrolithiasis, lithotripsy and previous nephrostomy tube and emergent surgery to repair ureteral damage - h/o left interpolar renal lesion, followed with MRs - h/o BCC s/p excision - h/o SCC left cheek, s/p Mohs' [**5-/2144**] - h/o multiple back surgeries: Lumbar L5-S1 surgery x 3, and cervical spine fusion (bone graft, no hardware) - h/o anterior cervical diskectomy and instrument arthrodesis at C5-C6 and C6-C7 for degenerative cervical spondylitic disease with spinal cord compression and foraminal stenosis at C5-C6 and C6-C7 [**2-/2144**]- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] - Chronic numbness, neuropathic pain in left upper extremity.
- Multilevel compression fractures T11, T12, L1 and mild compression L3 and L4.
- h/o pulmonary embolism [**11/2144**] on anticoagulated from [**11/2144**]-present - h/o RSV [**11/2144**] requiring ICU admission - h/o OSA, planned BIPAP, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**]  Social History: Lives with his wife, and one of children, worked as a [**Company 22957**] technician until [**Month (only) 547**] when he took early retirement and he is no longer working.
Father died of unknown cancer with tumors visible across body.
One brother has diabetes and kidney stones.
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: mild RUQ->mid epigastrium tenderness GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
No calf or thigh tenderness.
Skin: depigmentation on hands, redness of neck, but no notable skin changes otherwise.
Mostly resolved parenchymal opacities, leaving several parenchymal bands which are felt most likely to represent residua of a prior infectious or inflammatory process.
Subacute to chronic rib fractures, including along the right posterior seventh rib, where there is faint but suspicious sclerosis extending further laterally than would usually be expected in the setting of an uncomplicated rib fracture.
In the setting of prior treated hematological malignancy, the finding of vague sclerosis raises concern for a bone marrow abnormality such as myelofibrosis or potentially a form of disease recurrence.
[**9-8**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

# Lethargy: concern for viral syndrome, including activation of CMV, or a respiratory virus.
This could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he has been having, and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonary work-up in parallel with the infectious work-up.
Regarding VTE, his risk should be reduced with therapeutic INR, though the concern for coumadin failure merits consideration, though would be unlikely and he has no other signs and symptoms of DVT.
# Hypotension: A bedside "shock" ultrasound US in ED showed no cardiac effusion, no evidence of gross RV overload.
Patient's hypotension was fluid/stress dose steroids responsive.
Likely etiology was slight adrenal insufficiency in setting of viral syndrome despite negative infectious workup.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal azotemia.
# Mild epigastric/RUQ tenderness: No laboratory e/o hepatitis.
This pain has resolved on discharge.
# Pulmonary Embolism [**11-23**]: continued coumadin with INR goal [**1-19**].
# Diabetes: Continued NPH 12 units [**Hospital1 **], with close sugar monitoring and diabetic diet.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypotension/adrenal insufficiency Bronchitis Acute renal failure .
Secondary diagnosis: AML s/p MUD allogeneic SCT [**6-/2143**] Chronic GVHD of skin/liver h/o PE Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, BP 113/76, RR 16, sats 96% on RA, INR 1.8.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, low blood pressure and acute renal failure.
We were concerned for early sepsis and you were in the ICU initially.
You received broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids, but a full workup (including viral swabs, cultures, ECHO, and CT chest) were unrevealing.
CT chest showed resolving infiltrates and your symptoms improved so the antibiotics were switched to azithromycin for presumed bronchitis.
Your prednisone was increased due to presumed mild adrenal insufficiency.
of the following symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, cough, flu symptoms, or any other worrisome symptoms.
