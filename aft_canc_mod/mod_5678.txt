Admission Date:  [**2102-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-10-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-11-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension and positive troponin  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Cath [**10-23**] Pleurx catheter drainage daily  History of Present Illness: 65 yo M with history of CAD sp MI, CABG and recent MI([**2102-5-23**]) while at HD.
Patient has recurrent transudative effusions status post multiple thoracentesis and trapped lung physiology.
Was in USOH until [**2102-10-19**], when he developed severe LUQ abdominal pain during drainage of the catheters.
Was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-20**], and the pain continued until he had a large BM, after which it was much improved.
Had a CT of the abdomen which was unrevealing of any pathology to explain his abdominal symptoms.
Patient says he felt a little lightheaded, but no chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or palpitations.
Has had chronic breathing issues, no worse.
Team checked an ECG that showed slightly more pronounced ST depressions across anterior leads and Troponin of 1.24 with flat CK and MB.
Notes that when he had the MI, he experienced severe chest pain, and had not had similar episode since.
Bedside echo revealed a dilated LA, mild LVH, mild LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %), RV moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion consistent with volume overload, and moderate PA systolic hypertension.
On review of systems, he has baseline SOB from chronic pleural effusions.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does report continued mild diffuse pain in his abdomen [**4-25**] intensity, worst RLQ.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, PND and syncope and ankle edema.

Skin resections for CA   Social History: Social history is notable for his being married.

Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
b/l pleurx drain dressings c/d/i, slightly tender to palpation ABDOMEN: Soft, diffusely tender to deep palpation, no rebound or guarding.
No abdominial bruits.
[**10-20**] CXR PA/Lat: New large bilateral pleural effusions with stable bilateral lower lobe hydropneumothoraces and Pleurex catheters.
TTE [**2102-10-21**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2102-5-31**], the right ventricle is now dilated, hypokinetic with evidence of pressure volume overload.
No pulmonary embolism.
Slightly enlarged main pulmonary artery could be from pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Large bilateral loculated pleural effusions containing a significant amount of air.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Small 5-mm hypodensity in the tail of the pancreas, likely unchanged from [**2102-5-8**].
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LCx had a proximal tubular 90% lesion and occluded OM branches.
The SVG-acute RV marginal-PDA had a 90% instent restenosis after the anastamosis of the graft with the acute marginal branch.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial hypertension with a SBP of 143 mmHg and a DBP of 80 mmHg.
Proximal 90% LCx stenosis with occluded OM branches.
90% instent restenosis of RCA SVG after anastamosis with acute marginal branch.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion remains, probably loculated, and residual volume of air in the pleural space is small, bilaterally.
Cardiac silhouette partially obscured is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
There is no pulmonary edema.
TTE [**2102-10-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A major displacement is not noticeable.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M PMH CAD with CABG [**2079**], s/p STEMI c/b VF arrest in [**5-25**], diastolic dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, s/p bilateral pleurex catheter placement, ESRD on HD, initially admitted for abdominal pain that resolved with bowel movement; abdominal CT was unrevealing of any pathology.
He was transferred to the CCU for hypotension thought to be secondary to new right ventricular failure of unclear etiology.
Hypotension was responsive to IV fluid boluses, with SBP increasing from 70s to 80s/90s.
Additionally, the patient had slightly increased cardiac enzymes and mildly increased ST depressions in anterior leads on ECG, concerning for recent or evolving MI.
On [**10-23**] during hemodialysis the patient had an episode of chest pain, somewhat relieved with nitroglycerin, and an ECG concerning for anterior wall ischemia.
Additionally, the patient became extremely agitated in the cath lab, requiring endotracheal intubation.
He continued to be hypotensive overnight with SBP in 70s-80s, again responsive to IV fluid boluses.
Around 12pm, the patient had a PEA arrest, a code was called and CPR intiated.
Patient then went into periods of Vtach and PEA arrest, and received one 200J shock for Vtach during the code.
Bedside echo did not show any evidence of tamponade.
After discussion with the family, the code was called off and patient was pronounced dead at 12:42 PM.
Immediate cause of death is cardiopulmonary arrest most likely secondary to evolving MI.
Other chief causes include heart failure and ESRD.
