Duodenotomy with excision of two lesions for gastrinoma.
History of Present Illness: This 61-year-old man has hypergastrocnemia in the setting of sporadic  gastrinoma.
Workup for this has revealed a 3-cm lesion in the peripancreatic area which has been biopsied, proven to be a neuroendocrine tumor.
There is no evidence of any other disease on endoscopic ultrasound or octreotide scanning preoperatively.
He has been controlled for his gastrin level through proton pump inhibitors quite well, but realizes that he has a potentially metastatic lesion and that an operative intervention would be warranted for oncologic purposes.
He has had nausea and vomiting with this as well as diarrhea for over seven years now.
This was worked up by an endoscopic ultrasound at our institution and a close to 3 cm mass has been found in his porta hepatis, which is consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor based on a fine needle aspirate.
It has all the [**Hospital1 **] features of a neuroendocrine tumor radiographically.
Past Medical History: Zollinger-[**Doctor Last Name 9480**] syndrome HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, CAD s/p angioplasty  Social History: Retired from [**Country 11150**].
Physical Exam: On physical exam, his abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
He is slightly obese in the abdominal area only.
His inguinal and genital region shows no evidence of any hernias or masses.
DIAGNOSIS: I.  Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A-B): Cholelithiasis and chronic cholecystitis.
Soft tissue, duodenum, excision (C-D): Fragment of duodenum and pancreatic tissue with ductal epithelium.
No malignancy identified.
Soft tissue, "duodenal lesion-2," excision (E-F): Malignant neuroendocrine tumor (clinically gastrinoma), 0.3 cm, invasive of duodenal submucosa.
Stomach, duodenum and omentum, partial gastrectomy (G-N): Malignant neuroendocrine tumor (clinically gastrinoma), two foci each 0.2 cm, present in duodenal mucosa.
No malignancy identified.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis and bilateral trace pleural effusions.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2191-9-11**] 5:35 AM IMPRESSION: Development of atelectasis in the lower right lung.
Atelectasis or consolidation at the left base, unchanged.
Evidence of small right effusion.
Radiology Report PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2191-9-13**] 8:08 AM  IMPRESSION: Unremarkable bowel gas pattern with no evidence for ileus or obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 61-year-old man who has hypergastrocnemia in the setting of sporadic gastrinoma.
During the procedure, there were no evidence of any hemodynamic compromise or overt complications.
On HD 3, he was transferred to the ICU for possible pulmonary embolism and with suspected atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
A variety of imaging was also done while in the ICU and are detailed as follows: CXR ([**9-11**])Development of atelectasis in the lower right lung.
Atelectasis or consolidation at the left base, unchanged.
Evidence of small right effusion.
CXR ([**9-10**]) IMPRESSION: No change in left base patchy opacity.
CXR ([**9-10**]) A heterogeneous infrahilar opacification, new since an abdomen CT [**2191-8-19**], could represent either pneumonia or atelectasis.
Upper lungs clear aside from pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Heart mildly enlarged.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis and bilateral trace pleural effusions.
On HD 10, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] another episode of SVT and so cardiology's approval was requested before his discharge.
