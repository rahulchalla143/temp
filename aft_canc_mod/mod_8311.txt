Admission Date:  [**2183-8-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-2-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**] Chief Complaint: Malaise, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided drainage of gall bladder abscess  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 112301**] is a 65 year old man with a history of pancreatic cancer s/p CBD stent placement in [**2-/2183**] with subsequent revisions in [**4-/2183**] and [**7-/2183**] who presents from OSH with malaise and mild abdominal pain.
He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early [**2183**] and underwent an attempted Whipple in [**3-/2183**] that was aborted when metastatic disease to the liver was discovered at laparotomy.
The weekend prior to admission, the patient had poor appetite and did not eat or drink very much.
He reports brief LOC but no head strike or abnormal movements.
His wife grew worried given apparently increasing weakness and took him to [**Hospital1 **] ED.
He was in Afib with RVR and was started on a ditliazem drip at 10mg/hr.
A CTA was negative for PE and showed numerous lung and liver lesion and an air-filled strucutre at the anterior border of the liver that could represent gallbladder with pneumobilia, bowel, or a necrotic lesion.
A RUQ u/s showed a CBD dilated to 8-11mm and the same incompletely characterized air-filled structure at the anterior border of the liver.
His Afib with RVR broke with the diltiazem gtt and he was given tylenol 1g for pain.

There is a small right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
Multiple hypoenhancing  lesions are seen throughout the liver, with the largest in segment V measuring 4.2 x 4.1 cm (2ae:28).
Inflammatory changes are seen around the gallbladder, consistent with acute cholecystitis.
There is disruption of the gallbladder wall at the level of the fundus, with a 9.6 x 2.7 cm hepatic subcapsular fluid collection which communicates freely with the gallbladder.
This collection contains a small amount of air which may be due to superinfection or due to the presence of a biliary stent.
An adjacent rim enhancing fluid collection is seen in the right lateral abdominal wall musculature measuring 4.0 x 2.0 cm (300b:16).
Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, without evidence of hydronephrosis.
The spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 13.8 cm.
There is an ill-defined hypodense mass centered in the region of the pancreatic head/uncinate process, measuring approximately 3.1 x 2.7 cm.
An additional hypoechoic lesion measuring 3.7 x 2.5 cm (2a:32) in the portocaval region may represent a lymph node or posterior extension of the known pancreatic tumor.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
The abdominal aorta has mild atherosclerotic calcification without aneurysmal dilation.
Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen, with the largest in the aortocaval region measuring 10 mm (2a:46).
There is mild stranding of the mesenteric fat along the right paracolic gutter.
A mesenteric nodule in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen measuring 15 x 12 mm (2a:54), concerning for metastatic disease.
There is a small amount of simple pelvic ascites.
No significant pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid is seen.
Incidental note of a small fat-containing right inguinal hernia is made.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:  Few small lucent lesions are seen in the lumbar spine, the largest in L2 vertebral body measuring 7 mm (2a:44).
and a lucent lesion in the right iliac bone (300b:43), are concerning metastatic disease.
Presumed gangrenous cholecystitis with perforation.
Subcapsular hepatic fluid collection communicating with the gallbladder.
A rim enhancing fluid collection in the right lateral abdominal wall musculature, concerning for abscess, likely communicating with the larger collection.
Multiple hypoenhancing liver lesions, in the setting of known pancreatic cancer may represent metastatic disease or multiple abscesses.
Poorly defined hypoenhancing mass in the pancreatic head/uncinate process, represents known pancreatic cancer.
Additional hypoechoic lesion in the portacaval region may represent posterior tumor extension versus a lymph node.
Peritoneal metastasis and possible osseous metastasis.
There are low lung volumes with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
Multiple lung nodules described in prior CT are not clearly visualized in this examination and are below the resolution of this exam.
rib fractures are again noted.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism although with suboptimal opacification of distal vessels.
Multiple lung parenchymal nodules which, given history, are concerning for metastatic disease though the appearance is not typical and infectious or inflammatory etiologies may also be considered.
Small right-sided pleural effusion and associated opacity, in the setting of right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely due to atelectasis although it is difficult to completely exclude an infectious process.
Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrating hypodense lesions within the liver concerning for metastatic disease.
Low density areas with air along the anterior margin of the liver are incompletely imaged and could represent gallbladder with pneumobilia, bowel or possibly even necrotic lesions.
This cannot be connected to bowel and may represent distended gallbladder with sludge and pneumobilia; however noting limited assessment, stomach or bowel, or potentially a necrosis lesion are difficult to exclude.
The CBD measures up to 11 mm shortly above the stent, but there is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Heterogeneous liver with several hypoechoic foci concerning for metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: # Fever/Malaise: The patient presented with RUQ tenderness, elevated transaminases, and elevated TBili.
GI/ERCP evaluated the patient and felt that his symptoms were unlikley to be due to cholangitis or biliary obstruction and felt that an ERCP was unnecessary.
Early imaging in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED suggested the presence of a possible liver abscess.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed perforated cholecystitis with an adjacent fluid collection that was concerning for abscess.
A gram stain of the fluid showed polymicrobial infection and cultures were pending.
# Afib with RVR: The patient presented from [**Hospital3 **] in Afib with RVR to the 150s on a diltiazem gtt at 10mg/hr.
Medications on Admission: insulin glargine 25U qHS actos 15mg PO daily glipizide 5mg PO daily omeprazole 20mg PO daily aspirin 81mg PO daily zenpep 10,000 TID prescribed diltiazem, metoprolol, and lisinopril, but not taking  Discharge Medications: 1.
Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Perforated cholecystitis with abscess Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We initially felt your symptoms might have been due to a bile duct obstruction or a bile duct infection (cholangitis), but your labs normalized and we did not feel an ERCP was necessary.
We did a CT scan that showed you had a perforated gall bladder that was infected.
You were given ciprofloxacin and Flagyl (metronidazole) for antibiotics, which were started on [**8-19**].
You should have another imaging study to see if the fluid collection is improving.
You were also in rapid atrial fibrillation while in the hospital.
Wash the skin with 1/2 strength hydrogen peroxide, rinse with a saline-moistened QTip, and apply a new sterile dressing.
If there is pain with flushing this may mean that the abscess cavity has collapsed.
3) Inspect to be sure that there is no debris blocking the catheter.
