Metastatic stage four lung cancer.

Jejunal metastasis times two - status post laparoscopic resection.
Metastatic lung cancer.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Blood loss anemia.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  This patient is a 60 year-old male who was diagnosed with stage four nonsmall cell lung cancer in [**2122-6-2**].
He was started on chemotherapy for this and recently complained of abdominal pain to his physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2122-7-3**] and was found to have a jejunal masses for which biopsies were taken.
These came back being metastatic lesions.
Given the small nature of these lesions and the symptomatology that was causing the patient it was felt these could be resected laparoscopically.
He was in no acute distress.
There was no scleral icterus.
There were no oral lesions.
He had no adenopathy in the neck.
There was no organomegaly or mass or tenderness.
He had no peripheral edema, phlebitis or clubbing.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2122-7-21**] and on that same day underwent laparoscopic resection of two small bowel presumably metastatic tumors.
There was no note of intraoperative complications or excessive blood loss.
The patient's postoperative pain was initially controlled with Dilaudid PCA.
On postoperative day one the patient was complaining of inadequate pain control and had his PCA increased with the addition of Toradol.
The patient again had complaints of severe pain with inadequate relief on postoperative day two, although his PCA had been increased in dosage, therefore an acute pain service consultation was obtained and their recommendations were taken into account and they recommended an epidural for pain relief given the patient having a history of metastatic cancer and in order to avoid a postoperative ileus.
Notably during the day of postoperative day two the patient is complaining of some abdominal pain.
During discussion with the patient about one of these episodes of pain he had an episode of 600 cc of coffee ground emesis.
During attempts of placement of this tube the patient again had another episode of about 400 cc of coffee ground emesis and continued to retch at each attempt.
It was determined after discussion with anesthesia that these attempts might be easier after placement of the epidural catheter.
The patient had some difficulty with this and again began to have symptoms of Lidocaine toxicity with brief episodes of desaturation, which were later controlled with oxygen and bag mask breathing.
In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit the patient was aggressively hydrated and had serial hematocrits monitored.
Notably in the Intensive Care Unit the patient did have multiple episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
It was noted that the patient may have aspirated during the course of his episodes of Lidocaine toxicity in the preop holding area during placement of his nasogastric tube, therefore he was empirically started on Levofloxacin for possible aspiration pneumonia.
There was a question of this on chest x-ray.
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring of his vital signs and to assure adequate pain control and for management of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
By postoperative day seven the patient was ready for transfer back to the floor as he had been afebrile and was having some improved pain control and was not having episodes of atrial fibrillation.
He was having no problems with shortness of breath, but he continued to have pain.
This was discussed with acute pain management and they did not agree with these recommendations.
By postoperative day nine although the patient continued to have pain he no longer had any surgical issues and it was determined that he could be discharged to home.
His white blood cell count remained elevated 25.9.
His BUN and creatinine at the time of discharge were 10 and 0.7 with a K of 4.2 and no cardiac enzymes had come back as ruling patient in for an myocardial infarction.
This patient's sputum cultures taken showed contamination with oropharyngeal flora.
He had no positive blood cultures.
Essentially the summary course for this patient is that the patient is the patient did well after laparoscopic resection of two small bowel metastases from his primary stage four lung cancer.
Postoperatively likely suffered a gastrointestinal bleed, which probably started sometime even before surgery possibly secondary from stress from surgery in addition to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
This gastrointestinal bleed was complicated by an episode of desaturation during attempted placement of an nasogastric tube after placement of an epidural catheter for poorly controlled pain, which likely had a chronic and acute component.
The patient also had a question of aspiration pneumonia after placement of the nasogastric tube for which he was given antibiotics empirically, but for which no final sputum culture was definitive.
The patient's main issue was essentially pain control, which was not resolved by the time of discharge, but his primary care physician felt that he would best be able to deal with this as an outpatient.
