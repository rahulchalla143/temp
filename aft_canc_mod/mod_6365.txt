Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy Endoscopic ultrasound with biospy PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 426**] is an 85 year-old woman with a history of CAD recently noted abdominal mass who presents with fevers/rigors and bandemia.
It lasts throughout the day is not increased by eating though there is associated vomiting and is worsened with coughing.
Was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] on [**4-14**] who felt that the pain might be seconodary to diverticulitis.
CT abdomen without contrast was then performed on [**4-20**] showing a large 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.0-cm heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass.
On the morning of admission, was noted to have rigors/shaking chills.
Given possible GI source, empiric zosyn was given.
ROS: (+) 4lb weight loss over months; due to "poor appetite" (-) night sweats (-) chest pain, shortness of breath, palpatations (+) diarrhea after oral constrast for CT abd (+) nausea, occasional vomiting (+) BRBPR after oral constrast for CT abd (+) arthritis   Past Medical History: 1.
Coronary artery disease with history of angioplasty in [**State 108**] one year ago 2.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Hyperlipemia 5.
Hypertension 6.
Chronic kidney disease (SCr 2.1 in [**3-17**]) 7.
Anemia (HCT 30.7 in [**3-17**])  Social History: She is a widow and lives alone.
Family History: Father had a GI tumor, primary unknown.
Another daughter with ovarian carcinoma.
No palpable masses.
Able to relate recent events well.
Large 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.0-cm heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass with areas of low and high density suggesting hemorrhage.
Underlying tumor is suspected, however, not fully assessed without IV contrast.
Origin of mass is not clear, but not likely adrenal, renal or gastric in origin.
Given mass effect on the colon, retroperitoneal mass such as pancreatic hemorrhagic tumor or hemorrhagic pseudocyst arising from the pancreatic tail is considered, although no findings of acute pancreatitis are seen.
Exophytic splenic or colonic mass are also considered, although less likely.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
CXR (5/16/0):  No consolidation or edema is evident.
Mild prominence of the right hilum is evident.
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta.
The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged with incidental note made of mitral annulus calcification.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
RUQ U/S ([**2140-4-23**]): Panc duct dilated but panc not well visualized; if pncreatitis suspected coorelate with labs GB appears distended with cholelithiasis but no GB wall thickening, fluid or CDB dilatation .
No free air in the abdomen.
Interval decrease of splenic flexure mass.
The reported drainage of pus after biopsy at the depressions site suggests a fluid component of this mass.
This could represent an abscess or hematoma from possibly prior colonic infection/inflammation, especially given the sigmoid diverticulosis.
Unchanged appearance of pancreatic head mass, with abrupt ending of the dilated pancreatic duct.
Sludge-filled gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
New small left pleural effusion.
Repeat CT: CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen in the left upper quadrant is a heterogeneous lesion centered at the pancreatic tail/splenic hilum/splenic flexure.
This lesion has decreased in size when compared to the prior CT scan dated [**2140-4-20**] perhaps secondary to decompression after biopsy of the splenic flexure at colonoscopy as there is a description of purulent material emanating from the colonic biopsy site.
While this mass lesion abuts the splenic artery, there is no evidence of splenic artery encasement or thrombosis.
Pancreatic Tumor Table: I: Pancreatic tumor present: Yes.
Pancreatic duct dilation measuring up to 5mm.
Metastatic disease, definitely present: No.
IV: Ascites/peripancreatic fluid: No evidence of ascites.
Pancreatic Vascular Table: I: Vascular Tumor Involvement: No.
No evidence of intra- or extra- hepatic bile duct dilation.
Hypoattenuating lesions are seen in the kidneys bilaterally, likely representing renal cysts.
Atherosclerotic disease is seen in the proximal abdominal aorta which is normal in course and caliber.
Interval decrease in the heterogeneous centrally hypoattenuating lesion centered at the pancreatic tail/splenic hilum/splenic flexure in the left upper quadrant.
Differential diagnosis for this lesion is unchanged and includes pancreatic pseudocyst, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and metastasis.
Although the splenic artery courses adjacent to this region, there is no evidence of splenic artery thrombosis, encasement, or pseudoaneurysm.
In the pancreatic head, there is a 2.1 cm TV x 2.5 cm AP x 3.1 cm CC [**Month/Day/Year 71062**] mass which is causing pancreatic duct dilation to approximately 5 mm.
This finding is consistent with the patient's biopsy proven pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.
No evidence of vascular involvement 3.
Persistent small left pleural effusion with associated posterior left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
Left lower lobe pulmonary node measuring 6 mm.
Cholelithiasis and gallbladder sludge.
Multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions which were demonstrated to represent hepatic cysts on the prior MRCP dated [**2140-4-25**].
Colonic diverticulosis.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2140-4-26**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Patient is a 85 year old female with history of newly noted abdominal mass, now being admitted with sepsis.
# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: This was noted incidentially on a CT scan.
The results of the biopsy were consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Anesthesia was consulted for pre-operative clearance.
The patient will be seen in the geriatrics clinic the week prior to surgery for pre-operative risk reduction.
# Splenic flecture/pancreatic tail mass, likely diverticular abscess: This mass was unable to be biopsied on colonoscopy.
Given the patients recent likely history of diverticulitis this was thought to be an infected fluid collection or abscess.
Repeat scans showed that the mass was decreasing in size.
IR was involved initially but felt that the location of the fluid collection was at a high risk to drain and given the fact that she was clinically stable it was better to continue antibiotic treatment without drainiage.
# Diverticulitis:  There was a small outpouching seen on colonoscopy that was not at the splenic flecture.
This was thought to be a small diverticula that was clogged and had some reactive changes.
Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation, with acute respiratory failure:  Patient has a history of heart failure.
In the setting of getting fluid and FFP she defeloped some pulmonary edema and required diuresis.
No pyuria to suggest urinary tract infection.
It was felt that the likely etiology is what is thought to be intra-abominal abscess based on improvement of mass on repeat CT and recent history of likely diverticulitis.
Acute blood loss Anemia, lower GI bleeding:  At baseline upon presentation; after 4 liters of IVF, decreased to nadir of 22.8, followed by one unit of pRBCs.
GI source is possible as noted to have BRBPR with bowel movement soon after arrival to MICU; the large abdominal mass may also represent hematoma.
Hemolysis labs unrevealing.
Has elevated lipase though exam is not overwhelming and CT does not show clear evidence of pancreatitis.
Likely related to ductal dilation from pancreatic head mass.
Chronic kidney disease.
Elevated TSH.
No prior diagnosis of hypothyroisism; is on amiodarone so at increased risk for thyroid dysfunction.
Coronary artery disease.
Hyperlipidemia:  Continued statin/zetia .
Left Lower Lobe nodule noted on CT scan.
Betaxolol 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QD () as needed for HTN.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2436**] Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 2436**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis - gram negative intra-abdominal abscess pancreatic cancer - newly diagnosed   Discharge Condition: Stable for rehab.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fevers and chills.
You were found to have bacteria in your blood and needed to go to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
A CT scan found an incidental mass in the pancreas and a second mass in the abdomen.
The pancreatic mass is a type of cancer called adenocarcinoma.
You will be having surgery for this mass on [**5-19**] br Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The second mass was not seen on the colonoscopy.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
