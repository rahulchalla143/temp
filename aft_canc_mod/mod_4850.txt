NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
The lungs are well expanded and clear, with the exception of a small discoid atelectasis noted in the left lung base.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process  UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT Study Date of [**2108-2-22**] 9:22 AM FINDINGS: Duplex was performed of the right upper extremity veins.
There is a partially occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein.
Non-occlusive thrombus of the right subclavian vein.
Moderate to large ascites, unchanged from prior abdominal CT allowing for Preliminary Reportdifference in techniques.
No focal liver lesion identified.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty Preliminary Reportinfiltration.
1-cm L thyroid nodule for nonemergent US.
Brief Hospital Course: 50yo F PMhx metastatic pancreatic cancer with multiple complications including ascites and nonocclsive thrombus R subclavian vein presenting with fever, found to have bacteremia and new occlusive thrombus of the right IJ, as well as thrombus in the right atria possibly attached to portacath tip.
# Pancreatic Cancer: Nonoperative pancreatic cancer with metastases to liver.
Hypercoaguable with several clots extending through the RIJ and subclavian, potentially into right atrium.
# Clot Large area of right IJ and subclavian were found to be full of clot, likely surrounding portacath as well.
Small mobile thrombus was also seen in the right atrium.
Anticoag had to be stopped for a GI bleed.
# GI Bleed Most likely etiology is hemobilia from multiple stents leading to BRBPR and melena.
Required stopping of anticoagulation, which was a particularly concerning given her large clot burden.
# Sepsis Found to be hypotension on admission, which was most likely due to a combination of GNR found in the blood as well as the GI bleed.
