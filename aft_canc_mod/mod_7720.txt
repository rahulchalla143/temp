Admission Date:  [**2181-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-2-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: recent fall, possible shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Difficult to obtain history due to language barrier.
Noted to right neck echymosis today, extending onto the left side.
However, per her son in the [**Name (NI) **], she had no complaints but seemed more confused on the day of admission.
CT Head was negative and CT c-spine showed spinous process fractures.
CXR showed old cardiomegaly and questionable LLL infiltrate.
She received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin to treat UTI and ?
Due to hypoxia requiring a NRB, she was admitted to the ICU for further care.
Review of systems is not able to further be obtained due to language.
Past Medical History: diastolic CHF with severe TR AFib on coumadin CKD baseline Cr approx 2.4 Type 2 DM Chronic Hep B gout glaucoma Monoclonal gammopathy, suspected multiple myeloma.
Family History: Significant for DM and HTN.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck with diffuse ecchymosis.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Severe multilevel degenerative disease with moderate central canal stenosis, which predisposes this patient to spinal cord injury with minor trauma.
In the appropriate clinical context, consider MR for further characterization.
Large multinodular goiter.
Large linear fluid collection within the epidural space, beginning at approximately C3-C4 extending into the visualized upper thoracic spine is most suggestive of epidural hematoma.
There is moderate-to-severe canal narrowing at the C6-C7 interspace related to a combination of disc osteophyte complex and more focal component of epidural hematoma at this level.
No definite cord edema is identified, although the exam is somewhat limited on the fluid-sensitive sequences.
Slightly increased signal within the C7 and T1 vertebral bodies in conjunction with mild anterior soft tissue swelling at this level is concerning for traumatic vertebral body fractures.
No significant loss of vertebral body height or retropulsion of bony fragments is noted at the levels.
Diffuse edema within the posterior spinal tissues related to known spinous process fractures.
Limited ability to assess the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments related to motion artifact on current study, however, no definite discontinuity is identified.
Moderate canal stenosis at the C4-C5 interspace, predominantly related to disc osteophyte complex and focal ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at this level.
Marked cardiac enlargement, unchanged, likely reflecting a combination of cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion, as seen on prior CT from [**2180-9-19**].
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
No displaced fractures identified.
TTE The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There are torn tricuspid valve chordal structures seen prolapsing across the valve and into the right atrium.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe tricuspid regurgitation with evidence of right ventricular volume overload.
Markedly dilated right ventricle with mild global hypokinesis.
Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: AP: 82F with chronic dCHF, severe TR, DM2, and CKD who presents from rehab s/p fall with confusion, hypoxia, C-spine fractures, pyuria  .# Cervical spine Fractures: Per trauma, no acute management needed.
MRI also shows cervical spine epidural hematoma but neurologically remains intact.
# Confusion: Initially presented with confusion s/p fall and ?hypoxia vs. UTI.
The true etiology is unclear at this point as pt got broad spectrum abx in ICU initially.
She likely has underlying dementia.
Hx of Hypoxia: Unclear if hypoxia was true or a measurement artifact.
Sometimes difficult to get accurate O2 [**Location (un) 1131**] on finger; much more reliable with a forehead monitor.
No evidence of infection.
No clinical signs of PNA .
She has known underlying CKD stage 4, due to combination of DM and suspected multiple myeloma.
Has known monoclonal gammopathy which has been documented at [**Hospital1 3278**].
No hydronephrosis on CT scan, urine eos neg, renal U/S no acute hydronephrosis.
# Anemia - labs show no sign of Fe deficiency.
likely from CKD and anema chronic disease.
coumadin held for several days due to supratherap levels.
Should not allow further supratherap levels due to cervical hematoma.
Type 2 DM uncontrolled with complications: had a hypoglycemic episode early in hospitalization, may have been due to reduced Cr clearance of insulin.
Chronic diastolic heart failure:  she has known severe tricuspid regurgitation, RV overload, on [**Hospital1 3278**] echo as well as echo here.
Records from [**Hospital1 3278**] shows that she has been admitted there for CHF exacerbation several times requiring diuresis.
She has signs of anasarca here but breathing was stable.
Her lopressor dose was decreased this admission and imdur held to increase overall blood pressure and improve forward flow to her renal perfusion.
Has hx of proteus sensitive to all except cipro.
-she was initially tx with bactrim, urine culture grew E. coli ESBL but then final [**Hospital1 **] result returned and showed signs of contamination.
A final UA from [**3-30**] shows 2 wbcs, neg Leuk, neg nit, no bacteria or yeast.
Bactrim discontinued as given concerns over renal failure and monitor.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Please check Cr, electrolytes twice this coming week to monitor renal function and ensure it continues to improve   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute renal failure Cervical spinal fracture Hypoglycemia resolved  Chronic kidney disease Atrial fibrillation Chronic diastolic heart failure Anemia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: If you have fevers, chills, worsening neck pain, focal weakness, numbness or tingling of your extremities, please seek medical attention  Followup Instructions: Please follow with orthopedic spine at [**Hospital1 18**] as below: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] XRAY (SCC 2) Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] Date/Time:[**2181-4-9**] 12:40 Provider: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
