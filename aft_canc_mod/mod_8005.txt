Past Medical History: rheumatic fever s/p MVR with mechanical valve, atrial fibrillation/flutter s/p ablation currently on Coumadin, R knee arthroscopy for meniscus tear, LUE surgery for bursitis.
brother - deceased pancreatic cancer  Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T ; BP 148/64; P 54; RR 18; O2 sat 96%  General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple Pulmonary: bronchial breath sounds an L lower base.

Fluent speech with no paraphasic or phonemic errors.
Able to name low and high frequency objects.
No left/right mismatch.
No pronator drift.
Large, heterogeneous and multilobulated right frontal lobe mass with central necrosis and extensive peripheral zone of edema, causing 12 mm leftward subfalcine herniation and effacement of the right lateral ventricle, with no sign of transtentorial or tonsillar herniation.
Anterior aspect of the tumor extends inferiorly to the peripheral margin of the sylvian fissure with focal overlying dural enhancement, raising question of pial involvement and transgression.
The overal appearance is most suggestive of high-grade primary glial neoplasm, e.g.
glioblastoma multiforme.
No CT evidence of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal malignant process.
No mass or lymphadenopathy.
2-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
12-mm left-upper-pole likely renal cyst.
Expected post-surgical changes are seen with mild residual enhancement on the medial aspect of the surgical cavity.
No evidence of acute infarct or hydrocephalus seen.
Right frontal lobe post-surgical changes without evidence for hemorrhage.
Hypodensity in right caudate head, which likely represents evolving infarct when correlated with previous imaging.

A head CT was repeated, which demonstrated no changes and no acute incracranial process.
on [**8-24**], the patient was noted to have very [**Last Name (un) **] L facial droop, and no other significant findings.
