He has had recurrent oral ulcers since his transplant, treated with famvir for biopsy proven HSV-2 in the past.
Recently was hospitalized for oral ulcers and treated with foscarnet for resistent HSV.
His also reports increased mouth pain.
ROS (+)mouth and throat pain, emesis with pills, confusion since starting scopolamine patch for secretions.
(-)headache, photophobia, fever, [**Date Range **], SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation (last BM [**11-27**]), dysuria   Past Medical History: Oncologic history: CLL, diagnosed in [**2137**] when incidentally noted to have elevated WBC count.
Treated with fludarabine then relapsed and required four cycles of PCR and then again had five cycles of PCR, but had persistent disease.
He underwent reduced intensity allo-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**] from his brother in [**2-16**] that was relatively uncomplicated, though he did have grade I skin and hepatic GVHD, and febrile neutropenia.
-s/p inguinal hernia repair -Cardiomyopathy: Moderate pericardial effusion and markedly reduced EF (20%) noted on echo in [**9-19**], presumed viral vs. chemotherapy induced.
+desquamation in multiple areas of buccal mucosa, hard palate, with surrounding erythema.
+aphthous ulceration on lower lip.
Vesicular rash on chin.
Left submandibular adenopathy Neck: Supple Cor: RR, tachycardic, with laterally displaced PMI and hyperdynamic precordium.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2142-12-1**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.

Hypoxia, new b/l infiltrates on CXR suggesting fungal infection.
Also has cardiomyopathy with CHF on clinical exam.
Cardiomyopathy with CHF on clinical examination.
A large pericardial effusion has increased compared to [**2142-9-5**].
A dilated esophagus with distal mural thickening is filled with debris.
A 5.3 x 3.5 cm (5:37) rim-enhancing fluid collection along the anterior medial margin of the right chest abuts pleura and pericardium and crosses the plane of the minor fissure, adjacent to a previous pneumonia; whether is a lung or pleural abscess is uncertain.
Enlarging, moderate volume, nonhemorrhagic, layering pleural effusions have some pleural enhancement suggesting exudation (5:35).
New multiple foci of ground-glass opacity and parenchymal consolidation occur in both upper lobes and the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
No bone lesions worrisome for malignancy are seen.
Enlarged lymph nodes are present adjacent to the renal vessels and the celiac axis.
A new 5.3 x 3.5 cm abscess in the anteromedial right chest could be pleural or pulmonary, abutting an enlarging pericardial effusion.
Multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacity suggest pneumonia.
Alternative diagnostic considerations include pulmonary hemorrhage or unexplained pulmonary edema.
Dilated debris-filled esophagus with wall thickening.
Enlarging pericardial and bilateral pleural effusion (right greater than left), likely exudative.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2142-12-6**] 11:51 AM _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ [**12-6**] Pleural fluid:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
_ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ [**2142-12-19**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2066-12-10**], and 31:  Right pleural effusion has almost disappeared since [**12-15**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions remain.
There is, however, more that perihilar opacification in both upper lungs.
Given patient's recent history of rapid waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of asymmetric pulmonary edema, this may represent recurrence of edema alone, but since there has been five-day interval since the last chest film, the rapidity of onset is really indeterminate and pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Skin, chin:  Necrotic material with bacterial colonies and isolated fungal spores.
Skin, chin:  Necrotic material with bacterial colonies and isolated fungal spores (see note).
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 year old male with CLL on campath, history of HSV-2 oral ulcers, presents with severe mucositis and oral ulcerations with concern for viral infection.
resistant oral [**Female First Name (un) **], but oral culutres grew out SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE.
Continued to improve and went from requiring frequent IV dilaudid to no pain medications to no oral pain whatsoever.
Patient had significant lesion in right lower molar area and anterior to lower gums.
A sample of tissue was sent to pathology and microbiology and showed oropharyngeal flora, small amount of yeast, and small amount of fungal spores.
Pathology demonstrated necrotic tissue.
The lesions slowly improved and the patient was changes from foscarnet to valacyclovir as he no longer had evidence of active infection.
Continued on TPN during the majority of his admission for nutritional support, but this was stopped prior to discharge.
#)Pulmonary infection - CT scan, xrays w/ right sided effusion, bilateral ground glass opacities most consistent with CHF.
Treated with zosyn for broad coverage.
Tapped R sided pleural effusion and sent for culture and cytology which were both negative.
Reaccumulated on [**12-10**] and repeat CT w/ re-accum of effusion and persistent infiltrates.
The patient had a diagnostic BAL performed, but this resulted in dyspnea, hypoxia, and tachypnea, and the patient was sent to the ICU.
After a fairly uneventful course in the ICU, with one episode of desaturation thought to be secondary to sedation, the patient returned to the floor.
Also had apergillosis fumigata, and he was continued on voriconazole at an increased dose of 300 mg PO BID, decreased to 200 mg by discharge.
Continued prednisone for mild GVHD.
No acute issues while in hospital.
Was well-compensated with no clinical CHF until [**12-10**].
Underlying cause thought secondary to viral infection vs. chemo.
Patient had CHF exacerbation (d/t TPN and IV foscarnet and abx) with hypoxia, increased RR, tachycardia, which required ICU care.
Patient was diureses and sent to the [**Doctor Last Name 3242**] floor.
The patient was tapped by IP x 2 for a large right pleural effusion while trying to get to optimal CHF regimen.
#) Deconditioning: The patient is severely weak and deconditioned.
Did not qualify for acute rehab, but will get VNA and PT at home.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 6438**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Mucositis (resistant HSV) CHF exacerbation Aspergillus fumigata on BAL Orocutaneous fistula Malnutrition   Discharge Condition: Stable.
The patient is not SOB and is able to ambulate around the [**Last Name (un) 3242**] unit without minimal difficulty.
Orocutaneous fistula on chin remains, but has been followed by ENT who recommend no further intervention at this time.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please take all of your medications as prescribed 2) Please call your PCP or return to the ED if you have SOB, chest pain, dizziness, increasing edema, mouth pain, or any other symptoms that are worrisome to you.
