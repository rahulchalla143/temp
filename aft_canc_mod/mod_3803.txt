CT head [**2178-5-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Overall, a slight decrease in the mass effect and edema associated with the postoperative changes.
2) Slight increase in epidural fluid collection adjacent to the craniotomy site.
CT abdomen [**2178-5-25**]: IMPRESSION: Small residual collection anterior to the rectum, smaller than on the prior study, and without substantial fluid components to allow drainage.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2178-5-12**]): (PELVIC ABSCESS)       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2479**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
