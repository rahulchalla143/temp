She was recently admitted with worsening abdominal distension and shortness of breath (like from increased ascites).
CXR showed a RLL opacity that was concerning for pneumonia.
Found to have Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia, and completed a 2 week course of Cefepime and Bactrim (sensitive to both).
She is s/p chest tube placement and removal for massive pleural effusion.
Blood cultures, CXR and UA/UCx were ordered in a reflexive fever workuup.
A CXR demonstrated a RUL and LLL infiltrate with persistent bilateral effsuions, worse than those evaluated on [**9-15**].
With stable vital signs, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a thorough evaluation.
A dx para was negative for SBP.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Past Medical History: * Primary sclerosing cholangitis: complicated by ascites, hydrothorax, encephalopathy, portal vein thrombosis * Common bile duct stricture s/p hepatojejunostomy ([**2104**]) * Diabetes mellitus * Invasive ductal carcinoma on the right breast (~[**2104**]), s/p Femara 2.5mg every other day and lumpectomy [**2107-11-13**] with ?recurrence.
Managed at [**Hospital3 **] * History of idiopathic thrombocytopenia   Social History: Patient previously lived at home in [**Hospital1 **] with her husband, [**Name (NI) **].
2/6 SEM murmurs.
No rubs, or gallops.
non-tender to palpation, feels pressure, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Diffuse maculopapular rash across her entire abdomen and back with increased confluence.
EXT: 2+ distal pulses bilaterally, 1+ pitting edema bilaterally to midshin SKIN: Thin, warm, dry.
CXR ([**9-23**]):  IMPRESSION: New right upper lobe opacity concerning for infection.
Large right effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
CXR ([**9-29**]) - after 2 thoracenteses during hospitalization Large right pleural effusion with almost white-out of the right hemithorax is unchanged.
Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is stable.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Cirrhosis and segments of hepatic atrophy affecting the liver with fibrosis in keeping with patient's underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Similar degree of intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
No evidence to suggest infected bile lakes.
Non-occlusive thrombus in the main portal vein, suboptimally evaluated due to motion; however has not propagated into occlusive thrombus in the interval.
Moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis at the lung bases.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo female with 69F with PSC cirrhosis, previously decompensated by ascites, hydrothorax, and encephalopathy, with rapidly recurring hepatic hydrothorax and Klebsiella bacteremia and multi-GNR UTI, with suspected HCAP.
Goals of care: After two recurrences of her hepatic hydrothorax and declining clinical state, we had many discussions concerning Ms. [**Known lastname 69849**] goals of care.
The results of these conversations are as follows:  Her code status has been changed to DNR/DNI and she does not want to undergo any more invasive procedures to temporarily correct her shortness of breath.
Instead, we have prescribed her 2-6mg of morphine (liquid form) as needed for her shortness of breath.
# Respiratory failure, secondary to pneumonia and hydrothorax - CXR upon admission showed a possible infiltrate and she was empirically covered for healthcare-associated pneumonia with Vancomycin and Meropenem.
The patient was initially breathing comfortably on room air, but then decompensated with hypoxemia to the mid 80s.
CXR showed a recurrent right-sided hydrothorax and a thoracentesis was performed in the ICU.
It was determined by [**Hospital 3585**] that she is not a candidate for TIPS due to her portal vein thrombosis and declining condition.
# Klebsiella bacteremia - Blood cultures from [**Hospital 100**] rehab showed a pansensitive Klebsiella, but she was kept on Meropenem, given her history of VRE bacteremia.
A MRI/MRCP was done to locate any possible sources that were causing recurrent GNR bacteremia, but did not show any bile lakes, biliary tree abnormalities, or abscesses.
Pramoxine-Mineral Oil-Zinc 1-12.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal TID PRN () as needed for rectal discomfort.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical DAILY (Daily) as needed for itching.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: [**1-15**] ml PO q3h as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Recurrent hepatic hydrothorax Klebsiella bacteremia Klebsiella and Enterobacter urinary tract infection Hospital-acquired pneumonia .
Secondary diagnoses: Primary sclerosing cholangitis cirrhosis Breast cancer Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
We found that you had an infection in your blood and your urine and treated this appropriately with antibiotics.
You were also short of breath upon arrival and a thoracentesis was done to take the fluids out of your lungs.
During your time here, you got very short of breath again and needed to be moved the intensive care unit for a short time so they could take more fluid from your lungs.
We recommended medications and extra oxygen to treat your shortness of breath.
