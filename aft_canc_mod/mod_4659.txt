An introp U/S revealed- liver echogenicity appeared unremarkable.
Within the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, there was s a 5.5 x 3.3 cm well- circumscribed, slightly hypoechoic lesion that contained a degree of increased through transmission suggesting at least some cystic components.
No other additional lesions were found.Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were removed by postop day 5.
Right adrenal mass, excision (A-F): Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical carcinoma, see note.
Liver segment six, resection (G-O): Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical carcinoma, see note.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tapered prednisone after one week as she developed an incision infection necessitating opening the incision and using a wound vac.
A CT of the abd was done on which demonstrated Two ill-defined fluid collections post-surgical site that were extrahepatic and could represent postoperative seromas, bilomas, or less likely abscesses.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
This was negative for bleed/mass on [**10-29**].
Psychiatry did not recommend antidepressents or stimulants at the time.
She experienced desats and sob.
A f/u cxr was improved and without pneumothorax.
She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and Flagyl for the wound x 4 days.
These antibiotics were switched to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep veridans, sparse yeast, Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and staph coag positive resistent to levo/oxicillin/penicillin and sensitive to vanco.
A repeat abd CT revealed stable appearance of hepatic fluid collections with some debris and air in the surgical bed.
Bibasilar atelectasis with stable right pleural effusion.
Stable appearance of right abdominal wall defect overlying surgical site.
Interval development of nonocclusive thrombus within the intrahepatic inferior vena cava.
Contrast was seen surrounding this wound and draining along the right lateral aspect of the wound into dressing, however, no definite communication into the abdominal cavity noted.
Midline chevron scar and multiple clips scattered across the abdomen were seen.
She then underwent successful drainage catheter placement in collection in the subhepatic and hepatic areas on [**2194-11-12**].
The plan is for her to go to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on TPN via a R picc with a RUQ incision wound vac.
She experienced minimal spotting while hospitalized.
