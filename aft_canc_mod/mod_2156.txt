Once the patient was closed and on the Operating Room, she was noted to go into a ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest and was subsequently emergently reopened on the operating table.
She had been maintained on an intra-aortic balloon pump postoperatively and the wound where they had inserted the balloon pump did have a serous effluent, thought possibly secondary to a lymphatic leak.
She did subjectively complain of continued shortness of breath and, as a consequence, she was worked up for this.
A chest x-ray on postoperative day number revealed bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with left lower lobe collapse, thought to be secondary to atelectasis.
She was without chest tubes.

She was in no acute distress.
