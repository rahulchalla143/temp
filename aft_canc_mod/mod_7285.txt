Admission Date:  [**2166-12-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-1-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-2-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ACOVE  ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Renal cell carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year-old man with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, hypertension who presented on [**12-29**] to [**Hospital1 69**] for a partial right nephrectomy of his right kidney inferior pole.
Subsequent pathology demonstrated it to be papillary renal cell carcinoma.
The patient at that time received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and 6 liters of lactated Ringers.
The subsequent hospitalization was complicated by a left lower lobe consolidation and a sputum notable for MRSA and increasing O2 liter requirement.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for MRSA positive staph sputum.
MRI of the head on [**1-6**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage and no stenosis or carotid bifurcation and chronic periventricular white matter changes.
Diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, renal cell cancer papillary, status post right partial nephrectomy, depression.
He travels with a scooter.
Blood cultures from [**12-31**] was notable for no growth.
Urine culture from [**12-31**] was notable for no growth.
Electrocardiogram from [**12-29**] showed ST segment depressions in V2 and V3.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of greater then 50% focal wall motion abnormalities, mild LA, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild left ventricular systolic function.
Pathology from [**12-29**] showed papillary renal cell carcinoma changes consistent with diabetic glomerulosclerosis and multiloculated cystic structure.
Radiology, x-ray from [**1-7**] showed nasogastric tube, no pneumonia.
X-ray from [**1-6**] showed a left lateral pleural thickening versus loculated effusion, right PICC, scattered discoid atelectasis.
MRI of the head on [**1-6**] showed negative MR, intracranial, negative stenosis, carotid bifurcation negative, territorial infarct, chronic paraventricular white matter changes.
Video swallow study from [**1-6**] showed penetration with silent aspiration, moderate to severe oropharyngeal dysphagia.
MRI kidney, abdominal imaging [**12-5**] showed a 2 by 1 by 1.5 by 1.8 right upper pole posterior mass pancreatic cyst.
CT of the abdomen [**11-10**] had shown a positive mass in the right kidney.
No abdominal or bowel obstruction.
TTE from [**7-21**] showed an left ventricular of 80%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Hospital course complicate by perioperative myocardial infarction, positive oxygen requirement and variable mental status changes.
Cardiac:  The patient's operation was complicated by a perioperative myocardial infarction with elevated CK and troponin levels.
The interpretation at the time had been low probability for flow limiting coronary artery disease to the achieved work load, frequent APB with occasional beat and more frequent isolated premature ventricular contractions with increased dobutamine dose.
Pulmonary:  The patient obtained a seven day course in house for a possible MRSA sputum positive culture.
The patient, however, remained afebrile when the patient's antibiotics were discontinued on [**1-6**].
Endocrine:  The patient has a history of insulin dependent diabetes.
The patient's ENT evaluation showed global function with incomplete epiglottis detection, premature spillage and silent aspiration.
Neurology:  The patient in the hospital had an episode of delirium treated with Haldol.
It was felt that variable mental status differential included an anoxic damage versus narcotic overdose.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit was stable following the initial blood loss during the procedure.
Oncology:  The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma.
Renal cell cancer.
Perioperative myocardial infarction.
Change in mental status.
