Of note, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at that time was complicated by the findings of interstitial pulmonary abnormalities and pulmonary nodules on imaging studies; these were ultimately thought to be a chronic finding, but because of his RLL lesion, he was treated empirically for aspergillosis with voriconazole, and he was also given a course of levofloxacin.
Further investigation following his discharge from the hospital demonstrated that he had been treated with gatifloxacin and azithromycin at an OSH in [**2140**] for presumed Rhodococcus equi pneumonia (the organism was cultured from BAL fluid at that time); the significance of this finding and the relative adequacy of this treatment remains unclear.
A sputum culture obtained after readmission in [**7-25**] for dyspnea and hemoptysis showed Mycobacteria gordonae (a known contaminant and not likely to cause disease).
A chest CT done [**2142-8-14**] demonstrated a persistent spiculated nodule in his right lower lobe, multiple opacities in the right and left upper lobes that were more prominent than on previous examinations, unchanged calcified mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and stable low-attenuation liver lesions.
In summary, his voriconazole was discontinued [**2142-10-24**] based upon the presumption that he appears too well to have persistant infection and the lack of any definitive evidence (e.g.
He was scheduled to be seen in pulmonary clinic for follow-up of the persistent collapse vs. atelectasis of his right middle lobe out of concern for another primary malignancy.
Pulmonary disease as per HPI, s/p treatment for aspergillosis 3.
Chronic micronodular pulmonary disease due to pneumoconiosis (retired coal miner) 4.
Bleeding peptic ulcer disease in [**9-/2141**] 5.
Prolonged (two month) course of gatifloxacin and azithromycin for possible Rhodococcus equi pneumonia [**2140**] 7.
Physical Exam: Temp 97.7, BP 126/78, HR 73, RR 14, SpO2 94% RA Gen: Mandarin-speaking only, very pleasant, comfortable, [**Location (un) 1131**] papers in bed and ambulating around room, non-toxic HEENT: NCAT, no sinus tenderness, pinpoint pupils bilaterally, conjunctivae clear, OP clear, moist oral mucosa Neck: Soft, supple, shotty submandibular adenopathy CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, no m/r/g Pulm: Diminished bibasilar breath sounds but otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, non-tender, mildly distended with tympany to percussion, active bowel sounds, no organomegaly Back: No CVA or paraspinal angle tenderness Ext: Trace bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, 2+ DP pulses, warm Nodes: No palpable cervical, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy  Pertinent Results: WBC-64.5 (N-35 Band-6 L-10 M-4 E-1 Meta-2 Blast-42) Hct-37.3 MCV-86 Plt-173 PT-12.9 PTT-32.2 INR-1.1 Fibrinogen-322 Na-142 K-4.2 Cl-109 Bicarb-27 BUN-16 Cr-1.3 Ca-9.3 Mg-2.2 Phos-3.9 Alb-4.1 ALT-14 AST-38 Alk Phos-72 TBili-0.1 LDH-817 Uric Acid-7.4  Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo man with AML, status-post idarubicin and ARA-C in [**Month (only) **] [**2141**], initially in  remission by bone marrow biopsy at that time, now with relapsing AML/acute leukemic crisis (WBC 64,000 with 42% blasts) and mild acute renal failure.
He developed neutropenia and spiked temperatures.
His initial infectious work up was unrevealing, with the exception of bilateral basilar lung disease on chest xray.
Sputum cultures only revealed sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Pulmonary: Elaborate and complicated history of pulmonary disease with possible superimposed infectious disease (recent fungal infection?
He has a history of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis as well.
Likely etiologies include an effect of tumor lysis vs. pre-renal azotemia.
was transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia (uncontolled atrial fibrillation) and hypotension, presumed to be related to sepsis.
clinical status deteriorated despite treatment with multiple antibiotics, pressors and mechanical ventilation.
became profoundly acidemic on the 23rd hospital day and progressively hypotensive despite increasing doses of pressors.
A family meeting was held given his deteriorating status but it was decided to continue all current treatment, however, it was determined that CPR was not indicated.
