Pt notes worsening dyspnea, with significant extertional dyspnea.
Pt has also had a dry cough that started around Monday as well.
In the ED he was started on heparin gtt, given lasix 20mg IV, and Levoquin 500mg PO for possible PNA on CXR.
Small subacute subdural hematoma along the right tentorium and left frontal lobe.
Gliosis in the right frontal lobe likely secondary to prior trauma.
[**10-26**] Head CT: The subdural collection along the right tentorium and right frontal lobe seen yesterday is not appreciated today.
Gliosis in the right frontal lobe is unchanged.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is again noted which is likely secondary to age-related involutional changes.
White matter hypodensity suggests sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
No skull fracture is seen.
Prior burr hole in the left parietal skull area is again noted.
There is also a similar skull indentation along the left frontal convexity.
[**10-30**] Head CT: Thin subdural hematoma along the left frontal pole, with both chronic and subacute components, unchanged.
[**11-12**] Head CT: The small left frontal subdural hematoma, intermediate in density, is unchanged in size and demonstrates no evidence of new blood products.
There is no mass effect on the underlying left frontal lobe, as the extraaxial spaces and ventricles are enlarged due to cerebral atrophy.
A small area of encephalomalacia is again noted in the inferior right frontal lobe, likely secondary to prior trauma, or less likely prior infarction.
There are multiple foci of low density in the deep and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, as before, likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14 mmHg and severely elevated left sided filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 29 mmHg and a prominent V wave.

He likely had a CHF exacerbation and afib in the setting of MV prolapse with severe regurgitation.
Pre-op Issues: # CHF exacerbation: BNP 8563 on [**10-24**].
Pts sats dropped on the am of [**10-30**] with possible flash pulmonary edema.
Bedside echo noted worsening mitral regurgitation and significant tricuspid regurg and the decision was made to transfer the pt to the CCU, where he was electively intubated.
# New onset afib observed [**10-24**].
# Mitral valve insufficiency:  Initial presentation was likely [**2-14**] progression of MV dz, or rupture of chordae, mitral valve prolapse.
TEE showed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to posterior leaflet flail, no thrombus.
# CORONARIES: Troponins and CKMB have been flat.
Cardiac cath prior to surgery to eval for CAD showed no coronary artery disease.
# Small sub acute left frontal subdural hematoma secondary to fall 2 months: Neurosurgery consulted.
No Urgent or Emergent Neurosurgery needed.
CXR [**10-24**] shows no acute process and pt was afebrile with no cough and satting well albeit DOE.
There was low suspicion for PNA and so Levaquin which was started in the ED was discontinued.
WBC remained elevated in the 11-12,000 range with left shift but pt was afebrile from admission to [**10-30**] when he was transferred to ICU.
A transesophageal echo demonstrated inferior wall motion abnormalities and when the patient was not being paced, there were ST elevations in the inferior leads.
He was taken emergently to the cath lab which demonstrated total occlusion in the mid circumflex distribution after a big dominant obtuse marginal coronary artery had taken off from the main circumflex and very near the cuff of the mitral valve as seen by the radiographic images.
Over the next several days he remained sedated and intubated, pressors were slowly weaned and Amiodarone and Coumadin were started for atrial fibrillation.
Over the next couple of days he was stable but remained somewhat confused but cooperative.
On post-op day six he was noted to have increased ecchymosis and swelling in his left groin and was found to have a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.
On [**11-8**] he underwent repair of his pseudoaneurysm with thrombin injection to the left superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.
Over the next couple days he continued to improve with resolving delirium and working with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
On post-op day twelve he was going to be discharged to rehab but became slightly lethargic in later AM.
Cipro was started prophylactically for possible urinary tract infection (pending UA with recent valve surgery).
11. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day: Adjust for a goal INR of [**2-14**].5 for atrial fibrillation.
