There are extensive coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
There are pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymphatic nodes, including right paratracheal and left paratracheal, that are not overtly changed from previous examination by size criteria.
There has been interval increase in soft tissue surrounding CyberKnife marker, now measuring 19 mm versus 9 mm previously, suggestive of progression of the disease.
Again noted is interstitial fibrosing pattern associated with ground-glass opacities, affecting predominantly right lung in peripheral distribution.
This is more prominent compared to previous examinations, and may represent interstitial fibrosing process versus radiation pneumonitis.
There are several gallstones in the gallbladder, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
There is a hypoattenuating lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney, likely representing angiomyolipoma.
There are extensive vascular calcifications.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
More prominent appearance of right lung interstitial fibrosing pattern that may represent interstitial fibrosing process versus radiation pneumonitis.
There is no evidence of edema.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area  0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid  regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate, calcific aortic stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a charming 85 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, COPD on home O2, and NSCLC who was admitted for elective heart catheterization, found to have patent grafts, AS, and elevated LVEDP.
1) Hypoxia On admission CXR, patient appeared to be volume overloaded; given lasix in ED and his hypoxia improved with continued diuresis.
Elevated LVEDP in cath lab the day prior supports this diagnosis (although could be [**2-8**] pulm htn and AS) and patient received 2L IVF in the prior two days for catheterization.
Of note the patient has severe COPD at baseline with 2L resting and 4-5L ambulatory O2 requirement.
Serial ABG's on transfer to the floor revealed well compensated chronic respiratory alkalosis with marked A-a gradient with pO2 in the 50's.
- Pulmonary consultation was obtained and formulated a likely multifactorial etiology, but could not rule out radiation pneumonitis s/p XRT and possibley cardiac catheterization as a possible etiology.
Aspiration pneumonitis surrounding cardiac cath was also considered - Lasix diuresis improved oxygenzation - Prednisone was started, but later discontinued per pulmonary given lack of clear benefit in pneumonitis and possibility that it may worsen pt's fluid balance.
CXR without evidence of focal consolidation, but given evidence for Lung CA progression.
Patient was treated with Levofloxacin/Flagyl for possible aspiration vs. post-obstructive pneumonia.
- rate controlled with metoprolol - continued ASA and Clopidogrel  5) Non Small Cell Lung Cancer: Repeat PET CT scan from [**2154-1-7**] revealed evidence for progression of disease s/p XRT.

You had significant trouble breathing and were taken care of in the ICU.
You had an element of congestive heart failure, and possible obstructive pneumonia.
Most significantly your chest CT and recent PET scans show evidence for progression of lung cancer.
Call your doctor or 911 if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, headaches, difficulty urinating or any other concerning symptoms.
