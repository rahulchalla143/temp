Prior to presentation, her home lasix had been stopped due to hyponatremia.
She also notes that her dyspnea has increased since her aldactone was stopped in mid-[**Month (only) **] because of hyperkalemia.
The team obtained LE ultrasound and CTA chest, which were negative for DVT or PE.
Because of concern for possible pneumonia on her CXR, she started treatment with vancomycin and ceftriaxone on [**9-13**] (switched to vanc/ceftazidime [**9-14**]).
The team obtained plain films of her knee and hips because of a known h/o hip infection and persistent leukocytosis.
[**Month/Day (4) 1957**] was consulted and MRIs obtained, concerning for right hip infection (where she has hardware from an arthroplasty).
She was found to have E coli from her right hip aspirate, and zosyn was started on [**9-15**].
Because of difficulties with hypoglycemia, she was started on stress dose steroids given concern for adrenal insufficiency.
The night prior to transfer, Ms. [**Known lastname 68459**] was triggered for acute hypoxia.
Per report, she had an episode of scant hemoptysis (not witnessed by MD).
However, she continued to have an increasing oxygen requirement through the day and was transferred to the MICU for further care.

Father w/ COPD and EtOH cirrhosis  Physical Exam: VS - 97.8 104 126/69 27 95% 6L GENERAL - frail-appearing woman who appears anxious, she is mildly tachypneic and has some distress when speaking.
HEENT - Pupils equal, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear, +spider angiomata NECK - supple, +JVD to angle of jaw when sitting at 45 degrees LUNGS - crackles throughout lung fields b/l HEART - Regular tachycardia with systolic murmur ABDOMEN - +BS, soft/NT, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - warm with 2-3+ pitting BLE edema to above knees R hip is tender to palpation and with movement at hip joint (leg roll) SKIN - spider angiomata NEURO - awake, appropriate, A&Ox3, slight asterixis present   Pertinent Results: [**2158-9-11**] MRI hip 1) Very limited study for reasons stated above.
2) Small residual or recurrent fluid collection within the soft tissues lateral and superior to the proximal aspect of the right hip prosthesis contiguous with the prosthesis, though intra-articular extent cannot be established on this study.
Susceptibility artifact from the prosthesis limits evaluation for a hip joint effusion, though no large effusion is directly visualized.
3) Severe diffuse subcutaneous edema/anasarca as well as deep interfascial and muscular edema throughout the right thigh.
No deep abscess/focal fluid collection.
[**9-8**] bilateral hip xray Since the prior study, interval continued periostitis and erosion of the lateral aspect of the proximal femur.
This is worrisome for continuing infection  Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 49-yo woman w/ HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, c/b ascites, encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic hydrothorax, currently on [**Month/Day (4) **] list w/ MELD 15, directly admitted from clinic w/ worsening BLE edema and SOB in setting of being off diuretics due to hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.
Transferred to MICU [**2158-9-16**] for progressively worsening hypoxia and dyspnea (See MICU course below) .
SOB and BLE edema - Likely [**1-7**] fluid overload in setting of being off diuretics.
CXR does not reveal pulm edema or pleural effusions as expected.
Improved significantly w/ diuresis and addition of albumin.
She improved for several days w/ diuresis but then her platelet count dropped and she developed hemoptysis, after which her O2 sats dropped, CXR demonstrated alveolar and interstitial opacities and she was transferred to the ICU for further management of her hypoxia.
She was intubated in the ICU and diuresed for several days after her sugery, her oxygenation slowly improved and she was extubated and transferred to the floor.
had been on bactrim suppression for CONS infxn of hardware, but got increasing hip pain and low grade temps.
Hip was tapped and grew E. coli resistant to everything except pip/tazo and amikacin.
She recieved a right hip explant of all hardware w/ placement of an abx spacer and continued on vancomycin and meropenem per ID for a total 6-week course.
Hyponatremia - Hypoalbuminemia vs. adrenal insufficiency.
She was given albumin along w/ hydrocortisone for combination of persistent hypoglycemia and hyponatremia.
complained of pain and locking of her jaw while chewing.
Anemia - Appears anemia of liver disease, Hct trended slowly downward and on day of transfer to MICU was 21.1.
An NG tube was placed in the ICU and she hemorrhaged from her nose and required multiple transfusions before it stopped.
HCV cirrhosis - Pt w/ HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, c/b encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, ascites, and hepatic hydrothorax.
Asthma - was continued on her montelukast and advair along w/ albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
presented w/ persistent hypoglycemia.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency - continued home prednisone, started stress dose hydrocortisone for persistent hypoglycemia/hyponatremia which was tapered back to home dose after 2 doses of stress dose.
Depression / anxiety - continue home Effexor psych was consulted per [**Last Name (STitle) **] coordinators request.
Osteopenia - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate .
MICU Course Patient transferred to MICU on [**9-16**] for progressively worsening hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation [**9-16**].
Chest CT and CXR c/w diffuse airspace consolidation which was thought to be multifactorial secondary to ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **], pulmonary edema +/- infection.
She was continued on standing and prn ALbuterol and Atrovent MDIs while intubated with improvement in respiratory exam but persistent R pleural effusion which will be tapped by IP [**2158-9-27**] prior to transfer.
On [**2158-9-16**] she developed severe epistaxis when placement of NGT was attempted with drop of HCT to 17 requiring 5 units PRBC to maintain stable HCT.
There were no further episodes of bleeding.
Meropenem and Vancomycin were continued for hip infection and had removal of hardware with explant and replacement with antibiotic spacer on [**2158-9-19**].
Intraop cx grew Enterococcus sensitive to Vanc and Coag neg staph.
She was afebrile during MICU course.
She was tolerating PO diet at time of transfer with clear mental status.
