Admission Date:  [**2162-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, fever, respiratory distress.
History of Present Illness: This is a 39-year-old gentleman with NHL s/p alloSCT [**2155**] and DLI [**2156**], in remission but with chronic GVHD including bronchiolitis obliterans and severe restrictive lung disease being admitted from [**Hospital1 **] with hypoxia to 82%, increased yellow-white secretions, and respirtory distress.
He denies dysuria, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea or other symptoms.
Of note, he was recently discharged on [**3-16**] after 2 month hospital stay complicated by repeated respiratory failure ultimately requiring trach ([**3-8**]) and VAP.
He was readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fever on [**3-22**], for which he was treated for Klebsiella pneumonia and bacteremia.
Patient presented with fevers, increased pulmonary secretions and increased ventilator requirements.
His blood cultures and sputum cultures were positive for Klebsiella.
He was initially treated with Vancomycin/Meropenem/Bactrim, but this was later tailored to Meropenem and Tobramycin for ESBL Klebs double coverage.
Given Tylenol and Vancomycin, afebrile on time of transfer to ICU.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he is feeling significantly better, denies respiratory distress or any other symptoms.
Past Medical History: - [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this was treated with a course of Rituxan.
No evidence for recurrence of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain.
MRI revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle bilaterally.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has remained in remission.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small new pneumothorax in the left apical area.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics with possible pneumonia.
Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD in setting of his URIs.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo SCT 2.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.

A small amount of intra-abdominal ascites and small pleural effusion.
LUE US [**5-5**]:  Soft tissue edema, without discrete fluid collection underlying prior left basilic vein PICC insertion site.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39-year-old gentleman with chronic repiratory failure, vent dependent, secondary to GVHD-associated bronchiolitis obliterans who was admitted for ventilator associated pneumonia with sputum cultures growing multiple strains of multi-drug resistant pseudomonas.
# PSEUDOMONAS PNA:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] has had numerous strains of high resistant pseudomonas, and had been on tobramycin prophylaxis prior to admission.
A CT chest on [**4-27**] showed increased bilateral pleural effusions without evidence of empyema.
Sputum cultures continued to show multi-drug resistent pseudomonas.
FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely due to recurrent pneumonias (multiple sputum samples positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa) though other sources were ruled out.
Patient's left PICC line was pulled on [**4-30**]; he was started on IV vancomycin for empiric gram positive coverage and this was continued despite a negative catheter tip culture.
Moreover, patient was treated with flagyl despite multiple negative stool samples for clostridium difficile.
There was also concern for infection at the site of previous PICC line in LUE however, [**Month/Day (4) 950**] was negative for fluid collection or other signs of infection.
Finally, it was thought that fevers/white count may be the results of underlying GVHD, and prednisone was increased from 15mg to 40mg; however, as fevers resolved and white count remained stable, prednisone was decreased to baseline of 15mg QD.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Although Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was initially stable on pressure support, he became tachypnic after multiple episodes of mucous plugging and was switched to assist control.
HISTORY OF NHL STATUS-POST ALLO [**Known lastname 3242**] COMPLICATED BY GVHD:  Most recent PET scan with no evidence of recurrent disease.
GVHD is underlying cause for patient?????
?s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was found to have a clot in one of his left brachial veins.

You came to the hospital because of low oxygen saturations and increased secretions.
You were found to have a pneumonia caused by an organism called pseudomonas aeuruginosa.
We also found a clot in your left arm, likely the result of a PICC line that had been placed there.
Return to the hospital if you develop increased shortness of breath or trouble breathing, fevers, rising white count, pain with urination, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, abdominal pain, palpitations, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.
