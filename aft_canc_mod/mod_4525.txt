Colonoscopy and imaging there had suggested colonic origin.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where CT abdomen/pelvis revealed sigmoid diverticulosis but no active extravasation.
She underwent colonoscopy under anesthesia that revealed diverticulosis of sigmoid colon and polyps in descending and sigmoid colon but did not identify site of bleeding.
She continued to have multiple episodes of dark maroon colored output from rectum.
She was taken for CT angiography that was also negative for active extravasation.
Surgery consult team was made aware of the patient how given inability to localize bleeding no surgical intervention was recommended.
Pt's bleeding improved and stool changed from maroon to brown w/out evidence of frank blood.
# DVT: On the floor, pt complained of leg pain.
# CAD: Pt's history of CAD was unclear.
Denies any chest pain or new onset SOB.
Isosorbide mononitrate continued to be held given concern over bleeding and risk of hypotension.
# CHF: TTE performed at admission showed preserved EF > 55% and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal biventricular systolic function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
# Rapid afib: In the ICU, HR increased to 120s on HD2; she was given one time dose of diltiazem 5mg which decreased HR to 60s but pt remained in afib.
On the floor, pt had 2 episodes of afib w/RVR which required pushing of IV diltiazem and support with IV fluids given low blood pressure.
# Interstitial lung disease: Pt had unclear history of interstitial lung disease and had been on low dose prednisone at home.
This was held during ICU course and continued to be held on the floor due to bleeding concerns.
Pt also had some wheezing and coarse lung sound whihc improved w/nebulizer treatments.
# Urinary retention: Patient is being treated for urinary urgency with incontinence.
She had an episode of urinary retention for ~8hrs in which she was found to have 750 mL of urine in her bladder.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation and Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: lower GI bleed from unknonw source hypotension anemia due to acute blood loss atrial fibrillation w/rapid ventricular rate .
Secondary: bilateral DVT requiring placement of an IVC filter UTI GERD Interstitial lung disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having bleeding from your lower gastrointestinal track.
You needed to be admitted to the ICU because of the extent of your bleeding and the need for significant blood transfusions and blood pressure support.
Multiple attempts were made to determine the source of the bleeding including a colonoscopy and a special imaging scan.
Your bleeding slowed and finally stopped.
However, while on the medicine floor, you had several episodes of a fast irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation which resulted in low blood pressure.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection and were treated with antibiotics.
