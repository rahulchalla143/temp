Admission Date:  [**2180-8-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-9-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-4-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY  PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Unresectable metastatic colon cancer to liver.
Previous coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction times three).
History of ventricular tachycardia with automatic implantable cardiovascular defibrillator.
Partial colon resection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] previously for a lower anterior resection of rectus sigmoid carcinoma on [**2176-6-28**].
Follow-up CT of the chest and abdomen on [**2180-2-21**], showed a large area of heterogenous perfusion measuring 8.6 x 7.7 cm.
Upon subsequently admission to the hospital on [**7-10**] for chest, abdominal and back pain, he received another CT scan of the abdomen that displayed a poorly defined area of heterogenous enhancement located within the right lobe of the liver that increased in size compared to the prior exam.
The lesion was deemed to be a metastatic spread of his previous colon cancer, and he was planned for elective surgery.
He was seen by Cardiology and Anesthesia prior to surgery and was cleared.
He was admitted on [**2180-8-31**], for exploratory laparotomy with possible excision of the right hepatic lobe.
Postoperatively he complained of some abdominal pain but did quite well otherwise.
During his stay in the hospital, a right internal jugular triple-lumen catheter was placed with no complications.
He tolerated the procedure well, and his chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax and showed good placement of the catheter tip.
On [**9-1**], he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit as he was found unresponsive, cyanotic and hypoxic.
Chest x-ray at the time showed right upper lobe and right middle lobe infiltrates but no evidence of pneumothorax.
His abdomen is soft and nontender and slightly obese.
