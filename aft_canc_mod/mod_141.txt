She woke up at 8 am with substernal chest pressure.
It was severe initially.
She took SL NTG x3 with relief of CP for a short period of time.
The CP radiated to her right side and eventually down both arms.
She reports diaphoresis, but denied associated nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness or dizziness.
She reports that she has felt mildly SOB since her recent pneumonia (first diagnosed appox [**6-24**] weeks ago).
Her cough has improved substantially and is very minimal at this time.
She went to her PCP's office and was found to have a new LBBB and anterior ST elevations.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: Pt with MI in [**2134**] and subsequent 1 vessel CABG SVG ->LAD -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:  none -PACING/ICD:  none 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # CVA - small left posterior frontal infarct in [**2164-12-17**] for which she is on [**1-18**] tab of plavix daily # hypercholesterolemia.
# small PFO.
# Macular Degereration  Social History: # Clopidogrel [Plavix] 75 mg Tablet PO Daily # Ezetimibe-Simvastatin [Vytorin [**11-5**]] 10 mg-20 mg PO daily  # Nifedipine 30 mg SR PO qday # Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg/hour Patch 24 hr 1 patch once a day # Nitroglycern sublingual tabs PRN - has not used recently prior to today # Propranolol 80 mg Tablet PO once a day # Multivitamin .
Family History: Her father died due to CAD at age 52.
Her mother had stomach cancer and bone cancer.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTA anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Distal LAD diffuse diseased.
LCX: occluded OM2, 50% LCX RCA: Occluded  Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who presented with an STEMI s/p catheterization and was incidentally found to have multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Her TIMI risk score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.
There was concern for acute heart failure from ischemic insult oxygen requirement.
However, she was noted to also have a RLL pneumonia and no significant pulmonary edema (see below).
ECHO showed moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
Initially, patient  was started on coumadin for ventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly discontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit.
As the patient had history recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which showed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new diffuse lung nodules with  sputum cytology positive for adenocarcinoma.
Hypoxia was initially felt to be a combination of postobstructive pneumonia and tumor burden from adenocarcinoma.
Repeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower lobe infiltrate.
Likely this will continue to be necessary for some time.
# Lung nodules/ Broncheoalveolar carcinoma: CT scan with diffuse pulmonary nodules and sputum cytology positive for adenocarcinoma.
Etiology was felt to be primary bronchioalveolar vs metastatic thyroid dx (prior dx of possible microfollicular carcinoma) although routine cancer screening was not up-to-date.
A tissue diagnosis was not attained given the patient's high oxygen requirement and anticoagulation with plavix/asa in the setting of recent BMS placement.
Although patient did not have imaging of her head, staging based on CT torso was IIIa with pulmonary nodules in both lung fields without obvious distal LAD or metastasis.
# Chronic renal insufficiency - Patient with GFR 48.
# Hyperkalemia:  The patient was mildly hyperkalemic the day prior to discharge to 5.6 without EKG changes.
# HTN:  She was normotensive on ACEI and b-blocker.
Medications on Admission: # Clopidogrel [Plavix] 75 mg Tablet PO Daily # Ezetimibe-Simvastatin [Vytorin [**11-5**]] 10 mg-20 mg PO daily  # Nifedipine 30 mg SR PO qday # Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg/hour Patch 24 hr 1 patch once a day # Nitroglycern sublingual tabs PRN - has not used recently prior to today # Propranolol 80 mg Tablet PO once a day # Multivitamin  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction Presumed broncheoalveolar carcinoma   Discharge Condition: stable, with 5L oxygen requirement and O2 Sat in the low 90s   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pressure and found to have a heart attack.
You had a cardiac catheterization and had a bare metal stent placed.
After this, you had some trouble breathing and had a scan that showed some nodules in your lungs.
A sputum sample was sent and malignant cells were seen.
