He was diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2145-8-31**] now follows with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16212**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.
In [**Month (only) 359**] he developed acute cord compression and had decompression on [**2145-10-15**].
He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 56568**] for shortness of breath with new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL post obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA. During last admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later, pleurex catheter placement on [**11-17**].
Pleural fluid positive for malignant cells, AFB smear negative.
IP did not feel mass was amenable to stenting.
When arrived back at rehab, he was sent to the ED due to inability to drain the effusion.
CXR performed with finding of interval increase in pleural effusion and R lung base opacificition.
A bedside ultrasound was obtained showing no pericardial effusion.
Notes he gets dyspneic at times but no different lately.
Actually denies shortness of breath currently.
No CP, no pleuritic pain.
Notes continued numbness and weakness in his lower extremities since his acute cord compression.
+lower extremity edema x few weeks.
+ weight loss.

H/o C diff colitis in [**2145-9-30**] 3.
COPD 4.
Atrial fibrillation  Social History: Originally from [**Country 651**], immigrated to the US > 10 years ago; was living with his son and daughter until discharge yesterday (discharged to rehab in [**Hospital1 392**]).
Family History: No family history of malignancy  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.2 BP: 128/59 P: 76 R: 26 SaO2: 97 RA General: Cachectic male, alert, oriented, moderately tachypneic with some accessory muscle use.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds on right, few rales, somewhat rhonchorous with ?pleural rub.
CV: tachycardic, irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs, gallops appreciated Abdomen: soft, thin, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
No calf tenderness.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved suggesting a non-ischemic etiology.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial anterior pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2145-11-20**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound: Peroneal veins not visualized.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
[**2145-11-21**] Chest Xray There is essentially no change in chest findings with right upper lobe complete opacification, right pleural effusion, ground-glass opacity and mass-like consolidation in the right lower lobe, nodular opacity projecting in the left upper lobe and peribronchial abnormalities in the left lower lobe or due to patient's known non-small cell lung cancer.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with metastatic lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion admitted for pleural catheter drainage.
He was initially admitted overnight to the MICU after experiencing shortness of breath, tachypnea and hypoxia in the emergency room; however, this quickly resolved.
# Shortness of Breath: He has baseline shortness of breath due to persistent malignant effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia secondary to mass.
# Pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient completed a course for post-obstructive pneumonia and other than leukocytosis as below has no other signs or symptoms of infection.
UA negative, CXR without new findings, C. diff negative as above, blood cultures are no growth to date and patient ruled out for flu, parainfluenza, adenovirus and RSV.
Tachypnea and hypoxia improved as above with drainage of pleurex.
# Stage IV NSCL and Malignant effusion: Known mets to spine and malignant effusion.
# Leukocytosis: C. diff negative, CXR unchanged other than effusion, UA negative and blood cultures no growth to date.
Patient remained afebrile and non-toxic appearing, though chronically ill.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to malignancy.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tach vs MAT.
No clear Afib history and he was intermittently irregular making MAT more likely (though difficult to appreciate p waves when accelerated rhyhtm).
