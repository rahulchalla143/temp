Admission Date:  [**2118-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-6-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old right-handed woman presenting with Transfer with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Two days ago, on Wednesday night, she felt in her normal state of health watching television, perhaps the Red Socks when she developed a sudden onset posterior headache.
It did not radiate, sharp, constant without banging.
She noticed that she had difficulty seeing her peripheral vision on the right, which would wax and wane.
It wasn't black nor were there positive phenomena, it was simply that this part of her vision wasn't there.
She only told her brother a few hours ago after she was in the hospital ([**Hospital3 2568**]) from whence she was transferred upon finding hypertension and a intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
She has a chronic intermittent morning cough which she attributes to smoking.
In [**2117-10-7**], she had hit her head on a cabinet and had headaches since that event.
On [**2115-10-12**] she noted some visual disturbance as she was walking to her car.
EEG at [**Hospital1 **] showed "sharp and slow wave activity."
MRI brain at [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2115-10-18**] showed two small subacute right occipital infarcts and a subacute left superior frontal infarct.
CTA brain/neck showed left MCA aneurysm, atherosclerosis of the right PCA, mild narrowing of the left vertebral artery origin, mild bilateral narrowing of the proximal ICA's.
Holter monitoring did not show atrial fibrillation.
No evidence of ASD of PFO by bubble study.
No other vascular malformation was found.
- She has a history of melanoma resection from her chin.
- hyperlipidemia.
- Palpitations - Hypertension, borderline, saw PCP two years ago - Tonsillectomy, Dilatation and curettage.
Family History: Older brother, now deceased, had seizure and clotting disorders (PE).
Father - lung cancer - was a smoker.
Peripheral pulses normal.
No paraphasic errors.
Knowledge: Appropriate fund of knowledge - vocabulary and recent events.
Construction is impaired - draws form and not details of a copied figure.
Visual fields are significant for homonymous hemianopia on right.
Fundi are normal (discs and cups), but with pigmentary changes and increased tortuosity of vessels.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full, conjugate and without nystagmus.
No tremor or abnormal movements.
No extinction to DSS, no agraphesthesia.
Discharge examination: Alexia without agraphia, acalculia (significantly affected as patient was an accountant), right homonymous hemianopia and no focal limb weakness, sensory disturbance or other CN abnormality.
Colour naming errors and finger agnosia had resolved at time of discharge.
**FINAL REPORT [**2118-6-5**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2118-6-5**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Radiology: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; OUTSIDE FILMS READ ONLY Study Date of [**2118-6-3**] 9:50 AM FINDINGS: There is a large left occipitoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring approximately 5.8 x 3.0 cm.
A second hyperdense focus is present just lateral to this large hemorrhage and measures 7 mm (2, 14).
This may reflect another region of intraparenchymal hemorrhage or a small focal subdural hematoma.
Hemorrhagic hyperdense material is layering along the tentorium and falx suggesting a component of subdural hematoma.
There is intraventricular extension with blood in the left lateral ventricle.
A small amount of blood is likely also present in the third ventricle (2, 15).
There is relative enlargement of the right lateral ventricle suggesting some component of compression.
Metallic artifact is present in the region of the left MCA suggesting prior aneurysmal coiling.
There is no evidence of acute or prior infarction.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
No fracture is identified.
Large left occipitoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, as above.
2 mm rightward midline shift.
Relative enlargement of the right lateral ventricle suggesting component of compression.
Smaller second focus of hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe may be a second small intraparenchymal hemorrhage or focal subdural hemorrhage.
Subdural hemorrhage layering along the left tentorium and falx.
There is associated mass effect with effacement of the overlying sulci and relatively mild rightward shift of the septum pellucidum, measuring up to 4 mm, also unchanged.
There is no definite "trapping" of the contralateral lateral ventricle or evidence of more central herniation.
There is associated ventricular hemorrhage with clot occupying the atrium and extending into the occipital and temporal horns of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
There is also overlying subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as subdural blood layering along the dorsal aspect of the falx and over the left leaflet of the tentorium, all unchanged.
No new hemorrhagic focus is identified.
Again demonstrated is extensive metallic "star" artifact originating from coils in the region of the left MCA bifurcation, presumably related to previous treatment of an aneurysm at this site, limiting the evaluation of adjacent structures.
No definite peripheral or central CTA "spot sign" is identified in association with the large parenchymal hematoma to suggest extravasation portending rapid expansion.
Allowing for the presence of the clot, there is no evidence of underlying arteriovenous malformation or other vascular anomaly.
No aneurysm is identified in the region or elsewhere in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], with evaluation of the region of the left MCA bifurcation, limited by the metallic artifact.
There is normal, symmetric opacification of the major dural venous sinuses and principal deep cerebral veins with no evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
There is no significant mural irregularity or steno-occlusive disease involving the cerebral vasculature.
There is only minimal calcific atherosclerotic plaque involving the aortic arch and great vessel origins, with no flow-limiting stenosis at these sites.
There is also calcific more than soft plaque involving both carotid bulbs and proximal ICAs; however, again, there is no evidence of flow-limiting stenosis with the Dmin measurements, as follows: On the right, proximal, 6 mm, distal, 4.5 mm; on the left, proximal, 6 mm and distal, 4 mm.
The remainder of the examination is notable for fairly severe panlobular emphysema at the lung apices, without discrete bulla formation.
There is also biapical calcific pleuroparenchymal scarring, which may relate to old granulomatous disease.
The thyroid gland is grossly unremarkable and there is no cervical lymphadenopathy.
The [**Last Name (un) **]-, oro- and hypopharyngeal mucosal surfaces are grossly unremarkable.
There is multilevel, multifactorial degenerative disease involving the cervical spine, most marked at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there is both central spinal canal and severe left neural foraminal narrowing with possible exiting neural impingement.
Also, incidentally noted are DISH involving the imaged cervicothoracic spine, as well as a congenital fusion anomaly involving the posterior neural arch of C1.
No significant short-interval change in the large left parieto-occipital "lobar" hemorrhage, as well as associated left intraventricular and subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage; the overall appearance is highly suggestive of underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
No evidence of underlying arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or other vascular anomaly.
No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
Status post apparent aneurysm coiling at the left MCA bifurcation, with no other aneurysm seen to involve the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
Calcific atherosclerosis involving the both carotid bifurcations and proximal internal carotid arteries, without flow-limiting stenosis.
Streaky linear opacities at left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis given their absence on the comparison study from earlier in the day.
Lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of pleural effusions, focal airspace consolidation or pneumothorax.
Overall, there are slightly less vascular markings in the upper lungs relative to the lower lungs which suggests a component of underlying emphysema given the patient's history of smoking.
If a lung primary remains of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT should be considered.
There is expected extensive "blooming" susceptibility artifact associated with the large left parieto-occipital "lobar" hemorrhage.
There is similar susceptibility artifact related to the transependymal dissection with significant left lateral ventricular component, as well as the overlying subarachnoid and subdural blood, layering along the left lateral aspect of the falx, posteriorly, as well as the left leaflet of the tentorium.
These findings are consistent with underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
There is only faint vascular and, perhaps, early marginal enhancement involving the lobar hematoma, but no discrete peripheral or central nodular or mass-like enhancement to suggest an underlying space-occupying lesion.
There is no pathologic parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement, elsewhere.
Apart from the expected zone of vasogenic edema surrounding the large parenchymal hematoma, not significantly changed from the CTA, there is also more diffuse sulcal FLAIR-hyperintensity suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, also likely related to CAA.
There are also scattered punctate, more ovoid and more confluent T2-/FLAIR-hyperintense foci in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular, as well as central pontine white matter, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
In the region of the lobar hemorrhage, the DWI sequence is not interpretable; however, elsewhere, there is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event, and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids, including those of dural venous sinuses are preserved, and these structures enhance normally, corresponding to the findings on the recent CTA.
Expected marked susceptibility artifact associated with the known left parieto-occipital lobar hemorrhage and associated intraventricular and overlying subdural blood.
Diffuse sulcal FLAIR-hyperintensity, likely representing subarachnoid blood, more evident than on the recent CT (this is in a non-aneurysmal pattern).
The overall constellation of findings is highly suggestive of underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) with leptomeningeal vascular involvement.
Only expected early enhancement of the evolving parenchymal hematoma, with no finding to suggest underlying mass lesion.
Normal opacification of the cerebral venous system with no evidence of thrombosis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-6-5**] 2:16 AM FINDINGS: There is a large left occipitoparietal parenchymal hemorrhage similar in size and appearance compared to [**2118-6-3**].
A second hyperdense focus is present just lateral to this (2, 13) which may reflect another area of parenchymal hemorrhage or a small focus of subdural hematoma.
There is extension of hemorrhage into the left lateral ventricle as well as layering along the left tentorium falx suggesting subdural hematoma, unchanged from the prior examination.
There is mild asymmetric enlargement of the right ventricle; however, the ventricle size appears similar to [**6-3**], [**2118**].
Minimal rightward shift of normally midline structures (2 mm rightward shift) is noted, unchanged from the prior examination.
There is no evidence of acute major vascular territory infarction.
Periventricular and subcortical low attenuating regions appear consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Bilateral mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
Stable large left occipitoparietal parenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, 2 mm rightward midline shift, unchanged from [**6-3**], [**2118**].
Subdural hemorrhage layering along the left tentorium and falx, unchanged from the prior examination.
A smaller second focus of hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe may represent second smaller parenchymal hemorrhage or focal subdural hematoma, unchanged from the prior examination.
No new acute foci of hemorrhage.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2118-6-5**] 11:31 AM FINDINGS:  CT OF THORAX: The thyroid gland is unremarkable and there is no supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
No mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria is present.
With the exception of mild coronary artery calcifications, the heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.
There is no esophageal wall thickening or hiatal hernia.
Lung windows demonstrate moderate diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
No focal opacities.
Biapical consolidations likely represent age-related changes.
Calcified pleural plaques are noted.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in size without evidence of an intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Multiple calcifications are noted in segments 4A and B.
A small focus of focal fatty infiltrate is also noted in segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/b along the falciform ligament, likely related to focal perfusion abnormalities.
The right adrenal gland is within normal limits while the left adrenal gland demonstrates a 7 mm nodularity in its posterior lymph (3:59), which has a average attenuation of 8.3 Hounsfield units in the non-contrast CT, suggesting small adenoma.
The kidneys do not demonstrate any focal lesions and show symmetric nephrograms and excretion of contrast.
There are no perinephric abnormalities or fluid collection.
The stomach, small bowel and colon are within normal limits without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.
The appendix is not visualized, but there is no evidence of appendicitis.
There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
With the exception of atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta and main abdominal vessels there is no evidence of aneurysm or any other abdominal vascular abnormality.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria.
No ascites, free air, abdominal wall hernia is present.
There is no pelvic free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild left convex scoliosis centered in the upper lumbar spine is noted.
There are also degenerative changes at the lumbar spine, more prominent at the level of L2 on L3, but no lytic or blastic lesions concerning for malignancy.
No evidence of thoracic, abdominal or pelvic malignancy.
Chronic conditions including atherosclerotic vascular calcifications, clacified pleural plaques, centrilobular emphysema, degenerative changes of the spine, and diverticulosis are noted.

Brief Hospital Course: 62-year-old right-handed woman with a history of left MCA aneurysm s/p coiling in [**2115**], prior right occipital infarcts and a subacute left superior frontal infarcts on imaging in [**2115**] with negative workup and started aspirin and simvastatin per OSH records, borderline HTN, HLD and seizure disorder (with somewhat unclear history - please see "additional history" for details) who presented on [**2118-6-3**] as an OSH transfer with persistent (initially sudden onset) posterior headache and  fluctuating difficulties with right visual field which then became fixed.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], neurological exam was significant for right visual field homonymous hemianopia, alexia without clear agraphia, finger confusion, and color errors and acalculia.
CT showed a large left occipitoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and 2 mm rightward midline shift as well as associated left intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage suggestive of amyloid angiopathy.
CTA showed no evidence of underlying arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or other vascular anomaly.
CTV showed no evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
In addition, there was calcific atherosclerosis involving the both carotid bifurcations and proximal internal carotid arteries, without flow-limiting stenosis.
MRI showed several "micro-bleeds" peripherally-located in the posterior aspect of both cerebral hemispheres with only expected early enhancement of the evolving parenchymal hematoma, with no finding to suggest underlying mass lesion.
This was again suggestive of underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy with leptomeningeal vascular involvement.
Repeat CT was stable after worsening of word-finding difficulties.
Hypertension was controlled with uptitrating lisinopril to 40mg qd on discharge in addition to PRN IV hydralazine which was latterly not required.
Echo showed EF >55% and mild AR with mild valve sclerosis, mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
She had no seizures in house.
WBCs and platelets were mildly elevated and UA and chest exam were unremarkable and were felt to be likely reactive to her IPH.
The most likely aetiology was amyloid angiopathy given the multiple bleeding sources and evidence of microbleeds and other imaging findings suggestive of this.
MRI did not show any clear underlying lesion and she had a CT torso which showed no clear evidence of malignancy (This was pursued especially in light of a remote history of melanoma).
She will have an interval MRI w and w/o contrast in [**Month (only) **] to assess for underlying mass lesion once the hemorrhage has resolved.
Colour naming and finger agnosia resolved and writing (previously described as clumsy but not agraphia) had also improved and patient could spell words but could often not read directly and had striking acalculia (was able to only do one serial seven and had difficulty with simple arithmetic) given her job as an accountant.
There were no limb impairments and she was bright and alert while on the floor.
She had persistent headache treated with acetaminophen.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will need uptitration of her anti-hypertensives with goal BP <140/90 - Plt increase likely reactive and to be trended at rehab - Patient awaits repeat MRI w and w/o contrast on [**2118-7-25**] - Awaits neuro-ophthalmology review and formal visual fields in [**2118-7-8**] - Patient should discuss with PCP regarding cancer screening and f/u (Mammogram, Colonoscopy, Pap etc) and Dermatologist follow up due to history of melanoma - Patient to discuss Chantix with PCP to aid in smoking cessation - Pt was counselled to please avoid aspirin and antiplatelet agents  Medications on Admission: levetiracetam 750mg po bid MVI  Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Left Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage in the Parieto-Occipital Region with intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural extension likely secondary to amyloid angiopathy but awaiting repeat MRI to rule out underlying mass lesion .
Secondary Diagnosis: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Neuro Exam at time of Discharge: Alexia without agraphia, acalculia (significantly affected as patient was an accountant), right homonymous hemianopia and no focal limb weakness or other CN abnormality.
You were admitted from an outside hospital after having a bleed on the left side of the brain (in the parietal-occipital area) seen on CT and MRI.
This area of hemorrhage accounts for your headache, difficulties [**Location (un) 1131**] and problems with your right visual field.
Due to the bleed in the brain you were admitted initially to the intensive care unit but remained stable enough for discharge to the floor.
You examination remained stable and your MRI scan showed evidence of "microbleeds" suggesting a diagnosis of amyloid angiopathy (leaky blood vessels which can rupture and cause small or large bleeds in the brain) although an underlying lesion could not be definitievly ruled out.
You had a CT scan of the body which did not show any evidence of tumours.
Also, as you have had a history of melanoma we are recommending that you see Dermatology for a skin check after you are discharged.
Should you wish to participate we would be able to reimburse you for transportation costs.
We have organised stroke follow-up.
