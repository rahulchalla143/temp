In [**Month (only) 956**] when he began to develop graft rejection he was also diagnosed with prostatic cancer.
On [**2156-6-7**], he presented to an outside hospital complaining of substernal chest pain radiating to his bilateral shoulders and arms.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three-vessel disease.
Chronic kidney disease in 20s d/t interstitial nephritis versus post-infectious GN -- 1.5 yrs of HD prior to transplantation -- [**2138**] Cadaveric transplant -- Elevated cr, since [**2-/2156**] ~3.8 due to acute cellular rejection -- Hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia 2.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Aorta was examined and no evidence of dissection was noted.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.

If high clinical suspicion remains, we will obtain dedicated MRI when patient is able to tolerate.
Final Report HISTORY: Postop day #1 status post coronary bypass surgery with seizure activity.
Evaluate for intracranial pathology.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarct.
There is a subtle region of decreased attenuation within the periventricular white matter adjacent to the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] which is most suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic changes (although acuity is unclear given lack of any prior exams).
A few scattered punctate  calcifications are noted within the posterior fossa which may project off the tentorium or relate to prior infection or inflammation.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the anterior and posterior circulation.
There is pooling of secretions within the nasopharynx consistent with the patient's intubated status.
Mild mucosal thickening is present within the sphenoid sinuses, ethmoid air cells, and maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION:  1.No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Please note MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 634**] was noted to have rapid eye movement, facial twitching, tongue fasciculations - question of seizure activity.
Renal following for ongoing hemodialysis.
