Patient was started on coumadin in [**12-4**] and has intermittently had episodes of epistaxis relieved by cauterization.
Six days prior to admission, patient developed epistaxis again but did not decrease his coumadin.
Then on the day of admission, patient developed epistaxis, hemoptysis with cough productive of sputum and blood, and difficulty breathing.
Initial CXR demonstrated left-sided consolidation.
Labs were notable for elevated WBC to 16.3, INR 2.6, and creatinine 1.8.
Shortly after arrival, the patient triggered for hypoxia and he was transferred to the MICU.
Past Medical History: Stage III chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 2.1) Cystinuria with a history of heavy stone burden (on longstanding penicillamine until 3 yrs ago) Cutis laxa secondary to penicillamine [**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (thought to be secondary to penicillamine) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF) Pulmonary hypertension Atrial flutter s/p AV node ablation (with postprocedure complete heart block requiring pacemaker placement) Pancreatic low grade, benign mucinous cystic neoplasm (LGBMC) Large bilateral renal cysts Small AAA Popliteal aneurysm hyperuricosuria restless leg syndrome GERD  Social History: Works as a software engineer.
Is married with no children.
Physical Exam: T 100.8 / HR 92 / BP 111/50 / RR 13 / 96% on NRB Gen: resting comfortable in bed, NAD, speaking in full sentences without difficulty HEENT: Clear OP, MMM, no evidence of mucosal bleeding NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops LUNGS: scattered crackles throughout in the left lung field and clear to auscultation on the left; no dullness to percussion ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
Diagnostic considerations again include pneumonia.
Small left-sided pleural effusion .
CXR [**9-9**] Pneumonia involving the left upper and lower lobe .
Diagnostic considerations again include pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 58 yo male with past medical history of chronic kidney disease, GERD, and CHF was admitted with left-sided infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
Left upper and lower lobe consolidation Patient presented with left-sided consolidations.
Differential diagnosis includes the following: pneumonia, aspiration given patient's persistent epistaxis and sleeping on his left side, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Patient still with significant O2 requirement in the MICU, although difficult to interpret given patient's significant baseline nocturnal O2 requirement of 7 liters due to sleep apnea.
He improved and when his O2 requirement was gone he was transferred to the medical floor where he was stable and was discharged the following day.
Epistaxis Patient with a history of epistaxis requiring cauterization in the past.
Currently stable without persistent epistaxis although at high risk for rebleeding.
Significant risks for epistaxis including high flow O2 by nasal canula at night.
Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.8-2.1) Patient still within baseline, although creatinine increased from 1.8 to 2.1 since admisison.
Atrial Fibrillation Stable.
Hyperuricosuria Stable, continued outpatient management with allopurinol 100mg PO daily .
Pancreatic Mass Stable, continue outpatient monitoring .
Cystinuria - Stable, continued captopril, consider decreasing dose if creatinine continues to worsen but as it did not, captopril dose remained the same .
Restless Legs Syndrome - Stable, continued requip, oxycontin, oxycodone, and gabapentin pt's current dose of gabapentin appears quite high in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency, recommended further follow-up with outpatient [**Hospital1 3390**] regarding dosage .
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: aspiration pneumonia secondary to epistaxis  Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.8-2.1) Cystinuria with a history of urolithiasis(on longstanding penicillamine until 3 yrs ago) Cutis laxa secondary to penicillamine [**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (thought to be secondary to penicillamine) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF) Pulmonary hypertension Atrial flutter s/p AV node ablation (with postprocedure complete  heart block requiring pacemaker placement) Pancreatic low grade, benign mucinous cystic neoplasm (LGBMC) Large bilateral renal cysts Hyperuricosuria restless leg syndrome GERD Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation - on coumadin but complicated by epistaxis Sleep Apnea - on 7 liters of O2 at night - does not tolerate CPAP mask   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, satting well on room air, good po intake   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with nosebleed, and hemoptysis(cough productive of blood), you were transferred to the MICU due tolow oxygen saturation.
You are felt to have aspiration pneumonitis, an irritation of your lungs secondary to aspiration.
Call your doctor for any chest pain, increased cough, shortness of breath, headache, or any other symptoms.
