Bone scan, CT scan, and liver MRI were negative for metastatic disease, and she was treated with chemotherapy and radiation.
On [**2103-6-6**], her CA 27.29 was 32, and on [**2105-4-10**], it was noted to be elevated at 65.
On [**2105-4-23**], she underwent a CT scan of the chest and abdomen that demonstrated a 1.7-cm hypodense lesion in segment II thought to represent a cyst, as well as a 2.5-cm hypodense lesion with a lower density center in segment VIII of the liver.
A bone scan on [**2105-4-23**] demonstrated no metastatic disease.
On [**2105-5-28**], an MRI of the head demonstrated no evidence of intracranial metastases.
On [**2105-6-8**], a PET scan demonstrated the FDG-avid lesion in segment VIII measuring 4.4 x 2.9 cm.
A liver biopsy on [**2105-6-22**] confirmed metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.
On [**2105-6-29**], a follow-up CT scan demonstrated that the lesion was now 5.2 x 3.0 cm in size, with no other evidence of metastatic disease.
