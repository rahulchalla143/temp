The patient has had ongoing neutropenia spiking daily fevers with largely negative culture data with the exception of VRE UTI, and multifocal pneumonia and a right sided pleural effsuion.
She has been persistently tachypneic with RR 20-30 and hypoxic and had O2 sat of 94% on 4L.
She was given lasix 20mg Iv X1 yesterrday morning with marginal improvement, and she was incontinent of urine so output was unable to be assessed.
The patient has pmh of developmental delay, and is a poor historian, but she is not reporting pain, discomfort, or dyspnea.
Per report from the team, over the past week she has also developed new bilateral lower extremrity weakness, attributed to deconditioning, and sside effect of daptomycin, and urinary and fecal incontinence.
The urinary incontinence was attributed to a VRE and bowel incontinence attributed to new diahrrea.

A suggestion of fullness in the thoracic inlet, slight rightward tracheal deviation could be due to enlarged thyroid or adenopathy in that location.
A slight lateral convexity in the course of the line as it passes under the right clavicle could be due to local swelling, but may also be spurious.
Heart size top normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes, reflected in mild left basal atelectasis.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any.
No pneumothorax.

MRA NECK, HEAD and BRAIN: Study Date of [**2190-3-3**] 3:26 PM  1. severe stenosis of the supraclinoid left ICA of uncertain etiology with low flow with the left A1 and M1 segments.
Acute deep white matter infarcts in the left centrum semiovale may be secondary to a low flow state or may be watershed infarcts.
Diffusely hypointense bone marrow signal intensity may be secondary to anemia or neoplastic infiltration.
Diffuse dural enhancement which may be secondary to an infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Neoplasia cannot be excluded.

BIOPSIES   -- CYTOGENETICS --  BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS Procedure Date of [**2190-3-3**] KARYOTYPE: 46,XX[10]  INTERPRETATION: Only 10 metaphase cells were obtained and analyzed from this specimen and no cytogenetic aberrations were identified.
This limited/ incomplete study may not rule out mosaicism at a level that is standard for such an analysis.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
A normal CBFB FISH finding can result from absence of a CBFB rearrangement, from a variant CBFB rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

****Please see the online medical record for additional results which were not copied into this summary given large number of studies performed and lack of need to transfer care in the setting of death****   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 year old female with history of MDS presenting with acute leukemia, hospitalized for nearly 2 months for treatment and complications of disease, ultimately resulting in death.
Pt tolerated HDAC well, was still neutropenic (ANC = 0) by day 25, thus another BM bx was performed on [**4-18**] which showed a hypoplastic marrow.
ANC remained 0-20 and when patient started to develop high grade fever (see below), the G-CSF was discontinued due to concern of drug fever.
Although transplantation was considered, deferred indefinitely due to persistent infectious complications.
Severe myelosuppression remained and patient required multiple transfusions with pRBCs and platelets to maintain Hct > 25 and plt > 10. .
CNS Involvement: Mild R-sided weakness thought [**2-23**] recent CVA vs CNS involvement, thus IT chemo was initiated.
Neutropenic Fever: Patient initially developed low grade fevers (Tm 100.5) on [**3-5**] without localizing sx.
Subsequently, developed acute onset R cheek swelling.
Although swelling improved significantly on regimen, low grade fevers persisted so aztreonem was added to antibiotic regimen on [**4-20**].
Despite broad spectrum coverage with meropenem/ metronidazole/ micafungin/ vancomycin low grade fevers persisted.
Beginning on [**5-1**], the patient started spiking higher fevers to 102- 103 with occasional relative hypotension (SBP 80s), responsive to fluids.
Source thought to be most likely progressive multifocal pneumonia.
On [**5-11**], patient developed progressive respiratory distress with tachypnea, increased work of breathing and hypoxia requiring 100% NRB.
Repeat CXR showed increase of right middle and lower lung opacities, from increased pulmonary edema and worsening consolidation.
A diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed with removal of 800cc fluid, temporarily ameliorating respiratory distress, however pt continued to be tachypnic, hypoxic and short of breath when not on high flow oxygen.
Watershed infarct: During the week of [**5-4**], patient was noted to have increasing lower extremity weakness.
She also had new bladder and bowel incontinence on presentation to the ICU, correlating with a new frontal hypodensity that was subacute in nature attributed to leukostasis.
On exam, she was noted to have worsening RUE weakness/paresis which later evolved to paralysis.
Patient also noted to have new slight right-sided facial droop and rightward tongue deviation on tongue protrusion.
MRI shows acute ischemia in the left MCA as well as the ACA territory to a lesser extent.
Overall, the pattern appeared to have an acute on chronic nature which together with her known supraclinoid ICA stenosis is suggestive of ongoing embolic phenomena known as ?????
?160 to prevent continued poor perfusion to watershed infarct area.
Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, related to fluid overload as well as infection.
Pt is s/p thoracentesis [**5-19**] with removal of ~1L of fluid, consistent with exudative effusion.
Respiratory status improved with that treatment, with patient able to lie flat, however she continued to have high oxygen requirements.
Diarrhea: had intermittent ongoing diarrhea during hospitalization.
Nosebleeds: Had recurrent nosebleeds in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
Discoloration and Coolness of Right Hallux: evaluated by vascular surgery, felt likely to be an embolic event.
AVNRT: With onset of high fevers and septic-like phsyiology on [**5-1**], patient began to have episodes of SVT with heart rate as high as 150-170s.
Tachyarrhthymias were unresponsive to fluid and patient remained asymptomatic with stable blood pressure.
Etiology of tachycardia was thought to be secondary to high output/ catecholaminergic state related to malignancy and underlying pulmonary infection.
On [**5-14**] with progression of sepsis and development of hypotension responsive to fluids, Bblocker and CCB were discontinued, but were later reinitiated.
Transaminitis: Elevated transaminitis developed after patient briefly placed on daptomycin and voriconazole.
CT scan w/o contrast showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal U/S showed benign hepatic cysts, pleural effusions.
