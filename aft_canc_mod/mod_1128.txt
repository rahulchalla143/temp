He went to dialysis that day and the bleeding ceased with compression.
Later that night, he felt tired, lightheaded and was observed to be pale.
He was given a 500cc IVF bolus without response and was then started on dopamine.
Other causes of hypotension such as adrenal insufficiency and sepsis needed to be ruled out so a cortisol level and blood cx were sent.
A CT of the abd/pelvis was done and found no evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed.

---- CXR [**1-20**]:Normal chest --- [**2158-1-20**] 06:15AM BLOOD Cortsol-21.7*  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 75 yr old male with hx of cirrhosis, DM, ESRD [**3-7**] IgA Nephropathy who presented to ED with hypotension and bleeding from catheter site, sent to ICU for management of hypotension and transferred to floor when stable.
Bleeding: Pt has ESRD on HD, so has uremic plts.
Also has liver dx and MDS, so has chronically low platelets, and not surprised that PT and PTT are somewhat elevated.
Mildly elevated homocysteine level suggests propensity to clot.
Hypotension: ICU notes report thought to be secondary to bleed and/or fluid shifts from hemodialysis.
Had a Hct drop after admit, but unclear if dilutional in part.
Had abd/pelvis CT which showed no RP bleed.
Pt has had episodes of syncope in past, mostly in dialysis, and possible they are caused by fluid shifts/transient hypotension.
He did well with the procedure and was monitored post-op due to worry of fluid shift from arm to vasculature possibly causing CHF.
5.Psoriasis:Has worsening of psoriasis on areas around AVF s/p needling for HD.
Followed skin lesion which stayed stable.
* 4. s/p fall: Pt still complained of bruise on left side of chest from fall 2 weeks ago.
Pain gradually improving.
Ruled out for MI, but pain not cardiac in nature.
Cirrhosis: No evidence of encephalopathy.
Medications on Admission: Vancomycin 1gm at dialysis Nadolol 10 qd Protonix Lactulose Nephrocaps Ca Acetate Oxycodone  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Bleeding from tunneled HD line catheter site in right groin Hypotension Repair of upper venous stenoses bilaterally -- Cirrhosis ESRD on HD h/o syncope stable bradycardia MDS Thrombocytopenia Multiple venous clots DMII   Discharge Condition: Pt had no additional bleeding from groin catheter site.
