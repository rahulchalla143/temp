He denies confusion, but reports some left sided numbness that has persisted but improved slightly.
Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**] hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area 2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.
Past Medical History: Past onc history (per Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] initial outpatient note [**2110-6-9**]):  Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] developed hemoptysis in [**2110-3-1**].
A chest X-ray and chest CT showed a tumor in his R lung.
Pathology showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with ulceration, necrosis and lymphovascular invasion.
He was taken to [**Hospital1 9191**], where he had a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, showing brain metastasis.
He had a nonproductive cough but denied fever, chills, nightsweat,headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure, imbalance, urinary  incontinence, or fall.
The stent was replaced, and the patient is being transferred to the Oncology service for further management of his oncologic issues.

PA/LATERAL CXR: A large central right upper lobe mass is again demonstrated with associated right hilar and paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
Linear opacities projecting distal to the mass may represent a component of minor post-obstructive atelectasis or localized lymphangitic spread of tumor.
No pleural effusions or acute skeletal abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION: Large central right upper lobe neoplastic mass with associated right paratracheal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is a 2.5 x 2.6 cm right parasagittal frontal lobe mass with central areas of low attenuation and extensive adjacent vasogenic edema unchanged since recent MR study.
There is no significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There are no other masses or lesions.
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right frontal parasagittal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema, without significant mass effect or shift of midline structures.
No hemorrhage.
The mass measures approximately 2.7 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in its traverse, AP, and craniocaudal dimensions.
This appears to have minimally increased in size since the prior study from [**2110-6-11**].
Again seen is a large area of surrounding edema with sulcal effacement.
There is also depression of the right lateral ventricle and minimal right to left shift of the normally midline structures.
No new enhancing lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Large right frontal mass with surrounding edema again visualized.
There is some adjacent soft tissue swelling.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
There appears to be minimally increased subfalcine herniation with 14 mm midline shift compared to 13 on prior, although this may be due to technique and slice selection.
There is persistent edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle as well as sulcal effacement, which overall is otherwise similar.
There is trace residual pneumocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right frontal vasogenic edema with subfalcine herniation and minimally increased midline shift, which may be due to technique.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2110-7-7**]  TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic leaflet thickening without discrete vegetation or valvular regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 53-year-old man with a past medical history significant for HIV, Hep C, metastatic squamous cell lung ca with mets to the brain who was transferred from an outside hospital with a seizure.
He denies confusion, but reports some left sided numbness that has persisted but improved slightly.
Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**] hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area 2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.
Loss Of Consciousness: The patient was admitted with loss of consciousness and left sided numbness.
Brain Metastases: The patient has a known brain metastasis.
He was evaluated by the neurosurgical service on this admission, and underwent a steriotactic brain biopsy of a right frontal parasagittal mass on [**6-23**], which showed a  poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma on pathologic evaluation.
His post-operative course was complicated by development of stroke symptoms: Left facial droop and hemiplegia on [**6-29**].
CT revealed worsening right frontal vasogenic edema with new foci of parenchymal and possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and 13-mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
He underwent repeat head CT on [**2110-7-2**] demonstrating no new bleeds and mild improvement in edema.
On discharge, the patient had evidence of increasing strength on his left side (ability to lift left leg against gravity and mild resistance; and ability to move L hand mildly against gravity; unable to lift forearm or shoulder).
Non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to brain, adrenal glands: The patient has stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain and adrenals.
Hyponatremia: He developed hyponatremia following his brain resection.
The hyponatremia was thought to be due to cerebral salt wasting as well as SIADH from his lung cancer.
Fever: The patient experienced fevers post-operatively.
His infectious workup was notable for coagulase negative staph in two out of two blood cultures on [**2110-7-3**].
TTE was w/o evidence of endocarditis.
He defervesced without intervention.
See below for exerpt regarding the patients wishes and psychosocial concerns from a note by palliative medicine physician, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]:  "a) His priority right now is to spend as much time as possible with his family, especially with his partner of more than a decade [**Name (NI) **].
We discussed that he is to have another re-evaluation with PT today or tomorrow; he is focused on doing PT at home and prefers not to go to rehab.
However, as we discussed further what his priorities are, it became clear that he wants any remaining time to be spent alert, comfortable, and interactive with his loved ones, not intubated or unconscious in the ICU.
He initially says that maybe his cancer is punishment for his prior life, but then recants and says he doesn't really believe he is being punished -- "life is just being unfair";  He shared that he's happy he has done well with his dx of HIV/AIDS, which he acquired from IVDU; shared with pride that he has done a lot of HIV teaching in high school, is glad he has done something constructive with the hard events in his life.
