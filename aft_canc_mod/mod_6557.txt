Admission Date:  [**2133-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-2-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4611**] Chief Complaint: Right Parietal Occipital Brain Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Craniotomy with resection of supratentorial metastases Rhinoscopy   History of Present Illness: 62M w/ hx of ETOH abuse, A-fib, cardiomyopathy who was found to be confused and shaking on [**12-9**].
He was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive intervention.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Extensive nodular mass present throughout the neck, with lymphadenopathy present bilaterally and the largest conglomerate of masses seen on the right as detailed above.
Heterogeneous bulky appearance to the right side of the glottis and supraglottic region which needs evaluation with direct exmaination and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31186**] [**Last Name (un) 78953**] without and with contrast for better assessment of extension and exclude neoplasm in this location.
Heterogeneous mass close to the right palatine tonsil extending into parapharyngeal space and carotid space- ?
nodal mass or mass in the tonsillar/peritonsillar region.
There may be a small focus of residual nodular enhancement in the infratentorium which may represent residual disease versus post-surgical changes.
In the supratentorial compartment, there is smooth pachymeningeal enhancement, without nodularity to suggest residual neoplasm.
Large bulky mass in the right aspect of the neck as well as a necrotic node of Rouviere.
The findings may represent a conglomerate of metastatic lymph nodes, but the appearance given the relationship to the pyriform sinus raises the possibility of a primary neoplasm of the head and neck.
Combination of edema and encephalomalacia in right parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
No unexpected large hemorrhage.
Segment of non-opacification within the right transverse sinus, consistent with likely chronic occlusion.
Large mass centered in the right parietal bone, better assessed on recent MRI of the head.
[**12-10**] MRI Head Diffusely enhancing mass centered in the right parietal bone, extending into the subcutaneous tissues as well as involving the leptomeninges with mass effect on the adjacent right parietal and temporal lobes and probable invasion of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses.
Differential considerations include metastatic disease as well as a plasmacytoma.
Meningioma and a chronic infection are less likely but still considerations.
Findings of metastatic disease without a definite primary lesion identified.
Numerous hepatic masses consistent with metastases.
5mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Small right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.
Destructive lesion of the right ischium.
Right posterior sixth rib fracture without callus formation which therefore may be pathologic.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Muscle, mastoid, right (A-E): Metastatic carcinoma with focal squamous cell differentiation.
Bone, temporal, right (F-G): Metastatic carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation.
"Temporal tumor" right (H-O): Metastatic carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] dept of neurosurgery after having an episode of confusion and shaking.
He was then taken to an OSH, where CT head imaging revealed a right sided parietal-occipital mass.
MRI of the head, as well as CT of the Torso were obtained which revealed significant, likely metastatic disease.
A Lymph node biopsy was obtained which revealed metastatic carcinoma.
The patient underwent a craniectomy/craniotomy for resection of the skull mass and supratentorial lesion on [**2133-12-17**].
The patient went directly to CT scan from the OR and the scan showed no hemorrhage and confirmed resection of the supratentorial portion of the mass.
His neuro exam remained stable and he was ambulating without difficulty.
# Squamous cell Carcinoma: The patient's pathology revealed metastatic carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation.
Vascular surgery was consulted, given the proximity of the mass to the patients carotid artery, and they said they would be available for assistance, in the event that the neck mass would be resected.
His chemotherapy was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and neutropenia (pleae see below).
# Tumor lysis syndrome/[**Last Name (un) **]: Following his first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed signs of tumor lysis, including acute kidney injury, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia (in the setting of a high baseline uric acid level), and an LDH level that rose into the 5000s.
The aggressive hydration caused severe generalized edema.
His Is and Os remained even to slightly negative and his edema improved.
# Nuetropenia: Over the course of his hospitlaization the patient's cell counts decreased and on C1D#12  after the cisplatin/5FU he became neutropenic.
It was thought that his nuetropenia was likely due to the chemotherapy.
However, it was possible that his dilantin was contributing to decreased production in the BM so this medication was stopped.
The patient remained afebrile and was treated with supportive care.
ABG showed a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with an elevated lactate.
No EKG changes, and pt was warm, so unlikely cardiogenic shock.
Lasix was given to help with his breathing, but had no effect despite large doses.
Family was there and confirmed that he was DNI/DNR and they did not want an ICU transfer or escalated care.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient initially presented with a creatinine of 1.1.
# abdominal discomfort: The patient complained of increasing abdominal discomfort and gas with increased appetite, but nausea and pain after PO intake.
He continued to pass flatus and multiple loose BMs several times a day.
# Head trauma: On [**1-3**], the patient fell forward from sitting on the edge of his bed.
He quickly developed a hematoma over his right forehead.
STAT head CT revealed a extracranial hematoma, and (likely chronic) pooling of CSF at the site of the surgery.
Given the relative proximity to the patient's craniotomy site, neurosurgery was asked to come see the patient; they recommended no further intervention, other than the platelet transfusion and regular neuro checks.
The patient continued to have a non-focal neurologic exam as the hematoma resolved.
# BRBPR/Diarrhea: On the night of [**1-1**], the patient had a single episode of BRBPR, with no major change in Hct or hemodynamic instability.
Following that episode, the patient had frequent episodes of watery diarrhea, with no further blood.
# Atrial fibrillation w/RVR: The patient was generally well rate controlled with dilitazem 30 QID and lopressor 50 TID.
These medications were frequently held, because of hypotension.
The patient was kept on telemetry, which altered between runs of tachycardia and occasional bradycardia with asymptomatic pauses of ~2 seconds.
Anticoagulation was held, given chemo and expected drop in cell counts, BRBPR (see above), and recent neurosurgery.
# Cardiomyopathy/CHF - The patient was found to have an EF of 50-55% as seen on [**12-10**] TTE.
In spite of aggressive IV fluid hydration for tumor lysis (see above), the patient did not experience any dyspnea or hypoxemia suggestive of pleural effusions.
He did experience significant symmetric edema of his lower extremities, and gained upwards of 30 lbs.
His fluids were tapered and he was not aggressively diuresed (as above) and his edema resolved.
# Anemia - The patient maintained a Hct around 30.
His subcutaneous heparin was discontinued and he was placed on pneumoboots and ambulation for DVT prophylaxis.
# Hearing loss: The patient complained of worsening hearing out of both ears, in the days following his cisplatin/5FU regimen.
