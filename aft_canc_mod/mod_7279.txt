Allowing for this, no definite evidence of fracture of the cervical spine is identified.
There is probable degenerative change throughout the cervical spine, with facet joints hypertrophy.
It is difficult to determine whether the small degrees of apparent scoliotic configuration of the cervical spine represent patient movement or a true scoliosis.
There is multilevel intervertebral disk space narrowing, most prominent at C6-7.
No evidence of traumatic injury to the chest.
Dense structure with adjacent stranding within the anterior abdominal wall could represent a focal hematoma, although soft tissue mass related to a ventral wall hernia is not excluded.
Hypodensity adjacent to the falciform ligament within the right lobe of the liver could represent focal fatty infiltration versus other hypodense liver mass including hemangioma.
When the patient is able, an ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
Cystic structure in the right adnexa could represent an ovarian or paraovarian cyst.
4 mm nodule within the right lower lobe.
No significant interval change aside from new small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage or hemothorax.
Right adnexal cystic structure again may represent a para-adnexal cyst.
Ventral wall lesion just above the umbilicus which is approximately 4 cm in diameter and is of uncertain significance.
This is unchanged since the prior examination, and could represent a hematoma or other inflammatory lesion--correlate clinically.
The findings are nonspecific and could be secondary to ischemia or could be secondary to Wernicke's encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo woman with seizure and etoh abuse, found down by neighbour, likely in coma secondary to anoxic brain injury.
Decreased level of consciousness: Patient was intubated initially for concern of inability to protect airway, but following removal of sedative medications, patient continued to have no signs or indications of waking or cognitive function for two weeks.
Infectious etiologies were ruled out on the night of admission as lumbar puncture revealed no organisms and minimal white cells (2).
MRI revealed only bilateral thalamic lesions consistent with infarcts vs. Wernicke's, however neurology consultants felt that decreased level of consciousness was more likely due to diffuse anoxic brain injury endured during episode prior to presentation.
Nonetheless, patient had intermittent convulsions during late part of hospital course possibly thought to be seizures, therefore, patient was loaded on phenytoin and re-started on benzodiazepines in order to completely suppress seizure activity on EEG.Neurology assessed pt to have anoxic brain injury.
LP without evidence of infection.
EEG without active seizure.
However, had several witnessed seizure in MICU requiring large doses of ativan (10mg x3 on [**2-11**]).
After several days of continuous EEG, which showed no signs of seizure.
THis went on for several days, but she was not able to recover her mental status.
anemia - of note with slow bleed, on [**2-13**] her hematocrit was 19. unclear source.
iron : anemia of chronic disease.
/hemolysis labs negative.
Her anemia was stable while she was in the hospital.
Acute renal failure: THis resolved while in the hospital.
She passed on [**2-24**]  Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: cardiopulmonary arrest arrthymia status epilepticus acute renal failure anemia respiratory failure  Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none
