Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild apical dyskinesis, lateral wall akinesis, severe hypokinesis of all mid and distal sements, and mild basal hypokinesis of all segments.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly to moderately thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are bilaqteral pleural effusions.
The left ventricle displays apical akinesis with slight improvement in all the rest of the segments.
The mid and distal segments are still severely hypokinetic with the basal segments showing moderate hypokinesis.

He had recurrent pain and was transferred here for further care.
He remained pain-free and was worked up cardiac surgery.
He was cleared by hematology and subsequently was seen by the renal team and dialysis was started preoperatively for his worsening renal function.
The initial plan was to proceed with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, but in the Operating Room he was found to have adhesive pericarditis and he was also becoming hemodynamically unstable and it was decided to proceed with the operation on full cardiopulmonary bypass.
He was started on a Lasix drip on POD#1 due to a low urine output.
He was started on an Amiodarone drip due to ventricular arrythmias and EP was consulted due to his low EF.
He did have a bradycardic episode and was atrial paced at 56 for a brief period.
Echocardiography on [**1-2**] showed an EF 15-25%, 1+ mitral regurgitation and no pericardial effusion.
The patient also had an increased total bilirubin to a peak of 16.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed sludge but no evidence of biliary obstruction or distention of the gall bladder or an acute process.
Hepatology was finally consulted on [**1-8**] due to persisitently elevated LFTs and hyperbilirubinemia.
Multiple serology studies were sent to evaluate for hepatitis and are pending at discharge.
He has had no further ventricular ectopy on Amiodarone 200 mg daily.
Medications were adjusted for his renal failure and as he had rhythm issues postoperatively and the LFTs rose before Amiodarone was begun it was not discontinued completely.
He continued M-W-F dialysis without problems.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
