Admission Date:  [**2150-2-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2150-2-16**]   Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 84 year old man with a decreasing level of alertness and speech difficulties as well as coordination difficulties.
Over the past few weeks and the past few days he had increasing somnolence as well.
Today he had difficulty breathing and developed a cough productive of yellow-green phlegm.
He also developed bowel and bladder incontinence.
The patient was seen at [**Hospital1 69**] in [**Location (un) 620**] where he was noticed to have decreased movement in the right arm, a temperature of 101.0 F., a heart rate of 123 and a blood pressure of 87/55 with an elevated white count to 19.9.
He had a chest x-ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate.
He also had a head CT scan done that showed a large left frontal cystic mass with midline shift.
While at [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room the patient developed hypotension again responsive to fluid boluses in the Emergency Room.
He received Levaquin and Flagyl for suspected pneumonia as well as Decadron 6 mg intravenously q. six for increased intracranial pressure secondary to increased intracranial mass.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Right hip replacement.
Generally, he is a cachectic disheveled elderly man in no apparent distress.
Chest was poor breath sounds throughout.
No crackles, no wheezes.
Cardiovascular:  Heart rate were very faint; regular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities revealed scars on bilateral right thighs; no lower extremity edema.
Bilateral decubitus ulcer on the heels.
Speech without abnormalities.
He had a chest x-ray which revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
He had a head CT scan which revealed a large right frontal mass with midline shift with no evidence of intracranial bleed.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit secondary to presumed sepsis and hypotension complicated by extreme dehydration.
The hypotension was most likely related to right lower lobe pneumonia.
Hypernatremia:  This is likely secondary to dehydration.
On hospital day number two, the patient was again seen by Neurosurgery for evaluation of his presumed metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.
Neurological issues on hospital day two were brain mass with progressive neurological changes.
Neurosurgery recommended no intervention secondary to poor prognosis.
Neurosurgery discussed the patient's options which included a combination of resection with probable large deficit as an outcome versus lung biopsy for tissue diagnosis and possible chemotherapy versus comfort measures only.
Metastatic brain lesions.
Acute renal failure.
Pneumonia and secondary hypotension.
Bilateral heel ulcers.
