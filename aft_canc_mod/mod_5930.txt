IMAGING: # CXR [**2104-12-15**]: No acute intrathoracic process.
No evidence of pneumoperitoneum .
# Abd/pel [**2104-12-15**]: (prelim) Massive loculated abdominal ascites with complex components of peritoneal implants.
Mildly distended small bowel up to 3.3 cm in R hemiabdomen, without free air.
Much of colon compressed; mid upper abd anastomosis within normal limits.
Brief Hospital Course: 56-year-old woman with metastatic colorectal cancer presents with abdominal pain likely from worsening malignant ascites.
# Abdominal pain: Abd/pel CT showing worsening ascites and possibly liver mets.
Pt received paracentesos on [**12-17**] with improvment in pain (2L off), and fluid culture was negative to date so no concern for SBP.
She did not have peritoneal signs on exam, but abdomen remained markedly distended and tender in the upper quadrants.
Her pain was controlled with ocycontin and PRN oxycodone.
Given increased distension, there was concern for SBO and KUB showed partial obstruction likely [**2-26**] to peritoneal mets.
NG tube was placed with improvement of symptoms with decompression.
She developed fevers and tachycardia and was transferred to the ICU for concern for sepsis.
Her INR was allowed to trend down in the setting of parcentesis, and pt received 2 [**Location 16678**] prior to the procedure.
Lovenox was d/c in the ICU given elevated INR and concern for bleeding.
She was guaiac negative and nowo history of BRBPR or melena.
Initially she had poor Hct response but after her 2 Units on [**12-18**] she had 6pt Hct increase from 22.5-->28.7.
We feel that her anemia is likely related to her chemo, as there was no obvious bleeding and hemolysis labs were negative.
#ARF:  Pt noted to have a creatinine bump to 1.5 from 0.9 with subsequent slow upward trend after this.
Initially thought to be [**2-26**] volume depletion in the setting of poor PO intake and vomitting.
On [**12-21**] pt was noted to have poor urine output, so renal u/s obtained which showed No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Medications were dosed appropriately for renal impairment.
# Metastatic colorectal cancer: currently on [**Female First Name (un) **], oxaplatin, and capecitabine.
