ROS: Denies CP, SOB, palpitations  Pt is somewhat of a poor historian and he states that he is in the hospital now for drainage of his lung.
Past Medical History: PMHx:  AICD defib implant [**2103**], CAD including ischemic cardiomyopathy, lung CA, s/p right middle lung lobectomy, right pleural effusion, metastatic adenocarcinoma, HTN, anemia, PE, COPD, asbestosis, chronic Afib, high cholesterol, PVD s/p left femoral endarterectomy [**2106**] at [**Hospital1 18**]   Social History: hx ETOH use 12 beers daily   Family History: NC   Physical Exam: On Admission: Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
HEENT: old left occipital laceration Neck: Supple.
No tenderness Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2111-3-2**]: Significant bifrontal contusions, left occipital skull fx.
Overall similar appearance to extensive inferior bifrontal parenchymal hemorrhages, inferior bitemporal parenchymal hemorrhages, and right frontal subdural hematoma.
Minimal layering hyperdense material in bilateral occipital horns likely represents acute blood.
ECHO [**2111-3-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere (LVEF= 30%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LENIS [**2111-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
60-69% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery with no significant stenosis in the right internal carotid artery.
Diffuse moderate heterogeneous calcified plaque in the bilateral common carotid and internal carotid artery, left more than the right.
EEG [**2111-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous telemetry because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing.
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non- specific.
In addition, there is right more than left centrotemporal slowing indicative of a more severe cerebral dysfunction in the right centrotemporal region.
There are no epileptiform features.
No significant interval change in the extensive hemorrhagic contusions and surrounding edema in the inferior frontal lobes bilaterally.
Stable bilateral temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusions.
Stable small parafalcine frontal subdural hematoma.
No evidence of herniation or significant interval change.
EEG [**2111-3-6**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG is evidence for diffuse slowing of background frequencies into the theta and delta bandwidth.
There is some focality over the central regions with a slight rightsided preference.
No seizures were recorded.
LENIS [**2111-3-11**]: Negative for DVT  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU on the Neurosurgery service for frequent neuro checks and systolic blood pressure control less than 140.
Given his history of heavy EtOH use he was placed on a CIWA protocol and observed for signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
An EKG was done that revealed sinus rhythm with some ectopy.
A TTE was done that revealed mild left atrium dilation and an LVEF of 30%.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
An EEG was done that revealed no seizures.
60-69% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery with no significant stenosis in the right internal carotid artery.
Diffuse moderate heterogeneous calcified plaque in the bilateral common carotid and internal carotid artery, left more than the right.
Lower extremity ultrasound was performed to assess for lower extremity DVT: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
On [**3-5**]: patient continued to be disoriented and at 12:30, while working with PT, patient had a sudden onset episode of speech arrest and confusion that self resolved.
It was thought that patient may have had a seizure and underwent an EEG that revealed no seizure activity on final read.
On [**3-9**], he had a short episode of speech arrest that self resolved.
On [**3-11**]- we began tapering down Dilantin as there was no EEG confirmation of seizure.
Bilateral lower extremity doppler ultrasound was performed for extended bedrest and was negative for DVT.
At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 39857**] - [**Location 9583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bifrontal contusions Occipital skull fx Subdural hematoma Traumatic Subarachnoid hemorrhage Alcoholism Delirium confusion Seizures Urinary Tract infection Slurred speech   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, but we started you on Keppra and would like to taper your Dilantin off.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
