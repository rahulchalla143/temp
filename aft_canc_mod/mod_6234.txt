Admission Date:  [**2110-1-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-1-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-3-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status/[**Location (un) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: History of Presenting Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 15979**] is a 56 year old female with HCV cirrhosis c/b portopulmonary HTN, hepatopulmonary syndrome (on 4L home O2), and hepatic encephalopathy, admitted 3 weeks prior to presentation for altered mental status who presented to the ED with altered mental status and left lower extremity pain concerning for cellulitis.
Pt was in usual state of health until [**1-5**] when she developed LLE cellulitis and was started on Keflex.
She states that over past week her legs have become more swollen, increased abdominal distension and then she developed a rash over las couple days.
Pt is usually AOx3 with some baseline confusion but acutely worsened overnight last night into this morning.
Patient was initially started on Keflex on [**2110-1-4**] for cellulitis of let thigh but then began having "creeping" erythema which was thought to be reaction to keflex.
She then began acutely decompensating with yelling, thrashing, hitting bed rails saying "I just cant stop and I dont know why" Per report her lactulose has been uptitrated on [**2110-1-5**] to Q4hours and she had 4 large BMs since that time.
Of note, patient has had multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy Since [**2109-9-5**] despite rifaximin and lactulose administration.
Patient was too disoriented to relay a history, but did say she was having abdominal pain as well.
Metabolic panel significant for creatinine of 1.4 (baseline 0.6), BUN of 27 (Baseline around 10), as well as hyponatremia of 127 (baseline low 130's).
Urine studies did not show evidence of UTI.
CXR showed low lung volumes, pulmonary vascular prominence, without evidence of PNA or effussions.
A CT of the lower extremity was performed which showed no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis or fluid collection, however large amounts of anasarca and ascites was seen.
At times she moans in pain and says "I didnt do anything" when reoriented she is appropriate and follows commands.
Past Medical History: # Hepatitis C cirrhosis -- inactive on transplant list   -- No reported h/o varices, though no EGD in our system   -- Stable arterially enhancing 8.7mm lesion in segment VII      concerning for HCC # Hepatopulmonary syndrome (on 4L O2 at home) # Pulmonary hypertension (on sildenafil, followed by pulm) # Bipolar disorder # Hysterectomy for fibroids # Herniorrhaphy   Social History: Currently living in [**Hospital 582**] Rehab in [**Location (un) 5176**], MA since [**Month (only) **] [**2109**].
Poor respiratory effort but no rales or wheezes heard.
+Ventral hernia (at umbilicus, fully reducible).
Erythema marked over anterior and posterior left thigh blanching, non-raised, painful to palpation.
There is pulmonary vascular prominence.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is appreciated on this single frontal view.
No soft tissue gas in the left lower extremity.
Extensive fascial and subcutaneous edema but no intramuscular edema.
No drainable fluid collection.
Moderate to severe anasarca and moderate to large amount of ascites, both increased since [**2109-10-5**]  RUQ u/s ([**1-6**]): 1.
Partial thrombosis of the right portal vein, probably decreased somewhat.
Large patent umbilical collateral vein.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
No soft tissue gas in the left lower extremity.
Extensive fascial and subcutaneous edema but no intramuscular edema.
No drainable fluid collection.
Moderate to severe anasarca and moderate to large amount of ascites, both increased since [**2109-10-5**].
Non-contrast head CT ([**1-8**]): FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
Mild bifrontal cortical atrophy is present and likely related to underlying chronic liver disease and multiple prior episodes of encephalopathy.
No fracture is identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Both kidneys are normal in size and echogenicity with no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or renal lesion bilaterally.
There is a moderate amount of ascites which is unchanged from previous ultrasound.
Moderate ascites unchanged from previous US of [**2110-1-6**].
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 56 year old female with HCV cirrhosis c/b portopulmonary HTN, hepatopulmonary syndrome and repeated episodes of hepatic encephalopathy presenting with altered mental status, LLE cellulitis, and acute kidney injury.
Increasingly confused, hypotensive and tachypneic.
Began having emesis of stool.
In addition, Benadryl given night prior to admission may have acutely worsened mental status.
Ascites negative for SBP, urine clean and CXR negative for focal consolidations.
This may also be delirium in addition to hepatic encephalopathy as patient has had episodes of acute delirium during past admission.
Non-contrast head CT showed no sign of bleeding or other acute process.
#LLE Cellulitis: Admitted with large cellulitis on left thigh extending almost complete circumference of thigh, superior to knee.
As the patient had been hospitalized frequently and lives at extended living facility, she was treated empirically for MRSA infection with Vancomycin.
# Increase in LFTs: Initial labs with AST elevated from baseline and ALT at baseline, this was associated with an elevated LDH and total bilirubin.
This was pre-renal in etiology supported by a FeUrea 14% and response to volume challenge.
Renal ultrasound ruled out obstruction, leading to concern for HRS vs. ATN.
Complicated by ascites, portopulmonary syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome and refractory ascites and likely developing HCC mass.
Admitted grossly volume overloaded with anasarca.
Not on active transplant list because of pyschosocial issues including inability to care for herself, requiring 24 hour care.
Likely dilutional from cirrhosis, anasarca indicating volume overload status.
Diuretics were held, Albumin challenge given and she was free water restricted with a low Na diet.
# Anemia: Total drop from 40.3 to 28.8.
#Thrombocytopenia: Chronic sequelae of chronic liver disease/portal hypertension.
