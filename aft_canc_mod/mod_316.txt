She did not have symptoms of lightheadedness or change in mental status and over the course of her stay her blood pressure returned to her baseline of 90s to low 100s.
Fever: The patient presented with high spiking fevers to 102s.
These fevers continued for a full week into her stay and were often accompanied by severe chills, fatigue and in general a "toxic" looking appearance.
Although she was not neutropenic, she was started on broad antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl given her history of C.Diff, and caspofungin.
Her admission CT chest actually showed an improvement in her ground glass lung opacities from previously and given that she had had a negative BAL within the last month, PCP was [**Name9 (PRE) 1801**] thought to be a low probability.
Given the lack of improvement on antibiotics and the negative cultures, the fevers were thought most likely due to either Velcade (last dose on [**5-9**]) or desatinib.
She then had a repeat CT of the chest which showed worsening ground glass in the upper lobes.
ID: ID consult service was involved and based on beta-glucan and CT findings and resolution of fevers on Bactrim, determined that the diagnosis could be made without doing another bronchoscopy.
She was switched from the Bactrim to Clindamycin Q6 and primaquine 15 mg QD dosing and had been on these medications for >48hrs prior to discharge with no fevers.
ALL: The patient had her Dasatinib held for roughly 4 days to rule out drug related fever but was discharged on her normal dose of 70 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

You were admitted with high fevers.
Based on your CT scan and one of your blood tests, there is a high chance that these fevers were caused by an infection called Pneumocystis or "PCP".
If you have any fevers or other concerns about your health, call your physician.
