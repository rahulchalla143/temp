Chest X-Ray [**2167-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Conceivably, it could represent small focal anterior loculated effusion or possibly a subsegmental atelectasis.
Large soft tissue lesions through the mesentery, retroperitoneum, inguinal areas and lower mediastinum concerning for large lymph nodes, presumably in setting of CLL.
Bilateral small pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, could be atelectasis.
No evidence of abdominal aorta dissection.
Moderate atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta and its branches.
Diffuse osseous sclerosis, could be seen in the renal osteodystrophy or related to CLL.
Large soft tissue lesions through the neck, mesentery, retroperitoneum and inguinal areas concerning for large lymph nodes, presumably in setting of CLL since no FDG uptake above normal tissues is seen.
Increased FDG uptake in several hilar lymph nodes, subcarinal lymph node and soft tissue at the left lung base near the mediastinum (difficult to tell if mediastinal lymph node or within the lung); concerning for focal [**Doctor Last Name **] transformation.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, could be atelectasis in setting of pulmonary edema.
Diffuse osseous sclerosis, could be seen in the renal osteodystrophy or related to CLL.
Note: There is suggestion of metabolic imbalance; we are not seeing uptake in the kidneys and there is decreased uptake in the brain.
Also, due to diffuse anasarca and third spacing, the resolution on low-dose CT is particularly poor.
No pneumothorax has developed.
Tissue immunophenotyping [**2167-3-3**]: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa light chain restricted monotypic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, consistent with patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Review of the concurrent blood smear reveal increased prolymphocytoid cells; Atypical larger lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli are noted, suggestive of transformation.
Tissue immunophenotyping [**2167-3-13**]: pending   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] is a 69 y/o male with a history of ESRD on HD, CLL, DM2 c/b peripheral neuropathy, CAD and anemia (baseline 20-23) who presented with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue, transferred to MICU for hypotension, improved with aggressive IV hydration, then transferred to the floor where he was dialyzed and was evaluated for possible CLL/SLL conversion to lymphoma.
# Hypotension: He triggered the night after admision ([**2167-3-1**]) for hypotension with SBP in the 70's, was started on Vanco/[**Hospital 35453**] transferred to MICU.
There he was extremely fluid responsive with >10L IVF given.
Working diagnosis included hypovolemic shock vs distributive shock, although no infectious source was identified.
He had no recurrences of hypotension while on the medical [**Hospital1 **].
He was dialyzed as per schedule with additional ultrafiltration to help diurese the large fluid load he received due to hypotension.
Sevelamer was stopped due to low phosphorus.
At discharge, he is still hypervolemic, but anasarca has significantly improved and pulmonary edema has significantly improved (no oxygen required).
There was no evidence of hemolysis.
# CLL/SLL: CT abdomen showed large intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, initially concerning for [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] syndrome.
Flow cytometry was sent which was consistent with known CLL/SLL, although there was some concern over prolymphocytes seen on smear.
He subsequently received a PET CT which showed FDG avid uptake in hilar nodes but not intra-abdominally.
However, because hilar nodes were concerning on PET CT, he received bronchoscopy with hilar lymph biopsy [**2167-3-13**].
There were no immediate complications to the procedure.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because of shortness of breath and fatigue.
You were found to have a very low blood pressure, requiring care in the Intensive care unit where you received a large amount of intravenous fluid and improved.
The results of this biopsy are pending and you will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for these results.
