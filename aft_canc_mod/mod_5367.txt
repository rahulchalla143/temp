This prompted to obtain an ultrasound of the abdomen which was performed on [**2142-9-25**], demonstrating a lobular slight hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head that measured roughly 3-cm in diameter and was associated with prominent abnormal dilatation of the pancreatic duct which measured 10 to 11-mm in diameter.
There was also dilatation of the common bile duct which measured 11 to 12-mm in diameter and was associated with slight intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
A CT of the abdomen was performed on [**2142-9-25**] which demonstrated a mild to moderate intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, as well as dilatation of the common bile duct which measured 1.1-cm at the level of the pancreatic head.
There was diffuse dilatation of the pancreatic duct which measured 0.8-cm.
There was adenopathy noted inferior to the head of the pancreas measuring 1.7 x 1.9-cm.
A necrotic mass was seen in the small bowel mesentery on the left at the level of the head of the pancreas measuring 1.6 x 2.9-cm.
He denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any weight loss or steatorrhea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, elevated PSA, benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of bilateral inguinal hernia repair in the [**2106**], status post appendectomy in [**2086**].
Patient is a well-nourished, well-developed male in no acute distress.
No scleral icterus.
CV regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, without rub, but he does have a II/VI systolic ejection murmur that is present along the left sternal border.
ABDOMEN: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, masses.
Patient had epidural catheter for pain control.
Path report came back as 1) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 2) extensive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia (PanIN III).
The permanent sections of the pancreatic neck margin showed no dysplasia or carcinoma.
4) Chronic pancreatitis with atrophy and fibrosis.
5) Dilatation of common bile duct without tumor.
Gallbladder demonstrated cholecystic duct lymph node, no tumor, gallbladder within normal limits.
Lymph node superior pancreatic demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma.
On postop day 5, the patient had a low-grade fever of 100.9, otherwise doing well.

Patient is to call transplant surgery immediately at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, any increased redness to incision, sustained decreased appetite, increased bowel movements, or any problems with urination.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Clostridium difficile, peripheral vascular disease, elevated prostate-specific antigen/benign prostatic hypertrophy.
