Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o female with PMH significant for type 2 DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and iron deficiency anemia admitted on [**12-13**] with PNA and hypoglycemia, evaluated for GIB with EGD and colonoscopy and found to have malignant lesion in colon, to be followed by surgery outpatient for possible resection.
# GI Malignancy: Pt had colonoscopy and EGD on [**2186-12-20**] and was found to have polyps in the rectum (biopsy), 3cm ulcerated malignant appearing mass in the ascending colon (biopsy), otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Pt had CT abd in [**7-/2186**] for abdominal pain which revealed normal bowel and no enlarged lymph nodes.
CT abdomen w/ contrast for staging during current admission revealed cratered lesion in ascending colon characteristic of malignancy, without enlarged lymph nodes.
Pt evaluated with pre-op CXR which revealed mild CHF and persistent LLL opacity.
# Hypoglycemia: Acute issue that necessitated patient's admission to the MICU.
Symptomatic rx with expectorant, lozenges, nebs prn.
Pt remained afebrile without leukocytosis.
# Iron deficiency anemia/Chronic GIB: Pt with iron deficiency anemia and guiac positive stools.
No past EEG or colonoscopy.
No persistent BRBPR.
# Atrial fib Holding coumadin, cont beta blocker.
Continue beta blocker for rate control.
UA negative, though with large number of RBCs likely from traumatic foley.
