Intubation   History of Present Illness: Briefly, this is a 72 year old woman with history of CVA x 2 (no residual defecits), COPD on 2L O2 at home, who presents from her [**Hospital3 **] with altered mental status, respiratory failure/pneumonia/copd exacerbation, dehydration/acute renal failure.
She was noted to be tachycardic and tachypneic.
There was note that she reported shortness of breath with a congested cough.
Nursing notes record purulent nasal secretions.
Her labs were notable for a polycythemia with Hct of 60.9, lactate 3.4, BUN 37, Cr 1.1, LDH 756, Ca [**86**].3.
ECG with no ischemic changes.
CTA showed small LLL PNA, 2.1cm left lung nodule, no PE, extensive bullous disease.
She was given 2L NS, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, solumedrol and nebs and transfered to the ICU for further management of her respiratory failure.
In ICU, patient initially remained intubated, was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, standing nebulizers, solumedrol transitioned to prednisone to treat pneumonia/COPD flare.
Her ICU course was also notable for mild hypernatremia attributed to her dehydration status.
With above measures, patient was successfully extubated and weaned to her home O2 requirement of 2L via nasal cannula.
Currently pt complains of continued cough, some shortness of breath, and diarrhea.
ROS also positive for weight loss.
Opens eyes, moves to voice, no purposeful movement.
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, no scleral icterus.
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes audible.
Slight decreased BS at left base.
Cardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: Thin, soft, + BS.
Extremities: Thin, no edema, distal pulses present.
DISCHARGE EXAM afebrile, normotensive, SpO2 97%/4L Gen: alert and oriented x3, responds appropriately Pulm: decreased breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes/crackles appreciated   Pertinent Results: Labs at Admission: [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD WBC-9.0 RBC-6.28* Hgb-19.1* Hct-60.9* MCV-97 MCH-30.4 MCHC-31.3 RDW-12.4 Plt Ct-411 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD Neuts-87.8* Bands-0 Lymphs-7.3* Monos-3.6 Eos-0.1 Baso-1.2 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD Hypochr-NORMAL Anisocy-NORMAL Poiklo-NORMAL Macrocy-NORMAL Microcy-NORMAL Polychr-NORMAL [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD PT-12.5 PTT-26.2 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD Glucose-126* UreaN-37* Creat-1.1 Na-157* K-7.3* Cl-109* HCO3-34* AnGap-21* [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD ALT-13 AST-49* LD(LDH)-759* CK(CPK)-152* AlkPhos-83 TotBili-0.6 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD Lipase-54 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD CK-MB-6 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD Calcium-10.3* Phos-4.4 Mg-2.7* [**2185-6-10**] 05:08AM BLOOD VitB12-1231* [**2185-6-10**] 05:08AM BLOOD TSH-0.57 [**2185-6-9**] 11:00AM BLOOD ASA-NEG* Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG [**2185-6-9**] 06:40PM BLOOD Type-ART Temp-37.2 PEEP-5 pO2-491* pCO2-39 pH-7.44 calTCO2-27 Base XS-2 Intubat-INTUBATED [**2185-6-9**] 11:10AM BLOOD Lactate-3.4* K-4.7  DISCHARGE LABS [**2185-6-14**] 07:55AM BLOOD WBC-6.8 RBC-5.20 Hgb-16.2* Hct-50.2* MCV-96 MCH-31.1 MCHC-32.3 RDW-12.5 Plt Ct-236 [**2185-6-14**] 07:55AM BLOOD Plt Ct-236 [**2185-6-14**] 07:55AM BLOOD Glucose-73 UreaN-16 Creat-0.6 Na-144 K-3.7 Cl-107 HCO3-29 AnGap-12 [**2185-6-14**] 07:55AM BLOOD LD(LDH)-403* [**2185-6-14**] 07:55AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-2.7 Mg-2.0  Imaging Studies:  CT Head ([**6-9**]): No acute intracranial process.
CXR ([**6-9**]): Bullous emphysema with left lower lobe pneumonia.
A repeat PA and lateral view of the chest is recommended to further evaluate the right basilar lucency which most likely represents a large bulla.
Leftward superior tracheal deviation which may in part be positional.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection.
Recommend comparison with prior imaging of the chest if available, and in its absence, this finding needs clinical correlation for possible malignancy and close 3 month followup.
Small collection of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and ground-glass opacity on the left may represent an infectious process in the appropriate clinical context.
Brief Hospital Course: A 72 yo woman with history of emphysema/COPD and prior CVAs found down, hypoxic, tachycardic and confused.
# Respiratory failure Felt to be due to pneumonia versus COPD flare.
CTA showed LLL infiltrate but no PE.
On the first hospital day, she was extubated to BiPAP, then weaned to nasal cannula on the second hospital day without complication.
Serial ABGs showed adequate oxygenation with slight hypercarbia, likely due to underlying COPD.
She was treated with a 72-hr course if IV methylprednisolone, followed by [**5-8**] day course of prednisone 60mg, to be followed by an extended steroid taper for COPD exacerabation.
Sputum culture grew sparse Strep pneumo, which was covered by the antibiotics.
# Acute Renal Failure/Dehydration Cr elevated on admission, with BUN:creat of 37:1.1, consistent with hypovolemia.
This is likely in the setting of decreased po intake.
# Altered Mental Status The patient was found down, likely in the setting of hypoxia, hypovolemia and use of home sleep-aid ([**Month/Day (1) 20746**]).
# Lung nodule A 2.2x1.3cm lung nodule was seen at the left lingula on admission CT scan.
This was suspicious for malignancy given size and significant smoking history.
Her LDH also remained elevated throughout hospitalization.
# Hypernatremia Likely dehydrated in setting of no PO intake x4 days.
# Hypercalcemia The Ca level >10 on admission was concerning, particularly in the setting of a new lung nodule and elevated LDH.
The initial elevation was likely a combination of chronic hypoxia and hemoconcentration in the setting of hypovolemia.
#Diarrhea The patient had a few episodes of loose stool in the setting of starting po intake.
Bowel regimen was held in setting of loose stools.
#Elevated LDH The LDH level was elevated on admission and continued to be elevated on discharge (LDH 403).
There was no evidence for hemolysis.
This value is concerning for malignancy particularly in the setting of new lung nodule.
