Admission Date:  [**2134-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-8-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-6-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: Refractory Hypertension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy with biopsy   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, migraine headaches, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 10377**] hospital for neurosurgical evaluation after a right parietal intracranial hemorrhage was noted on CT scan performed for evaluation of headache.
Patient presented initially due to persistent headache for 3 weeks.
She initially felt the headache was secondary to migraine and took Fioricet with minimal relief.
At [**Hospital1 18**], Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] of repeat head CT demonstrated right parietal calcifications, with no cerebral oedema, mass effect, or midline shift.
Patient continued to have marked hypertension (190/50) in the emergency room and was started on labetalol continuous infusion.
She was also given potassium chloride 50mEq for hypokalemia and was admitted for further management.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended conservative management, blood pressure control, and no need for seizure prophylaxis.
Hypertension #.
Coronary artery disease, S/P MI in [**2130**] #.
Hyperlipidemia #.
Hypothyroidism secondary to partial thyroidectomy for nodule  #.
Physical Exam: On admission to the ICU , PE was as follows:  GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
QT is 452mm intervals, normal R-wave progress, LVH, no ST or T-wave changes, Q-waves in inferior leads.
Imaging: Head CT [**8-17**]: IMPRESSION: Three rounded foci, 1-2 mm in size within the right  frontoparietal region and a second focus in the left temporal lobe most likely represent calcium, possibly sequelae from prior infection or inflammation.
These calcifications could also be associated with an underlying vascular abnormality.
Air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus may represent acute sinusitis.
Right lung mass with subcarinal and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy, highly suspicious for metastatic lung cancer.
Severe narrowing of the origin and 3.5 cm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.
A small filling defect at the origin of the left subclavian may represent thrombus superimposed on athersclerotic plaque.
Moderate-to-severe stenosis of the left common carotid origin.
Probable aortic stenosis and regurgitation.
Further evaluation with echocardiography is recommended.
Small vertebral lesion, which may represent a hemangioma but not fully characterized on this exam.
Large heterogeneous mass in the right upper and middle lobes with associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, highly concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma.
No pleural effusion or chest wall invasion.
Additional pulmonary nodules in the right middle and lower lobes, measuring up to 8 mm each.
Small segmental pulmonary embolus within the anterior segment of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the aorta and moderate calcification in the LAD.
Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
Left adrenal hyperplasia without focal nodule.
_____ [**2134-8-20**]   Radiology MRA ABDOMEN W&W/O CONTR IMPRESSION: Bilateral high-grade stenoses of the proximal renal arteries, left greater than right, with bilateral renal atrophy, also left greater than right.
_____ FNA, right paratracheal lymph node: Positive for malignant cells, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
_____   Brief Hospital Course: She is a 73 year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and previous stroke who presents with 3 week course of headache and intracranial densities concerning for ICH vs. previous insult.
NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER -patient originally transferred for evalutation of hypertensive urgency, headache, and ?intracranail bleed.
Due to marked blood pressure differential, MRI/A was obtained to rule out dissection, which ultimately diagnosed a RML lung mass.
MRI head was obtained for staging purposes and to follow up ?calcifications noted on head ct, now with new diagnosis of lung cancer.
MRI showed possible leptomeningeal metastases.
RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS -Patient initially admitted with difficult to control blood pressure and evidence of atrophic kidney.
MRI abdomen confirmed high grade renal artery stenosis, Left greater than Right.
Her blood pressure was eventually controlled on 3 agents, however, due to impending nephrotoxic chemotherapy agents, and plan for long term anticoagulation, consideration was given to intervention on arterial stenosis this admit, while she was on a heparin drip.
Cardiology was consulted and evaluation and intervention was recommended, on both her stenosed/occluded subclavian arteries and bilateral renal arteries, to 1. provide better information of her true central pressures, since hypertensive urgency was her presenting complaint and 2. to attempt to maximize her renal preservation in the setting of probable nephrotoxic chemotherapy.
She had a small hematoma after the procedure without bruit.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM - small segmental pulmonary embolism was identified on chest ct.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and had no respiratory symptoms.
Heparin drip was initiated without complication, and continued until possible inpatient procedures were completed.
She had hematuria while on heparin and coumadin, which resolved with the discontinuation of the heparin.
CKD (III) -kidney function remained stable during admission, patient found to have renal artery stenosis as discussed above.
5.CAD(NATIVE VESSEL) -asymptomatic during hospitalization, no chest pain in setting of hypertensive urgency, asa/bb/statin continued.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER HTN, MALIGNANT/REVOVASCULAR PULMONARY EMBOLISM CAD (NATIVE VESSEL) CKD III RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS HEMATURIA ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You had initially gone to [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital for a persistent headache.
Due to concern for a possible bleed in your brain, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 827**].
After a repeat CT showed that you did not have an acute bleed in your brain, you were transferred to our intensive care unit for the treatment of high blood pressure, which was discovered in the emergency department.
During the course of your evaluation, a lung mass and a blood clot in the lung were discovered as well as severe narrowing of your renal arteries, subclavian arteries, and carotid artery.
Further evaluation by CT, MRI, and biopsy of the lung mass led to the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer that showed evidence of spread to other parts of your body.
You were then transferred to the Cardiology service for stenting of your narrowed right renal artery and left subclavian artery.
You were given medication for your pulmonary embolus.
Please watch for signs of increased bleeding, shortness of breath, nausea, chest pain, or increased confusion.
You should go to clinic on Thursday or Friday to have your INR checked.
