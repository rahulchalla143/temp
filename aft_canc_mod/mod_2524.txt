He was taken to [**Hospital3 3383**] hospital where a CT showed a right cerebellar mass.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
oriented to self/hospital PERRL, EOMI face symmetric, tongue midline MAE's with good strengths following all commands incision- C/D/I  Pertinent Results: [**2156-10-18**] MRI head with and without contrast: There is confirmation of an ovoid, irregularly rim-enhancing mass measuring 23 x 32 mm within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is extensive surrounding edema, including compression of the fourth ventricle.
No other areas of pathological enhancement are identified.
The lesion exhibits very low diffusion, which would argue against an inflammatory process such as an abscess.
The motion degraded FLAIR images suggest a very minor degree of T2 hyperintensity within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, becoming confluent in the periatrial regions bilaterally.
Given the patient's age, chronic small vessel infarction would appear the most likely diagnosis.
No primary tumor identified to account for metastasis.
There is interstitial lung disease with a basilar predominance and subpleural cysts consistent with interstitiell lung disease.
Centrilobular emphysema is present.
A nodule within the lingula measures 7 mm and is non- specific.
A 3-mm nodule within the left lobe of the thyroid is noted 4.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2156-10-21**] Status post resection of right cerebellar mass, with expected postoperative changes, and no evidence of large hematoma,increased mass effect, or larger vascular territorial infarction  [**2156-10-22**]: MRI brain with and without contrast: minimal amount of blood product within the postoperative bed.
No overt evidence of residual mass.
He was started on antiemetics and steroids which improved his symptoms of nausea and vomiting.
CT Torso was performed for metastatic workup but was negative for obvious signs of primary disease.
Post op head CT showed post surgical changes, no acute hemorrhage, mass effect or acute infarct.
MRI Brain demonstrated no acute infarct.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
****  There were several abnormal findings on the CT scan we did of your chest.
You must see your PCP within the month to discuss the findings of emphysema, thyroid nodule and diverticulosis.
