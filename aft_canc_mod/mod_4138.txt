I am now being called for left sided weakness since about 4:30am (it is now 10AM).
She was found unresponsive in bed at [**Location (un) 15383**] Home where she lives, incontinent, fever to 104.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was noted to have left sided weakness at around 4:30am, team was notified at 7:30am, and neurology was called around 9:45am.
She was hypotensive to 91/30 and given fluid bolus overnight.
Patient currently has no complaints but is confused.
Tuberculum sellae meningioma with suprasellar extension and superior and posterior displacement of the optic chiasm, 4.1 x 3.4 x 2.1 cm in transverse x anterior posterior x superior inferior dimensions.
Patient was admitted in [**10-21**] and underwent extensive evaluation of this mass by onc/neurosurg/xrt.
She was admitted for an unresponsive episode that was thought to be secondary to adrenal insufficiency.

Mildly dilated RA.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Conclusions: 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-10-20**],  no change.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.
The suprasellar mass exerting mild mass effect on the left inferior frontal lobe is again identified, measuring 34 x 32 mm, not significantly changed in size or appearance.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarct.
There is scattered opacification of mastoid air cells, but the remainder of the imaged sinuses appear clear.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of large suprasellar meningioma.
No other acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is no MR evidence of hemorrhage, edema, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate a focal area of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal regions and also on the left side in the similar region and appears to be along the watershed zone between the anterior and middle cerebral artery distributions.
Again noted is a sellar meningioma, which appears to be unchanged in size and extension since the prior examination.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] absent flow in the right internal carotid artery, suggesting right internal carotid artery occlusion.
FINDINGS: Compared to yesterday's study, multiple new cortical hypodensities are seen within the right frontal and frontoparietal regions.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Again seen is a large suprasellar mass in the left inferior frontal region, not significantly changed in size or appearance compared to yesterday's study.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen within the ethmoid air spaces.
There is evidence of a left-sided mucous retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
Scattered opacification of the mastoid air cells appears unchanged.
Multiple new cortical hypodensities seen within the right frontal and frontoparietal regions, consistent with MCA infarct.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
Unchanged appearance of large suprasellar mass seen in the left inferior frontal region.
FINDINGS: There are no prior comparison examinations.
The non-contrast head CT [**Year (4 digits) 4059**] multiple hypodensities within the territory of the right middle cerebral artery territory brain cortex, consistent with early subacute infarcts.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline structures.
A large suprasellar mass slightly eccentric to the left is again identified, reportedly characteristic of a meningioma from prior MRIs.
CTA [**Year (4 digits) 4059**] the left common carotid artery has mild areas of narrowing from its origin at the arch due to atherosclerotic plaques.
At the bifurcations of both internal carotid arteries, there is a large amount of atherosclerotic plaque.
The right internal carotid artery then reconstitutes at its petrous segment and flow is present in its cavernous and supraclinoid portions, although with atherosclerotic plaque some of which is calcified.
The left internal carotid artery just distal to its internal carotid artery origin has flow with calcified atherosclerotic plaque at its cavernous segment.
The supraclinoid left internal carotid artery then is encased by the presumed meningioma with significant narrowing of its normal caliber.
Once the vessel leaves the suprasellar mass, the normal caliber is restored and there is flow within the middle cerebral artery and minimal flow within a hypoplastic segment of the left A1 anterior cerebral artery.
There may be a small segment of stenosis at the proximal right posterior cerebral artery.
At the petrous segment, the right internal carotid artery is reconstituted and courses normally to its bifurcation into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.
The left internal carotid artery has stenosis at its origin due to atherosclerotic plaque.
Once the left internal carotid artery exits the mass, a more normal caliber is restored and there is opacification of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.
The right vertebral artery appears small throughout its entire course and slightly irregular, likely due to atherosclerotic disease.
Low limb lead voltage.

[**Last Name (STitle) **], she had had viral illness with  nausea and vomiting for days before she came in, and many other NH residents were also sick with an apparent viral illness.
Initial head ct had been negative for new changes or infarcts but showed stable size of meningioma.
The following morning, she was noted to have L-sided weakness and the neurology team was called at 7:30 AM.
CT of the brain had suggested bilateral watershed infarcts; MRI was consistent with this finding, though images reviewed by the stroke consult team suggested right watershed infarcts and tight  RCA, with ?L embolic infarct.
Visual loss is also a complaint, but this is chronic and related to the sellar mass according to her primary care doctor.
He reports that her baseline is "oriented times one," with very poor memory, but able to ambulate independently without a cane.
Sepsis workup was negative, including cx and TTE, and imaging was found to have R>L infarcts on head ct thought watershed from low  bp, versus embolic on one side.
She had imaging with L ICA occlusion/severe stenosis that was not present on MRI in [**2185**].
One possible mechanism for her stroke (also suggested by PCP) was viral illness with poor endogenous steroid response related to panhypopit and resulting functional adrenal crisis.
With dementia and comorbidities, she was felt to be a poor candidate for surgical correction of carotid stenosis; stent is one possibility, but as the other carotid is completely occluded, it might be a risky procedure.
She was also felt to be a he will be a poor coumadin candidate secondary to poor vision and now a fall risk due to hemiplegia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Watershed cerebral infarctions Hypotension Fever Adrenal insufficiency related to panhypopituitarism   Discharge Condition: Left-sided hemiplegia, right-sided weakness, visual acuity poor with likely visual field cuts, left-sided hemineglect and hemisensory changes (diminished pinprick and light touch).
Discharge Instructions: Please [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD or return to ED if new changes in mental status, worsened weakness, or any other signs of stroke.
If she becomes hypotensive or sick, consider also calling her endocrinologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10759**], as this might indicate an episode of adrenal insufficiency.
