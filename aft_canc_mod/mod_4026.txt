He was afebrile at 98.3,  heart rate of 90, 120/64.
On [**2113-4-8**], (please see operative dictation) the patient underwent an LAR for an obstructing rectosigmoid cancer.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with general anesthesia.
There were no complications.
They found an obstructing cancer that was massive with multiple hepatic metastasis.
There was no pneumothorax, and the patient was taken to the PACU in stable condition.
On his postop check the patient was afebrile at 98.1, had a blood pressure of 101/50, heart rate of 75, saturating 100%.
He had a little bit of ectopy on the monitor strip.
The PVCs that the patient had on the monitor stopped after repletion of electrolytes and the patient's pain was well controlled by acute pain service; says he had an epidural.
He was afebrile at 99.0 and 97.7, heart rate 95, 120/60, and had made 736 in urine overnight and 250 in urine since midnight.
The patient was consented by Dr.[**Name (NI) 2829**] team and taken to the OR for single lumen port placement in preparation for chemotherapy.
He denied pain at rest, ambulated with them, moved all  extremities.
He was noted to have impaired functional mobility but was doing well from a physical therapy perspective.
There were no complications.
There was no hematoma or any complications.
His pain was well controlled with PCA and discharge planning was begun about discharging the patient to a rehab facility.
His wound was clean, dry and intact.
The patient had no pain and the patient had arranged for an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for [**4-26**].
He was in no acute distress.
His abdomen was soft and nontender.
His wound was clean, dry and intact.
He was complaining of some pain with scrotal edema and was a little bit uncomfortable when awake, and was answering questions appropriately throughout the early morning on [**2113-4-16**].
On [**4-16**] the venous access team came to evaluate him for a PICC.
On [**4-16**], postoperative day #8, he had some sinus tachycardia to the 120s.
An EKG was performed to rule out ischemia and there was no atrial fibrillation.
His blood pressure had dropped to 90/50 with the sinus tachycardia, but after a liter of bolus it improved to 120/70.
The abdomen was described as a little bit distended with a minimal fluid wave, concerning for ascites.
An ultrasound was performed at that point and time which showed right upper quadrant intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
He was afebrile at 97.4, heart rate 104, blood pressure 110/60, and was saturating 98% on room air.
There was suspicion of biliary obstruction, but there was also concern for sequela related to the metastatic disease of the liver.
The patient was confused on exam and he was diffusely tender in the abdomen.
He had some guarding, especially in the right lower quadrant.
The patient had a prerenal picture and transfusions were done to keep hematocrit above 30.
The patient on arrival to the SICU was described as alert and in no acute distress, jaundiced, increased respiratory rate, and lungs had clear breath sounds.
He was tender and had a distended abdomen with 2+ pitting edema to the mid calf.
It did demonstrate a touch of pneumoperitoneum.
At this point the patient was deemed critically ill with a potential biliary source, but also with a potential other source such as an anastomotic leak, therefore, the patient was taken back to CAT scan subsequently early that morning and performed rectal contrast.
After extensive discussion with the family and the patient's prognosis with liver replaced by metastatic disease from his original cancer, a  decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Obstructing colon cancer, resection with subsequent anastomotic leak, and sepsis.
