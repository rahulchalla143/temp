Evaluate for ischemic or hemorrhagic injury.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, large masses, mass effect, or large territorial infarction.
No acute fractures are identified.
A small subcentimeter area of low-attenuation is noted within the left supracortical white matter (2, 15), which could represent a prominent perivascular space or lacunar ischemic event.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, large masses, mass effect or infarction.
MRI is more sensitive to detect ischemic changes with diffusion- weighted imaging sequences and is recommended if clinically indicated and if there is no contraindication to MRI.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Mild left lower lobe atelectatic changes are noted, improved.
Heart is mildly enlarged.
Aorta is mildly tortuous.
