Admission Date:  [**2122-9-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-9-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-8-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH with fevers, back pain, and pathologic evidence of Sweet Syndrome   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation Bone marrow biopsy Central venous line placement  History of Present Illness: (Primary historians: wife & daughter): 66 y/o male with lung cancer s/p RUL lobectomy, back pain w/ spondylolisthesis, s/p lumbar laminectomes x2, initially admitted to OSH with back pain, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with fevers, leukocytosis, and delirium.
He initially complained of acute onset R lower back pain that started after leaning over quickly.
Pain worsened and developed L sided back pain as well.
Also with + constipation and LE weakness.
Around this same time, the patient started developing a productive cough and fevers.
MRI back showed L5-S1 central disc protrusion without mass effect or abnormal enhancement.
CT of the head showed diffuse mild cerebral atrophy with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI with and without contrast showed no evidence for meningitis and no enhancing mass lesion.
Neurosurgery was consulted and felt no intervention needed based on lumbar imaging.
ID consulted, and felt the patient had no clear signs of infection, aside from fevers, so antibiotics have been generally held.
Neurology assessment was to assess the patient for viral illness, including viral meningitis, less likely paraneoplastic disorder.
Lumbar puncture was attempted x 4, with records indicating that one attempt may have yielded venous blood.
Heme/onc consulted for leukocytosis, bone marrow aspirate revealed myelodysplasia with no evidence of leukemia.

Patchy opacities are present at both lung bases, and may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
Differential diagnosis includes aspiration and early infectious pneumonia.

No evidence of spinal or paraspinal abscess.
Note that if concern exists for focal discitis or osteomyelitis, MR would be the more sensitive modality for evaluation.
Nodularity of the pancreas and left adrenal gland.
Given history of previous lung malignancy, metastatic disease is the primary consideration at the pancreas.
Additionally, though the adrenal nodule is statistically likely an adenoma, metastatic disease must be considered.
Large bilateral consolidations in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Given the history of fever and cough reported on the previous chest radiograph, these are concerning for infectious pneumonia.
Nevertheless underlying mass is not excluded.
Large mediastinal lymphadenopathy as detailed above.
Numerous healing left lateral rib fractures as well as deformity in the right sixth rib, presumably post-surgical.
---------------- [**2122-9-18**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to reduced voltage, slowing, and disorganization of the background rhythm.
These findings are suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy involving both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant aortic or mitral regurgitation seen.
Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function  Brief Hospital Course: # Fevers: Transferred from outside hospital with pathologic diagnosis of Sweet's Syndrome, based on skin biopsy and persistent fevers/leukocytosis.
Stable infiltrate opacities on OSH CXR may represent PNA, especially in setting of productive cough.
The patient underwent lumbar puncture with IR guidance, which yielded ~15 cc of bloody CSF.
The patient underwnet TTE, to evaluate for fever of unknown origin.
# Mental status changes/Delirium: The patient was clearly confused and disoriented, which--per the family's report--was strikingly different from his baseline cognition/personality.
Potential etiologies were thought to include infectious (meningoencephalitis, abscess or non-CNS infection), metabolic/endocrine (hypercalcemia), renal failure/uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, or persistently febrile state.
It was thought unlikely to be hydrocephalus or brain metastases from unknown primary (hx of lung CA), given reportedly normal OSH imaging.
EEG revealed mild to moderate encephalopathy involving both cortical and subcortical structures, without epileptiform features.
# Leukocytosis: The patient had reportedly undergone bone marrow aspiration at the OSH, with findings consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome.
# Hypercalcemia: Calcium was highly elevated at OSH, where he received pamidronate treatment prior to transfer.
# Hypotension: Per patient's family, he has never had difficulty with high or low blood pressures, and was not on home anti-hypertensives.
Endocrine was consulted and felt his symptoms were unlikely to be carcinoid-mediated.
