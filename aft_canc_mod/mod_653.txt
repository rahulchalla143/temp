male with multiple medical problems including lymphoma, CRF, sent from Outside Hospital for change in mental status.
He was treated from [**6-24**] to [**2101-6-28**] at [**Hospital6 33**] for Herpes Zoster in occipital area complicated by Coag Negative Staph bacteremia due to a skin breakdown from the zoster.
Since d/c from [**Hospital3 **], he has had constant LBP and was directly admitted to [**Hospital 38**] rehab [**2101-7-20**] for back pain and alternating right and left hip pains and inability to ambulate.
Work up there included: -MRI (w/o gadolenium) of cervical and lumbar spine showing bad OA but no osteomyeltitis  -Bone Scan with increase uptake in L5-S1 (prelim result) -TEE negative for vegetations -TTE showed mild/mod AS -Given oxycodone, robaxin, tylenol (QID scheduled) with improvement in pain symptoms but mild delirium On admission he was noted to be delirious and hypoxic to 72% on RA (improved to 94%4L NC).
Labs drawn prior to diuresis consistent with acute renal failure (Cr 3.3, BUN 77) and infection with 14K WBCs and 42% Bands.
He has been afebrile there but on scheduled tylenol.
+back pain xwks, unchanged recently.
RUQ U/S with sludge-filled gallbaldder, no cholecystitis.
V/Q scan showing low probability for PE.
Patient admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2101-7-28**] for change in mental status and ARF.
Patient with TEE no vegetations, thus endocarditis unlikely.
Patient also with hyperbilirubinemia,with elevated alk phosphate, largely unchanged from admission .
Past Medical History: 1) Polyarthritis of Hips, Knees and Lower Back 2) Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma s/p radiation dx in [**2098**] 3) BPH s/p TURP in [**2096**] 4) HTN 5) Aortic Stenosis 6) Mitral Valve Regurgitation 7) Hearing Deficit, mild 8) Urinary Tract infections 9) Herpes Zoster  Social History: Widow x 2 years.
No EtOH/Tob since WWII.
Brother in his 90s with Alzheimer's Dementia and brother in 70s in good health.
Physical Exam: VS: 168/90, 75, 22 96% rm air GEN - no apparent respiratory distres, some pain on movement HEENT - MM dry, anicteric, pupils constricted but responsive bilat, difficutly following instructions for extraocular muscle exam, well healed vesicles at the occipital area on left NECK - mild JVD CHEST - crackles at right base [**1-15**] way up, o/w CTA CV - reg rate, harsh [**3-19**] SM at LUSB -> apex and carotid, no s3/s4 ABD - soft, NT/ND, +BS EXT - +1 ankle/pedal edema bilat Neuro - A+Ox1 (only to name), A+Ox3 at ED no asterixis but mild intention tremor, ROM: LE 45 degree of passive flexion, no saddle anesthesia, no bowel, bladder incontinence (Foley).
No sensory deficits.
Rectal - Guaiac + (per ED) Back - no CVAT, +lumbar paraspinal TTP, midline lumbar tenderness, no warmth/erythema.
RUQ U/S with sludge-filled gallbaldder, no cholecystitis.
V/Q scan showing low probability for PE.
Patient admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2101-7-28**] for change in mental status and ARF.
While in MICU, patient treated for E. Coli UTI, gram positive bactermia/sepsis with vancomycin.
TEE no vegetations, thus endocarditis was ruled out and patient found to have epidural abcess/osteomyletis by MRI with gadolinium.
Patient's ARF on his CRF (baseline creatinine 1.8), hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, leukocytosis and anemia all improved during his ICU with primary sepsis treatment.
1.Altered MS: Patient's confusion has resolved considerably with treatment of his sepsis/UTI and thus toxic/metabolic causes were largely responsible.
He is currently on a low prn dose of oxycodone/  2.MSSA sepsis/bacteremia--Patient with MSSA sepsis secondary to epidural abcess/osteomyletis (+[**5-18**] for MSSA [**7-28**]--MRI w. gad), initially treated with vancomycin for 4 days prior to culture results sensitivity indicating MSSA, now on day 4 of oxacillin and subsequent surveillance cultures ([**7-31**], 7?20, [**8-3**]) have been negative.
Of note are his elevated LFT's which are improving but trending down.
Oxacillin can be continued with weekly LFT's, with the consideration that elevation of his LFT's are elevated in response to his resolving bacteremia/sepsis 3.UTI - E. Coli resolved on full course of Levoquin.
Gently diureses on the floor due to renal function with complete improvement of shortness of breath.
CRF likely secondary to hypertension, ARF sepsis/dehyrdation.
Patient's anemia improving with treatment of sepsis-likely primary cause.
Anemia work-up consistent with that.
Thrombocytopenia, increased INR--given 2.5 mg vitamin K [**8-2**], likely secondary to sepsis because resolving well with treatment.
He has no evidence of chord compression and never has-no saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinenece.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 66**] Rehab & Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: MSSA sepsis, chronic renal failure, osteomyletis, epidural abcesss-  Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Patient to follow up with PCP from rehab facility.
