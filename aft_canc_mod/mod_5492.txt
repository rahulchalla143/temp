He then had deep breathing, drooling, and urinary incontinence.
Head CT at [**Hospital3 1196**] showed a 3.7 cm x 3.8 cm lesion in the left frontotemporal lobe with adjacent edema and mass, with partial effacement of the left temporal lobe but no herniation or hemorrhage.
On admission, he noted a history of seizures that were manifested by speech arrest, once this past [**2169-3-9**] and once in [**2169-4-9**].

The degree of adjacent T2 signal abnormality is unchanged.
The slightly thickened enhancement is concerning for tumor recurrence.
Left temporal cyst aspirate: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 65-year-old right-handed man with grade 3 astrocytoma who presents from OSH with questionable syncope versus seizure, who developed with hypotension after antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamicin).
(1) Syncope: Initial event that brought him in was thought to be vasovagal in nature due to Valsalve in setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
With treatment of his constipation and drainage of his tumor cyst, this did not recur.
Overnight his rash progressed from hives to diffuse erythema with pruritis and he became more hypotensive.
He had an elevation in his creatinine and 5 point increase in his hematocrit without transfusion.
He was given IV fluids and steroids for potential adrenal insufficiency and was sent to the ICU for closer monitoring.
elevated Likely etiology is anaphylaxis versus anaphylactoid reaction (although hypotension less likely with anaphylactoid reactions).
(3) Astrocytoma: [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] from [**2169-5-15**] revealed increasing cystic mass.
For this, he was taken to the OR by neurosurgery on [**2169-5-18**] where he had a cyst aspiration which was negative for malignant cells.
No seizure activity was noted on this admission.
(5) Obstructive Sleep Apnea: His history and body habitus are concerning for OSA, which could exacerbate his seizure disorder.
It was likely from hemodilution given IVF received in setting of anaphylaxis which subsequently remained stable.
2 days prior to discharge this was removed and he was able to urinate without difficulty.
