Admission Date:  [**2127-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-7-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 83 yr old female with multiple medical problems including CAD, recurrent endometrial cancer s/p debulking surgery in [**4-/2127**] who was complaining of pain all over so an ambulance was called.
En route to the hospital, pt developed severe substernal chest pain and became hypotensive to the 60s.
She was complaining of abd pain and and noncontrast abd CT was done to rule out AAA.
There was no AAA on CT but there was diffuse stranding surrounding the colon consistent with pancolitis.
The pt's son stated that pt has been having diarrhea for the past several days, no n/v.
She received a total of 3L of IVF along with levaquin/flagyl for suspected abd source.
Surgery was consulted given the concern for mesenteric ischemia and recommended IVF and abx.
Of note, pt was recently diagnosed with recurrent emdometrial carcinoma in [**4-10**] when she presented to the ED for abdominal pain and had a CT abdomen which showed extensive omental involvement.
During her hospital course she had several episodes of chest pain but cardiac cath was deferred.
She was recently readmitted for chest pain and near-syncope and again, w/u was negative.
Coronary artery disease s/p cath [**4-8**] showing 100% occlusion RCA, 80% occlusion LAD, PCI to LAD then s/p ETT MIBI [**11-9**] showing reversible anteroir defect, medically managed.
Recurrent endometrial cancer.
Originally diagnosed [**2122**] s/p TAH/BSP om [**2122**] showing grade III papillary serous carcimona in a polyp then re-presenting [**4-10**] with increasing abdominal pain.

There is no pneumothorax.
Interval development of diffuse stranding surrounding the colon from the cecum down to the rectum.
Left adrenal adenoma.
No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Soft tissues again demonstrate a seroma within the anterior abdominal wall, which is unchanged from the prior study.
Worsening severe pancolitis.
Increasing fluid throughout the abdomen and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Imaging findings are most consistent with C. difficile colitis.
No evidence of megacolon.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 83 yr old female with hx of CAD, recurrent endometrial cancer s/p recent debulking surgery who presents with chest pain and abd pain, hypotension and found to have colitis on abd CT .
Abd Pain: Mostly likely secondary to C.diff colitis given recent antibiotic use, ddx includes mesenteric ischemia, obstruction, colitis vs worsening chronic abd pain from her cancer.
Mesenteric ischemia initally concerning given the severity of her pain but less likely now that lactate has returned nl and guiac neg.
Obstruction also less likely given that pt is passing stool and having freq bowel movements.
Pt recently on cipro and has been hosp frequently so is at risk for c diff colitis and other infectious etiologies of acute diarrhea such as salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, e.coli .
Serial abd exams were performed; surgery was consulted and felt that given clinical picture of diarrhea with toxic granulations, and pancolitis, most c/w C diff colitis, therefore recs po flagyl, no levo and nonoperative case.
Continued flagyl, initially PO then converted to IV given her continued nausea and concern for absorption.
- On [**7-6**] she was looking worse and a repeat CT was performed, this showed worsening of her pancolitis.
The following day she again looked worse with increased pain.
There was some difficulty obtaining labs but when obtained she was noted to have a metabolic acidosis, felt to be due to diarrhea, and a stable HCT.
She continued to have abdominal pain and was maintained with increasing pain medications and IV Flagyl.
The following day she was hypotensive, with SBP in the 90s.
She was started on IV fluids with no improvement of her pressure.
At that point there was concern that she was septic or had perforated her bowel.
She was started on pressors for hypotension and transferred to the MICU for further management.
She was hypotensive with elevated lactate.
Etiology of sepsis was thought to be bowel related with DDx including C. difficile toxic megacolon vs bowel ischemia.
She was also treated with levofloxacin, metronidazole, and Zosyn for broad coverage.
Prn morphine was given for pain control.
The patient's son and other family members confirmed her desire not to be intubated or have any further surgery.
Hypotension: On admission she was hypotensive with concern that it could be cardiogenic vs septic vs volume depletion.
On admission she described chest pain, however there were no EKG changes and CE flat x 1 making cardiogenic less likely.
Sepsis was initially high on differential given severe abd pain, however she was afebrile and had no leukocytosis.
She again became hypotensive on [**2127-7-7**] at which time she was tranferred to the MICU for pressors and further management as above.
Chest Pain: She has been frequently admitted with chest pain and medically managed rather than taking for catheterization.
We ruled out MI with 3 sets cardiac enzymes negative.
EKG was without ischemic changes, telemetry monitoring was without arrhythmia.
ARF likely due to pre-renal given reports of poor po intake.
UA negative for infection and no new drugs to implicate AIN.
Urine lytes consistent with prerenal azotemia.
Metabolic Acidosis: Pt with gap of 15 so pt with both gap and non-gap metabolic acidosis (based on delta-delta gap).
Etiology of gap acidosis likely acute renal failure and of non-gap acidosis likely diarrhea.
We followed lactate given concern for mesenteric ischemia.
On the day of transfer to the MICU she had a worsening metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate.
