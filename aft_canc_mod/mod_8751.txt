Admission Date:  [**2122-10-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2122-11-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-8-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, sputum production  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old man with a history of metastatic left tonsillar cancer status post resection, chemotherapy, radiation and tracheostomy placement, who presents with chest pain, productive sputum and fever.
The patient states that, two to three days prior to admission, he felt weak and fatigued.
He has a chronic cough at baseline, but notices that it has been increasingly productive over the past several days.
He has not had any documented fevers.
He denies any chills or sweats.
Chest x-ray demonstrated bibasilar nodular opacities and new right middle lobe collapse.
CTA demonstrated no pulmonary embolism, but did demonstrate right middle lobe nodular opacity with surrounding ground-glass and impaction of airways with partial collapse of the right middle lobe.
Several other nodular opacities were noted.
A small left effusion and subcarinal and hilar adenopathy was also noted.
Metastatic left tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, originally diagnosed back in [**2119**].
The patient had left tonsillar fullness and left neck mass and underwent tonsillectomy in [**2120-9-22**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of ENT.
His diagnosis included Stage IV and III squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2121-12-12**], the patient underwent neurosurgery for a C6 metastatic vertebral tumor.
On [**2122-7-2**], the patient demonstrated bilateral vocal cord paralysis and airway obstruction.
Orthopaedic problem in right knee with metal plate  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has a history of nasal cocaine use, but has no history of intravenous drug use.
The patient is a homosexual man, but has never engaged in anal intercourse.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died in his 80s of a cerebrovascular accident.
His father also had prostate cancer, but had not received treatment.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, but no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Lower extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Pneumonia:  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the patient was initially noted to have increased secretions and increasing oxygen requirements.
He also had worsening chest x-ray and increasing size of left pleural effusion.
Ultrasound revealed this pleural effusion was loculated, and the patient went for ultrasound-guided drainage by Radiology.
Cytology was suggestive of metastatic disease, although this could not be confirmed.
The patient appears to have copious secretions.
On hospital day 12, the patient underwent bronchoscopy for question of tracheal stenosis.
This revealed no signs of tracheal stenosis, but did reveal edema of the false vocal cords, copious secretions, and mild granulation tissue around the trach.
Follow-up chest x-ray revealed mild left-sided effusion.
The patient started to have slightly decreased secretions and decreased oxygen requirements.
This was felt to be likely due to an anemia of chronic disease.
During his admission, he had some leaking from the tube, and the patient went down to Interventional Radiology, who changed the external tubing with good relief of his leaking gastrostomy tube.
Metastatic left tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma 3.
Left chest wall pain 7.
Anemia of chronic disease status post two units of packed red blood cells transfusion  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Morphine sulfate oral solution 30 mg by mouth every four hours for pain                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 735**], M.D.
