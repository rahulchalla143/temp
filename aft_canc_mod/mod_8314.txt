Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the internal carotid arteries.
No fracture is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.
No fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative changes with multilevel neural foraminal narrowing due to facet arthrosis.
If clinically indicated, recommend further evaluation with a thyroid ultrasound.
Severely dilated intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts without definite associated mass.
Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis and sludge, but no other findings to suggest evidence of acute cholecystitis.
CXR [**8-13**]: no intrathoracic process.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-14**]: There is a mass lesion involving the ampullary region which results in severe dilatation of the intra and extrahepatic biliary tree as well as mild main pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Differential considerations include a cholangiocarcinoma versus a pancreatic neoplasm.
There is no evidence of distant metastases.
Trace ascites is seen.
Incidental hepatic and renal hypodensities, likely cysts as described above.
Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions, most compatible with IPMN.
There was a complete obstruction in the duodenal bulb preventing an ERCP from being performed.
Marked intra and extrahepatic biliary dilatation to the level of the distal CBD.
2.Successful placement of an 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain throught the obstruction which has been left on free drainage.

Upon stabilization of the patient's blood pressure, it was decided to proceed with ERCP on [**8-14**].
ERCP was unsuccessful due to an obstructing duodenal mass.
For immediate biliary decompression and relief of the associated symptoms and abnormal laboratory values, on [**8-16**], the patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with decompression and drain placement.
On [**8-23**], the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with biopsy of periduodenal nodule, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y, choledochojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, on a single-day-course of IV zosyn, with a foley catheter, and her PTBD in place, and an epidural for pain control.
On POD#1 ([**8-24**]), she continued to have the epidural for pain control.
She therefore continued to have a foley catheter.
On POD#2 ([**8-25**]), her pain remained well-controlled with the epidural.
On POD#3 ([**8-26**]), she continued to have good pain control with the epidural.
On POD#4 ([**8-27**]), she continued to have good pain control with the epidural.
Her pain was well controlled with oral medications.
On POD#8 ([**8-31**]), per recommendations by Hematology/Oncology, a CT Chest was obtained for staging purposes.
She continued to ambulate regularly, and have good pain control.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Metastatic well differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.
