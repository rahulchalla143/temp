He also has metastatic disease to the lung, s/p IL2 therapy cycle 1 in [**2192-7-25**] and cycle 2 in [**2192-11-25**].
He developed an obstructive right upper lobe lesion in [**2193-4-25**] and is s/p tumor debridement by rigid bronchoscopy and photodynamic therapy, as well as cyberknife to the right upper lobe lesion.
However over the last 2 weeks he developed a headache that was worsening and over the last week it was associated with ataxia especially when in the dark.
The patient went to [**Hospital **] Hospital at [**State 1727**] today where a MRI revealed a cerebellar mass with associated shift.
In the ED, the neurological exam was benign except for some mild unsteadiness of the gait.
Neurosurgery eval was requested due reported mass effect seen on MRI and q4 neuro checks + dexamethasone was recommended.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI as well as bloating and nausea of last few days, now resolved; also + weight loss of 25lbs recently (per patient due to hard physical labor) (-) Review of Systems: GEN: No fever, chills, night sweats.
HEENT: No headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
CV: No chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
PULM: No cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
GI: No vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel habits, no hematochezia or melena.
GUI: No dysuria or change in bladder habits.
MSK:  No arthritis, arthralgias, or myalgias.
DERM: No rashes or skin breakdown.
PSYCH: No feelings of depression or anxiety.
CT scan showed 6-mm noncalcified nodule in the anterior right middle lobe and a possible second nodule slightly more inferior; bone scan negative; PET CT showed activity in left kidney tumor but no abnormal FDG uptake in the lungs.
A single focus of increased activity in the left lobe of the thyroid was noted and a thyroid ultrasound was recommended.
[**2192-5-25**] surveillance CT scan showed multiple new pulmonary nodules and enlargement of previously noted nodules.
Referred for high-dose IL-2 treatment at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2192-6-25**] Multiple R lung wedge resections; RML path shows RCC mets [**2192-7-25**] IL2 Therapy at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2192-11-25**] IL2 Therapy [**Date range (1) 83379**]; [**2111-5-15**]: chest CT with post-obstructive consolidation, concerning for endobronchial lesion causing obstruction.
[**2193-6-14**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with obstructing RUL endobronchial lesion and nonobstructing RLL endobronchial lesion.
[**2193-6-17**]: rigid bronchoscopy with mechanical and argon plasma coagulation tumor debridement.
Biopsy revealed clear cell carcinoma.
Slight interval increase in size of the dominant right upper lobe nodule with adjacent increased soft tissue density surrounding the right upper lobe bronchus, concerning for new adenopathy versus tumor extension.
Increase in size of a nodule along the right middle lobe scar, now measuring 6 x 9 mm, previously barely visible.
Stable size of multiple other small pulmonary nodules as described above.
Past Medical History: - Arthroscopic repair of the right shoulder and right knee, three years ago.
- Hypertension, resolved with weight loss after IL2   Social History: Married, has three healthy sons.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: BS+, soft, NT, no rebound/guarding, no HSM, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign Extremities: wwp, no edema.
[**2194-9-29**] MRI Brain with and without contrast: expected postop changes  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  63 yo M with metastatic RCC presenting with HA, ataxia and new cerebellar lesion, likely due to metastatic RCC.
# Nausea resolved; ?
due to brain lesion as well vs stress induced vs other - H2blocker while on high dose steroids .
# FEN: Regular diet # PPx: - DVT PPx: encourage ambulation; will neeed to consider pneumoboots; no Hep sq given RCC mets in the brain # Access: PIV # Comm: patient # [**Name2 (NI) 7092**]: FULL # Dispo: pending above  On [**9-28**] the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] to the neurosurgery service.
On [**9-29**] he underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and resection of left cerebellar mass.
Surgery was without complication and he was extubated and transferred to the ICU post op.
At the time of discharge he is tolerating a regulat diet, ambulating without difficuty, afebrile with stable vital signs.
