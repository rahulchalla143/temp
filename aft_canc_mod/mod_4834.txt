History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79-year-old male with severe Crohn's disease, mostly in the rectosigmoid.
He had a loop colostomy which was eventually converted to an end colostomy.
He had severe disease in the rectum and was unable to be examined with a large parastomal hernia and prolapse interfering with stoma function.
Past Medical History: Chron's disease Afib HTN HL DM2 asthma BPH arthritis depression OSA: pnt has CPAP at home but does not use it.
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: On ICU admission: Vitals: T: 98.1 BP: 150/49 HR: 97 RR: 25 O2Sat: 88% on RA 94% on 40% FiO2 GEN: A+Ox3, appears weak, tachypnic but not dyspneic HEENT: pallor, no Jaundice, EOMI, PERRLA, sclera anicteric, dry MM NECK: No JVD, trachea midline COR: [**Last Name (un) **], no M/G/R, radial pulses +2 PULM: reduced air entry over lower lung fields with bibasilar insp crackles.

Small-bowel obstruction with transition point at the mid ilium adjacent to (but not related to) the transverse end colostomy.
Large volume pneumoperitoneum, likely secondary to recent laparotomy.
Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis and moderately large non-hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions which do not have appearance suspicious for empyema are accompanied by new septal thickening, the overall appearances in addition to an enlarging pericardial effusion suggest congestive heart failure.
Decompression of distended small bowel since [**2148-1-8**].
Interval decrease in volume of free intra-abdominal air after laparotomy.
No evidence of abscess.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2148-1-13**] 2:59 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-9**] through 3: Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has improved and small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have decreased.
Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild.
Upper lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema.
No pneumothorax.

Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2148-1-17**] 9:58 AM IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction.
The patient was stable on the floor, he was monitored closely on telemetry for atrial fibrillation, hydrated with intravenous fluids, and pain was controlled with intravenous pain medications.
On post-operative day one he remained NPO with IV hydration because of his extensive surgical procedure.
The patient complained of a small amount of nausea and splinting and his diet was decreased to sips of clear liquids.
The appearance of the stoma was monitored closely and it was noted to be slightly edematous which prompted the surgical team to closely monitor his volume status.
On post-operative day [**2-9**] the patient was continued on sips of clear liquids and had increasing abdominal distension.
On the evening of post-operative day six the patient was noted to have increased abdominal pain and distension.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained which showed small bowel obstruction, distended stomach, small amount of ascites, small amount of pneumoperitoneum, and small bilateral pleural effusions.
The details of the patients ICU admission follow:  79 yo gentleman with med history including AF, HTN, DM2, HLD, asthma, Crohn's disease s/p proctectomy + parastomal hernia repair + revised colostomy [**1-2**] who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the surgery floor on [**1-8**] to worsening abdominal pain and distention, hypoxia and oliguria and was found to have SBO.
# SBO:  this was most likely [**1-10**] to adhesions after numerous surgeries, CT also demonstrated pneumoporitoneum which likely residual from surgery w/o evidence of perforation or intraabdominal abscess, stomach was markedly distended.
NG tube was placed with output of upto 2L daily of bilious content.
Abdominal distension subsequently markedly improved with improvement in pain and resolution of patients nausea.
SOB, desaturation, productive cough: Likely caused by combination of underlying COPD,  atelectasis d/t splinting from pain and pleural effusions + difficult breathing d/t abdominal distention.
There was no evidence of pneumonia and no clinical signs of CHF.
UOP improved with IVF and oliguria resolved.
#Anasarca with ascitis, pleural effusions and pericardial effusions: [**1-10**] to hypoalbuminemia, no signs of tamponade physiology/ no pulsus.
# Bacteriuria: associated with indwelling urethral catheter.
Gram neg rods grew in urine with speciation and sensitivities still pending at ICU discharge.
Patient was generally afebrile throughout course except for one spike to 100.3.
Digoxin was initially held d/t supratheraputic serum levels.
Patient has CHADS2 score 3, home Coumadin was held and no antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was given due to high risk for abdominal bleed per surgery team.
# Normocytic anemia: baseline Hct 39, stable at around 31 on this admission since post op.
Likely has mild anemia of chronic disease now worsened d/t blood loss during surgery .
# Unmeasurable platelets: PLT reported as ??????clumping??????
The patient continued on intravenous antibiotics for treatment of moderate amounts of erythema noted around the old stoma site and vertical abdominal incision which drained a small amount of drainage process and klebsiella urinary tract infection.
The abdominal distension had improved and on post-operative day 12 the nasogastric tube was removed after an improved KUB and decreasing white blood cell count.
The patient was closely monitored for this white blood cell count, and during this time he remained afebrile and on discharge his white blood cell count was 15.0 which was an improvement.
LENI's were also obtained to rule out an additional cause for this unexplained white blood cell count which was negative for DVT.
The patient had moderate ostomy output and was advanced to a regular diet on post-operative day fourteen.
Geriatrics recommended discontinuing the extended release diltiazem 180 mg daily and initiating 10mg of immediate release Diltiazem every 6 hours for discharge to rehabilitation with the in assumption that this will be titrated to an appropriate dose of sustained release Diltiazem.
The erythema noted on his abdomen continues to resolve and he will continue Augmentin therapy for the prescribed duration.
