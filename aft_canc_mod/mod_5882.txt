2. enhancing right renal mass measuring up to 2.3 cm, concerning for malignancy 3. splenomegaly 4. stable pancreatic ductal dilation up to 5mm, compared to [**2140**].
CT Head no acute intracranial process .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
MRI HEAD:IMPRESSION: Small areas of acute infarct in the left parietooccipital region.
Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and small vessel disease.
No evidence of chronic microhemorrhages.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Premature appearance of saline is still seen in the left heart, but the amount of saline contrast is reduced.
No evidence of enhancement of the 2.3 cm right renal lesion of concern on CT [**2146-4-7**], which is compatible with a hemorrhagic cyst.
Stable segmental dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, unchanged going back to [**2141-7-20**].
No evidence of obstructing pancreatic mass.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate lumbar dextroscoliosis.
Brief Hospital Course: # B/L pulmonary embolisms: Presenting with profound hypoxemia but minimal other symptoms.
Large A-a gradient on admission.
Seemingly up to date on cancer screening and without prolonged mobility or other RFs for PE however does have PCV which could increase her risk.
Underwent TTE which showed RV dilation and PFO.
LENIs showed DVt popliteal vein.
Continued on hep gtt but converting to lovenox or coumadin held in light of tepeated LENIs which showed progression of clot and concern that she may need IVC filter.
Although patient with infarct findings on CT/MRI brain, neurology consultation showed benefit > risk for both lysis and anticoagulation.
Cause for PE unknown, consider colonoscopy given patient has never had one, gyn w/u given increasing abdominal distention (MRI abd without evidence for malignancy, but consider MRI pelvis or u/s).
# Renall mass - seen on CT scan, concerning for malignancy; MRI demonstrated hemorrhagic cyst rather than lesion concerning for renal cell carcinoma.
Decided benefit > risk for anticoagulation nonetheless.
# Hypertension - Hypotensive in ED during peri-intubation period.
Improved with decreased propofol.
Also with evidence of RV dilation on CT concerning for strain and decrease CO.
# Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Perhaps d/t long-standing vertigo versus hypoxia versus orthostatic hypotension d/t dehydration.
# Delirium: Confusion occurred x1 night in ICU and x1 night on floor.
# Shoulder pain: d/t rotator cuff injury, very significant, continued pain meds, set-up outpatient PT and OT f/u.

You were in the ICU, on a breathing machine, because of the severity of the clots resulting in low oxygen levels.
A CT scan showed a concerning lesion on your kidney, an MRI was performed that showed a hemorrhagic cyst (benign).
An MRI of the head showed small stroke lesions in your brain, but you did not clinically have symptoms from these very small lesions.
