Patient has had recent admissions for RUQ abdominal pain, diagnosed with cholecystitis, non-operatively managed due to poor surgical candidate.
Per her son, he was notified that she had decreased PO intake, no stooling.
On day prior to admission, patient was found to have abdominal pain, KUB at that time showed possible early SBO.
She underwent CT abdomen and pelvis that showed small bowel distention and mild dilation with air-fluid levels and possible point of subtle caliber transition in the right lower quadrant, ascites, no free air.
Surgery was consulted and recommended CT with contrast to rule out ischemia.
CT with contrast showed small bowel/colonic wall thickening/edema, likely secondary to third spacing.
Slight terminal ileal hyperemia in the right lower quadrant could indicate infectious or inflammatory process.
Patient developed transient hypotension to systolic 70's, resuscitated wtih 4L IVF.
Coronary artery disease with an LAD stent [**4-7**] 5.
Congestive heart failure.
Type 2 diabetes on insulin and metformin 9.
History of thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy [**2091**] 10.
Spinal stenosis 11.
Depression with prior hospitalizations 12.
E. coli septicemia in [**2101**] 13.
[**2103-5-3**] Bilateral renal lesions on MRI suspicious for renal cell carcinoma 14. radiographic evidence of cirrhosis, seen on recent CT scan and MRI ([**10-11**]) 15.
Pancytopenia 16.
She was an administrative assistant for a technical editor to a biotech research and development firm and also worked in the IRS.
HCP: [**Name (NI) 122**] [**Name (NI) **] [**2104**]   Family History: Father who died of complication of diabetes at age 50.
Mother died of a stroke at age 67 and had a MI at age 65.
Sister [**Name (NI) 2048**] is diabetic and hypertensive.
Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 95.5 BP: 107/56 HR: 85 RR: 15 O2sat: 99%RA GEN: lying in bed, intermittantly moving in pain HEENT: dry mucous membranes, EOMI, no scleral icterus, poor dentition, JVD not elevated RESP: Decreased BS L>R at bases, upper lung [**Last Name (un) 8434**] clear CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: distended with non-tense ascites, no bowel sounds appreciated, tenderness to deep palpation, minimal rebound tenderness.
SKIN: no jaundice, multiple ecchymoses on bilateral arms in various stages of healing.
Multifocal small bowel and colonic wall thickening and edema, most likely related to third spacing and low protein state secondary to cirrhosis.
Mild hyperemia of the terminal ileum could be seen in the setting of infection or inflammation with ischemia considered less likely.
Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: 73 female with history of cirrhosis, pancytopenia/presumed MDS, medically managed cholecystitis, recent LLL pna admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension.
Hypotension - Treated empirically with antibiotcis to cover intraabdominal source.
Morning cortisol 23 ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
Abdominal Pain - Initial concern for SBO based on OSH radiology.
CT with contrast showed hyperemic bowel.
Lactate of 2.6--> not consistent with ischemic bowel or perforation.
Passing flatus and small amounts of stool.
Pleural Effusions - Bilateral, found on CT.
Diff includes hepatic hydrothorax, parapneumonic effusion, CHF, effusion related to thyroid disease.
Hypernatremia - 154 on arrival to floor, concern for decreased Po in rehab hospital.
+ AScites, para negative for SBP.
Coagulopathy - likely [**3-5**] underlying liver disease.
Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase - trending down, monitor.
Pancytopenia - Long-standing, concern for MDS.
Repeat labs in ED with acute drop in all cell lines in setting of IVF resuscitation.
UTI - on cefepime 10. history of VTach - continued amiodarone 11.
Hypothyroidism - continued Levothyroxine 175mcg/day, checked TSH/FT4.
Depression - continued zoloft 50 mg daily .
14: Multiple medical problems/several re-admissions: Following discussion with HCP and PCP and overall unclear diagnosis but subsequent decline and several admissions consulted palliative care.
