Admission Date: [**2176-2-12**]        Discharge Date:   Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male who presented to an outside hospital two days prior to admission complaining of substernal chest pain increasing over a 2-week period which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction at the outside hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for elective cardiac catheterization which showed a left main stenosis of 70 percent, a left circumflex stenosis of 90 to 99 percent, and a RCA stenosis of 90 percent at that time and was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **].
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No jugular venous distention noted.
Gastrointestinal examination revealed soft, positive bowel sounds, nontender, and nondistended.
Distal dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses palpable.
On postoperative day one, he continued on a ventilator, unable to wean, with a chest x-ray showing a left-sided fluid collection.
He already had mediastinal and left anterior chest tubes.
He was also noted to have a significantly elevated white blood cell count up to 60, and a Hematology consultation was obtained.
The Hematology Service had no big recommendations as to the source or treatment of the elevated white blood cell count, and by postoperative day three his white count had decreased to 24.
On the evening between postoperative days three and four, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] had some atrial fibrillation for which he was started on amiodarone and beta blockade; which he subsequently converted to a normal sinus rhythm.
On postoperative day five, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] had additional bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation; treated with intravenous Lopressor as well as his oral amiodarone and Lopressor doses.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] continued to have coarse lungs with a productive cough; however, his sputum changed to yellow and no infection has been identified.
On postoperative day six, he was noted to have some serous sternal drainage treated with Betadine swabs and dry sterile dressing.
On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] was noted to have a continued scant amount of serous drainage from his sternal incision.
He had an elevated white count up to 33, and he was therefore started on vancomycin intravenously, and a PICC line was placed for potential long-term antibiotic administration.
Coronary artery disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Atrial fibrillation.
