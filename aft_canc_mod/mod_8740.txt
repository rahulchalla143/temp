HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the liver, chest wall, neck, pericardium, invading the brachial plexus and brain mets who was recently discharged on [**2121-10-9**].
She presents with change in mental status following whole brain radiation therapy.
She is currently complaining of nausea without emesis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for incontinence of urine, wearing a diaper, pain well controlled on Fentanyl patch.
Denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No breast, ovarian, or colon cancer.
No pinpoint pupils.
Heart:  Regular rate with normal S1, S2, no murmur.
Abdomen:  Soft, mildly tender, diffuse, nondistended, absent bowel sounds.
The MRI showed increasing size of the right frontal and right parietal metastases which are cystic in nature and that the brain was herniating.
The patient was started on Mannitol and Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and transferred to the ICU for bedside bur hole drainage of these mets because she was becoming bradycardiac and hypertensive.
The patient was intubated and remained intubated for two days following the procedure and then was extubated without difficulty.
Each day subsequently, her mental status appeared to improve slightly to the point where she is alert but not oriented to place.
It is most likely secondary to an SIADH component of her increased intracranial pressure.
PAIN:  Well controlled with the Fentanyl patch 75 micrograms and Dilaudid was used for breakthrough pain as needed.
