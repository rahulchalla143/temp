Admission Date:  [**2166-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-11-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percodan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: need for possible esophageal and Y-stent placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radiation therapy to lung mass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 87136**] is a 69 year-old man with COPD and newly diagnosed right lower lobe poorly differentiated NSCLC w/ bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and obstruction of the esophagus and distal trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi.
He was initially transferred to the MICU from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital after being admitted on [**2166-7-16**] for evaluation for esophageal and Y-stent placement for compressive lung mass.
About two months ago, he presented with hemoptysis and, with the workup, ultimatley had a biopsy around 3 weeks ago.
He has lost 35 lbs due to anorexia and difficulty getting food down.
In the MICU, he was started empirically on vanc/unasyn for aspiration pneumonia and seen by IP.
They felt that his hypoxia was most likely secondary to right pulmonary artery compression from the mediastinal mass/LAD, and did not feel that he would benefit from Y-stent placement.
They also recommended chest CTA to rule out PE (he previously had chest CT with contrast at OSH but was not protocoled for PE per report), and urgent rad onc consult.
Past Medical History: -PEG tube placed on [**2166-7-17**] -COPD -HTN -Transitional cell Bladder CA -Spermatic cord liposarcoma, [**2160**], RP nodal resection; no chemo/XRT -Poorly differentiated NSCLC -- RLL; needle bx [**2166-6-19**] -Cholecystectomy  Social History: 50 pack year smoking history; drinks 1 drink per day; prior asbestos exposure.

Extensive mediastinal, hilar lymphadenopathy involving the entire mediastinum and hila bilaterally, with minimal change within the right hilum compared to prior study.
The lymphadenopathy encases aorta, right main pulmonary artery and SVC as described in details in the body of the report.
Interval increase in pericardial effusion is noted, small-to-moderate.
Right lower lobe mass, unchanged.
Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes most likely representing a similar process.
Hypodense pancreatic lesion, significance is unknown, might represent IPMN or involvement of the pancreas by metastatic process as well.
Status post PEG insertion due to significant compromise of the esophagus by lymphadenopathy.
Metastasis involvement of L1 by lytic lesion with soft tissue component.
No involvement of posterior endplate and spinal canal is seen at this point.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o gentleman with RLL NSCLC and extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy that is compressing the esophagus, left lower lobe segmental bronchi, and right pulmonary artery; he was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] while he completed his radiation course.
The patient did develop atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate that was controlled with Metoprolol.
[**Name2 (NI) 87137**]/Hypoxia:  New diagnosis of lung cancer with involvement of mediastinum and compression of right pulmonary artery, distal trachea, bilateral mainstem bronchi, and esophagus.
Hypoxia likely multifactorial with right pulmonary artery compression, ?
of post-obstructive pneumonia, and airway compression.
After few days started having difficulty with substernal chest pain likely [**12-24**] to mass effect and post-radiation changes/inflammation.
A palliative care consult was obtained due to the nature of the disease process.
Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with new onset of Afib during the evening of [**9-2**].
EKG showed no signs ischemia.
HR slowly increased again to 150s over next [**12-25**] hrs but pt spontaneously convereted to sinus early in AM with no further intervention.
It is thought that a combination of atrial compression from the mass and radiation change to the atrial area precipitated the Afib which did not reoccur while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Recommend increasing to 50mg PO Q6hrs if patient has recurrent rapid ventricular response.
Concern for DVT or SVC syndrome as come evidence of SVC compression on chest CT. U/S RUE showed occlusive clot of cephalic vein (superficial vein) but no DVT.
COPD:  Initially treated for COPD exacerbation at OSH with azithro and solumedrol.
Pt was kept on standing ipratropium/albuterol + PRN albuterol for SOB but steroids were discontinued per rad onc request while on XRT.
Back pain:  History of distant back surgery and patient reports chronic back pain x decades, no worsening in last several months.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: Six [**Age over 90 1230**]y (650) mg PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.

You developed complication with an irregular heart rhythm called Atrial Fibrillation that is controlled with a medication called Metoprolol.
