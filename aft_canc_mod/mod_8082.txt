She was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab and eventually admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**7-4**] with worsening dyspnea and possible mucus plugging of stent.
Currently, the patient feels well, though she admits that she has not had a nebulizer in several hours and is starting to feel somewhat short of breath.
Otherwise, the patient feels well, with no CP, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, fevers, chills or sweats.

CXR [**7-5**] There may be a small region of new atelectasis at the base of the left lung,where there has been pleural scarring.
The patient is a 63 year old woman with h/o stage I lung cancer, GERD, HTN, thromboembolic disease, ex-smoker, admitted for worsening dyspnea in background of traceobronchomalacia.
The patient was transferred to the MICU on [**7-6**] for acute respiratory distress requiring BiPap.
The patient presented with paroxysms of dyspnea associated with audible stridorous respiration during which she was in acute distress, but maintained normal oxygen saturations.
However, the patient remained symptomatic with paroxysms of acute wheezing/stridor despite stenting of cervical trachea, making her a poor candidate for surgical intervention as the cause of these paroxysms are less likely to be associated with tracheobronchomalacia in the absence of improvement with stent placement.
In addition, she had an episode of significant respiratory distress requiring bedside bronchoscopy, revealing significant mucous plugging along the length of the stent and at carina.
She was started on mucomyst therapy, continued albuterol, ipratropium, mucinex, hypertonic saline nebulizer treatments, and BiPAP, and was able subsequently to tolerate the stent with no subsequent episodes concerning for mucous plugging.
They did, however, note a Left true / false vocal fold mass, likely granulation but given h/o smoking could not rule out neoplastic process.
#Vocal cord dysfunction - The patient was evaluated by ENT for potential vocal cord dysfunction.
Flexible laryngoscopy demonstrated a left true/false vocal fold mass.
Given the patient's smoking history, this mass was thought to be attributed to be either granulation or a neoplastic process.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBCs was most likely [**3-3**] steroid use.
The patient was otherwise stable with no signs of infection during this hospitalization.
# Hyperglycemia - The patient has diabetes, managed with glyburide at home, and was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during this hospitalization.
# GERD - The patient was continued on her home omeprazole, simethicone, and TUMS.
Her regimen was enhanced with [**Hospital1 **] PPI and addition of H2 blocker given risk of increased reflux with tracheal stent.
# Hypertension - The patient's blood pressures were maintained with metoprolol.
# Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her home simvastatin.
# Depression - The patient was treated with her home citalopram.

You were admitted because of worsening shortness of breath.
During your hospitalization, you were evaluated by ENT and Thoracic Surgery.
You also received acetylcysteine therapy to help with your shortness of breath.
ENT also evaluated you for potential dysfunction of your vocal cords.
During their evaluation, they found a mass on your left vocal fold which they will continue to follow-up on once you are discharged from the hospital.
