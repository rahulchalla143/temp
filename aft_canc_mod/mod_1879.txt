Admission Date:  [**2132-2-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-2-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-4-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Sepsis and hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer with metastatic disease to the lung complicated by esophageal fistula, esophagectomy, deep vein thrombosis, and recent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 2910**] earlier on the day of admission with complaints of increasing weakness, decreased po intake, mild abdominal pain and dehydration plus some shortness of breath over the past week.
He also reported a cough productive of whitish-yellow sputum, and decreased frequency of urination.
He denied any fevers, chills, headache, chest pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or dysuria.
His chest x-ray showed findings consistent with congestive heart failure or right upper lobe pneumonia.
It was noted that he had worsening respiratory distress and his oxygen saturations diminished to the 60% range on 100% nonrebreather.
He was then electively intubated for increasing respiratory distress.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer treated with surgery and x-ray therapy; he had right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis; two prior strokes with residual right lower extremity weakness; abdominal aortic aneurysm; esophageal fistula; Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; motor vehicle accident [**2131-1-13**] fracture; J tube insertion after sepsis episode; chronic lower back pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan which showed no evidence of intraabdominal abscess, focus of infection, or a perforation.
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and upon arrival, patient was noted minutes later to become hypotensive with a mean blood pressure of 40 and was then noted to have a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity.
At this point, the Cardiology Fellow was notified who performed a bedside ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a significant pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology.
The family was immediately apprised of the situation, and was presented with the options of pursuing a decompression of the pericardial effusion or pursuing a course of conservative management, given the grim prognosis of the patient's esophageal cancer.
Because of this, decompression of the pericardial effusion was not pursued, and pressure support was withdrawn.
