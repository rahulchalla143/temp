Massive ascites.
Small-bowel is distened and large bowel is distended to the distal transverse colon where there is a relative transition point without obvious mass consistent with a large bowel obstruction.
Nodular densities along the left flank may be omental implants.
Dilated and fluid-filled esophagus and stomach.
Small left pleural effusion.
Subacute left rib fracture.
Cirrhotic liver with enhancing lesion with washout characteristics in the dome of the liver in segment VIII, concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Massive ascites.
Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Incompletely visualized gastrointestinal tract which demonstrates distention of the small bowel and large bowel as seen on recent CT. .
COLONOSCOPY: [**7-11**] No mass or obstructing lesion was noted.
Therefore, any smaller underlying lesions could not be completely excluded.
Retroflexion was not performed due to large amount of stool in rectal vault.
[**7-13**] - decompression in ICU Colonic dilatation without overt mass lesion or external compression.
[**7-17**]-ABDOMINAL XRAY: Dilated loops of both small and large bowel are noted, with air also seen within the ascending and transverse colons.
The overall degree of distention and appearance are not significantly changed from prior study, and may reflect an ileus.
There is no free air or pneumatosis.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in persistent small bowel dilatation, as well as dilated ascending and transverse colon.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8271**] is a 59 y/o M w/ ESLD [**2-21**] ETOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, SBP and PSE who was admitted for nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain due to bowel obstruction.
Bowel obstruction:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8271**] was discharged from the hospital on [**7-2**] on ciprofloxacin to treat SBP with last dose scheduled to be [**7-6**].
The patient was found to have a large bowel obstruction with dilated large and small bowel loops.
He had a colonoscopy, which showed no intraluminal mass, but it was a poor prep.
On hospital day 7, the patient started to complain of increased abdominal pain.
There was concern for perforation versus obstruction.
KUB showed no signs of free air and repeat paracentesis was negative for SBP.
In the afternoon, the patient became more sleepy (arousable to voice), with asterixis and was noted to have [**4-24**] small bright red blood clots in his NG tube fluid drainage.
Pt was admitted to MICU for colonoscopy and possible decompression of his bowel.
His lactulose dose was decreased as he had discomfort from gas pains.
His NG tube to suction was removed and he denied nausea and vomiting.
They were re-started after he was volume repleted.
After re-starting diuretics, the patient had persistent peripheral edema as well as ascites.
The patient's MRI showed concern for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute renal failure at time of admission with creatinine up to 1.4, from his baseline of 0.7.
It was thought to be pre-renal in etiology from vomiting and poor PO intake.
Iron studies on [**6-30**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
EGD in [**4-29**] consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy and ulceration.
Platelets are low likely due to splenomegaly.
The patient had small amount of blood from NG on [**7-13**] (which resolved), but no other bleeding during admission.
