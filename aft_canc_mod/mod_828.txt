The patient was doing okay at home, walking around the house, starting PT, when Friday she developed a rather sudden onset of shortness of breath at rest, being unable to complete a full sentence.
The dyspnea was accompanied concurrently with "rib" pain around her chest that felt like a pressure and tightness preventing her from fully breathing; this pain was similar to that which she developed with her pleural effusions though at those times the pain was of gradual onset.
She also felt extremely weak.
She saw her oncologist on Monday; CXR revealed "Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with right mediastinal shift...mostly consistent with interval accumulation of large amount of pleural effusion" and her Hct was low at 23.5.
She received one unit of pRBC and underwent CT scan of the chest today [**6-22**], which was concerning for large new hemothorax, multiple areas of pleural loculations concerning for metastatic deposits with internal areas of necrosis, and unchanged extensive metastases of the spine.
-Found to have rib metastases in [**2184**]; treated with Lupron and Arimidex from [**2184-7-6**] to [**2186-7-7**] -progressed on numerous chemotherapy regimens including Taxotere, gemcitabine, Navelbine, Doxil, carboplatin, and, most recently, Velban; received three cycles of Velban from [**2189-12-24**], to [**2190-2-17**] -Recent course complicated by hypercalcemia treated with zoledronate -Now s/p three cycles of c3d15 treatment with abraxane (starting fourth cycle week of [**6-22**]) -IM nail L femur for pathologic fracture [**3-15**] complicated by left thigh wound infected hematoma; s/p I and D of hematoma, deep culture of hematoma, debridement down to and inclusive of vastus lateralis muscle surface and placement of vacuum sponge in [**4-15**]; treated by ID initially with ctx and vancomycin now on standing levaquin - found to have PE in [**3-15**], s/p IVC filter placement, maintained on lovenox - s/p thoracentesis for SOB; found to have metastatic pleural effusion in [**3-15**] and [**5-15**] (noted to have trapped lung in [**5-15**]) - ORIF of traumatic ankle fracture in [**2187**] - Port placement in [**2188**] - L posterior rib biopsy [**3-23**] path fx   Social History: No IVDU, no smoking, social EtOH; patient is married, lives w/husband and son, daughter lives w/[**State 8449**], just had new baby; pt worked as bookeeper, likes to do outdoor activities (camping, hiking, kayaking  Family History: Per chart review:  Two paternal aunts had breast cancer.
One sister developed breast cancer and died in her 50s and the other  sister developed breast cancer in her late 50s, outcome is unknown.
Physical Exam: Upon discharge: T: 96.4   HR: 102  SR  BP: 130/84   Sats: 96 4L General: fragile appearing 53 year-old sitting in chair no apparent distess Card: RRR Resp: decreased breath sounds with faint crackles on left GI: benign Extr: warm no edema Skin: left hip non-healing ulcer  Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT [**6-22**] Significant interval increase in pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the left lung and right mediastinal shift.
Areas of high density consistent with hemorrhage within the pleural effusion.
Potential presence of large bulk metastatic deposits on the pleura.
Extensive metastatic disease of the spine, not significantly changed since the prior study.
Patient is known to have pulmonary embolism seen on the prior chest CT that cannot be assessed on the current study due to lack of contrast enhancement.
CXR [**6-21**] Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with right mediastinal shift [**2-8**] pleural effusion.
The opacity projecting over the right upper lobe is unchanged and it most likely represents the extensive metastatic disease within the entire skeleton.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely not changed.
No new pneumothorax is seen.
Extensive bilateral areas of consolidation and pulmonary metastases which is greater on the left appear similar to that seen one day prior.
Extensive heterogeneous bony mineralization is noted, consistent with history of bony metastases, as well as multiple anterior compression deformities in the mid-to-lower thoracic spine with exaggerated kyphosis.

LEFT-SIDE HEMOTHORAX The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-23**] with left-side hemothorax, left-side loculated pleural effusions, and a low Hct as discussed in HPI.
She did remain and appear short of breath at rest even on nasal cannula.
RE-EXPANSION PULMONARY EDEMA Unfortunately, while still in the O.R.
after being extubated she was noted to be extremely short of breath, tachypneic, and with decreased breath-sounds on the left.
CXR was concerning for re-expansion pulmonary edema and non-expanded left lower lobe.
She had a high pressor requirement and was brought to the ICU on Neo at 2.0.
Unfortunately, her CXR the following morning showed severe re-expansion pulmonary edema on the left worse since prior exam.
She underwent Chest CT (results listed above) concerning for re-expansion pulmonary edema, and also underwent bronchoscopy that did reveal inflated lungs bilaterally.
FLUID OVERLOAD Given her pressor requirements and need for crystal and colloid the patient became fluid overloaded and, with a high CVP, was started on gentle diuresis.
Skin: Left hip with small ongoing non-healing wound.
