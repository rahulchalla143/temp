OSH head CT revealed diffuse edema, large frontal and right parietal lobe edema with a concern for metastatic disease.
She had a 1 cm frontal hemorrhage along with possible SAH in frontal lobe.
Findings were significant for dense cerebral edema and borderline herniation.
No corneal reflexes.
Neck: No JVD or LAD.
Pulm: CTAB without wheezes or crackles.
Decreased tone throughout.
Vasogenic edema with vague hyperdensities suggesting metastases.
This may represent osseous metastasis .
[**2156-4-7**] LENIs No DVT.
[**2156-4-7**] MRI Head Diffuse metastatic disease, most prominently within both frontal  lobes and along the falx.
Large amount of vasogenic edema is also present.
There is mass effect, resulting in uncal and tonsillar herniation.
No acute infarcts.
Diffuse predominantly axial skeleton sclerotic metastases.
No definite lytic metastases evident.
No lymphadenopathy or definite other metastases within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
A 4 mm right lobe nodule is nonspecific and attention should be paid on followup.
Apparent hypodensity along the posterior aspect of segment 6 in the liver is likely related to extracapsular fluid; however, metastasis cannot be excluded and attention should be paid on followup.
Bilateral pulmonary aspiration.
Right superior perinephric fluid without adjacent renal abnormality is of uncertain etiology and significance.
Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
Small amount of abdominal and slightly more pelvic ascites.
[**2156-4-8**] TTE Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis on a background of normal-sized cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
[**2156-4-8**] CXR Left lower lobe consolidation appears improved from CT Torso dated [**2156-4-8**], allowing for differences in technique.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 y/o female with metastatic breast cancer who presented from OSH s/p cardiopulmonary arrest for ~30 minutes.
Pt with myoclonic jerks suggestive of anoxic brain injury.
Anoxic brain injury Pt with evidence of anoxic brain injury after arrest.
Neuro exam revealed 5 mm pupils unreactive, no corneal, no Doll's eye.
No spont movement.
L foot rhythmic twitching.
She was loaded on Keppra and maintained for seizure prophylaxis.
