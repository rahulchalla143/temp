Pathology revealed a 1.8 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins and no positive nodes.
On POD 2 she was noted to have increased somnolence which was thought to be related to her pain medications so her epidural was turned down and narcotics for breakthrough pain were discontinued.
On POD 3 metoprolol was started because of elevated systolic blood pressures.
She continued to have an air leak from all three chest tubes.
On POD 7 she noted that she felt dizzy when she was getting out of bed and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was given metoprolol once without effect and was then given IV diltiazem once with return to sinus rhythm.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and she was monitored with telemetry without recurrence.
A post pull chest xray showed no PTX.
Because her pain was well controlled, she was tolerating her diet and was ambulating without assistance, she was discharged to home on POD 9 with instructions to follow up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] clinic with a chest x-ray.
