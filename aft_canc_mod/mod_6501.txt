Past Medical History: Burkitt's lymphoma of the ovary stage [**Doctor First Name **]-E - [**2163-9-29**] Presented to PCP with abdominal pain, bloating - [**2163-10-4**] CT showed a 5 x 7 x 9 cm mesenteric mass encasing but not occluding a branch of the superior mesenteric artery with multiple prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes extending from anterior to the aortic bifurcation to the level of celiac axis.
In the pelvis, there was a 7 x 6 x 7 cm left adnexal mass with mass effect upon the bladder and uterus.
There was no evidence of peritoneal disease or omental caking.
- [**2163-10-12**] Laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy revealed Burkitt's lymphoma involving the adnexa/ovary which was partially resected.
Pathology revealed a high grade B cell lymphoma CD20+, CD10+, BCL-6+, and BCL-2+(dim) but CD5- and BCL-1-.
Cytogenetics were positive for t(14:18) IgH cMyc translocation c/w Burkitt's lymphoma.

Urine culture [**1-1**]- no growth .
Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2164-1-2**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
**FINAL REPORT [**2164-1-4**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2164-1-4**]):    No significant growth.
FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2164-1-5**]):       NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2164-1-4**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2164-1-5**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii).
CXR [**2164-1-1**]: FINDINGS: No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen on this single frontal view.
IMPRESSION: Stable chest radiograph without acute process.
Septal scarring at the left base is unchanged (2:7).
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
Non-contrast-enhanced images of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal.
A previously seen mesenteric mass within the left lower quadrant is no longer well-visualized.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and no free air or free fluid.
PELVIS: The uterus, urinary bladder, rectum, and intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are normal.
No definite adnexal masses are detected.
There is no intrapelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture.
No concerning blastic or lytic lesions are identified.
No retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal hematoma.
5-mm ground-glass opacity at the right lung base, new since [**2163-10-31**], likely reflecting focal atelectasis.
Interval near-resolution of a left lower quadrant mesenteric mass.
CT chest [**2164-1-3**]: The central lymph nodes in the mediastinum are not enlarged, although a 9 mm wide lower paraesophageal node, 2:23 was substantially smaller on the [**2163-11-28**] PET scan.
The change is likely due to new lymph node enlargement, difficult to demonstrate in the absence of intravenous contrast infusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusion right greater than left is new since [**Month (only) **], as is a tiny pericardial effusion.
There are a variety of lung lesions all new since [**2163-10-21**].
Extensive peribronchovascular ground-glass opacification predominantly in the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe is present in all lobes.
A string of small consolidative lesions in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe against the major fissure, a 7-mmION right middle lobe nodule, 4:107, a stellate 6 x 9 mm nodule in the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, 4:125-128, and a subpleural lesion in the left upper lobe similar to those on the right, 4:61-64. .
Extensive multilobar ground-glass opacification and small consolidative lesions in both lungs new since [**Month (only) **] and [**2163-11-5**] more characteristic of viral infection than bacterial septicemia.
Small bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions could be related to such infection.
Alternatively, in the setting of new left hilar adenopathy, recurrent lymphoma is a possibility.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to ventricular interaction.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be significantly underestimated due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study).
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (may be underestimated).
There is no pericardial effusion.
No definite vegetations seen .
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed) of [**2163-10-21**], major right ventricular pressure and volume overload are now present.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-1-4**], biventricular systolic function is improved and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is reduced.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION 38 yo F with Burkitt's lymphoma, currently on chemotherapy, and presenting w/ sudden onset neutropenic fever.
# Neutropenic fever: Pt presented with sudden onset fever to 104, in the setting of pancytopenia and ANC 17.
Patient met criteria for sepsis as Streptococcus viridans was cultured in initial blood cultures.
No evidence of DIC given normal coag.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was negative for vegetation however given it also exhibited right sided heart failure.
CT scan of chest showed diffuse ground glass opacification on right with small consolidative lesions bilaterally with new left hilar adenopathy, thought to be most consistent with a viral process.
Cefepime was discontinued given there was no evidence of gram negative bacterial infection.
ID was consulted and recommended adding levofloxacin for empiric coverage of atypical pneumonia for a planned 7 day course.
# Tachypnea- Thought to be related to volume overload.
The patient was diuresed initially with lasix gtt then lasix boluses with symptomatic improvement.
# Tachycardia- Documented as sinus on EKG.
Thought to be due to underlying infection, then attributed to volume overload.
As it did not improve initially tachycardia was also thought to be related to increased sympathetic tone in the setting of sepsis.
# Cardiomyopathy:  Initial transthoracic echocardiogram was concerning for dilated cardiomyopathy.
Differential included adriamycin toxicity versus sepsis.
Repeat echo was normal indicating changes were likely due to sepsis.
# Pancytopenia: Pt s/p IVAC with intrathecal methotrexate recently, discharged from hospital on [**12-25**], with significant pancytopenia.
# Burkitt's Lymphoma: Patient is s/p 2 courses of 2 cycles of CODOX-M/IVAC as well as two doses of rituxan, with a plan for two more rituxan treatments to follow.
Mid-treatment PET (on [**2163-11-28**]) showed near complete resolution of the mesenteric mass with minimal residual non FDG avid soft tissue in the region.
No FDG avid new disease in the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient presented with isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia with reassuring LFT.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Burkitts's lymphoma Strep viridans Bacteremia Respiratory Distress Tachycardia Acute congestive heart failure (now resolved)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your blood cultures grew out a bacteria called strep viridans.
There was some concern that the infection might also involve the valves of your heart.
An ultrasound of you heart did not show this but it did show your heart was having difficulty pumping.
You were also having difficulty breathing which was felt to most likely be due to excess fluid.
You also had difficulty eating for a period of time and required nutrition through your IV.
You should weigh yourself daily and call your doctor should your weight increase more than 3 lbs in 1 day or if you notice swelling in your legs or feet, difficulty breathing.
START codeine-guaifenesin as needed for cough 4.
START Tessalon Perles as needed for cough 5.
