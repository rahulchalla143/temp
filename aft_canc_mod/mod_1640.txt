Tumor in proximal transverse colon with no intra-abdominal findings to suggest metastatic disease; pathology showed that tumor invaded through muscularis propria  Specifically, the tumor was invading through into the subserosa or the non-peritonealized pericolic or perirectal soft tissues and so it was pathologically stage T3.
21 lymph nodes were examined and 2 out of the 21 were positive for malignancy and so he had a pathologic N1B disease.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Pseudomonal Bacteremia - The most likely source was his probiotics shakes, which do contain this bacteria, although not on the bottle.
Acute blood loss anemia due to esophagitis with GI Bleeding - He present with maroon emesis and decreasing hematocrit.
Likely due to recent XRT to abdomen (gastritis) although also likely a major component of regurgitation from the gastric obstruction from the cancer - EGD in [**Month (only) 116**] showed only extrinsic compression of the antrum of the stomach and some mild reflux changes with no vacies or ulcers.
- The gastric obstruction was treated with reglan with moderate effect, and he was able to eat a fair amount of pureed diet  3.
