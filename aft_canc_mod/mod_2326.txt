HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a sixty-one-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis C and positive CA-125 with cystic ovarian disease who was originally admitted to the Gynecologic service on [**2185-10-18**], for elective total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for work up of ovarian cystic disease.
A chest x-ray obtained at the time was remarkable for evidence of volume overload and an evolving left upper lobe infiltrate.
The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
There had been no history or fevers in the postoperative period.
No history of delirium tremens or hospitalizations for detoxification.
2) History of multiple sigmoid diverticula.
3) History of chronic low back pain on Fentanyl patch.
6) History of hepatitis C. 7) History of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
General, appearance, agitated, confused woman who appears older then her stated age in moderate respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, anicteric.
Sclera anicteric.
Chest, diffuse inspiratory crackles, no wheezes, decreased breath sounds, bibasilar.
Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, regular rhythm, normal rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen, soft, mildly distended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities, no rash, no clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema.
White blood cell count differential, 76 neutrophils, 11 lymphocytes, 13 monocytes, no bands.
[**2185-10-19**], chest x-ray, bilateral pulmonary interstitial infiltrates with perihilar haziness, early left upper lobe infiltrate, no pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the MICU for progressive respiratory distress and was intubated shortly after arrival.
1) Neurologic, the patient required heavy sedation with Benzodiazepines and Fentanyl throughout her hospitalization with an underlying concern for development of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
She manifested no signs or symptoms suggestive of withdrawal syndrome and was maintained on Benzodiazepines throughout her hospitalization.
2) Cardiovascular, the patient developed a high cardiac output, low SVR state on [**2185-10-21**] and after aggressive volume resuscitation required vasopressors and vasopressin to support her blood pressure.
The patient developed atrial fibrillation on [**2185-10-24**] and was loaded on Digoxin and maintained on a therapeutic dose thereof.
3) Pulmonary, the patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia after being unresponsive to diuresis attempts.
She appeared to develop adult respiratory distress syndrome, subsequent to that with the evolution of multilobar air space infiltrates in the setting of a low pulmonary capillary wedge and fever plus secretions consistent with pneumonia.
This occurred on top of baseline of mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient was managed with a low title volume strategy.
Her respiratory status was further complicated by development of volume overload from aggressive volume resuscitation.
She was begun on basic strip after vasopressin was discontinued on [**2185-11-1**] with moderate success, secondary to borderline low venal arterial pressures.
On [**2185-10-31**], the patient was diagnosed with a ventilator associated pneumonia in the setting of developing a new retrocardiac opacification and increased purulent secretions.
The procedure was complicated by inability to pass the original Shiley tracheotomy tube.
4) Gastrointestinal, the patient was noted to have mild abdominal distension at the time of presentation.
An abdominal CT scan early in the hospital course revealed a nodular liver edge with borderline enlarged spleen and moderate to large ascites, given her history of alcohol use and hepatitis C, it was felt that the patient was cirrhotic.
There is no biopsy to confirm this.
Vancomycin was added empirically on [**2185-10-22**] for clinical decompensation.
This was continued for a seven day course after one out of four blood cultures grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus.
The site continues to be without erythema or external evidence of developing line sepsis including negative blood cultures drawn through the line.
The patient has had elevated glucose throughout her hospitalization, which has been managed successfully with an insulin drip.
2) Slowly resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome.
3) Gross volume overload.
4) Atrial fibrillation.
7) Adrenal insufficiency.
8) Glucose intolerance.
9) Strong evidence for underlying cirrhosis.
