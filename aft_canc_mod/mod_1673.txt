Admission Date:  [**2160-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-4-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-12-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: mental status change  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2160-4-10**]: Left Craniotomy for partial mass resection   History of Present Illness: 48M presents with worsening HA over the past 2 days.
Went to PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 216**]/08 with increased anxiety and has had memory loss since [**Month (only) **].
He then had CT which showed large L temporal mass.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM upon admission: T:97.8  BP:130/92   HR:84    RR:16   O2Sats 100 Gen: Lying on stretcher, appeard lethargic (due to pain meds) HEENT:normocephalic/atraumatic Pupils: L 3mm R 2mm   EOMs full Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
There is hemorrhage in the operative bed, which limits evaluation for residual neoplasm.
The more posteriorly placed medial temporal lobe mass with heterogeneous enhancement and either exophytically bulging or extending into the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is unchanged.
There appears to be ependymal enhancement within the left occipital temporal horns.
Again noted is an approximately 8 mm of midline shift to the right as well as mild uncal herniation which is unchanged from the preoperative imaging.
There is extensive T2 hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe extending to the inferior frontal lobe, which could represent vasogenic edema or infiltrative neoplasm.
There is small amount of restricted diffusion along the posterior margin of the operative cavity, which could represent acute ischemia or cytotoxic edema from retraction.
There is a left frontal subgaleal postoperative collection.
MRA demonstrates no stenosis or aneurysm, the basilar artery is somewhat dimunitive, which may be related to prominent PCOMS.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes in the left temporal lobe.
Due to presence of T1 hyperintense material in the operative bed, evaluation for residual neoplasm is limited.
Unchanged left posterior medial temporal lobe heterogeneous mass.
Small amount of restricted diffusion along the posterior margin of the operative cavity.
CT Head [**4-10**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post left craniotomy and resection of large left temporal mass.
Extensive areas of new hemorrhage are seen within the left cerebral hemisphere (2, 21).
Extensive amounts of edema are similar in appearance (2, 18): There is persistent shift of the normally midline structures by approximately 6.5 mm.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
The occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle also demonstrates mild effacement, similar to slightly worse when compared to prior exam.
There is an unchanged left temporal lobe mass causing mass effect on the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Extensive areas of new hemorrhage, pneumocephalus and persistent shift of the normally midline structures.
MRI Head [**4-9**]: FINDINGS: In the region of the left temporal lobe including the hippocampus, there are two heterogeneously enhancing lesions with thick rind of enhancing tissue surroudning necrotic areas in the center corresponding to those described on the CT scan done on the same day.
There is intraventricular extension of these lesions.
The more anterior lesion (8:10) measures 33 mm transverse x 23 mm AP x 23 mm CC.
The second more posterior area measures 21 mm transverse x 28 mm AP x 23 mm CC.
The two lesions closely approximate each other and may, in fact, represent lobules of one large conglomerated lesion illdefined lesion.
The more posterior lesion displays signal characteristics suggestive of retained blood products.
Both lesions show an irregular thick rim of enhancement on post- contrast images.
There is an approximately 8 mm right deviation of normal midline anatomy as well as partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle, associated with these lesions.
There is also mild subependymal enhancement and along the margins of the ventricle on the left side.
In addition, effacement of the left border of the suprasellar cistern is consistent with associated left uncal herniation.
There is no evidence of tonsillar herniation.
There is no evidence of acute infarction.
On post- contrastimages, there is displacement of the adjacent vessels including the middle cerebral arteries and venous structures.
Two heterogeneously enhancing Left temporal lobe lesions involving the hippocampus and intraventricular extension and resultant mass effect as detailed above.
Diagnostic considerations include primary CNS infiltrative malignancy such as glioblastoma multiforme or less likely a lymphoma, though metastatic disease is also in the differential diagnosis.
In addition to that, recommendations were conveyed for an MRA to assess vascular patency of the displaced vessels as well as a neurosurgical consult.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1313**] was admitted after CT revealed a new large left temporal brain mass.
He became progressively lethargic to the point of obtundation.
In this context, the patient was emergently rushed to the OR for a left temporal lobectomy on [**2160-4-10**].
Due to the large size of his mass and the amount of compression on the brain he remained in the ICU for several days.
The patient requires 24 hour supervision for his cognitive deficits.
He speaks with hesitatncy and paraphasic errors.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Outpatient Occupational Therapy Patient requires assistance with cognitive deficit.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: left temporal brain mass   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions:  General Instructions/Information  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-25**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
