Today he had a sudden on set of lower abdominal pain, [**7-7**], sharp without radiation.
No pain sense that time.
Had melena per rehab report, patient states he knows he had BM around the time of the pain but did not see it.
Lavage done via PEG tube with no return of blood or coffe ground material.
-Recurrent aspirations, now npo with PEG tube -PEG tube compilcated by melena -Anemia (baseline HCT 26) -Alcohol abuse -Liver mass, biopsy consistent with cholangeocarcinoma -[**2158-3-24**] c scope: Polyp in the ascending colon (polypectomy).
There was no evidence of active bleeding seen in the stomach or small intestine.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:97.3 BP:112/50 P:102 R:12 SaO2:96% on 4L General: Awake, alert, cachetic man HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MMdry, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Crackles at bases Cardiac: Distant heart sounds.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
Linear opacities persist, likely in part atelectasis versus resolving airspace disease.
There is a persistent right pleural effusion blunting the right costophrenic angle which may have slightly decreased in size as well.
There is no volume overload.
No discrete visceral pleural line is seen to suggest pneumothorax.
A tube of indeterminate origin or etiology is seen overlying the included abdomen.
CXR [**2158-4-24**] Severe pulmonary edema is new.
Consolidation at the right lung base is partially obscured but probably unchanged.
Pulmonary artery dilatation reflecting pulmonary hypertension due to longstanding chronic lung disease, unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2158-4-23**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Degree of consolidation in both lower lobes appears to have progressed slightly.
There are superimposed interstitial densities compatible with fibrosis at the lung bases.
There is an unchanged rim-enhancing pleural fluid collection in the right lung base.
There is new filling of the prior lumen of the common bile duct and intrahepatic ducts with high-density material which has the Hounsfield units (60-70) of acute blood clot.
The gallbladder is abnormal in appearance with heterogeneous areas of high density, also likely indicating hematoma/blood clot.
There is worsening intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is redemonstration of the large mass in the junctions of segments VII and VIII which is not changed in size or appearance.
Located anteriorly and just slightly inferior to the largest portion of the lesion, there is a new 6-mm tubular collection of arterial phase contrast seen adjacent to a branching vessel from the right hepatic artery (which is replaced, arising from the SMA).
No delay-phase images were acquired.
There is also a heterogeneous area of slightly increased attenuation in the liver parenchyma near the porta hepatis.
There is mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct measuring up to 4 mm.
There is no ascites.
There is no colonic wall thickening.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis or blood in the pelvis.
There is marked dilation of the CBD with a large filling defect may represent blood.
There is partial opacification of the pancreatic duct with borderline diffuse dilatation.
[**4-23**] Hepatic artery embolization - 1.
Selective and superselective arteriograms through the superior mesenteric artery and the replaced right hepatic artery showed the suspected pseudoaneurysm coming off a cranial branch of the right hepatic artery, without active extravasation of contrast.
Follow-up angiogram demonstrates good angiographic results with stasis at the level of the branches supplying the pseudoaneurysm and no more opacification of the pseudoaneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: 74yo M with biliary carcinoma a/w melena who later than developed UGIB complicated by respiratory failure.
Since HCT remained stable and felt to be slow bleed, scope deferred.
However, on Sunday [**2158-4-23**], at 7:30 am vomitted up ~250 cc of bright red blood and had abrupt onset of abdominal pain.
Called GI for urgent endoscopy, and surgery for evaluation of abdominal pain.
Pt was also intubated for respiratory distress and airway protection for hematemasis.
Patient was found on chemistries to have developed new billiary obstruction.
CT  showed large bleed in the billiary system.
IR was called, and patient went for embolization.
HCT remained stable after transfusion and embolization of the right hepatic artery.
For biliary obstruction from blood clot, ERCP done the following day, [**2158-4-24**] to remove clot and pig tail stent placed.
During that procedure, the existing PEG tube was removed due to visual obstruction.
Since [**2158-4-26**], patient has been hemodynamically stable with stable Hct and no further evidence of bleeding.
No signs of obstruction at this time.
# Respiratory failure: Pt has a baseline O2 requirement of 4L when he was initially admitted to the MICU.
Pt then later developed respiratory distress/failure which was multifactorial in cause with COPD/SIRS/[**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS, recent aspiration PNA and aspiration of hematemasis.
Pt was intubated for respiratory distress/failure on [**4-23**].
He was continued on vanc and Zosyn until [**4-30**] for aspiration pneumonia.
His WBC is still slightly elevated but stable and he has remained afebrile.
# Biliary adenocarcinoma: Pt has biliary adenocarinoma with a liver lesion and a ?
If pt has metastatic disease, pt has a poor prognosis.
# Hypotension - During active bleed and intubation.
Started on levophed [**4-25**] which was weaned quickly with fluid resuscitation.
Pt was continued on vanc and zosyn empirically as there was a concern for cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction and respiratory failure thought to be [**12-30**] [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS.
He has not required any further pressors or fluid boluses.
He has remained afebrile, but with an elevated WBC which remains stable.
# COPD - Continue spiriva, advair and nebs prn.
However, tip of G-J had to be cut off during ERCP for visualization and had to be replaced by IR on [**5-1**].
#Access: PICC, placed [**2158-3-7**] - will keep in place as patient has poor access in the event he needs access at rehab.
