Admission Date:  [**2175-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-10-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-4-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Calcitonin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2024**] Chief Complaint: hip pain and constipation with new hypercalcemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy Port a cath placement Chemotherapy   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 6955**] is a 44 yo female with pmh of metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] who presented to the [**Hospital3 22439**] with hip pain.
She had been experiencing right posterior mid-hip pain for the last 3 weeks.
The pain was sharp and did not radiate down her leg.
Denies weakness in her legs, sensory changes, or incontinence.
She also has had 2 weeks of constipation and more recently increasing abdominal distension and lower abdominal pain.
She used a saline enema on Wednesday which produced some stool, then had diarrhea on Thursday.
For the past few days she has been experiencing nausea and occasional vomiting after eating.
She also reports she has been gagging on pills recents and has had headaches on and off.
She had an X-ray of her lumbar spine which showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
She underwent a hip X-ray which showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she reports her hip pain is well controlled with the morphine she received in the ED.
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma - Diagnosed within the last year after presenting to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] fungating thigh mass.
Biopsy showed squamous cell carcinoma.
Metastatic workup revealed adenopathy involing the iliac vessles and superficial inguinal region.
Iron deficiency anemia - During workup for her SCC she underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy which showed no cause for her anemia.
Family History: Her father and sister have had sebaceous cysts.
There are a number of non-immediate family members with history of cancer; details are lacking  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.5 P 90 BP 153/79 RR 17 Sat 93% on RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Patient is breathing comfortably.
Inspiratory crackles bilaterally at the bases.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Linear well-healed scar in her LLQ.
Her abdomen is moderately distended with hyperactive bowelsounds.
Slight tenderness to palpation in her lower quadrants.
No rebound or guarding present.
GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Left mid medial thigh has a large area where a baseball-sized mass of tissue was removed with well-appearing scar tissue over it.
Pain to palpation focally over her right iliac crest.
No masses or abnormalities palpated.
Pathology [**2175-10-12**] Ilium/pelvis, right, biopsy: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present.
Known T10 vertebral body and pelvic osseous metastases do not demonstrate significant tracer avidity.
Marked right upper thoracic anterior chest wall uptake does not have an obvious CT correlate, though early rib/chest wall metastasis is a diagnostic consideration.
Difficult to exclude a skull metastasis in the setting of mild focal uptake.
New lytic lesions throughout the pelvis and new subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, all indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
Marked progression of extensive bilateral pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as numerous ossesous lytic lesions.
Overall, these findings are new since [**Month (only) **] and concerning for rapid progression of neoplastic disease in a person with known history of previous malignancy.
New bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8. .
# Hypercalcemia: This was most consistent with hypercalcemia [**1-30**] PTH-rp production and bone metastasis.
The patient presents with constipation and was found to have a Ca of 19.8.
Initially patient was unable to take in adequate POs, secondary to her mucositis, to meet her fluid requirement and her Ca levels were difficult to control.
# Squamous cell carcinoma: Chest and pelvic CT was performed which was concerning for pulmonary nodules, extensive lymphadenopathy, and lytic lesions in the pelvis all concerning for metastatic malignancy.
A bone scan was performed which showed diffuse lytic lesions in pelvis, chest wall, femur, and possibly skull.
All of these findings were highly consistent with metastatic SCCA.
A bone biopsy was scheduled that showed squamous cell carcinoma in the iliac.
She tolerate chemotherapy well except for mucositis that was improving prior to discharge.
She also tempoprarily developed elevated LFTs but this was an expected side effect of chemotherapy.
It was thought that the large amount of fluids she was getting for her hypercalcemia had contributed to her HTN.
# Acute renal failure: The patient's Cr on admission was 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).
She appeared dry initially on exam and given her extreme hypercalcemia likely has prerenal ARF vs ATN from volume depletion.
She had an abdominal US at [**Hospital1 6687**] which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall in the GFR.
# Right posterior hip pain: The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Hip x-ray was negative, but CT showed lytic lesions in bone which may be the cause of her hip pain.
She was given ms contin and morphine for pain relief.
# Chronic iron-deficiency anemia: The patient's initial Hct was 34.2 which was near her most recent baseline since being treated for iron-deficiency.
She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
Her hematocrit slowly trended downward, without any evidence of hemolysis.
Patient otherwise remained hemodynamically stable.
Based on previous clinic visit notes she has had tachycardia before.
