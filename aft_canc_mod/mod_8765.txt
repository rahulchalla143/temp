History of Present Illness: 73 year old woman with past medical history of IDDM, seizure disorder and breast cancer who lives alone presenting with right-sided hip, leg and low back pain after slipping off her toilet this morning.
There were no witnesses, and it is not clear how long she was down for.
Physical exam showed pain with active and passive R hip rotation.
K+ 5.8->5.6, EKG notable for new T wave inversions in V1-V4.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed urinary retention and a foley catheter was placed.
Perceived to have a somewhat altered mental status although unclear baseline.
Past Medical History: Seizure disorder (developed [**1-13**] DKA in [**2095**]) breast CA s/p mastectomy with prosthetic reconstruction ([**2107**]) IDDM RA HTN glaucoma bilat TKRs .
Of note, neuropsych evaluation in [**2125**] commented that "her marked attentional impairments raises concerns around her safety, medication compliance, and other areas of functional vulnerability."

RADIOLOGY: R Hip Films: [**2128-2-13**] FINDINGS: There is a nondisplaced, slightly impacted right subcapital hip fracture.
No other fractures are identified.
Mild degenerative changes involving the SI joints and lumbar spine are noted.
IMPRESSION: Right subcapital hip fracture as described above.
Fibroid uterus.
Distended bladder with mild left pelvic fullness.
Bilateral adrenal gland thickening, left greater than right.
CT HEAD [**2128-2-13**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
6mm peripherally calcified right thyroid nodule for which further evaluation with ultrasound.
There is a late transition with Q waves and ST-T wave changes in the anterior leads consistent with probable prior anterior myocardial infarction.
There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
CXR [**2128-2-13**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
R HIP FILMS [**2128-2-16**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-13**], views from the operating suite show placement of three metallic screws across the previously described fracture of the femur.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global hypokinesis.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small left ventricular cavity size with preserved systolic function.
[**2038-2-16**] CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**2128-2-17**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-16**], there has been a substantial decrease in the bilateral opacification, which had been more prominent on the left and could have represented either asymmetric pulmonary edema or diffuse aspiration.
Some residual areas of opacification are seen at the right base laterally and at the left base.
These most likely represent residual aspiration or possible atelectasis.
[**2128-2-18**] EKG Normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the right precordial leads consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Q waves in the inferior leads consistent with inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to tracing #2 there is no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 73F PMHx of DM, seizure disorder and breast cancer, found down on her floor with R hip fx s/p fall, admitted to the ICU with hip fx, ARF, NSTEMI, and hypoxia.
Hospital course by problem:  # Elevated Cardiac Enzymes and EKG Changes: Had elevated troponins in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] and new TWI both in the setting of anemia.
ACE-I was held given recent acute on chronic renal failure and preserved EF as seen on echo (see below).
# Right Hip Fracture s/p Fall.
Went to OR on [**2128-2-16**], no complications intra-op, but did go back ot the ICU for overnight monitoring as she had some hypoxia postoperatively (had received a larga amount of morphine).
Pain was also managed with tylenol.
She was discharged on lovenox 40mg sQ daily for DVT ppx, and with orthopedic followup.
# Pancyopenia: Presented with acute on chronic anemia with baseline in low 30s, as well as thrombocytopenia with nadir platelets in the 40s, and leukopenia to a nadir of 2.1 Felt likely [**1-13**] methotrexate use with questionable use of folate (marrow suppressive process).
DDAVP was given for low platelets.
Her methotrexate was held, she received supplemental folic acid, and all cell lines recovered to normal by discharge.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline creatinine = 1.3, but she presented with creatinine 1.8 -> max of 2.2 in setting of fall.
Felt likely [**1-13**] hypoperfusion and prerenal state.
# Transaminitis: Had elevations of ALT, AST and Alk Phos without elevation in bilis.
Unclear etiology, felt [**1-13**] mild ischemic liver in setting of hypotension.
On discharge,her metformin was continued, but lisinopril was still held in setting of recent acute renal failure.
# Fall: unclear etiology in pt with h/o seizure d/o and multiple CAD risk factors.
Further syncope workup included monitoring on telemetry without significant arryhtmia, sending a tegretol level (normal), repeating EKGs (developed signs of MI), and carotid ultrasounds which were normal.
# Hypoxia - pt still had minimal O2 requirement on d/c.
Echo performed this admission revealed preserved EF of 60-65% but markedly dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There was abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
This was thought to possible represent sequelae from her MI.
Pulmonary embolism was on the differential but given her acute on chronic renal failure, a CT-A was deferred, and the patient was allowed to autodiurese and recover from the imediate postoperative period and wean off of narcotics.
# RA:  methotrexate was held during admission given pancytopenia above.
# Depression: dx with mild depression - Effexor therapy was continued  # Dementia/Delerium: unclear circumstances of diagnosis, per record patient reporting forgetfulness, psych testing showing mild attention deficits.
She did experience significant delirium during her hospitalization which had improved by her discharge, but was still present in a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature but easily treated with reorientation and discontinuation of foley catheter, telemetry, and hydration.
She does have followup scheduled with her cognitive neurologist.
# Prophylaxis: will be on lovenox 40mg sQ daily until ealry [**Month (only) 547**] for DVT ppx, also d/c'ed on bowel regimen  # Communication: with patient and daughter [**Name (NI) **] HCP [**Name (NI) 1785**] [**Name (NI) 1356**] [**PO Box 103136**] [**Location (un) 2268**], [**Numeric Identifier 103137**]  Home: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103138**] Cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103139**] Work: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103140**]  # Code: Full  # Dispo: To [**Hospital3 **]  Medications on Admission: Lipitor 20 mg daily Tegretol 200 mg TID Aricept 10 mg daily Lisinopril 5 mg daily Meloxicam 15 mg daily Metformin 500 mg daily Methotrexate 12.5 mg weekly Effexor 150 mg Daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Percocet 2.5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every [**5-18**] hours as needed for pain: HOLD for any CNS or respiratory depression (RR <12).
- NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia - shock liver - Pancytopenia likely due to methotrexate - Right heart failure  Secondary: - Rheumatoid arthritis - Hypertension - Depression - Seizure disorder - Diabetes mellitus type II - Obstructive sleep apnea - Dementia - H/O breast cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital after falling at home.
As a result of the fall, you suffered a fractured right hip, as well as low blood pressure which caused major stress to your heart and liver.
