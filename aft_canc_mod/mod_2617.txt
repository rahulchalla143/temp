Admission Date:  [**2163-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-3-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]M is admitted to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of an aspiration event.
The son reports that he has been aspirating often however yesterday he had one aspiration event whcih was worse than usual.
Today, patient was noted to be somnolent and lethargic and confused, his blood pressure was 80's systolic and EMS was called who noted SBP 60/p and .
CXR shows bibasilar consolidation.
his son translated, patient was oriented to hospital reported dyspnea and cough and abdominal pain with palpation however was unable to contribute further to the interview.
The son reports that the patient had been having diarrhea 2 weeks ago but that the diarrhea had resolved.
Family History: Denies family history of coronary artery disease, hypertension.
Physical Exam: Admission exam: Vitals: T:99.7 BP:97/56 P:95 R: 26 O2: 93% General: Somnolent breathing comfortably with audiable upper airway secretions HEENT: Sclera anicteric, mucous membs dry Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, Lungs: R>L ronchi, equal air entry BL CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Distended, diffusely tender to palpatation, bowel sounds normoactive, no rebound, no guarding.
GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no edema Neuro: Equal handgrip BL, moving all extremities, responding to simple commands.
Given the relative asymmetry in the setting of low lung volumes, atelectasis is favored, although early developing pneumonia or possibly aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.
The large left perihilar mass lesion appears relatively distinct from the hilar vessels.
Portable abd REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Microcytosis and distended abdomen.
Portable AP radiograph of the abdomen was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
There is diffuse dilatation of the small bowel up to 3.7 cm.
Large, partially calcified mediastinal mass with narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein.
Primary differential considerations include thymoma or teratoma.
Bibasilar opacities likely represents aspiration or pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.
No evidence of small bowel obstruction, though small bowel is diffusely and mildly dilated.
Redundant, air-filled and dilated sigmoid colon with stool-filled and slightly hyperemic rectal wall with an area of mild focal narrowing (2.5 cm at narrowest caliber) at the rectosigmoid junction.
It is unclear if this appearance may be secondary to peristalsis, but a stricture or mass cannot be excluded.
Direct inspection with proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is recommended to rule out underlying mass.
Mild to moderate tracheo- and bronchomalacia.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and old, not completely healed left posterior rib fractures.
Brief Hospital Course: A [**Age over 90 **] yoM with history hypertension, thymoma, and aspiration admitted to the ICU for hypotension and hypoxia in the setting of recent aspiration event.
#Septicemia / Aspiration pneumonia: With lactate elevation, bandemia, and CXR findings of bibasilar consolidation, he was found to have sepsis seconday to pneumonia.
Abdominal CT showed "Redundant, air-filled and dilated sigmoid colon with stool-filled and slightly hyperemic rectal wall with an area of mild focal narrowing (2.5 cm at narrowest caliber) at the rectosigmoid junction.
It is unclear if this appearance may be secondary to peristalsis, but a stricture or mass cannot be excluded.
Direct inspection with proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is recommended to rule out underlying mass."
This finding was discussed with the patient's son / HCP [**Name (NI) **], who determined that further investigation of this thickening / mass is NOT consistent with the patient's goals of care.
# Aspiration: Seen by speech and swallow team for ongoing aspiration.
They understand there is a high risk for recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
# Pyuria:  UA mildly positive, urine culture grew coag negative staph which is covered with broad spectrim antibiotics as above.
# Acute renal insufficiency: Basline Cr 1.0, creatinine up to 1.8 on admission, likely pre-renal from hypovolemia.
# Chest mass: patient with questionable hx of thymoma which is likely the left sided mass seen on CXR and CT - given tissue components, mass in chest is most likely to be teratoma.
This is likely reason for wheezing as pt has large airway compression visualized on CT chest (see report above).
Records obtained from [**Hospital1 **] reveal mass has increased in size ~1 cm from prior imaging studies.
[**Doctor First Name **] / HCP states that further workup of this mass with biopsy or excision is NOT consistent with his father's goals of care.
#: Code status: Code status DNR/DNI, and do not place central line, no aggressive or invasive measures.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1643**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bacterial pneumonia Hypoxic respiratory failure / Sepsis Metabolic encephalopathy Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure and sepsis which improved with IV antibiotics.
