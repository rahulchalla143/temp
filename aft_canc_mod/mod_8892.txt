Admission Date:  [**2185-2-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-3-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-1-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, mitral valve replacement and was found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray in [**2184-4-27**].
The patient had a follow-up chest CT scan which confirmed the presence of a mass in the right upper lobe and collapse of that lobe in [**2184-10-27**].
Approximately four weeks prior to admission the patient is noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion and two weeks prior to admission the patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema.
However, at that time she left against medical advise because she did not want to have a bronchoscopy or a thoracentesis done.
The patient returned two weeks later on [**2-26**] with the same symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea, exertion and lower extremity edema.
She also states she had a chronic cough and a 20 pound weight loss in the past year with one episode of hemoptysis.
She had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and chest x-ray showed right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
When the patient's INR decreased she was taken for a bronchoscopy which showed a pulsatile mass in the right middle lobe.
After the procedure the patient did well until approximately 90 minutes later when she went into acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure.
Right upper lobe mass; see History of Present Illness.
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve replacement in [**2167**].
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Chest exam significant for decreased breath sounds on the right with coarse breath sounds and scattered rales anteriorly bilaterally.
Heart exam significant for mechanical heart sounds.
Extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally with no calf tenderness.
Calcium was elevated at 11.6.
Chest x-ray showed complete opacification of the right hemothorax and a large right atrium.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 80 to 85 beats per minute with right axis deviation and T-wave inversions in leads 2, 3 and aVF with nonspecific ST changes.
Right upper lobe mass.
Due to the size and nature of the mass seen by x-ray and CT as well as bronchoscopy it most likely represented a malignancy.
Numerous sputum cytologies were sent which showed highly atypical keratinized squamous cells highly suspicious for non-small cell lung cancer.
PTH related peptide was also sent as the patient was hypercalcemic and this showed that there was an elevated level of PTHrP which again made lung cancer the most likely and very likely diagnosis.
Radiation oncology felt that the mass was too large to receive radiation for treatment, however the patient could receive radiation for palliative reasons, perhaps to improve compression on large airways which may improve her respiratory function.
Therefore, the patient was taken for two doses of radiation, however, this did not resolve the insignificant improvement in any of her symptoms including her respiratory function.
The patient's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to the large right lung mass as well as the copious amount of secretions that she was producing possibly secondary to the lung mass and combination of her underlying lung disease of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was also given inhalers for bronchodilation for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Finally, it was decided since the patient had a terminal illness that the patient and the family both wanted to try extubation and spontaneous breathing.
Prior to her extubation it was decided that were the patient go into respiratory arrest she would not be reintubated or resuscitated.
Intermittent atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Hypercalcemia malignancy.
Coronary artery disease.
