His course was complicated by E. faecium and Klebsiella bacteremia in 8/[**2191**].
This was presumably due to a biliary source and because his biliary stent was not removable he was treated with IV antibiotics then started on chronic augmentin therapy.
Patient represented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital in [**9-/2191**] with recurrent fevers and was treated with IV antibiotics for two days without positive cultures or clear source of infection and discharged home on augmentin.
He was discharged home on [**2191-12-7**] but returned again to their ED with fevers and weakness on [**2191-12-10**].
Patient denied any localizing symptoms but was visibly rigoring.
On presentation he was in sinus rhythm but during ED evaluation went into atrial fibrillation with heart rates as high as 150s.
Due to persistent HR > 120 he was started on a diltiazem gtt and admitted to the ICU.
On arrival to the ICU, patient denies any focal complaints.
He denies headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools, chest pain, shortness of breath, productive cough, back pain.
He has a chronic dry cough that is unchanged x years.
He had one episode of emesis associated with coughing yesterday.

He has a brother who is 88 years old alive  with diabetes mellitus who was also treated for cancer of the sinus two years ago.
His maternal grandfather and mother's three siblings all died of complications of diabetes mellitus.

Pulm: non-labored breathing, clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes, but occasional cough Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Blood Cx [**12-10**], [**12-11**], [**11-22**]: Positive for Klebsiella oxytoca.
[**2191-12-12**] - Transthoracic Echocardiogram: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the apical segments and apex.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
A mass is present on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with mild focal hypokinesis.
There is small calcified mass on the aortic valve that could be focal calcification or a small, healed vegetation.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Abd U/S [**2191-12-13**]: ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is echogenic, consistent with fatty infiltration or fibrosis/cirrhosis.
There are multiple simple cysts within the liver as seen on prior CT.
The left lobe is atrophied with an ill-defined mass, consistent with known cholangiocarcinoma.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There is no ascites.
Common bile duct stents in situ, with no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation or evidence of abscess.
Redemonstration of left lobe cholangiocarcinoma and hepatic cysts.
The heart remains within normal limits and the lungs are free of acute infiltrate.
Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year-old man with history of unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p nine cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine last in [**2191-7-7**] who presents with persistent fevers and weakness.
Likely [**2-22**] to a biliary source with a possible nidus in the CBD metal stent.
GNR bacteremia was confirmed by OSH (4 cultures) as well as here at [**Hospital1 18**] with further speciation significant for Klebsiella Oxytoca.
Vanc was d/c'd given no evidence of gram positive bacteremia, and ID was consulted who recommended chaning meropenem to outpatient course of ertapenem.
Of note, MRCP was considered to assess for abcess vs progression of cholangiocarcinoma, but given patient's clinical stability, this was not further pursued.
# Transaminitis.
Likely from underlying cholangiocarcinoma and bacteremia.
He does not have any abdominal discomfort or GI symptoms.
He is scheduled for an outpatient CT to assess for disease progression.
# Cholangiocarcinoma, s/p metal stent & 9 cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine.
# Weakness, generalized.
Likely [**2-22**] bacteremia and underlying malignancy.
No focal weakness or neurological defict was noted on physical exam.
# Normocytic Anemia, baseline.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Sinus tachycardia:  Patient initially thought to have atrial fibrillation in the Emergency Department and was started on dilt ggt.
Sinus tachycardia resolved with 4.5 L of fluid resuscitation, and was not tachycardic for rest of admission.
Given persistent fevers, chills, and poor appetite this was likely due to hypovolemia.
# Hiccups:  Pt with persistent hiccups throughout admission likely due to malignancy and phrenic nerve irritation.
