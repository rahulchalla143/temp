Stable sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and global atrophy.
No mass effect or evidence of herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Osmotic demyelination syndrome ("central and extra-pontine myelinolysis") generally occurs as complication of the treatment, with too-rapid correction, of patients with profound,  life-threatening hyponatremia, rather than the hyponatremia, per se .
[**1-13**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Q-T interval prolongation.
J point and ST segment elevation are more apparent in limb and precordial leads.
CXR [**1-13**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-16**]: Antilordotic positioning probably explains mild enlargement of both hila.
Remainder of the imaged lungs and pleural surfaces are normal aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis.
[**1-14**] Knee xray: FINDINGS: There are severe degenerative changes involving the patellofemoral compartment with bone-on-bone contact to the patella with the trochlea at the lateral aspect.
These overall findings can be seen in the setting of CPPD arthropathy.
MRSA screen ([**1-13**]): MRSA positive C. diff ([**1-17**]): negative for C. diff toxin.
Urine Culture ([**1-17**]): URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.
Endoscopy ([**1-18**]): colonscopy  Findings:	 Mucosa:	Mild and patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum were noted.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed to rule out microscopic colitis.
-A 4 mm polyp in the hepatic flexure (polypectomy) -Mild patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum in the [**Month/Year (2) 499**] (biopsy) -Moderate diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**].
Cold forceps biopsies were performed to rule out microscopic colitis.
Duodenum: The mucosa at the proximal bulb of duodenum appeared mildly nodular.
A 0.8 cm X 0.6 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a cyst was noted in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
No intrinsic mass, septations or debris were noted within the cyst.
Pancreas parenchyma: there were mild lobularity and hyperechoic strands throughout.
But there was no other chronic pancreatitis changes.
Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 1.8-2 mm in maximum diameter in the head and neck of the pancreas and 1.5 mm in maximum diameter in the body of the pancreas.
No stone or dilated side branch was seen.
Impression:	 -Hiatal hernia -EGD exam revealed a normal stomach and D2 (biopsy) and slightly nodular duodenal bulb (biopsy) The -Linear EUS evaluation was then performed -A 0.8 cm X 0.6 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a cyst was noted in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
No intrinsic mass, septations or debris were noted within the cyst.
-Pancreas parenchyma: there was mild lobularity and hyperechoic strands throughout.
But there were no other findings of chronic pancreatitis.
These findings are compatible with, but not diagnostic of, early chronic pancreatitis.
-Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 1.8-2 mm in maximum diameter in the head and neck of the pancreas and 1.5 mm in maximum diameter in the body of the pancreas.
No stone or dilated side branch was seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo woman with history of breast ca, HTN, cystocele and hyponatremia, presented with recurrent hyponatremia and ARF, found to have ETOH withdrawal.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hyponatremia: Patient has had previous admissions for hyponatremia (and chronic hyponatremia with Na in mid-120s), which was thought to be SIADH in setting of vasopressin administration.
Per report, patient had some somnolence in the ICU but was easily arousable to voice, which was thought to be most likely secondary to the IV ativan she received prior to transport up to the ICU.
CXR negative for acute process and head CT was also negative.
Nephrology felt that presentation was consistent with a combination of low solute intake, SIADH and perhaps excess free water at home.
In addition, pt also presented with an osmolar gap suggestive of ETOH ingestion.
Recent TSH was normal, am cortisol 7 prior to [**Month/Year (2) **], not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
Her sodium levels were followed closely as well as her blood and urine osmolarity.
# L.knee pain-DDX included severe osteoarthritis vs. pseudogout vs. gout.
Pt did have a mechanical fall preceding [**Hospital **] but did not have any previous knee pain.
No new apparent trauma.
No new erythema or induration or warmth to suggestion infection or septic joint.
Xray confirmed severe arthritis with evidence to suggest CPPD.
Likely due to volume contraction in the setting of ACE-i use.
#ARF: Presented with a creatinine of 1.2 from 0.7, although pt stated she was drinking a lot of water at home, presentation was still likely c/w pre-renal, given recent diarrhea.
# Diarrhea/fecal incontinence/abdominal pain-pt with h/o IBS- was recently supposed to have [**Hospital 2792**], endoscopy, and EUS to further evaluate these complaints.
The GI team was contact[**Name (NI) **] during [**Name (NI) **] as it was felt that the patient would certainly need inpatient prep given profound hyponatremia and risk for recurrent profound hyponatremia.
C-scope showed a 4mm poly (removed via polypectomy), patchy erythema (biopsied), moderate diverticulosis, and random biopsies of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] were also taken to rule out microscopic colitis.
The EGD/EUS revealed a hiatal hernia, nodular duodenal bulb (biopsied), pancreatic changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis, and also a discrete lesion in the pancreas measuring less than 1 x 1cm in size, consistent with cyst.
Given recent EtOH use, would recommend waiting 3 months, but sooner if she develops weight loss.
The cyst could not be biopsied as the patient is on anticoagulation for her PE with fondaparanaux.
# Hx PE / DVT: Pt was continued on 7.5 fondaparanaux sc qd.
No reports of prior withdrawals.
Pt developed signs of ETOH withdrawal upon transfer out of ICU to the medical floor was was placed on a CIWA scale and given PRN valium.
#asthma-no sign of acute flare, continued fluticasone .
GI - will need outpatient MRCP in 3 months or sooner if weight loss occurs.
Will f/u result and call pt if she needs additional or changed antibiotic.

Chronic diarrhea/IBS gout asthma HTN   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium), elevated potassium and impairment in your kidney function.
You were initially monitored in the ICU and your symptoms improved.
You underwent an endoscopy, [**Month/Year (2) 2792**] and EUS (endoscopic ultrasound), which showed a polyp in your [**Month/Year (2) 499**], some areas of inflammation (biopsied), diverticulosis, a hiatal hernia, a nodular stomach (biopsied), possible chronic pancreatitis, and a pancreatic cyst.
For your pancreatic cyst and possible changes c/w chronic pancreatitis, you will need follow-up imaging with a MRI in approximately 3 months.
This has already been ordered by the GI doctors, and you will need to call after discharge to schedule the exact date.
You were also noted to have a urinary tract infection with a urine culture growing E. Coli.
If you have any GI symptoms, please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2799**] to schedule an appointment to be seen as necessary.
