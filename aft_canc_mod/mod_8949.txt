Admission Date:  [**2102-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-12-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4393**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension following anesthesia induction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC, osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of sedatives for intubation.
She underwent induction for anesthesia with propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl with blood pressure dropping from the systolic 90s to 60s.
ECG showed ST depressions in V3-6.
Cardiology was consulted in the PACU who felt that ST depressions were likely [**1-19**] demand ischemia from hypotension.
Repeat EKGs showed resolution of ST depressions.

**FINAL REPORT [**2102-4-14**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2102-4-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
IMAGING CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2102-4-12**]: PRE-PROCEDURE IMAGING: Limited unenhanced CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a macro-nodular contour of the liver with mild segmental atrophy in segment V consistent with known cirrhosis.
There is no ascites.
The known segment VIII liver lesion measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm is redemonstrated as a hypodense lesion (2:14).
The segment VI lesion is not well appreciated on non-contrast CT.
The lung bases demonstrate bilateral dependent atelectasis and mild middle lobe atelectasis.
The patient underwent induction of general anesthesia for the procedure.
After prepping the patient, and prior to beginning the procedure, the anesthesiologist noted ST depression on the monitor and the procedure was put on hold.
For information on general anesthesia course/medications administered, please see anesthesia notes.
IMPRESSION:  Cancelation of ultrasound/CT-guided radiofrequency ablation secondary to cardiac event during induction of general anesthesia.
Segment VIII liver lesion is visualized under ultrasound guidance.
The segment VI lesion was poorly visualized.
The planned radiofrequency ablation was terminated prior to beginning the procedure secondary to a cardiac event.
IMPRESSION:  Limited ultrasound guidance for planned radiofrequency ablation as above.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2102-4-13**] FINDINGS: There are bilateral basilar opacities, with some element of organization likely representing subacute pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities with organization, likely subacute pneumonia.
Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparant flow limiting coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 20% ostial lesion, and mild luminal irregularities leading into a 40% proximal-mid tubular lesion.
There was a possible intramyocardial segment of the LAD distally, and the distal LAD wrapped around the apex.
The LAD had slightly slow flow consistent with mild microvascular dysfunction.
The LCX was widely patent and supplied a large OM2, a large calibur OM4/LPL, a small LPL2, and a large left PDA.
There Lcx had slightly slow flow consistent with mild microvascular dysfunction.
Limted resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic arterial blood presure of 128/68 mmHg, and a mildly elevated LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
There was no gradient with careful pullback across the aortic valve.
No angiographically-apparant flow limiting coronary artery disease, with evidence of some athersclerosis and slightly slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
Medical therapy for coronary artery disease with aspirin, betablocker, statin, smoking cessasion, risk factor reduction.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC, osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of sedatives for intubation.
Her EKG was concerning for ST depressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponin elevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no angiographical flow limiting disease.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypotension: Pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic 60s, likely secondary to medications for induction.
Volume depletion was  likely another contributing factor as pt had been NPO since night prior to procedure and was fluid responsive in PACU.
She also received esmolol after she became tachycardic from glycopyrrolate.
Her bradycardia resolved over 24 hours.
# ST depressions: EKG showed ST depressions in lead V3-V6 that were new from prior, in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Her repeat EKG later showed resolution of ST depressions.
Pt was evaluated by cardiology who felt that ST depressions were likely from demand ischemia from hypotension and bradycardia.
She had a troponin elevation to Trop elevated to 0.32 with mild MB elevation to 8.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # HCC: Pt with HCV cirrhosis that is well-compensated (Childs [**Doctor Last Name 14477**] A).
She has no history of jaundice, encephalopathy, ascites, or esophageal varices.
# Osteoporosis: continued home raloxifene, calcium and vitamin D .
# Pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, however pt was clinically well and asymptomatic.
No antibiotics were started but would have low threshold to initiate treatment for pneumonia if pt develops symptoms.
Medications on Admission: alprazolam 0.25mg prn anxiety vitaminD2  1.25mg (50,000units) once weekly evista 60mg daily sumatriptan 50mg prn calcium with vitamin D 1250mg/1000units   Discharge Medications: 1. alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for anxiety.
5. sumatriptan succinate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for migraine.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: hypotension and bradycardia secondary to anesthesia  SECONDARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for a radiofrequency ablation, but had complications from the anesthesia so the procedure was stopped.
You required a short ICU stay for low blood pressure and a slow heart rate.
You had a heart catheterization to evaluate for any blockages in the heart, and this was normal.
