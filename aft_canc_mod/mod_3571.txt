His most recent PET scan showed persistent FDG avidity, minimally less than baseline in the distal esophagus, but no other areas of abnormality.
Past Medical History: Esophageal carcinoma s/p Chemotherapy Mild neuropathy Hypertension Diabetes - type II Hard-of-hearing BPH  PSH: [**2136-8-14**]: Right cephalic vein cut-down for placement of a double lumen Port-a-Cath, placement of a jejunostomy tube  Social History: He is a former but light cigar smoker when he was in his 30s.
No cigarettes or alcohol infrequently.
Physical Exam: General: 77 year-old male in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist, voice hoarse Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy Card:  normal S1,S2, regular, rate & rhythm, no murmur/gallop or rub Resp: decreased breath sounds otherwise clear bilaterally GI: bowel sounds positive, abdomen soft non-tender/non-distended Ext; warm no edema Incision: Neck clean dry intact with steri-strips, mid-abdomen well healed Neck wound: clean, small serous discharge, mild erythema Neuro: non-focal  Pertinent Results: [**2136-11-26**]: Pathology Tissue: pleural mass, pleural mass - not finalized  Chest radiograph of [**2136-11-28**].
No pneumothorax or right pleural effusion is present.
LV systolic function appears depressed, although in the presence of atrial fibrillation the left ventricular ejection fraction (at least moderately reduced) cannot be quantitated with certainty.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2136-12-3**] IR/SBFT & Video Oropharyngeal Swallow  FINDINGS: Optiray contrast media passes freely through the esophagus with a small amount of aspiration into the airway.
There is no evidence for anastomotic leak.
Ingestion of thick barium also shows small amount of aspiration with no anastomotic leak.
IMPRESSION: The two studies taken together, both the partial barium esophagram and video oropharyngeal swallow, show no anastomotic leak, mild aspiration improved with chin tuck, and vocal cord paresis.

Immediate postoperatively he was hypotensive and responded well to fluid boluses.
On postoperative day #1 he was extubated without difficulty.
He was found to have tachycardia with a heart rate in the 160's and his beta-blocker was restarted with a good response.
The chest-tube was placed on water-seal with moderated serosanguinous output.
He had good pain control with an epidural and PCA managed by the acute pain service.
He had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation and cardiology was consulted who recommended an echocardiogram, TSH, a diltiazem drip and metoprolol intravenous which was implemented.
He remained hemodynamically stable with burst of sinus rhythm and atrial flutter.
On postoperative day #4 the chest tube was removed and a chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.
The pain service removed the epidural and his pain was controlled with a PCA.
His foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.
He was found to have a left vocal cord immobility.
He was seen by speech for a video swallow which revealed mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced oral control.
On POD#9 patient became hypotensive with SBP in the 80's and went into atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 150s, he was bolused and had his medications staggered.
A CTA was also performed to rule out a pulmonary embolus which was negative, however a LLL effusion was noted.
The patient continued to have periodic episodes of atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin to decrease risk of stroke.
He remained afebrile and had no leukocytosis.
