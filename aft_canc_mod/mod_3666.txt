Admission Date:  [**2110-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-11-19**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Head bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation NG tube placement  History of Present Illness: 87 year-old man with a history of afib on coumadin, old stroke, HTN, rectal cancer transferred from [**Hospital3 7569**] with left posterior parietal bleed.
Reportedly no headache, nausea or vomiting.
It is not clear if pt had any other neurological symptoms, nor exactly how he had trouble talking.
According to medical record, pt had similar symptoms in [**Month (only) 404**], considered "TIA" at the time.
At OSH, BP 209/103 on arrival, had left facial droop and "expressive aphasia" but moved all extremities per ED note.
He was also given 4mg ativan  for agitation, loaded with 1gm dilantin, and started on labetalol gtt for blood pressure control, though BP remained elevated in 180s-200.
As labetalol was titrated, pt with increased wheezing so labetalol was stopped and pt started on nicardipine instead.
Additionally, he received lasix 40 IV x1 for increased crackles after getting the FFP.
Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin 2.
Report he has no residual deficits.
BPH s/p ablation 4.
HTN 5.
Rectal CA, dx'd [**2110**], s/p chemo/XRT but no resection.
He has no known mets.
Neck: Supple Lungs: Anterolaterally with lots of upper airway sounds CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmur.
2+ carotids without bruit Abd: Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Extr: No edema, warm  Neurologic Examination: s/p 4mg ativan Mental Status: Deeply somnolent, will wake to loud voice or noxious.
Occasional speech in response to command, perhaps mild dysarthria.
Mild right NLF flattening.
Toes withdrew bilaterally  Unable to assess coordination and gait given mental status.
CBC: 5.6/42.9/141 Coags: 17.6/36.5/2.2** Na 140 K 3.7 Cl 102 HCO3 27 BUN 15 Cr 1.0 Gluc 167 Ca 8.7 Mg 2.0 PO4 3.0  Head CT [**2110-10-12**]: ~3x5cm (over 7 slices, ~50cc) left posterior parietal bleed with edema and mass effect but no midline shift, no intraventricular extension.
Possible subarachnoid hemorrhage or contusion at R temporal lobe.
Head CT [**10-14**]: unchanged; evidence of mild brain atrophy and patchy decreased attenuation c/w microvascular angiopathy.
The left parietal hematoma measures 45 x 23 mm in size, with a thin rim of hypointensity on gradient echo images, consistent with a hemosiderin ring.
[**2110-11-3**] 08:48PM URINE Color-Yellow Appear-Clear Sp [**Last Name (un) **]-1.019 [**2110-11-3**] 08:48PM URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-7.0 Leuks-TR [**2110-11-3**] 08:48PM URINE RBC-0-2 WBC->50 Bacteri-FEW Yeast-OCC Epi-0-2  Brief Hospital Course: 87yo M h/o afib on coumadin, old stroke (stroke in '[**08**]; TIA in [**11-28**] and [**1-29**]), HTN, rectal cancer s/p XRT presented w/ acute L parietal bleed.
It was initially thought that his hemorrhage was due to amyloid angiopathy, especially given the location of the bleed.
Alternate etiologies were also considered such as coumadin use (INR 3.0 at admission) and hypertension (although this would cause more lacunar infarcts).
A repeat CT on [**10-13**] showed stable hemorrhage, and on [**10-14**], CT revealed a slight increase w/ very small extension into the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of L lateral ventricle.
Started seizure prophylaxis w/ dilantin - this was continued for one month, then, with no seizure activity during that time.
He has had slow improvement in his attentiveness and orientation, but son reports that after TIA in [**1-29**], pt was similarly confused and had generalized weakness - he could not walk or swallow.
From outside records ([**Hospital3 7569**]), pt has hx of stroke in [**2108**] and TIA in [**11-28**] and [**1-29**].
There was no evidence of hemorrhage, but his MRI showed extensive white matter ischemic disease.
The issue of re-starting coumadin was addressed, and although the risk for embolic stroke from his PAF remains elevated, the possibility of another ICH on coumadin was more concerning.
On one occasion, he was seen by the team and appeared to be staring to the right with head devation to the right, blinking, mouth open; although he was responsive to noxious stimuli (with grimace and moan) he did not respond to any verbal stimuli.
Levels should checked by rehab within one week of arrival, and dose increased or decreased accordingly.
An EEG was performed on [**11-17**] which revealed: "mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy manifest mainly by the slowing of the background frequency.
In addition, there is a cardiac arrhythmia."
He was continued on dilantin and had no recurrence of activity suspicious for seizures.
He has had documented low BP on anti-hypertensives in the past.
RESP: CXR initially showed mild pulmonary edema; was intubated for ?agitation and somnolence on [**10-14**].
On [**10-21**], CXR showed multifocal infiltrates c/w aspiration PNA after emesis [**10-20**].
After transfer to step-down, notable for multiple episodes of apnea while sleeping ([**3-6**] minute intervals lasting approx 15 seconds each).
He has no noted hx of OSA, but his symptoms were c/w this diagnosis.
Last CXR on [**11-3**] suggested resolution of both his pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia.
On 10/24th, several days after he had been tolerating tube feeds, he was found to have a low grade temperature and a cough.
Chest xray at that time showed a new left lower lobe infiltrate.
However, the patient's symptoms suggested new pneumonia, and he was started on Levaquin and Flagyl (initially Vancomycin, which was discontinued after two doses) to target gram negative and anaerobic pathogens.
His breathing pattern on [**11-18**] seemed to suggest a recurrence of [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], with high sats once again.
He failed the first swallow eval on [**10-29**], and also failed the most recent eval w/ video swallow on [**11-7**].
Repeated evaluations of swallow function, both at the bedside and by video showed no improvement.
NG tubes were repeatedly inserted and pulled by the patient during moments of confusion or discomfort.
ID: Pt was started on Levaquin [**10-15**] - [**10-21**] for question of aspiration pneumonia - now resolved.
Additionally, urine grew proteus mirabilis resistant to Levaquin and antibiotics were changed to Trimethoprim [**10-21**] by the ICU team.
He continues to have >50 WBC which may reflect chronic inflammation from XRT and TUNA for rectal CA and BPH, respectively.
Once again on [**11-17**] he had a low grade temperature and cough; cxr suggested pneumonia and he was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl for aspiration risk and lower suspicion resistant nosocomial pneumonia.
RENAL: Initially, he had an increased BUN to 43, which has since been normal or only mildly elevated.
Creatinine has been normal, thus this was not considered related to intrinsic renal disease.
Since then, electrolytes have stable, with signs of mild dehydration whenever his NG Tube has been out for more than one day.
His urine was positive for blood (x2), but his Hct remained stable and hematuria was attributed to manipulation of his bladder previously.
Coumadin was not restarted at the time of discharge, because of the intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 25759**] & Rehab Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: left posterior parietal lobe hemorrhage aspiration pneumonia urinary tract infection prior stroke, multiple TIAs hypertension atrial fibrillation h/o rectal cancer   Discharge Condition: stable, intermittently confused   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 15499**] has had new bleeding in your brain that could occur again should he take coumadin.
