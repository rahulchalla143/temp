- Tobacco: 25PY, quit [**2161**] - Alcohol: 3 drinks/wk, has been abstaining during chemo   Family History: Mother had lung cancer in her 60s.
Maternal grandfather also had a lung cancer and also was smoker.

Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Discharge: Vitals: T 99.2 HR 95 BP 128/96 O2sat 94% RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: obese, appropriately tender to palpation at midline incision, staple line clean, dry and intact.
Imaging TTE [**9-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied left ventricle with hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function.
No pneumothorax .
CXR [**9-26**]: post-extubation FINDINGS: bilateral atelectasis that is unchanged in extent.
Mild fluid overload might be present, no larger pleural effusions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate emphysema in the left upper lobe.
Stellate opacity in the left upper lobe may represent sequela of chronic change, however, focal lesion cannot be entirely excluded given history.
Bibasilar dependent atelectasis, left greater than right.
Concurrent infection in the left lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26075**] is a 58 y/o M with newly diagnosed rectal cancer s/p low anterior resection with end ileostomy whose intraoperative course was complicated by hypotension requiring continued intubation and care in the ICU.
An intra-operative ECHO at the time showed no pericardial effusion, embolus or other significant abnormality; EF was preserved at 75%.
A CT-angiogram of the chest also did not show any acute changes, including that of pulmonary embolus or other etiology to explain his intraoperative hypotension.
By system: Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA, TAP blocks (Pain service), and ativan with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV: As mentioned earlier, the patient developed intraoperative hypotension requiring pressors and 5L of crystalloid and 1L of albumin but was weaned off them soon thereafter with some residual tachycardia with normal blood pressure that resolved with beta-blockade.
As cited, his chest CT-angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.
He was extubated POD#1, and maintained good oxygen saturations on nasal cannula in the upper 90's as well as without additional O2 requirement upon discharge.
He initially experienced some lower urine output POD #3 but responded soon afterwards with a combination of auto-diuresis and a one-time dose of furosemide.
His foley was removed on POD#4, with no retention issues.
ID: The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection, no post-operative antibiotics were required.
However, the patient did not score significantly on his CIWA scale; he did not require any additional ativan besides that for his pain throughout his admission for withdrawal symptoms.
At the time of discharge on POD#5, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Disp:*90 Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2* 2. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
You were also able to manage your pain with oral pain medications.
Regarding bowel function and wound care:  You have a vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed with staples.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a fever.
Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.
You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication dilaudid.
Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol.
Ileostomy:  You have a new ileostomy.
If you find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office for advice.
The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output.
Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue.
If you notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe.
The stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched and this should subside with time.
The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact.
Monitor the skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed above.
