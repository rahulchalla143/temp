At the junction of segment VI and VII, there is a 3 x 2.7cm hypodensity c/w post-RFA changes.
Right replaced hepatic artery arising from SMA, accessory left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery and a segment IV artery arising from common hepatic artery.
Hepatocellular carcinoma, well differentiated, arising in a background of small cell dysplasia.
Background liver shows moderate predominantly macrovesicular steatosis.
Trichrome stain shows established cirrhosis with focal prominent sinusoidal fibrosis.
Iron stain shows moderate iron deposition in hepatocytes.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2176-9-6**], 64M with NASH cirrhosis and hx of HCC s/p RFA [**9-/2175**] with MELD of 28 admitted for liver transplant.
Hepatic duplex demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow and no ductal dilatation.
CXR demonstrated opacity at the right lung base, potentially associated with moderate pleural effusion.
Meropenem and Vancomycin were administed for empiric coverage.
On [**9-18**], torso CT was done to evaluate elevated LFTs.
This showed an irregular subcapsular hypodensity along the dome of right and left hepatic lobes extending down the posterior right lobe, concerning for infarction.
Small fluid collections extended around the IVC anastomosis and caudate.
On CT, right lower pulmonary lobe atelectasis and small effusion were noted.
Cytology noted rare very atypical epithelioid cells of uncertain significance.
He continued to require O2 nasal cannula and was given inhalers with slight improvement.
He had a couple of episodes of SOB at night that were felt to be related to volume overload.
Subsequent CXRs were notable for persistent RLL atelectasis.
Unchanged enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Review of CT by radiologist felt that enlargement of cardiac silhouette was  likely  due to mediastinal fat deposition.
He remained anuric and CVVHD continued until [**9-21**] then CVVH was switched to hemodialysis.
Nephrology felt that [**Last Name (un) **] was likely secondary to ischemic insult from transient hypotension requiring bolus doses of phenylephrine and/or blood loss.
LFTs decreased except the alk phos which remained elevated in the mid 300s.
Insulin pen needles Supply: solostar nano for qid injection.
