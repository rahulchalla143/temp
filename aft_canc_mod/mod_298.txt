Patient had hypertensive urgency with SBP 220s/120s at OSH requiring IV nicardipine infusion and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**11-6**] for assessment and admitted to the neuro ICU.
On admission, patient had a normal general and neurological examination with no papilledema.
Patient underwent workup for secondary causes of hypertension with normal fasting cortisol and normal TSH.

This was unremarkable save non-specific white matter changes on FLAIR which were felt possibly in keeping with Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**].
