She was in her USOH until [**7-12**] when she presented to [**Hospital6 **] with intermittent, L-sided chest pain.
She was treated for bronchitis with azithromycin.
She again presented to the ED on [**7-14**] with similar complaints and began taking ibuprofen for the pain.
Over the course of the past month she has experienced worsening sweating - at night and during the day, worsening fatigue, bilateral arm heaviness, easy bruising, and petechial rash on her arms and legs.
She presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with these complaints and CBC showed thrombocytopenia to 15 as well as lymphocytosis.
There was initially concern for ITP or rickettsial infection, but peripheral blood was sent for flow cytometry, which reportedly showed lymphoblasts.
At present, she complains of bilateral arm pain and pain in her back between her shoulder blades.

Gating on these cells demonstrates that these cells express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, and TdT, lymphoid associated antigens CD10, CD19 and CD20 along with CD71.
T cells comprise 63% of lymphoid-gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a decreased helper-cytotoxic ratio of 0.7:1 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
INTERPRETATION  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B-ALL).
Note: The morphologic findings on this core biopsy specimen combined with concurrent flow cytometry findings on peripheral blood (S11-33319M) are consistent with the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL).
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear:  The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears mildly increased.
A majority of circulating cells are variably sized, with moderately condensed to open chromatin, prominent nuclei, round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, scant amounts of basophilic cytoplasm and occasional coarse granules.
The smears are hypercellular with sheets of small to medium sized cells, with scant cytoplasm, smooth chromatin, prominent nucleoli and slightly irregular nuclear contours, morphologically consistent with blasts Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of two bone marrow core biopsies composed of trabecular bone with bone marrow elements, the overall cellularity is more than 95% and consists almost entirely of a monotonous population of variably-sized cells with round to regular nuclei, open chromatin and scant amount of cytoplasm.
Occasional atypical mitoses are seen in the neoplastic cells.
Rare scattered myeloid precursors, plasma cells and small erythroid islands are seen.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
However, due to the technically suboptimal nature of the acquired images, neither cardiac tamponade secondary to a loculated pericardial effusion nor a soft tissue mass causing right heart compression can be excluded on the basis of this study.
No CT evidence of an extrinsic compression on the atrium/right ventricle.
No pulmonary embolism  4.
Mild splenomegaly  EKG [**8-17**]: Afib with RVR  [**8-16**] Echocardiogram: Impression: Suboptimal image quality.
However, due to the technically suboptimal nature of the acquired images, neither cardiac tamponade secondary to a loculated pericardial effusion nor a soft tissue mass causing right heart compression can be excluded on the basis of this study.
A concurrent cytospin specimen reveals mostly a mixture of rare monocytes and small mature lymphocytes.

ALL: Patient had symptoms of night sweats, easy bruising, fatigue and initially chest pain and was diagnosed with ALL at OSH via flow cytometry.
At our hospital the diagnosis was confirmed via biopsy and flow cytometry, which were consistent with pre-B cell ALL negative for the [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome.
She tolerated it well with slight intermittant symptoms of headache, throat pain and nausea.
She was given acyclovir and fluconazole for infection prophylaxis while neutropenic and received a 10-day course of IV cefepime for fever on admission that was culture-negative.
She was discharged on day 20 of the protocol having regained her cell counts to a granulocyte count of 1205.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient experienced new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR in the hospital after a placement of a central line.
CT showed potential area of leukemic infiltrate in the right mediastinum.
Patient's line  was changed over the wire, as irritation from the line was a likely explaination for atrial fibrillation.
