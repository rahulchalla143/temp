History of Present Illness: 71 yo man with severe COPD on oxygen at baseline, new dx of NSCLC and recnet GIB who was transferred here on [**6-6**] for treatment of SC lung CA via photodynamic therapy, now with GIB.
Briefly, his OSH course began in late [**Month (only) 958**] when he was admitted for COPD exacerbation.
He was dc'd on [**5-13**] but returned on [**5-17**] with increased SOB, secretions, hypoxia and rapid afib.
During his hospital course he was found to have RLL PNA and tx with levaquin, zosyn, tobramycin nebulizers and high dose steriods.
He had a bronch on [**5-20**] with b/l mucoid impacation and endobronchial lesion.
On [**5-28**] he had repeat bronch showing RUL endobronchial lesion and biopsy demonstrating NSCLC.
[**Last Name (un) **] on [**5-31**] shoued large sigmoid polyp that was not removed, diffuse diverticulosis, multiple small polyps and no active bleed.
Here he underwent the first 2 portions of photodynamic therapy ([**6-8**] and [**6-10**]) and was awaiting debridement when he developed BRBPR and tachycardia on the morning of [**6-11**].
He began to get anxious, respiratory rate increased and he became hypertensive to 170/110 with HR in the 140s.
He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, fevers or chills.
Has a cough that has been present for 11 yrs.
Also c/o 40 lb wt loss in the past 5 weeks.
Past Medical History: severe COPD (O2 dependent at home) chronic multidrug-resistant pseudomonas colonization bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis common variable immune deficiency tx IVIG q2wks thrombocytopenia s/p LGI bleed [**2163-5-30**], s/p colonoscopy [**5-31**] as above herpes labialis asthma h/o rapid a fib (on coumadin-currently held) h/o prior episode of SVT   Social History: Quit smoking 8 yrs ago.
Has two erythematous scabbing lesions on his lip.
Neck: supple, no LAD, no carotid bruits CV: RRR, nl s1, s2, difficult to hear over breath sounds PULM: coarse breath sounds b/l, with exp wheezes and rhonchi.
Possible crackles at the bases b/l.
PSYCH: appropriate affect   Pertinent Results: OSH pathology: [**5-31**] [**Last Name (un) **]: tubulovillous adenoma [**5-28**] bronch RUL brush cytology: malignant cells, NSCLC, likely squamous cell carcinoma [**5-28**] RUL washing cytology: suspicious for malignancy, severely atypical squamous cells c/w high grade dysplasia/squamous cell carcinoma [**5-28**] path RUL biopsy: makedly atypical squamous epithelium c/w high grade dysplasia or SCC in situ [**5-28**] bronch cxL few pseudomonas resistant to gent, cefepime, tobramycin, fortaz, levaquin, cipro, zosyn and amikacin.
Negative examination for endotracheal or endobronchial lesions in the central bronchi.
Moderate emphysema.
Extensive severe, purulent bronchiectasis in both lungs.
One bronchiectatic segment with nodular peribronchial inflammation and nodularity, could represent a bronchogenic carcinoma or nodular inflammation.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries and major neck vessels.
6.Large likely simple renal cysts arising from the kidney for which a dedicated ultrasound examination is recommended.
7.Liver lesions too small to characterize on this examination.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-6-22**] SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is no change in appearance of underlying pattern of emphysema with bilateral lower lung ring shadows consistent with bronchiectasis.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion or infectious consolidation.

1 Non small cell lung cancer: He has known COPD and bronchiectasis but was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] with a new RUL mass c/w NSCLC for which he received photodynamic therapy.
He had continuing melena and bright red blood here despite holding coumadin and aspirin, with intermittent decrease in hematocrit requiring blood transfussions.
He had a recent colonoscopy at the outside hospital prior to transfer which showed a polyp and diverticuli.
This improved during his course suggesting improving consumption from bleeding possibly.
He also had leukopenia during his course but this improved by time of discharge and was thought possibly related to his CVID.
4 Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine but this improved to creatinine of 0.8 by discharge.
5 Atrial fibrilation: He remained in NSR and rate controlled on short-acting diltiazem 60mg qid.
7 Hyperglycemia: He was noted to have elevated blood sugar on prednisone so was given a diabetic diet and covered with sliding scale insulin for control of his sugars.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Ten (10) ML Intravenous once a day as needed for line flush.
