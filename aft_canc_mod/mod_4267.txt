He reports wine-coloured stools for the past couple of days.
He has been worked up over the past 2 weeks for anemia and iron deficiency.
He has previously had EGDs and C-scopes that showed no lesions.
Recent EGD [**2199-11-7**] showed chronic gastritis but no source of bleeding.
He was sent home but continued to have bloody bowel movements.
On [**11-9**], He complained of dizziness, abdominal cramps and wine-coloured stools.
A tagged RBC scan at [**Hospital 792**]Hospital showed a potential bleeding source in the proximal jejunum.
Due to his significant GI bleed and question of hemodynamic stability, he was admitted to the ICU.
In the ICU, he complains of some lower abdominal cramping and foul-smelling dark maroon stools.
He denies fevers, chills, difficulty breathing, chest pain, changes in urinary function or lower extremity swelling.
He denies any history of hematemesis or hemoptysis and reports a normal colonoscopy in [**2198**].
He states this is the first time he has ever had GI bleeding of this kind.

GI BLEED- The likely source of Mr. [**Known lastname 83978**] bleed was upper given nature and description of melenic stools and evidence of source at proximal jejunum on tagged RBC scan.
Possible causes of bleed include peptic ulcer disease and NSAID-induced gastritis from aspirin use, radiation enteritis from treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (although he was treated in [**2164**]), recurrent lymphoma and arteriovenous malformations.
In the ICU, he had decreasing hematocrits and one melenic bowel movement.
Gastroenterology service was notified of his admission and general surgery was also contact[**Name (NI) **] so they could be aware of any potential hemodynamic changes that would warrant surgical intervention.
Enteroscopy did not reveal source of bleed (just showed nodular stomach from old XRT) and bleeding was thought to be due to an ateriorvenous malformation that had blanched out.
He underwent colonoscopy on [**11-14**] which also did not reveal a bleeding source.
He had grade III internal hemorrhoids and a few polyps on colonoscopy.
He was instructed to take 81mg of aspirin instead of 325mg due to bleeding risk.
Aspirin and home anti-hypertensive regimen were held on admission due to GI bleed and close monitoring of hemodynamic instability.
HYPERTENSION- Diltiazema and Toprol XL were held to active GI bleeding in order to better characterize volume loss and reciprocal tachycardia in response to hypotension.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: GI bleed SECONDARY: coronary artery disease, hypertension   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure being involved in your care, Mr. [**Known lastname 83977**].
You were admitted to the ICU for GI bleeding and had an enteroscopy to try to figure out the source of bleeding.
The exact source of bleeding was not found, and thought to be due to an AVM (arteriovenous malformation).
We initially held your blood pressure medications because of GI bleeding.
Call your doctor or 911 if you experience crushing chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers/chills, intractable nausea or vomiting, dizziness from massive blood loss or severe bleeding in your urine vomit or stool or any other concerning medical problem.
