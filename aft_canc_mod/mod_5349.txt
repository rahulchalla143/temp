History of Present Illness: 46-year-old gentleman with locally advanced lung cancer who status post chemotherapy and XRT neoadjuvant therapy.
Of note the patient's surgery was recently postponed due to a fever and cough.

Sequence of changes is consistent with developing radiation fibrosis which may also explain a region of consolidation projecting over the mid thoracic spine seen on the lateral view, but this area could represent a bacterial infection.
A right upper lobe mass is smaller than it was on [**9-3**] but size measurements are not practical, still at least 5 cm in greatest diameter.
Right apical pleural thickening and fullness in the right paratracheal mediastinum are concerning for local tumor extension, but best evaluated by CT scanning.
No disc herniations are identified.
There is no abnormal signal or enhancement identified within the cord.
Within the right upper lobe in the right peritracheal region, there is a large heterogeneously enhancing mass with an apparent necrotic center.
There is also abnormal soft tissue in the subcarinal region, which probably represents lymphadenopathy.
There does not appear to be involvement of the adjacent vertebral bodies.
No evidence of abnormality within the thoracic spine.
Large necrotic right upper lobe mass with lung consolidation inferiorly and probable subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
Two right-sided chest tubes with suspected small right apical pneumothorax unchanged.
Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues again noted  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2165-10-6**] 9:00 AM  Compared with one day earlier, there is new blunting of the right costophrenic angle, without significant interval change.
Again seen is an elevated right hemidiaphragm and shift of the mediastinum to the right, with pleural fluid/thickening tracking along the right chest wall, right apex, and medial aspect of the upper right mediastinum.
Focal lucency and fluid level at the right lung apex is compatible with a small hydropneumothorax, unchanged.
There is considerable subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall, also unchanged.
The left lung remains grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis/scarring at the left base.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
He continued to have a cough prior to surgery, but was otherwise afebrile and felt well.
A right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed via a thoracotomy on [**9-30**] without complication.
He had an epidural placed pre-operatively that ceased to work for pain relief and he was converted to a PCA for pain control on POD1.
Post-operatively he was noted to have slightly increasing subcutaneous emphysema.
The chest tubes were left in place on water seal and his subcutaneous emphysema and a small stable pneumothorax remained stable and eventually decreased somewhat.
He complained of moderately increasing right chest wall pain on POD4&5 and his pain medications were adjusted accordingly when chest x-rays revealed no underlying pathology.
His chest tubes were discontinued POD5 without complication.
He was noted to have a gradual development of a post-operative anemia and was transfused on POD2 for a HCT of 21.2.
He developed a fever in the midst of his transfusion and this was stopped immediately and investigated for a transfusion reaction.
Cultures taken at that time were also negative for an infectious source.
He was started on oxycontin for a longer acting pain relief and this seemed to alleviate his pain except on his first movements from a stationary position.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for constipation.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sustained Release Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for pain for 3 weeks.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day: Take to prevent constipation while on pain medicine.
Please call if you are experiencing any increasing shortness of breath, if your pain significantly increases or changes in character, if you have any fevers or chills, or have any other symptoms that concern you.
