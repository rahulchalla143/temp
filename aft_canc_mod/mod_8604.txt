There is surrounding vasogenic edema resulting in local sulcal effacement as well as effacement of the occipirtal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
The mass has a dense rim and is centrally hypodense aside from a hyperdense central focus (series 2, image 21) concerning for intralesional hemorrhage.
There is no significant shift of midline structures.
There are no additional masses identified on this noncontrast CT.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and soft tissues appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Right parietal lobe mass with central hyperdense focus concerning for hemorrhage.
MRI Head [**9-14**]: A large necrotic right frontoparietal mass is unchanged measuring approximately 3.1 x 4.6 cm in size with mass effect on the ipsilateral ventricle and surrounding edema.
The edema extends into the splenium of the corpus callosum.
No other lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: Large necrotic mass in the right parietal lobe.
Differential would include metastatic disease or abscess.
MRI Head [**9-15**]: FINDINGS: There has been no significant change in appearance of the heterogeneously enhancing mass within the right parietal lobe.
There is signal abnormality within the adjacent white matter may reflect vasogenic edema versus tumor infiltration.
There is a similar degree of associated mass effect.
No additional lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: Limited post-contrast examination demonstrates no significant interval change in the appearance of the heterogeneously enhancing mass centered within the right parietal lobe.
Head CT [**9-15**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post right posterior craniotomy with underlying pneumocephalus and pneumocephalus layering non-dependently along the right frontal vertex.
Below the craniotomy site at the site of prior tumor is surgical packing material containing multiple locules of air.
In the right posterior vertex (2:25) is a 7 x 5 mm focus of hyperdensity and a trace linear region of hyperdensity (2:11).
No other foci of hemorrhage are present.
The prior tumor resection site has persistent white matter hypodensity reflecting edema which appears stable since the preoperative examination.
There is no midline shift or herniation.
No evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction.
The visualized paranasal sinuses, ethmoid, and mastoid air cells appear clear.
Otherwise, the surgical resection site contains multiple locules of air likely secondary surgical packing material.
There is persistent edema of the white matter, unchanged.
Pneumocephalus underlying the craniotomy site and layering along the right frontal convexity.
No herniation or midline shift.
There is new restricted diffusion in the superior right parietal lobe medially and surrounding the operative bed which could represent cytotoxic edema versus ischemia relating to surgery.
IMPRESSION: Post-op changes in the right parietal lobe with evaluation limited due to blood products.
Nonetheless, there does appear to be small amount of residual neoplasm along the anterior aspect of the operative bed.
Restricted diffusion in the medial superior parietal lobe and surrounding the operative cavity which could represent post-op cytotoxic edema versus ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2180-9-13**] following an episode of headache and clumsiness, and increased falls.
The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass with the goal of palliative mass effect and tissue diagnosis.
Her post-operative MRI revealed a gross total resection of the parietal mass.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for fungal infection.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-14**] days (from your date of surgery) for a wound check.
