There is large soft tissue hematoma-laceration in the subcutaneous tissue of the left frontoparietal region.
A left parotid lesion measuring approximately 2.5 cm is seen and better assessed on prior studies.
Small right frontal acute temporoparietal extra-axial, likely subdural hemorrhage.
Small acute posterior subfalcine subdural hemorrhage layering along the right tentorial leafleft.
Stable lesions within the left parotid gland characterized as likely a venolymphatic malformation on last MRI brain from [**2100-1-19**].

No discrete acute fracture is seen.
There are multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine.
Posterior to vertebral bodies of  C5-C6, there is a large osteophyte impinging on the thecal sac anteriorly.

Imaged portion of the lung apices show scarring in the left lung apex.
Similar lesion within the left parotid gland seen on multiple prior studies.
No discrete acute fracture is seen.
Thin lucent line at C2 base can relate to artifact/osteopenia or very minimal fracture without displacement of the fragments.
C5-C6 level large posterior osteophyte impinging on the thecal sac and deforming the cord.
Thin lucent line between the osteophyte and vertebral body may relate to the orientation; however, trauma related changes cannot be excluded as no recent priors are available.correlate clinically to decide on the need for further workup.
Stable lesion within the left parotid gland seen on multiple prior studies, characterized as likely a venolymphatic malformation.
Scarring in the left lung apex.
Scattered small lymph nodes are seen in the bilateral axilla, mediastinum, and hila, however, with interval decrease in size compared to last CT from [**2101-12-9**].
There are mild coronary artery calcifications.

CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of solid organs is suboptimal due to lack of IV contrast.
Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.
Diffuse wall thickening is seen in the stomach from known lymphoma.
There is a persistent bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter to the level of the retroperitoneal mass with associated stranding.
No free air is seen.

[**2101-12-21**]   Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no significant change in thickness or extent of the relatively thin right frontotemporoparietal region subdural hematoma, with little mass effect (2:12).
Additional subdural hematoma along the right portion of the posterior falx is slightly decreased in size, possibly related to redistribution over the right leaflet of the tentorium cerebelli.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Mucosal thickening is seen within the right maxillary sinus.
The orbits are grossly unremarkable aside from evidence of bilateral ocular lens surgery.
As before, there is a left frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma, unchanged in overall extent.
Additionally, more edema is evident in the right frontoparietovertex subgaleal scalp (2:16).
No significant interval change in the extent of subdural hematoma overlying the right cerebral convexity.
No new intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute large vascular territorial infarction.
No shift of midline structures or central herniation.

Once again noted is a prominent disc osteophyte causing moderate but non-critical stenosis of the vertebral canal, abutting the spinal cord at the C5-C6 level.
There is no marked change in the prevertebral soft tissues.
No acute interval change to explain patient's symptoms.
If there is continued clinical concern, MRI of the neck is recommended for evaluation of the neural structures or ligamentous injury to the spine.
Several vertebral body lucencies in the cervical spine, new from [**2100**], which may be related to the patient's osteopenia; however, evaluation with MRI is recommended due to the patient's history of leukemia.
There is nonocclusive thrombus seen in the right basilic vein which is a superficial vein.
There is no thrombus seen in the deep veins which demonstrate normal flow, compressibility and augmentation.
There is no abscess or fluid collection seen.

Right temporal SDH Noted on OSH CT head, confirmed here by radiology in the ED.
A third CT head/neck was performed on [**12-24**] (unchanged) when she c/o worsening L-sided headache and vertigo with neck flexion.
Neurosurgery re-evaluated but felt no intervention necessary given lack of focal exam findings and serial head CT stable x3.
Pain controlled with home lyrica TID + PRN percoset.
#C-SPINE INTRAVERTEBRAL LUCENCIES Neuroradiology did note some abnormal lucency within cervical vertebral bodies on all CT exams, which were stable but new since imaging in [**2100**], ddx included lymphoma vs osteopenia.
#RIGHT ARM CELLULITIS Noted at former PICC site; patient reported redness and swelling on admission.
Given exam findings of erythema and induration centered upon former PICC insertion sites, she was started on vancomycin.
Doppler US of the R arm ruled out DVT or abscess, but confirmed superficial phlebitis which was consistent with exam.
A repeat doppler of the PICC site itself reveal a small fluid collection that was too small to drain per surgery.
The patient was afebrile for over 1 week prior to discharge.
#ELEVATED PMN COUNT WBC acutely elevated from 6 to 23 on HD2 at time of transfer from TSICU to BMT floor, for which the differential included infection (PICC site cellulitis and/or UTI) but most likely reflects delayed response to neulasta received in outpatient clinic the week prior to admission.
The patient's WBC remained elevated into the 20 until a few days prior to discharge, which likely reflected the neulasta .
# UTI/URINARY INCONTINENCE Admission UCx grew coag-negative Staph >100K.
This was her second UTI in past 2 weeks, different organism; due for outpatient urology follow-up studies for ongoing unexplained urinary incontinence (which had resolved prior to admission, per patient report) and hydronephrosis/hydroureter.
She had been scheduled for functional bladder studies/cystoscopy in urology outpatient clinic but missed these appointments during this admission.
Patient did report improved daytime bladder control during interim at home, possibly due to interval improvement in size of retroperitoneal mass after CHOP as seen on admission CT abd/pelvis.
Repeat urine culture showed no growth.
# NONDISPLACED R RADIAL STYLOID FRACTURE Noted on outside hospital imaging.
Pain controlled with TID lyrica + PRN percoset.
#HX CONFUSION PRIOR TO ADMISSION This may have been the precipitating cause for her injuries.
Potential causes include infection (R arm cellulitis, UTI), hyponatremia, and/or side effects of steroids received during last admission.
#DLBCL Discovered on EGD workup for anemia prior to last admission.
Started CHOP without rituxan during that admission, tolerated it without complications.
CT torso performed during trauma workup in the ED here revealed interval decrease in size of diffuse adenopathy and interval decrease in size of retroperitoneal mass, no change in peri-cervical mass.
No recurrence.
Dyslipidemia Continued holding home simvastatin.
History of gastritis: [**Month (only) **] EGD showed nonbleeding ulcers in fundus and antrum.
Likely due to SIADH in setting of head trauma, but also may have pre-dated head trauma and therefore possibly contributed to confusion/fall.
Diabetic diet.
No notable hyperglycemia (much improved since last admission when taking steroids).
# Hx ARF Creatinine clearance wnl during this admission.
Did have brief elevation of creatinine of unknown etiology, urine lytes were indicative of intrinsic renal disases.
NEEDS UROLOGY FOLLOW-UP RESCHEDULED, FOR CYSTOSCOPY & FUNCTIONAL BLADDER STUDIES PLANNED PRIOR TO ADMISSION TO FURTHER WORK UP URINARY INCONTINENCE.
