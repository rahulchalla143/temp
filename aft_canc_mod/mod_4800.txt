The patient reports that he has been feeling short of breath for several months.
When he left the hospital last [**Month (only) 116**], he was short of breath, and this has been worsening since then.
He reports that his excercise tolerance has worsened progressively since being discharged from the hospital.
He feels short of breath with mininal exertion.
He denies any acute worsening in his breathing, and reports that it has been progressive.
He denies chest pain, palpations.
has cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion.
reports 10 pounds of unintentional recent weight loss.
Attempt was made to put him in 6l NC, but he became tachpyneic and [**Last Name (LF) 52536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] is now back on NRB.
- Hypercholesterolemia.
- Hypertension.
- Carotid stenosis status post bilateral CEA - Barrett's esophagus.

Lives with wife  Family History: parents had MIs in old age.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.2 BP: 98/56 P: 85 R: 25 18 O2: 95% on NRB General: Alert, oriented, clearly short of breath with speaking  HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: mostly Clear to auscultation bilaterally, rhonchi clear with cough.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: b/l edema left worse than right.
Acute PE involving right main/branch and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries.
No evidence of right heart strain.
Diffuse bilateraly pulmonary ground-glass opacities may be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS, although infection/inflammation or hemorrhage not excluded.
Superimposed infarction cannot be excluded.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities most likely represent infection or inflammation; however, the differential diagnosis also includes pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or superimposed infarction.
Persistent pulmonary embolism involving the right main pulmonary artery extending into the right middle and lower lobes but with no evidence of right heart strain.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Clots in left external iliac vein, right common femoral, and left common femoral veins.
Hypodensity in the upper pole of the right kidney is most consistent with a renal cyst.
Bilateral hypodensities are too small to characterize but likely represent renal cysts.
Attempt was made to put him in 6 L NC, but he became tachpyneic and [**Last Name (LF) 52536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he went back on a non-rebreather.
