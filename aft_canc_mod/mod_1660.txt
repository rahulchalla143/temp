Pertinent Results: Summary of Studies: CXR [**9-11**]: likely aspiration event CTA [**8-26**], [**8-24**]: no evidence of PE, nodules c/w possible metastasis Abdominal CT [**8-24**]: intraabdominal collection of fluid with pelvic  collections decreased [**8-10**] ileogram: no communication between abdominal collection and ileal conduit [**8-8**] CT abd: loculated intraabdominal fluid collection [**2142-8-1**] DVT LE: negative [**7-24**] CT abd: Large collection of gas and debris in the deep pelvis concerning for anastomotic leak, but leakage of oral contrast material has not been demonstrated.
[**7-24**] ECHO: EF >55%, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 31326**], trivial MR, borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension [**7-21**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation, extensive ST-T changes  Pathology: 1.
Uterus/cervix: Poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma (similar to prior biospy of cholangiocarcinom) extensively involving walls of uterus and cervix, bilateral parametria, peritubal and periureteral soft tissues, and vaginal cuff.
Bladder/Rectum/LN(3)/Pelvic side wall tumor: no evidence of malignancy.

When fit for extubation, she had no complications.
She developed metabolic alkalosis on lasix gtt (used to decrease bowel edema prior to closure) without any significant untoward effects.
Two CTA studies to evaluate for PE were negative.
Pulmonary nodules possibly c/w metastatic disease were seen on multiple studies.
On [**2142-7-24**], CT revealed collection at rectal anastomosis.
In abscence of signs of peritonitis, she was managed conservatively with IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin/Metronidazole), NPO, and TPN for approximately 3 weeks.
A new fluid collection developed in the right abdomen.
A low residue diet was attempted but patient continued to have vomiting and therefore returned to OR for ostomy for stool diversion.
Pt was followed by general surgery after ileostomy for managment of her abdominal wound dressings including a vac dressing.
Abdominal fistulas with drainage of feculent material devloped on POD#6.
Necrotic tissue on the wound was noted.
The alloderm closure had multiple defects.
A modified low suction vacuum dressing was applied with occlusive dressing to aid in keeping wound area clean from fecal drainage.
No overt signs of sepsis (hemodynamically stable, WBC stable, low grade fever only, blood culture NGTD).
However, given multiple fistulas and no effective surgical/medical management, hospice services were offered and palliative care consult obtained.
4) GU: Initially elevated creatinine returned to baseline level of 0.9 by POD#9.
Peritoneal fluid collection developed near urostomy site (see above).
Loopogram and repeated creatinine levels of drained fluid were not consistent with a urostomy leak.
5) ID: Patient received levofloxacin and metronidazole for empiric coverage in setting of rectal anastomotic leak.
Vancomycin was started on [**9-3**] for enterococcus in fluid from abdomen and increased WBC.
Laboratory studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
8) Mental Status changes: Pt was confused and disoriented on [**2142-9-9**].
TSH elevated 27 and possible aspiration as described above.
Pain controlled on oxycodone, lexapro, ativan, and prn SL morphine at time of discharge to hospice.
Disp:*60 Tablet, Rapid Dissolve(s)* Refills:*1*  Hospice medication rx provided separately - include anxiety, pain and nausea meds.
