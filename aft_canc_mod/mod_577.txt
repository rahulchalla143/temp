4 Ill-defined hypodensities within the liver, which may represent irregular fatty infiltration.
Sclerosis and thickening of the left ileum, which may represent Paget's disease.
No ST changes or Q waves.
CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process, left base with atelectasis .

# Septic Shock: Etiology of septic shock was likely VRE urosepsis and MRSA pneumonia, with positive urine culture and positive sputum culture.
CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for an intraabdominal source.
He was intubated, received one dose of hydrocort, and was supported hemodynamically with Levophed (dopamine pressor was changed to levophed, since dopamine was not working well).
The patient was weaned off the ventilator, with RSBI<80, and was extubated without complication on [**2183-1-22**].
[**Name (NI) **] on discharge is for ceftazidime and linezolid to continue for 6 more days, to treat VRE in the urine and MRSA in the sputum.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was hypoxic in the ED, with sats to 77%.
CXR and CT chest showed a LLL pneumonia with effusion, with mild volume overload.
# Renal failure: Patient's baseline Cr is 1.5.
Renal failure was mild, due to ATN due to hypotension (FENA was > 1.0), and improved with fluids and improving hemodynamics.
Spun urine had no remarkable sediment or casts.
# Transaminitis: LFTs were in the 1000s, and were trending down each day.
CT abdomen did not reveal any significant findings necessitating intervention.
# Neurologic status: CT head was negative, with findings of a chronic pituitary macroadenoma causing panhypopituitarism.
The patient was maintained on levothyroxine and was given one dose of stress dose steroids.
# Low voltage EKG: TTE showed no pericardial effusion.
Patient was monitored with no cardiac complication, and with recovering BP over time.
# Nutrition, DVT prophylaxis, Lines: Patient was on TF, PPI IV, and pneumoboots, since no heparin was used.
Patient had a RIJ and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] placed during admission.
Specifically, the HCP does not want the patient given shocks or surgery.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic shock due to VRE urosepsis and MRSA pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Stable, vitals are stable, patient is afebrile and at baseline mental status.
