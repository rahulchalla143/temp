Admission Date:  [**2105-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-4-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-4-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, shortness of breath, NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Intubation Transfusion of packed RBC Bronchoscopy with BAL Central line placement  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo woman with PMH DM (poor compliance) who was initially admitted to [**Location (un) **] [**2105-3-21**] with c/o "high blood sugars".
Also noted to have CP and SOB.
Patient is poor historian, but states chest pain located in center of chest, unable to characterize or identify strength of pain, came on at rest while she was at home, associated with SOB.
She denies having this chest pain before, denies recent angina or DOE symptoms, LE edema, PND, orthopnea.
However, per daughter, she states that the patient has been c/o SOB x past month, described as DOE.
Daughter denies that patient has been having chest pain.
On admission, she also ruled for NSTEMI with Trop=7.46, and was also noted to have ARF with elevated Cr=4, which was thought [**2-19**] hypovolemia from diuresis from elevated blood sugars.
She was started on an insulin drip with good control of blood sugars, started on plavix, aspirin, heparin, statin and beta blocker for her NSTEMI.
Patient was noted to have elevated LFTs during hospital course, and therefore lipitor was d/ced (although thought elevated LFTs could also have been [**2-19**] shock liver as patient was hypotensive on initial admission).
She had episode of SOB on floor for which she received 40mg IV lasix with good UOP and resolution of symtpoms.
On [**2105-3-24**] patient underwent dobutamine stress test that was stopped due to SOB and CP, decreased O2 sat to 85%, TWI in lead II and III.
On arrival to cath lab, patient noted to have diffuse b/l crackles, increased O2 requirement, inablitity to lay flat.
Currently patient denies CP/pressure, SOB, feels "tired", no other complaints.
Past Medical History: DM COPD, steroid dependent Lung CA s/p rescection (LUL lobectomy) anxiety GERD   Social History: smokes 1ppd x 40years, no EtOH, no drug use, lives with son in [**Name (NI) 1157**] per patient.

# Respiratory:  Patient presented w/ evidence of CHF, with crackles on exam, CXR c/w CHF.
Also w/ hx of COPD, steroid dependent.
However, on admission, patient was diuresed > 5L but continued to be hypoxic and eventually required intubation.
Chest CT [**3-27**] demonstrates interstitial septal thickening and ground glass opacities in R lung c/w pulm edema vs pulm hemorrhage vs acute interstitial pna vs lymphegenic carcinomatosis, L hilar finding ?recurrent ca vs scar.
Again, unclear etiology of her underlying pulmonary process, as no clinical evidence of volume overload or apparent cause of flash pulmonary edema, on broad spectrum abx w/ vanc, aztreonam and clindamycin, and on [**Date Range 3782**] steroid dose of pred 10mg qd for COPD.
Bronch [**4-7**] BAL for cytology + for highly atypical cells, suspicious for sq cell carcinoma, remainder of micro negative (PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/Cx, AFB, fungal, legionella, nocardia).
Patient was evaluted for IP thoracentesis of R sided effusion to confirm malignant effusion.
There was also a possibilty of VATS vs trans-bronchial bx in future.
The etiology of her PEA arrests remained uncertain with hypoxia being most likely diagnosis.
Patient was subsequently started on morphine drip for comfort as she became bradycardic and hypotensive on AM of [**2105-4-18**].
Patient subsequently expired after she became asystolic due to presumed cardiac failure and superimposed renal failure on 9:56 am on [**2105-4-18**] .
# Lung ca s/p resection:  Is possible ?recurrent lung ca contributing to SOB sxs.
CXR on admission demonstrates L hilar mass c/w recurrent lung ca vs adenopathy vs scar from radiation.
# Renal:  Patient had ARF at outside hosptial, thought pre-renal given elevated glucose at 1200 and osmotic diuresis.
Throughout hospital course thus far, pt developed contrast induced nephropathy following first cath, with Cr peak = 3.5.
Patient also w/ continued hematuria w/ blood tinged urine - was on CBI, now d/ced per urology recs.
CK peak for NSTEMI was 647.
During code on [**2105-4-5**], pt developed ST elevations diffusely which quickly resolved.
Pump:  Patient presented with clinical evidence of CHF, with bilateral crackles, LE edema, EF=40% per OSH ECHO.
Likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Recent ECHO showed no change in EF at 45%.
component of diastolic dysfxn.
Intra cath following code on [**4-5**], PCWP=16, mildly elevated L and R filling pressures.
However, pt became increasingly tachycardic, sinus tachy.
O/n [**4-1**] pt transiently went into AFib - started amio load and gtt, and pt remains in and out of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Patient went into PEA arrest while down in IR having her PICC line repositioned on [**2105-4-13**].
Patient brought back to MICU, echo revealed increasing right-sided dysfunction, however, EKG not consistent with right heart strain.
D. Pericardial rub:  pericardial rub appreciated on ascultation on [**3-29**] - cardiac enzymes sent that demonstrated no elevation.
EKG demonstrates diffuse ST elevation and PR depression c/w pericarditis.
ECHO demonstrates no pericardial effusion.
Likley [**2-19**] ICU setting, renal failure.
# Elevated Alk phos and LDH:  Unclear etiology.
Have remained stable-y elevated throughout hospital course.
# ?Adrenal insufficiency:  Patient started on fludricort and hydrocort (stress dose steroids) at OSH - per notes, believed to be adrenally insufficient due to hypotension despite IVF boluses.
No record of cortisol level at OSH.
Plan to: - will attempt to contact [**Name (NI) 3782**] provider for more information regarding this diagnosis - on fludricort as [**Name (NI) 3782**] for orthostatic hypotension, on 10mg pred QD as [**Name (NI) 3782**], No hx of adrenal insufficiency.
# Depression:  continue citalopram .
# hyponatremia - likely SIADH in setting of pulmonary process.
