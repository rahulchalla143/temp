Admission Date:  [**2180-10-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-6-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Iodine / Codeine / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31685**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from IP for management of metastatic melanoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracic Pigtail tube placement for pleural effusion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old woman with history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) 10834**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1105**] melanoma who is transferred from the IP service for treatment of metastatic melanoma.
She initially presented in [**2180-9-8**] with relatively acute onset wheezing and dyspnea.
She was seen in consultation in melanoma clinic, where it was determined that she did not qualify for IL-2 or any ongoing studies given her poor respiratory status.
Her breathing continued to deteriorate, and she developed orthopnea and small amount of hemoptysis.
She was seen by the interventional pulmonologist for evaluation for possible stenting, but was unable to tolerate the procedure; she was admitted to the IP service for further management of her hypoxia and dyspnea.
She was found to have a left pleural effusion; a pigtail catheter was placed and drained 2000cc of exudative fluid, thought likely to be malignant.
She had a chest CT which showed a large loculated pleural effusion (with pigtail catheter in place), extensive right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and multiple pulmonary nodules.
A V/Q scan demonstrated low probability of pulmonary embolism.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY: - Diagnosed in [**2169**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) 10834**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1105**] melanoma in [**2165**] with wide incision - Developed right inguinal lymphadenopathy, s/p right radicular inguinal dissection with positive lymph nodes, complicated by post op skin infection requiring debridement - No further therapy of melanoma at that time - Bronchial washings from [**2180-9-29**] were positive for malignant cells, consistent with metastatic melanoma; carinal lesion biopsy form [**2180-10-3**] demonstrated malignant melanoma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Hypertension - Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus - ITP s/p splenectomy - Right knee replacement  Social History: 40 pack year history, quit [**2170**].
Family History: Stomach cancer paternal grandmother, breast cancer in paternal aunt, throat cancer in maternal uncle, and question stomach cancer in maternal uncle.
Physical Exam: VITALS: T97.6F, BP 100/72, HR 87, RR 22, O2sat 92%6L NC GENERAL: Comfortable, no acute distress NECK: No cervical lymphadenopathy CARD: Regular rate & rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at LUSB RESP: No accessory muscle use.
Decreased breath sounds on left, with crackles ~1/3 up; right essentially clear ABD: Obese, + bowel sounds, non-tender, non-distended, no HSM appreciated BACK: No CVA tenderness, no spinal tender EXT: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema; 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: CN II-XII intact, 5/5 strength in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
No sensory deficits appreciated.
PSYCH: Mood and affect appropriate.
No previous tracing available for comparison .
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Large left pleural effusion, bibasilar atelectasis, and right basilar Kerley B lines.
This suggests lymphangitis carcinomatosa or direct, tumor-related pulmonary congestion.
Cytology pleural fluid [**10-31**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**10-31**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
[**10-31**] ECG: Slight sinus tachycardia.
Several lobulated opacifications suggest some loculated pleural fluid.
Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.
Relatively lower lung volumes with some opacification at the bases consistent with atelectatic change.
There is also some increasing prominence of ill-defined pulmonary vessels that could reflect some developing increased pulmonary venous pressure.
PE can not be excluded with certainty due to bilateral pleural effusion and airway disease affecting the interpretation of the lung scan.
[**11-1**] CXR: Moderate loculated left pleural effusion unchanged since [**10-31**], 2:51 p.m., previously much larger following placement of a left-sided pigtail drain unchanged in position since prior study.
Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, bibasilar atelectasis, more pronounced on the right, has not cleared and small right pleural effusion has increased.
[**11-1**] CT Chest: Several bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Extensive right hilar adenopathy with subsequent hypoventilation of the right lower lobe, combined with moderate mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
No obvious bone destruction.
No pericardial effusion.
[**11-2**] CXR: Several bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Extensive right hilar adenopathy with subsequent hypoventilation of the right lower lobe, combined with moderate mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
No obvious bone destruction.
No pericardial effusion.
[**11-3**] CXR: 59-year-old woman with history of metastatic melanoma with pleural effusion.
There is no overall change.
Moderate loculated left pleural effusion, vascular congestion, bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion are unchanged.
[**11-5**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
[**11-5**] CXR (PA/Lat and Lat Decub): At the bases of the right lung, no evidence of pleural effusion is seen.
Newly occurred, however, is a parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe with sparse air bronchograms that could be inflammatory in origin.
The large loculated pleural fluid on the left is grossly unchanged as compared to the previous examination.
Also unchanged is a moderate related plate-like atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 59yF with recent diagnosis of metastatic melanoma presenting with shortness of breath, found to have metastatic spread to lungs, pleura, and right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
She was initially admitted to the interventional pulmonary/thoracic service, where a workup for her shortness of breath (see below) was performed; a thoracentesis was performed with improvement, and she was transferred to the OMED service for further management.
#) Metastatic melanoma.
Known metastases to lungs/pleura, with extensive chest lymphadenopathy.
Patient also with headaches more recently, and vague RUQ abdominal pain which raises concern for additional metastases.
Transferred to OMED for administration of Taxol which was given on [**11-4**] without complications.
Multiple reasons for her dyspnea, including known metastatic disease, pleural effusions (malignant in nature), lymphangitic spread of disease.
The last CXR on [**11-5**] demonstrated loculated pleural effusions with nothing easily to take.
#) Elevated WBC.
Infection is possible given immunocompromised (splenectomy--which could also account for her elevated white count).
#) Chronic pain.
Continued pain medications.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Depression.
Atorvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for hypercholestrolemia.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID PRN as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Melanoma Pleural Effusion Anxiety   Discharge Condition: The patient was hemodynamically stable, afebrile and without pain at the time of discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath.
You symptoms were due to the accumulation of fluid on your lungs.
This fluid was drained and your symptoms improved.
First, you have held your provigil due to concerns for a high high heart rate.
We have increased your pain medication to a new dose for better pain control.
You can take these medications every 6 hours as needed for wheezing/shortness of breath.
Please call your doctor or seek medical attention if you develop a fever higher than 100.3, increased shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or any other symptom of concern.
