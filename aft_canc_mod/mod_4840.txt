However, given that this lesion was proximal to D1 in the LAD, he had significant myocardial damage.
BY PROBLEM   STEMI [**12-17**] Instent Thrombosis c/b Cardiogenic Shock requirin IABP + Dopamine  Known CAD  Systolic Dysfunction without clinical failure  LV hypokinesis and Akinesis     The patient was more than 2 years out from a DES and was taken off of aspirin and plavix in preparation for radiotherapy marker/seed placement.
He required three seperate boluses of furosemide for pulmonary edema.
An ECHO revealed depressed EF and HK/AK.
Ultimately, he will balance the risks of bleeding during a seed placement with the benefits of anti-platelet therapy.
While there is a theoretical interaction at CYP 2C19 between ppi's and plavix, it has never affected him.
He was discharged with the instruction to continue his ppi but recognize that he may be advised differently by his cardiologist and that while he, personally, has never had an event on nexium, there may be less risk with pantoprazole.
