You were admitted for an esophageal variceal bleed.
We performed an endoscopy, which showed an additional enlarged vein in your esophagus - a band was placed.
The enlarged veins are due to your liver disease - it is extremely important that you not drink alcohol because this can worsen your liver disease.
We are also working to schedule you for a repeat endoscopy.
