Admission Date:  [**2128-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-8-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: left back and upper chest discomfort and a large posterior mediastinal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: .
Left extended posterolateral thoracotomy with radical resection of invasive left chest wall mass, including ribs 4 through 7, on block with the left lower lobe, [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and mediastinal lymphadenectomy.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an unfortunately 29 year old gentleman with neurofibromatosis type 1, who was found to have a malignant large neurofibroma in the left chest wall, eroding through at least 2 ribs in the left lateral chest wall, and also likely invading the lung.
He presented with a left back and upper chest discomfort and a large posterior mediastinal mass.
He also has an intractable cough productive of yellow mucus.
Needle biopsy suggested a spindle cell malignancy, which was likely a neurofibroma which has undergone malignant degeneration.
A PET scan showed intense hypermetabolic uptake at this site, with also uptake in the right femoral neck.
An MRI suggested a round lesion in the marrow space with no cortical destruction.
Whether this represents metastasis or a neurofibroma is unknown.
The patient and his family understood that this may not represent a curative operation, but certainly would be the best palliation and the most effective cytoreductive approach to the disease.
Family History: Significant for coronary artery disease and neurofibromatosis in his father  Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: HEENT: There is no Horner's syndrome.
no scleral icterus LYMPHATICS: There is no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
He has pain on palpation over the scapula on the left.
Heart: regular rate and rhythm ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds.
extremities: no clubbing or edema  Pertinent Results: [**2128-5-19**] 09:36PM BLOOD WBC-17.2*# RBC-3.55*# Hgb-9.7*# Hct-28.8*# MCV-81* MCH-27.4 MCHC-33.9 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-312 [**2128-5-19**] 04:30PM BLOOD PT-14.0* PTT-31.2 INR(PT)-1.3 [**2128-5-19**] 09:36PM BLOOD Glucose-144* UreaN-17 Creat-0.7 Na-140 K-4.3 Cl-109* HCO3-23 AnGap-12 [**2128-5-19**] 09:36PM BLOOD Calcium-7.8* Phos-4.2 Mg-1.4* [**2128-5-19**] 04:08PM BLOOD Glucose-88 Lactate-1.7 Na-138 K-4.2 Cl-105  [**2128-5-26**] 09:45AM BLOOD Hct-32.5* pm BLOOD CULTURE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2128-5-28**]**     AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2128-5-28**]):    NO GROWTH.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2128-5-28**] 11:28 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: interval change-?PTX  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old man s/p LLL resection chest tubes d/c'd REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: interval change-?PTX INDICATION: Status post left lower lobe resection.
A loculated left hydropneumothorax is again seen with slight interval decrease in the loculated air containing portions of the collection at the left apex.
There has been interval removal of 2 left sided chest tubes.
The right lung remains clear with minimal linear atelectasis peripherally.
Stable left hydropneumothorax with slight decrease in loculated gasseous components at the left apex.
[**Doctor Last Name **] Gross Description by:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/dif    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:  MARGIN AORTIC ARCH, LEFT CHEST WALL MASS LEFT LOWER LOBE, L9/10/7 NODE.
Margin on aortic arch (A-B):  Positive for high-grade sarcoma, see note.
Left chest wall mass and left lower lobe of lung (C-Z):  High-grade sarcoma invading lung and chest wall, extending to lateral and inferior soft tissue resection margins, and extending to within 0.2 mm from anterior and 0.1 mm from superior soft tissue resection margins, see note.
Lymph nodes, L9 (AA-AB):  Three lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/3).
Lymph nodes, L10 (AC-AD):  Two lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/2).
Lymph node, L7 (AE):  One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
Note:  Tumor cells are positive for vimentin, focally positive for keratin and S-100, and negative for actin, desmin and GFAP, consistent with the diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
Post operative course included the following:  Day#1 - chest tube leak, transfused 2U pRBC due to low hematocrit.
Patient now afebrile 24 hours.
Day#5 - cxr slightly improved, but loculated effusion still present Day#6 - tpa was injected into chest tube , after which a substantial amount of drainge occured over the next 24-48 hours Day #9 - both chest tubes, post chest xray showed some improvement.
