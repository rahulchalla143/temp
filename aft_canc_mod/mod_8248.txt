DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Imaging: [**12-27**] Renal u/s: The right kidney measures 7 cm and is mildly echogenic.
A interpolar cyst measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.6 cm shows no internal vascularity or septations and is unchanged in size from [**2137-8-19**].
No hydronephrosis is present.
The left kidney measures 9 cm and is diffusely echogenic consistent with medical renal disease.
No hydronephrosis or masses are present.
IMPRESSION: Diffusely echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease.
Right renal cyst with calcifications is unchanged in size.
The right renal upper pole lesion seen on the prior CT was difficult to visualize on this examination.
There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion as well as pleural plaques along the right chest.
There is increased prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggesting an element of fluid overload.
There is minimal blunting of the left CP angle suggestive of a small effusion.
There is also some increased density at the left base which may represent an early infiltrate versus atelectasis.
[**12-31**] MRI abd/pelvis: There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
In fact, there is paucity of fluid within the collecting systems, which may represent reduced production of urine.
There is no perinephric fluid or fat stranding.
There are multiple bilateral renal cysts that demonstrate slight increase in size compared to MRI of five years ago.
The new cystic lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney measures 1.5 cm.
It is also noted that there is paucity of signal in the renal parenchyma on the ASL images.
Apparent reduced perfusion in the kidney which may represent a sequela or cause of patient's decreased renal function.
There is interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions from CT scan of [**2137-7-28**], with associated atelectasis/consolidation.
It is also noted that the IVC size in the intrahepatic and infrahepatic portions is large, which may represent fluid overload status.
There is a small amount of hemorrhagic fluid in the bladder lumen.
There is a small amount of nonhemorrhagic free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no adenopathy.
No hydronephrosis or reversible cause for renal failure identified.
No perfusion in the cystic renal mass in the right upper pole of the kidney.
Apparent reduced perfusion in the kidney which may represent a sequela or cause of patient's decreased renal function.
Thickened bladder and a short segment of distal left ureter thickening without proximal obstruction.
New bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis/consolidation, and increased pelvic free fluid.
[**1-3**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including cardiomegaly, post-sternotomy wires and post-CABG changes.
Multifocal opacities seen throughout the lungs are redemonstrated, mostly involving the right lower lobe associated with right pleural effusion.
Overall, the appearance has slightly improved since the prior study, which is most likely due to improvement of superimposed pulmonary edema.
Echogenic debris measures with maximum cross-sectional dimension 5.0 x 1.4 x 2.0 cm (TRV x AP x CC), layering in the dependent position of the urinary bladder, compatible with blood clot.
There is no free fluid in the visualized pelvic region.
IMPRESSION: Echogenic blood clot layering in the otherwise normally-distended urinary bladder.
Moderate right pleural effusion has increased since [**1-3**], after previously decreasing.
I doubt that there is pneumonia, and pulmonary vascular congestion is relatively stable so I do not think there is pulmonary edema either.
Extensive right pleural calcification is longstanding.
[**1-11**] CXR: There are small bilateral pleural effusions with possible interval increase in pleural fluid on the left.
There is an area of focally increased density at the right base that appears increased since the previous study and a small area of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Interstitial markings are increased and there may be an element of underlying interstitial edema as well.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o Russian M with PMHx of [**Age over 90 9197**] cancer with recent indwelling foley, stage IV CKD (baseline Cr 3.0) and chronic systolic CHF (LVEF 30%) who was admitted on [**12-26**] with anemia, hematuria and clot-related urinary retention.
He was initially admitted to the Urology Service for urinary clot retention and was taken to the operating room for cystoscopy, clot evacuation, and bladder fulguration.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post procedure due to urosepsis from Klebseilla UTI.
Pt developped presumed ATN and worsening renal failure post procedure.
Pt had some recovery of renal function but developped recurrent hematuria requiring multiple blood transfusions.
During this prolonged admission, he required multiple urologic procedures for recurrent hematuria with obstructive clotting.
On [**1-8**], he was taken for cystoscopy which was complicated by an episode of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure thought due to procedural sedation.
Foley was removed and he did had any acute issues with retention.
He did have one transient episode of scant hematuria which resolved spontaneously.
Pt continued to have normal UOP with mildly elevated PVRs and stable creatinine.
Urology recommended avoiding a foley unless pt develops severe pain or acute obstruction given his severe hematuria.
Specific issues: C diff: Pt was noted to have a rising leukocytosis and Cdiff toxin returned positive.
Acute on chronic renal failure: By the time of discharge, his renal function seemed stabilized at a creatinine of 3.6-3.9.
He had been adequately diuresed for his acute systolic heart failure and was clinically euvolemic on lasix dose of 40mg twice daily.
Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Pt was hypervolemic after fluid rescucitation in the ICU and required diuresis with IV lasix.
