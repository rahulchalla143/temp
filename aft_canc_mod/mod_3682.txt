History of Present Illness: Pt is a 74 yo F, who visited ED x2 in past([**2107-6-16**], [**2107-6-26**]) for severe constipation.
This is the third visit and presented to ED w/ increasing abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting.
On [**6-16**] CT showed large stool trough GI tract with cecum of 8cm.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-6-30**] 5:24 PM IMPRESSION: Increased lung markings are most likely secondary to vascular crowding from low lung volumes, though interstital edema cannot be excluded, especially in the setting of cardiomegaly.
Unchanged appearance of massively fecal-loaded right colon and dilated cecum.
The previously mentioned pneumatosis is not well visualized on today's study.
Multifocal ventricular premature beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave changes are probably related to left ventricular hypertrophy but cannot exclude ischemia.
Compared to tracing #1 on [**2107-6-30**] the ventricular premature beats are new and the ST segment elevation and T wave changes may be more significant in leads V2-V3.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2107-7-1**] Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% to 25% (nl >=55%) IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with severe global hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
[**7-1**] Colonoscopy: obstructing secal mass at 25 cm with blood.
Fibroadipose tissue with focal hemorrhage.
Segment of small intestine, with acute perforation.
Two lymph nodes; no malignancy identified.
There is no tumor.
Dilation and congestion of the cecal area without hemorrhagic  infarction.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2107-7-11**] 6:36 PM MODERATE ASCITES AND ANASARCA.
RIM ANHANCING FLUID COLLECTION IS NOTED AROUND THE ILEAL OSTEOMY.
Surgery was consulted and placed rectal tube, NG tube, made NPO, began IVF and attemped cathartics and enemas without success.
GI was consulted to perform colonoscopy to evaluate for obstruction and to treat impaction.
Concurrently, the patient had evaluation by Echo and found to have EF of 20-25%, and on EKG to have short runs of v-tach.
Colonoscopy on HD 2 revealed obstructing mass at 25 cm in sigmoid and Bx was adenocarcimoma.
PULM: the patient had good O2Sats throughout, remained on Alb/ipratropium inhalers prn for asthma and pulm edema, though never needed to use these.
She was given o2 post operatively and there were a few instanced where CXR was wet, 2nd to CHF, resolving well with appropriate fluid balance.
ABD: Pt had surgery for obstruction intractable to medical management as described above.
Her ostomy post-op was high output and required aggressive Rx management, but reduced over hospital stay.
CT abd obtained 2nd to WBC, fluid collection below skin around ostomy, no abscess and ostomy is clinically great.
Pt remained afebrile throughout hospital course.
WBC was mildly elevated post op likely secondary to CHF and post-op.
Endo: pt had blood sugars mildly elevated post-op, will continue to monitor w/ home nursing and f/u w/ PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4120**].
Opium Tincture 10 mg/mL Tincture Sig: Ten (10) drops PO three times a day as needed for high output ostomy.
Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: adenocarcinoma of colon systolic dysfunction/congestive heart failure blood loss anemia   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You have been hospitalized and treated for a colon obstruction.
The surgery that was performed (subtotal colectomy with ileostomy and partial small bowel resection) was successfula and without complication.
The pathology report indicated that you had a type of colon cancer (adenocarcinoma grade T3N0).
The section of colon with the cancer was completely removed and there was no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.
If you experience acute shortness of breath/trouble breathing, dizziness, severe headache, fainting, chest pain, abdominal pain, weakness, fever, chills or any other symptom that is worrisome, please seek immediate medical care.
