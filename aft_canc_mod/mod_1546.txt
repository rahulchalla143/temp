Follow up scans in [**2142-1-4**], revealed the left lower lobe lung nodule and a right upper lobe nodule with growth on follow up scans.
In [**2142-5-4**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] VATS of the lung nodule with pathology revealing lymphomatoid granulomatosis which was followed with close observation.
In [**2145-11-3**], a left lower lobe nodule grew, an FNA revealed lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
In [**2145-12-4**], he began interferon with evidence of disease progression in [**2146-8-4**], at which point rituxan was added.
He completed 2 cycles of Rituxan with progression of lung nodules and biopsy revealing renal cell carcinoma.
He received [**9-16**] doses with his course complicated by mild neurotoxicity and hypoxia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, renal cell carcinoma as above.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: Reveals a well appearing male in no acute distress.
Lymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral axillary, or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Abdomen: Round and soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
on treatment day #2 to help minimize toxicity and prevent neurotoxicity noted with week 1.
On treatment day #4, he developed confusion with IL-2 dosing held with subsequent improvement in his mental status.
On treatment day #5,  he was acidotic with a bicarbonate of 16, prompting IL-2 to be placed on hold until his acidosis was corrected.
He was also noted to have hyperkalemia on treatment day #5, improved from 6.1-4.8 with administration of Lasix x1 dose.
In the afternoon of treatment day #5, the patient became hypotensive with blood pressure in the 60s with pressors initiated.
Also during this episode he became hypoxic requiring 6 liters of O2 to maintain his oxygenation in the high 90s.
His oxygen requirement also decreased and he was weaned from oxygen by [**2147-6-6**], after diuresis was initiated given significant weight gain of 22 pounds.
Other side effects during this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy; diarrhea improved with Lomotil; and an erythematous skin rash.
During this week he developed renal insufficiency with a peak creatinine of 5.7 improved to 3.9 at the time of discharge.
He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 7.9 improved to 6.9 upon discharge.
He also developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 78 and peak AST of 86, both improved at the time of discharge.
He developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of 61,000 without evidence of bleeding.
He did develop metabolic acidosis with a minimum bicarbonate of 11, improved with aggressive bicarbonate repletion.
He had no coagulopathy or myocarditis noted.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post cycle 1, week 2, high dose IL-2 complicated by hypotension and hypoxia requiring ICU transfer.
