History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] is an 84 year old gentleman who was admitted into the hospital for surgical management of a right lower lobe mass.
He had a chest CT scan on [**9-14**] that showed a 24 x 28 mm noncalcified nodule in the superior segment of right lower lobe.
He denied any shortness of breath prior to admission.
He did admit to intermittent productive cough prior to admission, but no persistent hemoptysis.
Past Medical History: COPD (last PFTs [**2148**] FEV1/FVC 98%, FEV1 55) Coronary artery disease CHF (last echo [**2148**] showed preserved EF >55%, diastolic dysfunction) BPH Osteoarthritis bilateral hips s/p right total hip replacement Hypercholesterolemia atopic dermatitis cervical spondylosis s/p tonsillectomy  Social History: Lives with his wife, retired plumbing/heating Tob: smoked x60yrs, quit [**2147**] EtOH: "very little" Illicits: denies   Family History: Mother d. 56yrs MI, Father d. 71 MI, brothers with MI in 70s  Physical Exam: Discharge Vital signs: T: 99.1  HR 68-70 BP: 110-116/58 20 93% on 3L of nasal cannula  Wt: 104 kg  Discharge Physical Exam: GEN: 84 year-old in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR normal S1, S2 II-III/VI SEM RESP: decreased breath sounds with faint crackles right 1/3 up, left no crackles ABD: obese, bowel sounds positive, abdomen soft non-tender Extr: warm tr edema Incision: Right thoracotomy site with hematoma, no erythema, no discharge Neuro: awake, alert oriented.
Mild decrease in extent of pre-existing left lower lobe atelectasis.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
No pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Bibasilar consolidation, more pronounced on the right and right pleural fluid and/or thickening persists.
A very small right apical pneumothorax is redemonstrated.
There is streaky density at the bases consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as before.
Chest X-ray    [**2158-12-15**] Impression: There is interval increase in right pleural effusion.
There is small amount of right apical pneumothorax better appreciated on the current view and seen at the apex and along the mediastinum.
Left lung is essentially clear except for minimal basal atelectasis.
Calcifications surrounding the right humeral head most likely located within the joint are redemonstrated and most likely consistent with synovial osteochondromatosis.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Loculated right hydropneumothorax status post right lower lobe superior segmentectomy.
2.9 cm low-density collection with multiple foci of air noted within the subcarinal space.
Bibasilar consolidations with marked secretions within the right bronchus intermedius and basal segmental bronchi.
Findings are concerning for aspiration and atelectasis.
However, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Mild enlargement of the mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, possibly reactive in nature.
Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
ECHO [**2158-12-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
An epidural was placed by acute pain service which was discontinued POD 2.
This was dc'd POD 1, and the patients pain was controlled well with ibuprofen, Tylenol and oxycodone.
A CTA was done on [**2158-12-15**] to rule out PE given rapid fib and need for oxygen.
This was negative for PE, but revealed a pneumonia process.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs and incentive spirometer were continued.
He was seen by cardiology again who recommended increasing his Amiodarone to 400 mg daily and stopping toprol and home with an event monitor.
GU: Foley was placed intra op and dc'd after paravertebral block dc'd on POD 2.
He voided small frequent amounts.
ID: Vancomycin and Zosyn started empirically for a pneumonia seen on CT. Sputum cultures were unable to be obtained during his hospitalization and he was switched to Levaquin to empirically treat his pneumonia.
Dispo: The patient was evaluated by PT who recommended home with services for pulmonary rehab.
11. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation for 2 weeks.
13. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: .5 - 1 Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 40 doses.
Disp:*100 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Right lower lobe lung nodule Aortic stenosis- moderate to severe on echo [**10-11**] Hyperlipidemia Hypertension BPH   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] if you experience: -Fevers > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath, cough or chest pain -Incision develops drainage (soft hematoma at incision site stable) -Steri-strips remove in 10 days or sooner should they come off -Shower daily.
Wash incision with mild soap and water, rinse, pat dry -Chest tube site with bandaid.
Warfarin for atrial fibrillation.
