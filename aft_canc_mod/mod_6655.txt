Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o F with PMHx of metastatic uterine cancer was admitted electively and brought to OR where under general anesthesia she underwent T4 vertebrectomy/fusion.
She was extubated POD#1 without difficulty.
She developed Atrial Fibrillation with RVR on POD#3 with sBPs in 90/60s and pt was transferred to the CCU.
There was no evidence of rate related ischemia and BP remained stable.
Thyroid function was normal, transaminases were normal, Alkaline phosphatase was mildly elevated which is more likely related to the bony mets.
Her incision was clean and dry.
Methocarbamol 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for muscle spasm.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: T4 metastatic lesion atrial fibrillation anemia of blood loss uterine cancer  Discharge Condition: neurologically stable  Discharge Instructions: While in the hospital, you developed an arrthymia called atrial fibrillation.
Keep wound clean / No tub baths or pools until seen in follow up/ take daily showers ??????
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
