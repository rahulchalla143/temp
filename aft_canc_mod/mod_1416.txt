HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 84 year old non-diabetic white female with known coronary artery disease status post angioplasty with stent placement of the left anterior descending and left circumflex in [**2193-1-16**], with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, CML, myeloproliferative disorder and asthma, who developed a right heel ulcer in late [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.
She was ambulating with a walker at home and developed a small area of redness without any known trauma.
She has had prior symptoms of right calf claudication.
During the preoperative cardiac evaluation, the patient had a positive Dobutamine stress and echocardiogram at [**Hospital6 11896**] on [**2195-1-21**].
The following day, the patient had a cardiac catheterization and after an episode of hypertension and developed a left groin hematoma which required emergent repair of the left common femoral artery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was then transferred here for angioplasty and stent placement on [**2195-1-29**].
The patient was admitted [**3-12**] until [**3-16**], to the Medical Service for right leg arteriogram which showed right SFA disease and severe disease of the run-off vessels.
Coronary artery disease, status post angioplasty:  Obtuse marginal with a stent placement; the left anterior descending, left circumflex, in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year; a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at that time.
Cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 40%.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
History of Bell's Palsy.
Chronic myocytic leukemia.
Urinary tract infection in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year; she was treated with Levaquin.
She has had blood transfusions in the past; the most recent was in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
The dorsalis pedis is monophasic signal on the right and the posterior tibial is non-Doppler-able or palpable.
The left popliteal is palpable with a Doppler-able dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the left.
She does have an abrasion on the sacrum which is tender to palpation.
Joint examination shows feet equally warm with mild foot/ankle edema on the right.
There is a large 3.5 cm dry gangrenous ulcer to the right heel with some fresh bloody drainage on the dressing.
There is no odor or fluctuance.
Chest x-ray showed a small left pleural effusion.
EKG was a sinus rhythm, normal axis deviation; no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent, on [**2195-3-25**], a right common femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass with in situ greater saphenous vein in angioscopy.
Postoperatively, the patient had a drop in her hematocrit from 26 to 20 with low urinary output.
The right foot was warm with palpable graft pulse and Doppler-able dorsalis pedis.
She had a small hematoma on the left thigh; otherwise remained on her Nipride for blood pressure control.
Her EKG was without changes.
The Urology Service was consulted because of her anuria.
They agree with aggressive volume resuscitation and agreed with cycling cardiac enzymes and follow her potassium closely at q. six hours along with her calcium phosphatase and replete magnesium.
A Clonidine patch was reinstituted with improvement in her systolic blood pressure control and her SVR and increase in cardiac index of 2.78, with improvement in her urinary output with resolving of her acute renal vasoconstriction.
The Nitroglycerin was weaned and the patient was begun on Dopamine renal dosing with continued improvement in her renal function and urinary output.
Her hematoma was not enlarged.
There was no active drainage from the incision wounds.
She had a palpable graft pulse and Doppler-able dorsalis pedis.
Her hematoma remained stable.
Postoperative day six, she had an episode of a 33-beat run of asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia.
Postoperative day number eight, there was noted some ecchymotic and dry eschar changes on the dorsal aspect of her foot.
Postoperative day number nine, Plavix 75 mg q. day was added to her medicine regimen for history of angioplasty.
Silvadene dressings were also begun on the right leg for a peeling eschar with some bloody drainage and the eschar on the right foot continued with Silvadene dressings.
The graft remained functioning and she had a palpable dorsalis pedis.
She had consistently elevated white blood cell count but this was secondary to her history of CML.
She had a palpable graft pulse and a dorsalis pedis pulse.
Heparin subcutaneously twice a day for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Right heel ulceration status post bypass graft.
Acute renal failure, resolved.
Chronic myocytic leukemia.
