A CT scan of the chest and abdomen was obtained demonstrating a large mass in the right lobe of the liver and a CT-guided biopsy demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma.
A CT of the chest and abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-8**] demonstrated a 4.9 x 10.6 x 10.4 cm mass involving the right lobe of the liver and the medial segment of the left lobe (segments 4, 5, and 8) which demonstrates washout on delayed images and exerts mass effect on the portal vein branches without any clear thrombosis or invasion.
There was no ascites and the liver contour appeared smooth.
There was no evidence of portal hypertension.
He subsequently underwent portal vein embolization in preparation for a right hepatic trisegmentectomy.
He subsequently became jaundiced and underwent ERCP for compression of the biliary tree secondary to the tumor mass.
Past Medical History: PMH hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and benign colonic polyps.
PSH: trauma to his left hand requiring repair of his middle and ring finger in [**2168**], and bilateral wrist carpal tunnel syndrome in [**2169**] requiring surgical correction R portal vein embolization [**2174-3-22**] [**2174-4-22**] Right hepatic trisegmentectomy, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.
He has a history of significant alcohol intake with approximately 21 drinks per week, but he quit in [**2173-12-17**].
He has no history of IV drug use, marijuana use, blood transfusions, tattoos, hepatitis,  or piercing.
He has a bachelor's degree   Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: At Admission to OR Gen: NAD, AxOx3, generalized yellowing of skin HEENT: + scleral icterus, dry MM, no cervical lymphadenopathy Card: RRR, no bruits, no MRG Lungs: CTAB Abd: + bs, no rebound/guarding, non-tender, distended extrem: no edema, 2+ DP pulses b/l, skin: warm, dry with sl jaundice Neuro: no asterixis, no focal deficit   Pertinent Results: At Admsiion: [**2174-4-22**] WBC-9.3 RBC-3.26* Hgb-10.3* Hct-29.6* MCV-91# MCH-31.7 MCHC-34.9 RDW-16.4* Plt Ct-148* PT-13.8* PTT-31.1 INR(PT)-1.2* Glucose-106* UreaN-15 Creat-1.1 Na-143 K-3.9 Cl-106 HCO3-19* AnGap-22* ALT-1333* AST-2410* AlkPhos-95 TotBili-5.0* Albumin-4.0 Calcium-10.0 Phos-5.0* Mg-1.5* At Time of discharge [**2174-8-22**] WBC-11.8* RBC-3.19* Hgb-10.3* Hct-32.0* MCV-100* MCH-32.2* MCHC-32.1 RDW-25.8* Plt Ct-83* PT-17.8* PTT-47.3* INR(PT)-1.6* Glucose-156* UreaN-111* Creat-4.5* Na-145 K-3.1* Cl-104 HCO3-20* AnGap-24* Calcium-8.8 Phos-4.8* Mg-3.0* ALT-43* AST-76* AlkPhos-166* Amylase-42 TotBili-30.1*  Brief Hospital Course: On [**2174-4-22**], patient underwent right hepatic trisegmentectomy, cholecystectomy, with intraoperative ultrasound for HCC.
Postop course was long and complicated with sequelae from liver that was small for size.
He developed recurrent ascites requiring intermittent paracentesis, jaundice and confusion.
Hospital course was further complicated by acute renal failure with persistently elevated creatine levels.
Patient also developed several episodes of melena requiring mulitple transfusions to stabilize his HCT levels.
LFTs remained elevated during entire hospital course, especially alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels.
Patient ultimately expired on POD123 due to multiple episodes of bradycardia with decreased O2 saturation and ultimately respiratory failure.
Significant events during hospital course are as follows:  He was found to have thrombosis of the main portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein on [**5-1**].
Head was negative for bleed or stroke.
CXR within angio suite demonstrated no pneumothorax.
Injection of contrast showed disruption of the biliary tree with extravasation of contrast into the liver parenchyma.
Blood cultures were positive for enterococci on [**5-9**], so patient was started on vancomycin and continued through [**5-24**].
Pleural Effusion: CXR on [**8-3**] was significant for R pleural effusion.
Right pigtail catheter was placed and drained 2L of serosanguinous fluid.
Fluid was sent for analysis and did not reveal any signs of infection or active bleeding.
Melena: On [**2174-8-3**], patient began to have several episodes of dark, melanotic stools.
EGD was performed on [**2174-8-3**] that showed high risk esophageal varices, but these were not felt to be the cause of the bleeding.
Colonoscopy on [**2174-8-3**] showed clot in the rectum, but no signs of active bleeding.
Patient's mental status declined as he became minimally responsive.
On POD 123, episodes of bradycardia and desaturation continued.
