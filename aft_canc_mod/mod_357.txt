Admission Date:  [**2118-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-12-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-5-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath and tachycardia.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] is a 50 year old male with grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma s/p recent suboccipital carniotomy brought to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] center due to tachycardia and dyspnea noted by rehab radiology faculty.
His post-cramotomy ([**11-18**]) course was complicated by repeat craniotomy ([**11-24**]) for re-bleeding and residual mass as well as by RLL pneumonia (completed 7 day course on Levofloxacin).
Following d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-30**] and prior to this admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] reports minimal ambulation and activity (without HA, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations) with severe R calf pain and dyspnea while getting physical therapy at rehab that morning.
At that time he was noted to have LE swelling, tachycardia, and dyspnea.
Chest CT confirmed massive bilateral PEs.
He was evaluated by his neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended starting heparin at 1000 units/hour without bolus and repeating a head CT once the patient was therapeutic (PTT 50-70).
ECHO at that time showed RV free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion with a dilated RV.
Head CT (once PTT > 50) showed no acute bleeding.
On admission to the ED, his wife noted that his right facial droop and dyarthria have been improving.
He has also recently had a corneal abrasion [**3-12**] being unable to close his right eye.
Physical exam was notable for reduced lung sounds at the bases bilaterally (L>R) with inspiratory wheezes and mild crackles appreciated at the mid right throax and lower left lung base respectively.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2118-12-5**] CTA CHEST: There is massive bilateral pulmonary embolism with thrombus filling the left pulmonary artery extending into all lobar branches and their respective segmental and subsegmental branches.
There is oligemia of the left lung though there is no evidence of infarct.
On the right, there is a saddle embolus at the bifurfaction of the right pulmonary artery with clot involving the lobar and segmental branches and several subsegmental branches in the right lower lobe.
There is evidence of right heart strain with slight flattening of the interventricular septum.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is bilateral minimal dependent atelectasis.
No pneumorthorax.
Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal no abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Massive bilateral pulmonary embolism.
Left ventricular dysnchrony is present.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Postoperative changes in the cerebellum with possible residual tumor in the surgical bed.
Hypodensity in the right frontal lobe related to prior ventriculostomy catheter.
No evidence for active hemorrhage.
No other acute intracranial pathology .
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Postoperative change in the cerebellum with likely resolving hematoma in the surgical bed.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**],  You were admitted on [**2118-12-6**] for shortness of breath and tachycardia  resulting from bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE).
Chest CT scans on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] confirmed one large PE in the left pulmonary artery and a second large PE in the inferior branchs of the right pumonary artery.
Prior to admission to the medical service, while on the ICU service, an IVC filter was placed by vascular surgery following ultrasound evidence of bilateral deep venous thrombi in your legs which were the source of the clot travelling to the lungs.
Anti-heparin/PF4 antibody screen was positive consistent with a diagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Speech/Swallow monitoring was also performed while you were here and showed increased risk for aspiration of thin liquids.
