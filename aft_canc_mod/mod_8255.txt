Chest pain similar in quality to pain with prior MIs.
The blade was thought to be the cause of a subsequent left lateral wall infarction, leading to inferior wall hypokinesis, mod/severe MR due to papillary muscle infarct, and a drop in EF from 60 to 40%.
Patient was subsequently re-admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from [**Date range (1) 112543**] for recurrent chest pain and rising troponins (peaked at 2.27) thought to be related to continuing infarction.
Episode of chest pain leading to first [**Hospital1 2025**] admission was also preceded by chemotherapy that day.
ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V6.
Labs and imaging significant for lactate 4.1, trop 0.65, glu 381 with gap 13, UA with trace ketones and large glucose, calcium 10.9, WBC 2.5, Hct 30.8, Plt 92, and INR 1.4.
CXR showed small bilateral effusions and some vascular fullness.
Chest pain improved with morphine, but did not resolve.
Chest pain finally resolved with nitro gtt.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, patient was free of chest pain.

STUDIES: ([**10-13**]) CXR:IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, and adjacent atelectasis.
([**10-15**]) CXR: There is substantial interval improvement up to almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.
Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2157**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Based on [**2161**] ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or a change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year; if previously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**2-25**] years.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
EKGs: 2-3mm ST depressions in V3-V6 on admission; these decreased to ~1mm ST depressions on discharge when patient was asymptomatic  Brief Hospital Course: 76M with extensive hx of CAD including multiple CABG with most recent cath on [**9-23**] c/b rotorblade impaction in the LCx presents to ED with chest pain, elevated troponin, and EKG changes.
The chest pain appears to be associated with the timing of his chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
# Chest Pain: Suspect demand ischemia secondary to chemotherapy agents (direct effect or volume induced pulmonary edema).
In CCU, pt had an episode of [**9-2**] chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath and increased O2 requirement, which was likely ischemia with flash pulmonary edema.
Following this episode, he was without pain, and enzymes show negative CKMB and mildly elevated trop, indicating likely ischemia rather than new infarct.
On day of discharge, pt was without CP or SOB; he was breathing room air, had flat neck veins, trace ankle edema, and his lung sounds were clear.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF:  No change in LVEF on repeat ECHO (40%).
Pt was admitted with oxygen requirement to 4L NC.
On the first morning of his admission, he had what appeared to be an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which resolved with metoprolol, nitro drip, morphine, and Lasix.
CXR showed significant acute pulmonary edema which resolved over the next several days with diuresis.
# Multiple Myeloma: Currently on chemo with pancytopenia without evidence of bleeding.
Patient is neutropenic and afebrile.
The patient will meet with his oncologist on the day following discharge to discuss the potential impact of his chemotherapy on his cardiac disease and whether there are alternative agents.

Your acute increase in chest pain may have been related to the chemotherapy that you received prior to admission.
You were also found to have extra fluid around your lungs, which we think was related to "heart failure," that is, decreased ability of your heart to pump blood.
Please follow up with your cardiologist on [**10-27**] about the ongoing treatment of your heart disease.
While you were in the hospital, you were seen by our diabetes specialist who recommended some changes in your insulin doses to better control your blood sugars.
