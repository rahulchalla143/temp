[**2116-11-25**] Cytology of Thoracentesis fluid: "NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Scattered lymphocytes and proteinaceous material."
[**2116-11-27**] Video Swallow Study: "Single episode of aspiration of nectar thickened liquids on the initial bolus during premature spillover.
Bulky adenopathy within the mediastinum and both hila resulting in compression of left lower lobe bronchus 2.
New bilateral moderate/large pleural effusions.
Right upper lobe patchy pulmonary parenchymal opacity which could represent the patient's known pneumonia or metastatic disease.
Unchanged retroperitoneal adenopathy, left chest wall and scapular masses 5.
A lytic lesion of the T12 vertebral body extends to the osseous margins of the central spinal canal and results in possible spinal cord compression at this level."
[**2116-11-29**] Unilateral US of UE: "No evidence of venous thrombosis."
[**2116-11-30**] Cytology of Thoracentesis fluid: "NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells and blood."
[**2116-12-7**] Portable CXR: "Interval improved aeration in left upper lobe and left perihilar region, corresponding to reduction in left effusion and adjacent atelectasis, with residual moderate to large loculated left effusion.
Brief Hospital Course:    The patient was intubated in the ED for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
Respiratory distress: On admission, the respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to mixed hypoxic hypercarbic failure secondary to pneumonia and left pleural effusion.
He was relatively stable from a respiratory standpoint until the 15th when he experienced acute respiratory distress requiring BIPAP.
This was thought to be secondary to fluid overload after mobilization of fluids after receiving several liters of hydration as per the sepsis protocol and pressure support.
The patient was given a ten day course of Zosyn which he tolerated well for the PNA and a thoracenetesis with chest tube placement for the presumed malignant pleural effusion (2.5L of exudative fluid was removed, however 3 sets of cytology all returned negative for malignant cells).
After pleurodesis, pt became tachycardic and tachypnic (to 120s and 30s) and was third spacing all of his fluid.
The pt gradually improved with decreasing oxygen requirement and was eventually weaned down to 3L NC at which point the pt was transferred to the floors to the OMED team on [**2116-11-26**].
As per interventional pulmonology, there are no further interventions planned.
PNA: The patient was thought to have a Community Acquired PNA vs post-obstructive PNA.
He was not neutropenic and was started on zosyn and finished an 11 day course on [**2116-11-29**].
He finished his abx and remained afebrile with normal WBC count on the floors.
On the floors, the patient was hemodynamically stable, maintaining good BP, and his normal hypertensive medications were re-started without complications.
Last CT Scan ([**8-31**]) with diffuse metastatic disease involving the mediastinum, hila, lungs, posterior left chest wall, resection bed, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and right superior pubic ramus, multiple pulmonary nodules are also seen in both lungs, and right kidney.
Review of his path report from skin sample (from [**7-12**]) revealed sarcomatoid features.
ANEMIA: The etiology of the patient's anemia is multifactorial including both Fe deficiency + thalassemia minor (dx via electropheresis).
The patient was on darvopoeitin q 2weeks  and he received two units of PRBC on [**2116-11-28**] and was transfused again on [**2116-12-1**] (2 units) as pt was intravascularly depleted with low protein state.
Also had Morphine prn for pain control.
The patient denies any pain or discomfort since admission to the floor.
Roxicet 5-325 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: [**5-28**] ml PO q1-3hours PRN as needed for pain and shortness of breath for 1 days.
Ipratropium Bromide 18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 2-3 puffs Inhalation every 6-8 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: VNA [**Location (un) 270**] East / Visitng Nurse Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Respiratory distress secondary to malignant pleural effusion Secondary: Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma, HTN, DMII   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your medication.
