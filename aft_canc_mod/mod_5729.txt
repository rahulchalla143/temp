Decompensated cirrhosis 2.
History of variceal bleeding s/p banding 4.
Renal insufficiency.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The aortic valve is not well seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Focal hematoma at the liver RFA site, with dependently layering blood products within the abdomen.
Contrast enhanced CT should be considered if continued hematocrit drop.
Volume overload with ascites, anasarca, and pleural effusions.
CTA A/P [**2-13**]: Active extravasation from the liver with increasing intra-abdominal blood.
Increased right-sided pleural effusion.
New left-sided pneumothorax.
Active arterial bleeding from the capsular branch of the right hepatic artery (replaced anatomy arising from the SMA) was detected on selective right hepatic artery catheterization.
Placement of triple-lumen 12 French trauma central venous access line into the right subclavian vein under ultrasound and fluoroscopic visualization.
MICRO: none  PATHOLOGY: Pnd  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, who initially presented to the hospital on [**2155-2-11**] for rehydration prior to a radiofrequency ablation of liver mass.
On [**2155-2-12**], he then proceeded to have his RFA of the liver mass.
Per d/w anesthesia attending, thought to have 30cc external loss, but reports of 300cc internally.
After a brief stay on the regular floor, patient was transfered to MICU due to hypotension, most likely due to continued bleeding.
Upon stabilization, patient underwent CTA (to confirm hepatic and rule out intercostal or abdominal wall source) prior to angiography.
Brought emergently to IR for transarterial gelfoam embolization of active right hepatic arterial extravasation (via replaced CHA from SMA).
Operative findings included massive ~10L intra-abdominal hematoma and active bleeding from liver.
Upon arrival, pt persistently hypotensive - despite continued transfusion of blood products and multiple pressor agents.
It was noted that within 1 hour, pt continued to put out over 1 L of frank blood from the right chest tube.
It appeared likely that continued hemorrhage was related to DIC/diffuse small vessel bleeding in setting severe, uncorrectable coagulopathy; However, consensus, multi-disciplinary opinion was that a large vessel thoracic injury could not be excluded.
Though prognosis was grim, decision was made to return to OR with thoracic surgery to evaluate for large vessel intra-thoracic injury.
In OR, pt had PEA arrest w initiation ACLS protocol.
Upon return to SICU with patient on multiple pressor agents and requiring massive transfusion of blood products to maintain volume in setting of diffuse massive hemorrhage/coagulopathy, family meeting was further undertaken with multiple attendings present.
Family apprised of terminal nature of day's events.
