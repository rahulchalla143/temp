>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
An intact JP #1 drained adequate output from the RLQ and JP #2 drained serosainguinous fluid from the LLQ.
The incision remained well approximated with staples and no drainage.
POD#8, first small loose bowel movement.
Frequent loose stools developed over the next 24 hours, he was treated with immodium prn with fair results.
Bowel function resumed on POD#13 with Staples were removed on POD#12, incision remained C/D/I, abdomen soft and nontender.
He was then transitioned to percocet po for pain control, with IV morphine injections for breakthrough pain until POD#7.
Cardiovascular: Pt was stable in NSR until POD #5 when he developed atrial fibrillation.
Foley was replaced, and output improved with fluid boluses.
On POD#13, urine culture revealed pseudomonas, and cefipime IV was initiated, and continued at home after DC x 7 days total.
Nutrition: TPN was started due to prolonged NPO status as a result of ileus.
