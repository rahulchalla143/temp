She remained hemodynamically stable and other than a single blood pressure drop to 70's systolic and few readings in the 90's systolic, there were no major hypotensive events.
She received about 300 ml LR and no colloids or blood products.
She received e-Aminocaproic acid before the case as a prophylaxis for her bleeding disorder, while her Lasix, Spironolactone and Nadolol were held.
She has been transfered to the West ICU team due to concern of renal failure and difficult to monitor fluid status in the setting of pulmonary HTN.
Patient states she states that she had one problem with renal failure in the past but it resolved on its own (in the setting of pneumonia).
She denied CP but reports some mild dyspnea which had been worsening since her surgery on [**4-30**].
She stated that her abdomen was much distended from baseline but better than it was before the paracentesis the morning of MICU transfer.

Blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly could reflect pleural effusion or pleural scarring.
Low lung volumes most likely account for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
No acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
MRI of head limited study -52 REDUCED SERVICES Study Date of [**2205-5-11**] 5:51 PM FINDINGS: This is a non-diagnostic and incomplete examination, the axial images demonstrate significant motion, however high-signal intensity is visualized in both basal ganglia, suggesting changes due to hepatic encephalopathy.
A trace of high signal intensity is demonstrated on FLAIR on the right insular region (image 12, 13, 14, series #7), suggesting possible proteinaceous material versus subarachnoid hemorrhage, please consider repeat examination under conscious sedation.
Bilateral opacities are demonstrated in the maxillary sinuses and left mastoid air cells.
Questionable high signal intensity demonstrated on the right insular region, suggesting proteinaceous material versus subarachnoid hemorrhage.
High-signal intensity visualized in the basal ganglia, these type of findings have been described in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2205-5-10**] 5:30 PM There is no intracranial hemorrhage, and no parenchymal edema or mass effect.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter are normal in attenuation, without evidence of territorial infarct on CT.
There are no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.
There is no shift of midline structures, and the basal cisterns remain patent.
There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified concerning for malignancy.
There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells, without osseous destruction.
There is complete opacification of the visualized left and right maxillary sinuses.
The sphenoid sinuses and ethmoid air cells are clear.
No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or other acute intracranial process.
Complete opacification of the right and left maxillary sinuses, progressed from [**2203-11-25**].
Clinically correlate to exclude acute sinusitis.
Partial left and right mastoid air cell opacification.
CXR [**5-3**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-15**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Prominence of interstitial markings is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure and renal failure.
More coalescent area of opacification at the right base medially could represent a supervening pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Patchy area of opacification in the left mid zone could also represent atelectasis or possible supervening pneumonia.
US abd [**5-3**] of note, discussed with rads and no evidence for hepatic vein obstruction.
FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates coarsened heterogeneous echotexture, consistent with known cirrhosis.
The gallbladder wall is edematous, likely secondary to third spacing.
Coarse heterogeneous hepatic echotexture, consistent with known cirrhosis.
Gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to third spacing.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: At least moderate (and probably severe) pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction and pressure/volume overload.
Moderate to severe functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Neither kidney demonstrates hydronephrosis, stones, or large masses.
IMPRESSION: Ascites, without evidence for renal abnormality.

# Acute Renal Failure: Acute renal failure, likely secondary to ATN, had resolved by time of discharge.
ATN may have been secondary to hypotensive episode in the OR during surgery.
# Pseudomonas Bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**5-4**] grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
She was initially treated with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl with concern for possible polymicrobial infection, but vancomycin and flagyl were tapered off after 5 days of persistently negative cultures.
# Delirium - On [**5-10**], pt became increasingly agitated and emotional, reportedly unable to sleep at all.
There was concern that perhaps this was a manic episode in the setting of taking citalopram for depression as this medication had apparently only been started several months back.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended haldol for agitation and to help w/sleep, minimizing interruptions.
Delirium work was initiated, including Head CT, blood and urine cultures, as well as chest Xray.
Head CT showed no acute process.
[**Name (NI) **] pt was agitated and had risk of bleeding due to bleeding diathesis, decision was made not to LP pt or do paracentesis (no fever or WBC elevation at that time, and she was covered with cefepime for pseudomonas).
One dose Haldol had improved agitation and pt was marginally able to partially tolerate a brain MRI but this was relatively unrevealing showing possible enhancement of basal ganglia often seen w/hepatic encephalopathy; however, pt's labs had generally shown improvement since leaving the ICU she did not have asterixis on exam.
Concern for infection was high given pt's immuno compromised state.
# Cirrhosis ??????
Concern for mild encephalopathy.
Pt remained stable w/out evidence of acute or worsening encephalopathy.
# Hypoxia: Pleural effusions improved with diuresis.
# Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial, secondary to decompensated cirrhosis, intravascular volume depletion, sepsis.
# Severe pulmonary hypertension: Chronic ongoing problem which would preclude liver transplantation.
Patient's home sildenafil was held in MICU and restarted on floor at home dose 10mg [**Hospital1 **]; however, in the setting of delirium and ?facial swelling (which pt had had in the past w/this medication), decision was made to stop sildenfil (see above).
# HPV: Patient was admitted for elective operative ablation of vulvar and anal dysplastic lesions on [**4-30**].
Path came back showing vulvar cancer which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107309**] discussed w/pt.
# Bleeding diathesis: Patient with long standing bleeding diathesis followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**].
No evidence of bleeding.
# CVID: long hx of infections.
# h/o high fungal markers: repeat beta glucan and galactomannan markers were sent and will be followed up by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**].
# depression: Citalopram was held after episode of delirium for concern of mania, but it will be restarted at 10mg daily on discharge, to be uptitrated to 20mg daily after a few days.
