There has been interval removal of various lines and tubes including a left-sided chest tube, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is persistent increased opacity in left retrocardiac region as well as a left pleural effusion.
There is an apparently new right pleural effusion, partially layering on this semi-upright study.

Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
