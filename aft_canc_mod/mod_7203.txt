Pertinent Results: ECHO ([**2129-9-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

CT Head ([**2129-9-15**]):  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarcts.
Small calcific density within the posterior left parietal lobe may represent old sequelae of infection, trauma, or thrombosed vascular anomaly.
There is pooling of secretions within the oropharynx consistent with patient's intubated status.
MRI/MRA ([**2129-9-20**]): No evidence for acute ischemia.
No evidence of abdominal or pelvic abscess.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is extensive degenerative change noted in the humeral head bilaterally.

While in the ICU she had a BAL which did not show any evidence of gram negative rods, which had been noted on a previous sputum.
Cultures from her sputum were negative for legionella, acid fast bacilli and PCP.
She then developed episodes of hypertension during sedative weaning.
Chest x-ray after extubation demonstrated evidence of mild pulmonary edema.
The patient also had a cardiac work-up to exclude acute coronary disease as well as an ECHO, which did not show any evidence of an acute process.
After extubation, her altered mental status persisted, prompting an evaluation by the Neurologists.
She had a negative head CT as well as an MRI which was also negative for any acute process.
The patient has baseline anemia which has been stable over the course of this admission.
The patient also experienced renal insufficiency which resolved with intravenous fluids to normal.
