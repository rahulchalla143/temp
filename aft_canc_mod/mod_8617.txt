Pt reports that he was in his usual state of health when he developed flu-like symptoms 4-5 days ago with myalgias, general malaise, and poor appetite.
He began to then have progressively worsening dyspnea, feeling short of breath even while walking to the restroom.
Of note, pt also states that he was diagnosed with a bacterial infection in his blood in [**2143**] and treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].
CT chest was performed at [**Hospital1 18**] after discharge for follow-up on [**2143-12-16**] that showed paraseptal/centrilobular emphysema (could not rule out neoplasm of left lower lobe), multiple pulmonary nodules.
Subsequent follow-up CT chest on [**2144-2-19**] showed decreased size of left lower lobe lesion and unchanged pulmonary nodules.

Bilateral mid and lower lung zone opacities are consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
There is mild vascular congestion and a small right pleural effusion as well as small amount of fluid in the major fissure.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral mid and lower lung zone opacities are consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Diffuse, centrilobular emphysema is moderately severe.
Bilateral, perihilar predominant ground-glass opacities and bibasal lung consolidations are present in the background of emphysema.
Differential diagnosis include resolving pulmonary edema or multifocal infection.
Though similar appearance can be seen in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, given the clinical history, it is less likely.
There is no pleural effusion  MEDIASTINUM: Main pulmonary artery proximal to its bifurcation measures 31 mm and is top normal.
There is no filling defect within main, lobar, segmental or subsegmental pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
Heart size is mildly enlarged.
There is no right heart strain or septal bulge.
There is no pericardial effusion.
BONES: There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy/infection.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities and bibasal consolidations likely reflect resolving pulmonary edema or multifocal lung infections.

Compared to most recent study, there is slight improvement in multifocal bilateral opacities.
No pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course: 55-year-old male with hx of HTN and hx of "bacterial infection in blood" in [**2143**] who presented today to ED with 4-5 days of worsening dyspnea, general malaise, and myalgias.
#Dyspnea: Pt was admitted with profound dyspnea, feeling SOB while ambulating to restroom.
CXR showed b/l mid and lower lung ground glass opacities.
CTA chest showed emphysema and bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities and bibasal consolidations likely reflect resolving pulmonary edema or multifocal lung infections.
Numerous labs were sent to further elucidate etiology of his multifocal pneumonia.
He underwent bronchoscopy [**2145-11-4**] as he was not showing improvement on treatment for CAP (continued fevers, continued hypoxia requiring 2-3L oxygen).
However, bronchoscopy had to be prematurely aborted as pt had oxygen desaturation to 70s.
He had been afebrile for >24hours by time of discharge and had completed a 10 day course of levofloxacin.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 39730**] was held due to hyponatremia during this admission.
He was instead started on losartan for BP control.
Pt appeared volume depleted on admission with urine electrolytes that were consistent with volume depletion.
#Bacteremia: Pt reported history of a "bacterial infection" treated at [**Hospital1 2025**] in late [**2142**]/early [**2143**].
Incidental finding on cxr during that hospitalization showed a pulmonary nodule which was followed up by a CT chest in [**12/2143**] and [**2-/2144**] showing left lower lobe consolidation and multiple nodules.
#GERD: Pt reported symptoms of heartburn during hospital stay.
