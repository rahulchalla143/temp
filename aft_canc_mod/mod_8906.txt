You were admitted because of recent dehydration and poor appetite as well as increased back pain.
You were also admitted for further evaluation of the lung mass that was recently found on CT scan.
We made the following changes to your medications: (1) We started Tylenol to be taken three times per day for pain (2) We started oxycodone 2.5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain -> this medication can be constipating so it is important to take stool softeners -> We started Colace and Senna (3) We started Zofran 4 mg to be taken every 8 hours as needed for nausea (4) Started pantoprazole which helps protect you for further bleeding from your stomach.
(5) Started lidocaine patch for pain control.
