Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 74199**] is a 55 year old man with a history of CML status post allogeneic SCT complicated by GVHD of skin/gut on immunosuppression who was admitted with RSV bronchiolitis that was then complicated by hospital acquired pneumonia.
During this admission the following issues were addressed:  # Hypoxia: On admission the pt had a positive RSV assay on rapid respiratory viral nasopharyngeal aspirate.
The pt did not have evidence of lower lung disease and his chest x-ray on admission did not reveal an infiltrate.
During the admission the pt required multiple transfers to the ICU for hypoxia, and was diagnosed with hospital acquired pneumonia and treated with Cefepime and Vancomycin initially.
The pt then developed a diffuse morbilloform eruption that was attributed to Cefepime, and the antibiotic regimen for hospital-acquired pneumonia was changed to Linezolid, Aztreonam, Cipro and Flagyl per infectious disease recommendations.
The pt was treated with a total 14-day course and on discharge he was able to breathe comfortably on room air and did not have any oxygen desaturations on ambulation.
