Admission Date:  [**2180-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-4-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info **] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old man with lung cancer with brain metastases previously on anticoagulation for [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU from the SICU in the setting of arrythmias, most prominently tachyarrythmias, who originally presented to medical care on [**8-17**] late morning after being found by his family, lying down on the sidewalk outside of his home, minimally responsive.
He awoke at the scene complaining of headache and left shoulder pain.
He was taken to [**Hospital 6136**] Hospital; and then taken by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] after a CT showed extensive acute ICH.
An EKG there showed sinus rhythm, with an S in I and a Q in III, with prominent upright T waves in precordial leads and no indication of ischemia.
He reportedly started the flight being AOx3 and following commands and then deteriorated into lethargy and minimal responsiveness.
Of note, his INR was 3.7 on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] consistent with coumadin taken regularly at home for known PE in [**2179-12-30**].
Ultimately, neurosurgery decided to observe the patient, start seizure prophylaxis, normalize INR (with a recommendation to avoid anticoagulation for one month) with no indication for neurosurgical intervention.
He was diagnosed with a left humeral fracture for which orthopedics recommended splint.
Of note in terms of his functional status prior to the event, he had not had recent falls prior to this.
However, prior to his diagnosis with brain mets, he had a persistent cough and had some prior episodes, unwitnessed by family and only uncovered in retrospect, in which he coughed violently and then fell down, perhaps similar to this presentation.
He was until this admission able to perform basic ADLs, ambulating, toileting, eating, etc; though with low energy and slow mobility.

Pertinent Results: LEFT SHOULDER, THREE VIEWS [**2180-8-17**]: There is a fracture involving the proximal shaft of the left femur.
There is displacement by approximately one shaft width with apex lateral angulation of the fracture site.
CT OSH(1227 [**8-17**]): "extensive acute ICH identified which all appears to be extra-xial and is most prominent superficial to the anterior left frontal lobe, but there is less extensive acute ICH along the right anterolateral aspect of the suprasellar cistern, right side of the anterior cranial fossa, left ambient cistern, along the adjacent left tentorium cerebelli, and along the sulcus posterior right frontal lobe".
CT/CTA([**Hospital1 18**]): Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural blood measuring up to 6mm and layering along the falx.
No signficant mass effect.
No intraventricular hemorrhage.
5 x 9 mm focus of hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe.
No e/o aneurysm or vascular abnl.
Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma without evidence of significant mass effect.
Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left perimesencephalic cistern.
Previously noted left frontal hypodensity and subarachnoid hemorrhages as well as intraventricular hemorrhage are again seen.
Mild vasospasm is identified more predominantly in the left middle cerebral artery and the main divisions of middle cerebral artery.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to inferior posterior hypokinesis Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**2180-8-25**]): No gross aspiration or penetration.

He also sustained a left humeral fracture that was splinted by ortho trauma.
On [**8-18**] he was found to have a left lower lobe mass.
On [**8-19**], the patient was extubated and placed on nimodipine for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
On [**8-20**], cardiology was consulted for arrthymias seen on telemetry and nimoedipine was discontinued, as no vasospasm was seen on CTA.
It's still unclear why the patient fell initially--the differential includes seizure, arrythmia, hypoxia secondary to cigarette smoking/lung CA.
As his coumadin had to be discontinued, the patient had an IVC filter placed while admitted.
Arrhthymias: The patient had several episodes of atrial tachycardia while on telemetry, as well as one episode of bradycardia.
This was likely atrial fibrillation secondary to the stress of acute event.
Cardiology was also concerned that additional anti-arrythmic intervention would increase his risk for bradycardia, of which the patient had only one concerning episode but which would ultimately likely be more problem[**Name (NI) 115**] than his well-perfusing tachycardia.
The patient had a chest CT, showing 8 cm mass of the left lower lobe growing into the left main stem bronchus and associated with complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
This mass may contribute to future respiratory compromise via obstruction or subsequent pneumonia--however, the patient remained stable from a respiratory stand-point throughout his hospitalization, with 02 saturations >95% on room air and without respiratory distress.
In the future, if the patient develops respiratory distress, intervention on the bronchial mass could be considered by interventional pulmonology with stenting or phototherapy.
Fever: the patient became febrile on the floor, spiking fevers of up to 101.3 (PO) on multiple occasions.
Although he had no obvious source, with a negative UA and indeterminate CXR showing extensive left lung collapse and effusion, the patient was begun on coverage for ventilator associated pneumonia with IV Cefepime, Vanc, and Flagyl, given his increased risk from recent intubation.
The patient had been afebrile for 24 hours at discharge after 3 days of antibiotics.
He had a video swallow which showed no aspiration.
