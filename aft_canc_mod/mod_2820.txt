CFA-akpop-at w NRSVG,angioscopy and valve lysis [**2179-4-27**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 66yo F with history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease who presents with 6 weeks history of bilateral medial malleoulus ulcers (complicated by recent PTA fracture) and bilateral lower extremities cellulitis(R>L).
In pre-op assessment by medicine, she noted to have abnormal pMIBI   Past Medical History: 1.CHF 2.myelodysplasia with refractory anemiarequiring transfusion and procrit 3.hypercholesterolemia 4.diabetes on oral hypoglycemics 5.s/p CVA 14years ago(no residual weakness) 6.peripheral vascular disease 7.CAD 8.gout 9.partial thyroidectomy 10.HITT   Social History: retired medical transciptionistlives alone lives alone neg etoh neg ivda neg tob   Family History: deferred  Physical Exam: Vital signs of 98.5, 96, 22, blood pressure of 146/82, oxygen saturation of 95%.
General appearance is a very pleasant white female in no acutedistress.
Chest exam reveals lungs are with crackles bilaterally at the bases.
HEENT exam shows bilateral carotid bruits and JVD.
Extremity exam with 2+ edema bilaterally with shallow ulcerations on the medial aspect of both ulcerations.
Pertinent Results: echo [**4-7**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional akinesis of the distal half of the septum, severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall, and mild apical dyskinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Moderate, reversible defect involving the mid and distal inferolateral wall.
Moderate, partially reversible defect involving the apex.
Moderate, reversible defect involving the mid and distal anteroseptal wall.
Transient left ventricular dilatation with stress.
Global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 29%.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (or other diffuse process; in the absence of a history of systolic hypertension, an infiltrative process should be considered).
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
arterial study [**2179-4-6**] Moderate diffuse calcified plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
Significant aorto-right iliac and bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusive disease.ABI right 0.83, left 0.66  cath [**4-13**]: CO/CI 4.37/2.73 PCWP 36 CVP 19 PAP 67/32 LMCA-OK LAD-mid 99%, distal TO, D1 70% prox LCX-30% prox, 50% before OM1 RCA-90% after AM 3VD with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/D1 and PCA LAD, partially successful PTCA RCA  Vein mapping [**4-26**]  TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale examination was performed at the level of the superficial veins of the bilateral upper extremities with compression maneuvers.
Their caliber varies between 2.8 mm and 4.2 mm for the right cephalic vein, between 1.5 and 3.9 mm for the right basilic vein, between 2.3 and 3.0 mm for the left cephalic vein, and between 2.6 and 4.7 mm for the left basilic vein.
CONCLUSION: Pre-operative vein mapping with patency of the bilateral cephalic and basilic veins and dimensions as stated above.
Cardiology medicine was requested to see the patient because of her congestive heart failure on admission chest x-ray.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of congestive heart failure.
The patient an echocardiogram done which showed symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional systolic dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or other diffuse process.
In the absence of systolic hypertension and infiltrative process should be considered.
There is moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular cavity is enlarged, free wall is hypokinetic.
The stress perfusion images showed a moderate reduction in tracer distribution involving the mid and distal inferolateral wall.
Stress perfusion images additionally demonstrate a moderate defect in the tracer uptake of the apex, and this defect was partially reversible.
The stress also demonstrated moderately reversible defects in the mid and distal anteroseptal wall.
Once the patient was compensated for her congestive heart failure and her renal function stabilized, she underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2179-4-13**] with documented 3- vessel disease with markedly elevated and right and left- sided filling pressures.
She required a transfusion for a low hematocrit.
This was related to her chronic myelodysplasia disorder.
There was a small pericardial effusion.
There was no echocardiographic sign of tamponade.
The patient did experience contrast renal failure post cardiac catheterization and required aggressive treatment for hyperkalemia.
The patient was seen by the orthopaedic service for her ankle fracture.
Recommendations were bivalved cast with nonweightbearing and that further surgical orthopaedic intervention would be done after her cardiac and peripheral vascular problems were addressed.
The patient will return on [**4-26**] to be readmitted for elective revascularization of the right lower extremity on [**2179-4-27**].
