Patient states that since [**Month (only) 547**] he has been experiencing worsening left sided chest pain that radiates to his arm and diaphoresis.
Today, pain was elicited on his walk from the parking lot to the front door of the hospital.
He denies LE swelling, but has PND.
He had a recent stress MIBI, 9min, had [**8-21**] CP w/ 0.5mm horizontal STD II, III, avf, v5-6, new partial reversible defect at the distal anterior wall and apex 2, stable severe apical and moderate septal fixed defects and global hypokinesis with LVEF of 37%.
Upon stent deployment the LMCA was dissected, pt c/o CP and nausea had sbp of 75.
A second stent was crossed and his symptoms resolved.
On transfer he was hemodynamically stable and in no distress/pain.
He denied any chest pain, sob, or discomfort.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CAD s/p anterior MI [**2090**], s/p LAD and OM1 stents [**2093**].
ETT MIBI [**5-/2093**] with stable severe fixed defect at distal anterior wall, mod fixed septal defect 3.
CHF - EF 30-35% [**2099-2-2**] echo 4. hypertension 5. peptic ulcer disease 6. hyperlipidemia 7. h/o positive PPD 8. diverticulosis on colonoscopy [**10-16**] 9. colonic polyps 10. hemorrhoidal bleeding   Social History: The patient lives with his wife, daughter, and 2 grandchildren.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
R groin site c/d/i, bandaged SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
# CORONARIES:  Patient with known CAD p/w worsening sx and reversible defect in the distal anterior wall on perfusion scan s/p 2 promus stent to prox and distal LAD and 1 stent to LM.
# RHYTHM:  in sinus, no history of arrhythmias.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded in addition to distal left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Significant systemic hypertension.
Emergent PTCA/stenting of the unprotected LMCA due to dissection secondary to guiding catheter with a Promus OTW 3.5x12mm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-dilated with a 4.0 then 4.5 balloon.
Your vitals were stable overnight and you had no chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty walking around.
