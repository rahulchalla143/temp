His hospital course was complicated by hypotension and possible GI infection necessitating a short stay in the ICU, but pt recovered and was discharged in stable condition.
However, pt became hypotensive requiring dopamine with initial episode of A fib on [**7-17**] and occ V tach.
However, the patient continued to have hypotensive episodes as well as tachycardia and was eventually transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-20**].
Additionally, surgery was consulted on [**7-20**] for abdominal pain with concern for ischemic bowel given hypotension and elevated lactate, but surgical intervention was indicated at that time.
Finally, Nephrology was consulted for the management of his hypernatremia and renal failure.
Renal failure thought to be due to IL-2 coupled with ATN and hypernatremia due to volume depletion.
MICU course was also complicated by pleural effusion (tapped) and coagulopathy ( INR increased to 3) thought to be due to IL-2 therapy.
TPN was started on [**7-22**] for poor oral intake and rapid weight loss.
GI infection: pt had concern of an abdominal infection given elevated lactat, abdominal pain and leucocytosis.
Pt's symptoms of abdominal pain resolved and pt was able to eat regular diet and was afebrile.
Acute renal failure- Pt had significant elevation of creatinine while hospitalized (max of 7.1) that was thought to be due to IL-2 therapy with potential element of ATN.
Additionally pt had hypernatremia that was managed with free water boluses and encouraging PO water intake.
AFIB WITH RVR: Pt initially found to have A fib on [**7-17**] that spontaneously converted.
Pt did not have episodes of tachycardia.
PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pt initially had pleural effusion on [**7-14**].
Pt again had thoracocentesis once on oncology floor as pt was short of breath and it was done for symptomatic relief.
Pt was able to be weaned to room air without hypoxia on discharge.
Exam continued to be suggestive for pleural effusion on discharge, but given that the patient was asymptomatic no repeat thoracocentesis was done.
The repeat tap appeared to be exudative likely malignant given multiple pulmonary masses.
Pt will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] for further management of his renal cell carcinoma.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.

While you were here,  you were cared for in the ICU for low blood pressure and kidney failure.
Please call your physician or go to the ER if you have: * Fever or chills * Severe nausea or vomiting * Shortness of breath * Chest pain * Any other concerning symptom  Followup Instructions: You should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] on [**8-12**] for follow up appointment at 5:00 PM.
