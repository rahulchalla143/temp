HISTORY:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of mild asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic pain who presents with new onset of ascites and elevated CA125 level.
Her evaluation in the outpatient setting included a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which confirmed a large intraperitoneal ascites without other abnormalities.
The course and progression of the patient's ascites development was concerning for ovarian cancer.
When the patient presented on [**2170-12-20**] to the preoperative holding area, she complained of mild shortness of breath.
She had recently been treated with antibiotics for a presumed upper respiratory tract infection and had continued her outpatient asthma care.
The preoperative assessment was a mild asthmatic exacerbation.
Though more aggressive care would be necessary to optimize the patient's pulmonary status intraoperatively and postoperatively, postponement of the surgery was not considered as the optimal treatment of the patient's acute condition of ascites requiring more immediate diagnosis and intervention given the high suspicion for ovarian cancer.
The estimated blood loss was 150 cc.
The findings included the following:  Large ascites, normal upper abdominal survey, normal omentum, normal bowel, normal uterus, tubes and ovaries, no peritoneal seedings, no palpable lymphadenopathy.
Immediately postoperatively extubation was not successful due to significant tachypnea in the setting of the patient's underlying pulmonary disease.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit overnight for observation and management of her pulmonary condition.
As an outpatient she was managed with 60 mg of OxyContin tid for her chronic pain condition.
This regimen successfully controlled the patient's pain and she was discharged on this regimen.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5166**] in [**5-29**] days for a wound check and staple removal.
