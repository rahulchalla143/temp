Admission Date:  [**2149-4-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-4-16**]   Service:  MICU/GREEN  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87 year old woman with a history of lung cancer, status post resection and radiation therapy admitted to an outside hospital with shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral infiltrates and new endobronchial lesion.
The patient while in the hospital had an episode of hemoptysis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Here the patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy which showed a new left lower lobe endobronchial mass.
The failure to wean was deemed most likely due to an interstitial lymphangitic spread of the patient's lung cancer in addition to the hypoxemia induced by endobronchial lesion and hemoptysis.
