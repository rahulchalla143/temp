He got a CTA for syncope and a mass was found in his pancrease with similar liver masses.
Biopsy showed moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with upper GI origin.
In the ED, he was complaining of LE edema over the last few weeks.
He had guaiac positive stool and repeat hct went to 26, so he was admitted to the ICU and GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] who agreed to scope in the morning.
ROS: He complains of [**5-10**] abdominal pain in the RLQ worse with cough that is occasionally productive.

No adenopathy Bone scan- no osseous metastatic disease  Radiology [**Hospital1 18**] [**4-12**] Chest CT: Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is slightly limited due to non-optimal timing of contrast bolus, however, the main and subsegmental branches of the pulmonary vessels appear patent without filling defects bilaterally.
A 3.5 mm pulmonary nodule was noted within the right upper lobe with an additional 1-2 mm pulmonary nodule was noted within the right middle lobe (2:27, 30).
A slightly likely calcified nodule is identified more medially within the right middle lobe (2:27) likely representing calcified granuloma.
A 3-mm nodule was noted along the major fissure in the left lobe (2:33) with an additional 2-3 mm nodules noted more posteriorly within the left lower lobe (2:33,37).
There are areas of bilateral dependent and subsegmental atelectasis within the lower lobes with no enlarged pericardial or pleural effusion identified.
There are calcifications noted within the LAD and circumflex vessels.
[**4-12**] CT abdomen/pelvis: There is diffusely infiltrating hypoattenuating liver lesions consistent with extensive metastatic disease.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is identified in the portal and hepatic veins appear patent.
A 2.6 x 2.8 cm hypoattenuating pancreatic tail mass is identified with a probable necrotic center just adjacent to the splenic hilum.
Remaining pancreatic parenchyma appears unremarkable.
There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation.
A small splenule is noted adjacent to a normal appearing spleen.
Multiple collateral vessels and gastric varices are noted throughout the abdomen related to thrombosis noted within the distal splenic vein with patent splenic hilum vessels and recanalization more proximally.
There is a slightly prominent retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, however, none meet CT criteria for pathologically enlarge.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is a moderate amount of ascites noted throughout the abdominal cavity with no free air noted.
Small amount of free fluid is noted within the pelvic cavity with the intrapelvic bowel, prostate, and urinary bladder appearing otherwise unremarkable.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.
There is evidence of colonic diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
[**2114-4-13**] MRI/A Head: No evidence of acute infarct.
Chronic right-sided basal ganglia lacune.
No enhancing brain lesions, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
[**4-15**] CTA Chest Filling defect is seen in a left lower lobe pulmonary artery segment consistent with pulmonary embolism.
More subtle filling defect in right lower lobe suggests possible pulmonary emboli on the right side.
Multiple sub- centimeter pulmonary nodules are again seen bilaterally, little change from study three days prior.
Wedge shaped linear opacities at the bases suggest infarct vs. atelectasis.
Limited views of the upper abdomen again demonstrate multiple low-attenuation lesions scattered throughout the liver consistent with metastatic disease.
Free fluid again seen within the abdomen.
No new suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified within the osseous structures.
Pathology: Cell block, peritoneal fluid: Rare atypical degenerated epithelioid cells present singly and in clusters, in a background of mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old male with newly diagnosed metastatic adenocarcinoma (likely pancreatic in origin) admitted with gastrointestinal bleed.
Hospital course notable for pulmonary embolism and rapidly declining performance status.
He underwent an EGD, which revealed portal gastropathy, likely due to large metastatic burden in liver along with splenic vein thrombosis.
2) Pulmonary embolism: Following transfer to the general medical floor, given persistent sinus tachycardia and mild oxygen requirement, a chest CTA was obtained, which revealed a LLL pulmonary embolism.
However, given recent significant upper GI bleed requiring ICU admission and high risk for recurrent bleeding due to known portal gastropathy, an IVC filter was placed on [**2114-4-18**].
3) Metastatic pancreatic CA (liver/lung): CA [**25**]-9 [**Numeric Identifier 71783**].
Because of this and his poor prognosis (rising liver function tests, new renal failure), the decision was made with the family and patient to pursue hospice care as home as he was unlikely to become strong enough to be eligible for palliative chemotherapy.
4) Ascites: The patient underwent a paracentesis [**4-17**]; analysis was consistent with portal hypertension without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
5) Type II DM poorly controlled with complications: The patient's glargine dose was titrated to 34 units qhs.
Lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily) as needed for low back pain.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.

Please return to the hospital if you are experincing pain or shortness of breath that cannot be controlled with medications at home.
