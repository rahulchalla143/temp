Admission Date:  [**2111-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-5-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zestril  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Ventricular tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2111-10-13**] - Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63M with ALS, HIV on HAART with undetectable VL (per pt), hepatitis C, recent diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma admitted to [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital from home on [**10-10**] with left sided weakness, slurred speach, and altered mental status.
He was evaluated by [**Month/Year (2) **], head CT negative, head MRI/MRA with old small vessel disease with no acute infarction.
[**Month/Year (2) 878**] thought may have been TIA or possibly worsening of ALS.
Then on the evening of [**10-12**] when eating a [**Location (un) 6002**], telemetry alarmed for 2 minute episode of ventricular tachycardia per report (rhythm strip not included in OSH records).
RN responded and found patient with mouth full of food, cleared airway, patient started taking shallow breaths, was diaphoretic and complained on non-specific pain.
There were no compressions or shocks administered as he spontaneously converted to SR. EKG after the event reported to have ST elevation V1-V4.
He informed the ICU team that was having chest pain on transfer.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Periventricular white matter hypoattenuation about the frontal horns likely represent small vessel ischemic disease.

No evidence of hemorrhage or fracture.
Moderate cerebral parenchymal involution and small vessel ischemic disease.
Right maxillary and sphenoid sinus disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: =================================== 63M with ALS, HIV on HAART with undetectable VL (per pt), hepatitis C (written in records, antibody positive, reported by primary care physician as not having hepatitis), recent diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma admitted to [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital  and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following presumed episode of ventricular tachycardia.
ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== # WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA - Patient presented without a known history of coronary artery disease with largely preserved EF on most recent available echocardiogram from his outside hospital.
He was presumed to have sustained wide complex tachycardia with an episode of unresponsiveness at the outside hospital.
He did not receive shocks or resuscitation at that time.
It was possible that it was a primary ischemic cardiac event.
It is also possible that it was a non-cardiac event such as respiratory arrest due to obstructed airway, from a food bolus.
Regardless, the patient had anterior EKG changes and an elevated Troponin indicating myocardial infarction likely in the LAD territory versus myocarditis.
His cardiac cath ([**10-13**]) showed no evidence of significant coronary disease, however.
He also had a 2D-Echo on [**10-13**] which showed moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 30%.
We also uptitrated his beta-blocker to 75 mg by mouth three times daily with good effect, given some tachycardia and hypertension.
We also considered placement of an ICD given his inferior or inferolateral hypokinesis and presumed V.tach event, but this must be weighed against life expectancy given his esophageal adenocarcinoma and progressive ALS diagnosis.
He was not started on any anti-arrhythmics and had no further issues with dysrrhythmia.
# ASPIRATION - The patient presented with a mild oxygen requirement and decreased breath sounds at bases with CXR showing bibasilar haziness concerning for aspiration pneumonitis.
He remained afebrile and without leukocytosis.
We did start utilizing his PEG tube this admission and speech and swallow evaluation noted the need for thin liquids and soft-moist consistency diet given his risk of aspiration.
# Acute Encephalopathy ??????
He began to develop agitation in the evenings with some delirium noted on HOD#2.
An infectious work-up showed a reassuring urinalysis and his urine and blood cultures were reassuring; a CXR was reassuring.
We also dosed low dose Seroquel in the evenings for agitation with some benefit.
# FALL - He had a likely mechanical fall in the setting of his ALS and trying to use the bathroom by himself on the evening of [**2111-10-18**].
Head CT was negative for fracture or intracranial bleeding.
No other injuries were sustained.
# HYPERTENSION - Evidence of elevated systolic pressures even when not agitated.
# ALS - stable disease without current issues; we continued Rilutek.
# ESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA - seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD (Thoracic Surgery) in [**8-/2111**] who said he was non-operative and could benefit from radiation; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Heme-Onc saw him as well - patient not likely chemoradiation therapy candidate given other co-morbidities and patient disinterest in aggressive therapy; will need repeat endoscopy and EUS in [**2-18**] months for re-evaluation of disease progression.
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE (EF 30%): Nonischemic cardiomyopathy given clean coronaries.
# GERD - We continued his Omeprazole without issue.

You were admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CCU) at [**Hospital1 69**] on CC7 regarding management of a presumed atypical heart rhythm.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed no evidence of significant coronary disease.
You also had an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) which showed a low ejection fracture and some heart failure.
You did have some issues with agitation and delirium, which was attributed to your intensive care unit stay.
