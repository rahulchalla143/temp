He has also had some intermittent nausea, but not vomiting.
The patient went to see his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2109-7-12**] due to his continued brusing.
He had blood work performed that showed pancytopenia and was advised to go to the ED.
He has complaints of mild headache, but no numbness or weakness.

[**2109-8-23**] Bronchial washings cytology: Clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli, favor reactive pneumocytes.
Interval worsening of multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, as described above, consistent with progression of a multifocal infectious process.
Stable small left pleural effusion.
[**2109-8-16**] Ankle xray: FINDINGS: A frontal and lateral view (note that no mortise view was performed) of the right ankle were performed, without evidence of fracture, effusion, or significant soft tissue abnormality.
Minimal degenerative changes seen at the talonavicular and intertarsal joints.
No significant interval change.
[**2109-8-16**] Lower extremity US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
Small amount of fluid in the right medial ankle joint.
- DISORDERED MYELOID MATURATION IS PRESENT.
- NO DEFINITIVE MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA SEEN.
[**2109-8-14**] sputum: Highly atypical squamous cells, suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma .
[**2109-8-13**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Resolving small left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, without evidence of new hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality.
Technically suboptimal study, nevertheless, with evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli including probable right main pulmonary artery embolus as characterized above.
In light of patient's clinical history, these findings may represent progression of infectious process with some possible component of infarction.
[**2109-8-6**] colonic biopsy to eval diarrhea: no abnormalities.
Patchy ground-glass opacities throughout the left upper and left lower lobes as well as a few areas in the right lung, differential includes atypical infectious process versus alveolar hemorrhage; this appearance is largely unchanged from previous study.
No evidence for abscess or acute infectious process.
Slight interval worsening of diffuse ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe and right upper lobe with slight interval improvement in the left upper lobe.
While atypical infectious etiologies (ie PCP) could have a similar appearance, given bronchoscopy findings, this is most consistent with ongoing/recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Interval development of multiple small nodular densities in the bilateral lower lobes.
This is not consistent with hemorrhage, and most likely reflects a superimposed atypical infectious process.
In particular, fungal etiologies should be considered, as well as a possibility of small septic emboli.
[**2109-7-26**] CT head without contrast: IMPRESSION: Expected evolution of small left occipital parenchymal hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality.
Atypical pneumonia or hemorrhage, predominantly left lung.
Enlarged left paratracheal lymph node.
[**2109-7-15**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-20**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased (at least mild on review of the prior study).
Biventricular systolic function remains preserved.
Trace aortic regurgitation is also now present.
[**2109-7-13**] CT head: 6 mm left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with minimal amount of surrounding edema.
[**2109-8-29**]: RPR non-reactive .

BURGDORFERI DETECTED BY EIA [**2109-8-7**]: no virus isolated from Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture, Source: Nasopharyngeal swab [**2109-8-5**]: stool viral cx negative [**2109-8-2**]: CMV VL negative [**8-1**], [**7-28**], [**7-27**], [**7-26**]: stool neg for Cdiff [**2109-7-25**]: BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE negative for respiratory viral Ag, no CMV   Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o male who p/w bruising, increasing fatigue, night sweats, and labs suggestive of low grade DIC, diagnosed with APML, s/p 7+4 induction with cytarabine and daunarubicin then ATRA, in morphologic CR in bone marrow prior to discharge, with hospital course complicated by fevers, multifocal pna, bilateral PE's, ?alveolar hemorrhage, atypical squamous cells in sputum, gout, norovirus diarrhea, and genital HSV2.
Pt also started on dexamethasone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] as prophylaxis against ATRA syndrome, as on [**7-15**] the patient became short of breath and CXR showed pulmonary congestion.
His ATRA was continued until [**7-31**], when it was held due to severe diarrhea that was thought to be possibly secondary to the ATRA.
ATRA re-started on [**2109-8-6**], when diarrhea was resolving and noted to be norovirus, as seen by positive EIA.
On [**2109-8-15**], BM biopsy showing no morphologic evidence of myelogenous leukemia.
# Intracerebral hemorrhage: pt noted to have 6x6 mm left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with minimal amount of surrounding edema.
No mass effect found.
On repeat imaging [**2109-8-13**], prior ICH noted to be "resolving small left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, without evidence of new hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality.
No new hemorrhage detected."
# Fevers: DDX included elusive infection vs. drug reaction vs. ATRA side effect.
Patient had intermittent fevers throughout hospitalization, most likely felt to be from multifocal pna vs. side effect of ATRA, as his microbiology and bronchoscopy work-up were largely negative.
He was afebrile x 4-5 days.
# Multifocal pneumonia: imaging showing multifocal consolidative and ground glass opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, consistent with multifocal infectious process, requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer at one point (on 4-5L NC).
Clinical picture worsened while patient's counts were coming back.
He never required intubation and was weaned off of O2 without difficulty.
Given his aspergillus versicolor positive fungal culture on [**8-17**], patient will continue PO voriconazole 400 mg Q12 for 11 more days on discharge.
# Atypical squamous cells in sputum: noted on [**2109-8-14**] sputum sample.
Bronchoscopy washings for cytology done [**2109-8-23**] showing "clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli, favor reactive pneumocytes."
ENT evaluation did not reveal any mucosal changes.
# Bilateral PE's: pt became hypoxic, and diagnosed with PE as seen on [**2109-8-12**] imaging study.
# Gout: patient developed R ankle joint pain, mild erythema, and warmth in RLE.
R ankle imaging showed no fx, effusion, or soft tissue abnormality.
Rheumatology was consulted and performed joint tap, which was negative for septic arthritis/infection and no crystals were noted.
Patient subsequently developed L great toe pain, with erythema and warmth, suggestive of podagra.
# Diarrhea: not felt to be Cdiff given three to four negative Cdiff samples.
Initially ATRA held from [**Date range (1) 14008**] (due to large volume diarrhea >5L/day).
Of note, stool sample returned positive for norovirus EIA.
# Hemoptysis/alveolar hemorrhage: bronch [**7-25**] for hemoptysis showed increasingly bloody return suggestive of ?alveolar hemorrhage, although CT with predominant pathology in left lung which would be unusual for DAH.
Initially ATRA side effect suspected, but this seems less likely given the unilateral distribution.
# Chronic back pain - continued home oxycodone and oxycontin .
# Rash - the patient developed a diffuse morbilliform rash on his buttocks, inguinal region and his back that was consistent with a drug reaction.
# Genital HSV2: patient noted to have three lesions on the penis concerning for HSV vs. syphilis.
Patient started on valtrex 1 g [**Hospital1 **] until resolution of all lesions.
