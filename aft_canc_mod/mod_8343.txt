He was trace guiac positive on rectal exam.
He was taken to EGD today but unable to get the procedure [**2-20**] acute onset of low back pain.
On floor eval, patient denied any further chest, back, or abdominal discomfort, cough, diarrhea.
He had some recent dysuria and hematuria.

Elevated homocysteine 9.
GI bleeding 14.
He has been working in a pharmacy since the age of 12, and after graduating from high school ([**Location (un) 86**] English High School) and college, he attended [**State 350**] College of Pharmacy and was a pharmacist in [**Location (un) 86**] for 56 years and retired 10-12 years ago.
Father was a smoker who died in his 60s of lung cancer 2.
Mother suffered from chronic peripheral edema and died in her 80s of MI 3. a sister died of liver cancer 4. another sister had a blood disorder: patient could not recall the name Patient reports no family history of colon cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes, CAD, or depression.
No conjunctival pallor.
L eye red, No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
JVP= 9cm LUNGS: good air movement biaterally, crackles heard b/l bases ABDOMEN: NABS.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Studies: [**2113-2-9**] CXR: Patchy opacity within the left lower lobe which could represent atelectasis or aspiration with associated small pleural effusion.
Normal kidneys without hydronephrosis or calculi.
Pancreatic head calcifications, which can be seen as sequelae of chronic pancreatitis.
No evidence of acute pancreatitis.
Extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Unchanged cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Splenic calcifications consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
Redemonstration of atherosclerotic calcification throughout the aorta and major branches.
[**2112-2-13**] Echo:The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.1cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for comparison) of [**2110-12-3**], the ventricle is less vigorous, but without definite regional dysfunction.
The severity of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation are similar.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
[**2113-2-13**] CXR: Consolidation at the left lung base has progressed with a persistent small left pleural effusion.
The right lung remains clear, and there is no pneumothorax.
[**2112-2-14**] EGD: small dulefoy lesion coiled colonoscopy:2 sessile polyps removed, pathology pending   Brief Hospital Course: This 88M with h/o afib on warfarin, CAD, AS, and GIV presented with 2 dark BM worked up for GI bleed with complicated hospital course by urosepsis.
# GI bleed: Admitted with 2 dark guiac positive stools on coumadin.
Had been worked up prior for massive GI bleeds with no etiology found.
First scope attempt was [**2113-2-8**] but patient developed acute back pain.
When called out of MICU, underwent colonoscopy which showed two polyps that were removed and an EGD which showed dulefoy lesion likely accounting for guaic positive stools, subsequently clipped.
#Bacteremia/hypotension: Most likely secondary to E coli urosepsis(Blood and urine cultures positive) Patient transferred to MICU where CVL was placed and Ceftriaxone was started.
There was concern over pneumonia on CXR but the L lung base opacity was stable and more likely to represent atelectasis vs. small pleural effusion.
He does have any upper resp symptoms or fever with improving leukocytosis so more likely to be atelectasis, possibly volume overload more likely than pneumonia.
# CHF: Echo from [**11-24**] LVEF 55%, slightly volume overloaded by exam, BNP in 6000s which is at baseline.
Repeat echo "the ventricle is less vigorous, but without definite regional dysfunction.
The severity of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation are similar" EF 50-55%, held lasix.
Remained mostly euvolemic except some trace pretibial edema which improved with elevation.
# Blue fingers: likely vasoconstriction, concern for cold blue but blanching fingers for ischemia, but no signs of embolic lesions, consider cryoglobulinemia which was pending upon discharge.
EP consulted for concern over pacemaker but will hold off for now as he is asymptomatic and pauses <3sec.
#CAD: no chest pain, no acute EKG change, cardiac enzymes stable, monitored on tele.
Ultram  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: All Care VNA of Greater [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: GI bleed bradycardic atrial fibrillation urosepsis .
Secondary Diagnosis: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after your had a large dark bowel movement which was concerning for bleeding from your GI tract.
We also had the cardiologist come assess you because of your slow rhythm.
You also stayed in the intensive care unit because you developed a urinary tract infection and bacteria got into your blood stream.
We stopped your coumadin since you have now had multiple episodes of recurrent GI bleeding and the risks to bleed again are much greater than your overall risk for stroke.
If you develop any of the following, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or increasing dark bowel movements please call your doctor or go to your local emergency room.
