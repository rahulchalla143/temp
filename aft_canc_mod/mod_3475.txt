1) Shortness of breath -Contributing factors include large ascites as well as metabolic acidosis due to uremia and cachexia causing decreased respiratory muscle strength.
He was treated with paracentesis and removal of 7.5L of peritoneal fluid which did improve his dyspnea somewhat although he continued to require high flow O2 for symptomatic improvement.
In addition, he was given a prescription for morphine and ativan as needed for dyspnea.
2) Abdominal distention/pain - Due to advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma and associated ascites treated by 7.5L paracentesis.
No evidence of SBP (265 WBC with only 26% polys).
3) Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma - Currently followed by [**Hospital3 **] home health care.
No new treatment for HCC during this admission.
4) Acute on chronic renal failure - Cr 5.3 on presentation, up from 2.4 in [**12-9**].
Most likely due to pre-renal etiology.
Renal recommended discharge on Phos Lo for hyperphosphatemia and patient comfort.
4) Hypotension - Likely due to underlying liver disease/hepatocellular ca.
5) Pleural effusions - likely due to hepatohydrothorax.
No further managment.
6) h/o UGI bleed/anemia - With GE jxn, antral, and duodenal bulb ulcers that were non-bleeding on EGD in [**10-9**].
8) CHF - Thought to be [**3-5**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 40% on echo [**2111-11-10**].
9) Hypercholesterolemia - Continue atorvastatin.
10) h/o MSSA endocarditis - Of eustachian valve (embryologic remnant of valve of IVC) c/b lumbar paravertebral abscess and possible pulmonary septic emboli.
Repeat [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] showed decrease in size of paravertebral abscess.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Solution Sig: Thirty (30) ml PO tid prn as needed for constipation.
