Of note, the pt has been hospitalized twice this month for c/o increased LE edema.
The pt was initially treated with thrombectomy and local tPA which produced minimal result and then was given systemic tPA with resolution of the pt's LE edema.
He reports feeling better at the time of discharge and was able to walk without difficulty.
Since then, the pt has noted increasing scrotal edema and increasing R leg pain X 3 days.
Denies prior h/o scrotal edema.
He also reports R upper thigh pain that is intermittent.
ROS is remarkable for new L sided temporal headaches over the past week.
Denies neck stiffness, photophobia, visual changes, new weakness or numbness.

sclera anicteric.
NECK: No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Unable to appreciate JVD secondary to body habitus.
Venous stases changes in b/l LE NEURO: CN II-XII intact.
No sensory deficits.
Arterial and venous color flow and Doppler waveforms are demonstrated.
There are small bilateral hydroceles.
There is massive subcutaneous and interstitial edema within the surrounding soft tissues.
The pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pneumothorax.
The lungs are clear without consolidations or effusions.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
RELEVANT IMAGING DATA: [**2168-12-30**] MRI L-spine: Bony metastases are visualized in the lumbar vertebral bodies, sacrum and both iliac bones.
No significant change is seen.
No epidural abscess identified or new epidural mass seen.
[**2168-12-6**] MRI L-spine: Numerous metastatic tumor deposits, with possible small epidural lesions seen anterior to the thecal sac at the L4 and L5 levels, versus distended epidural veins secondary to a moderate posterior disc protrusion at L4-5.
[**6-/2168**] Bone scan: Widespread metastatic disease in multiple ribs, right iliac crest, and vertebra L4.
Noncompressible deep venous thrombosis in left common femoral vein almost occluding the lumen.
No clot demonstrated distal to superficial femoral vein.
No evidence of DVT on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the OMED service for complaints of scrotal edema and increasing R leg pain.
Given his past history, it was thought that his scrotal edema was secondary to known IVC clot extending down to the bilateral iliac veins.
Although it was noted that his lower extremity and scrotal edema improved slightly after the repeat thrombectomy and tPA, it was agreed upon by the medical, oncologic, and radiology teams that a repeat IVC venogram with repeat thrombectomy and tPA would be performed to help evaluate IVC flow and to improve the pt's chances of post-procedure success.
No clear sources of infection were found initially and antibiotics were not started for a week and a half.
The patient was given IVF as it was thought his renal failure may have been secondary to dye load from the IVC venogram the day prior or from pre-renal causes.
A urine sediment showed many WBC and WBC casts and was thought to be consistent with AIN.
A renal US was negative for renal vein thrombosis as well as a MRI/MRA of the kidneys.
Due to the patient's fevers without a clear source of infection, ID was consulted for FUO.
After further work-up, it was thought that the pt's fevers were secondary to the patient's clot burden rather than an infectious process or an allergic reaction to his other medications.
The patient also complained of tremors and twitching.
Neurology was consulted who felt that the pt's tremors were more consistent with asterixis.
His hospital course was also complicated by several episodes of chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes remained negative and multiple EKGs were without ischemic changes.
Given his large clot burden, intermittent fevers and intermittent episodes of hypoxia with O2 sats down to the 80s on RA, the possibility was considered.
Initially, the pt was not imaged given his ARF and the fact that he was already on a heparin drip.
The patient also complained of neck pain during the hospital course without other meningeal signs, including headaches, photophobia, elevated WBC, altered mental status.
It was thought to be musculoskeletal in nature as the neck pain resolved with acetaminophen and toradol.
He was transitioned to lovenox 120 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **] from heparin gtt once renal vein thrombosis was ruled out definitively with the MRI and was discharged home in good condition with follow-up with his oncologist and renal.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for increasing lower extremity edema and scrotal edema.
We also decreased your neurontin dose to 300 mg three times a day, which we believe were the primary cause of your tremors.
Call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any of the following: fever > 100.5, chills, night sweats, increased burning on urination, decreased urine frequency or output, shortness of breath, chest pain, increasing lower extremity and scrotal edema.
