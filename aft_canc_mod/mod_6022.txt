Admission Date:  [**2159-8-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Elective admission for resection of left sided meningioma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left craniotomy for resection of meningioma  History of Present Illness: 83 yo F with known left parasaggital meningioma, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who has had progressive right leg weakness and difficulty walking over the past several months to a year.
No pain, numbness or tingling.
Work-up of right leg weakness included MRI thoracic and cervical spine that show only mild degenerative changes and chronic T9 compression fx.
She was found to have a left sided meningioma and he is she is currently scheduled for elective craniotomy.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements decreased on right  Handedness Right   Pertinent Results: [**2159-8-22**] CT Head at 15:00: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy approach resection of a left parafalcine meningioma as demonstrated on the preoperative examinations.
There is extensive pneumocephalus compatible with post-surgical change.
In addition, high attenuation material compatible with hemorrhage is demonstrated within the resection bed with small areas of pneumocephalus.
There are low attenuation areas in the resection bed compatible with edema.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy for resection of a known left parafalcine meningioma.
High-attenuation and low attenuation regions within the resection bed compatible with post-surgical hemorrhage and edema.
[**2159-8-22**] CT Head at 19:00: FINDINGS: Again are noted post-craniotomy changes from a left frontal approach with skin staples and a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema.
A significant amount of bifrontal pneumocephalus is noted, similar to prior study with displacement of the frontal lobes and extending into the middle cranial fossae.
Again is seen in the left frontal resection bed an approximately 2 x 1.5 cm focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema, which is similar to slightly decreased compared to prior study.
There is no shift of midline structures.
There is no intraventricular hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is no sign of herniation.
The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy for left frontal mass resection, with stable appearance of left frontal hemorrhage in the resection bed.
Significant amount of pneummocephalus in the bifrontal regions with displacement of the frontal lobes; while this is not significantly changed from prior, correlate clinically for tension pneumocephalus.
[**2159-8-23**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: S/post resection of the previously noted left frontal extra-axial enhancing lesion, likely representing dural-based lesion such as meningioma.
There are also post-surgical changes noted in the adjacent bone and dura.
Small-to-moderate amount of pneumocephalus is noted in the bifrontal regions.
In addition, there is a new moderate sized area of altered signal intensity in the left parietal lobe, with hypointense appearance on the T1 and hyperintense on the T2-weighted sequence with some degree of decreased diffusion concerning for an infarct in this location.
There is a small amount of subdural fluid collection noted along the convexity on both sides.
MP-RAGE sequences are limited due to patient motion-related artifacts.
There is likely mild meningeal enhancement.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are otherwise unremarkable, except for mass effect by the blood products in the surgical resection site in the left lateral ventricle.
Post-surgical changes in the left frontal surgical resection site at the location of the previously noted meningioma, with presence of blood products; pneumocephalus and small subdural fluid collection extra-axially on both sides along with mild meningeal enhancement.
Interval development of a moderate-sized area of altered signal intensity in the left parietal lobe just posterior to the surgical resection site, with some degree of decreased diffusion, cortical swelling concerning for infarction, venous stasis/infarction/inflammatory changes in this location, acute-subacute.
Followup evaluation to assess interval change and confirmation of the nature of the abnormality is necessary.
[**2159-8-24**] Head CT at 01:00: IMPRESSION: Increased intracranial hemorrhage on the left, now involving the frontal and parietal lobes.
[**2159-8-24**] Head CT at 08:00: IMPRESSION: Stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal and left parietal lobes, with associated surrounding edema and mass effect, unchanged from prior study.
Given the location, especially the left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as the appearance on MR, this raises the possibility of a hemorrhagic venous infarct.
[**2159-8-24**] Head CT at 14:00: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change from prior study.
Stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal and parietal lobes with associated surrounding edema and mass effect, unchanged from prior study.
Given the appearance of MR and the location of the parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, this raises the possibility of hemorrhagic venous infarct, as mentioned on most recent prior study.
[**2159-8-25**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2159-8-25**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to prior study, with extensive left frontoparietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage, large region of surrounding edema and degree of mass effect, unchanged.
There is no evidence of uncal or other central herniation.
[**2159-8-26**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in comparison to prior study from [**2159-8-25**] with extensive left frontoparietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages with a possibility venous infarction laterally and significant moderate amount of surrounding edema and stable mass effect.
Mild bilateral pleural effusions.
Minimal enlargement of the pulmonary vessels, making minimal overhydration likely.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Mild bilateral pleural effusions.
Minimal enlargement of the pulmonary vessels, making minimal overhydration likely.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
New area of acute infarct in right cerebellar hemisphere.
Extensive left frontoparietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage which is unchanged from the prior study.
This possibly represents venous infarction.
Stable mass effect and perilesional edema.
3.No evidence of thrombosis in the superior sagittal, transverse and sigmoid sinuses.
[**2159-8-29**] CXR IMPRESSION: Right apical opacity is indeterminate but has reappeared.
Right lower lobe collapse has resolved.
[**2159-8-30**] CXR IMPRESSION: No interval change of small bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
No evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
[**2159-8-31**] Lower Extremity Venous Doppler US IMPRESSION: Superficial nonocclusive thrombus within the mid portion of the right basilic vein.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
[**2159-9-6**] LENI's: CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
She tolerated this procedure well with no complications.
She had some word finding difficulties and was slightly perseverative as well.
She underwent MRI scan of the brain to assess the resection cavity post-operatively which showed complete resection.
On the evening of [**8-23**] she was noted to have two seizures which was exhibited by right sided rigidity and left side shaking and hiccuping.
Serial CT scans showed intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal and left parietal lobes, with associated surrounding edema and mass effect.
On [**8-25**] she was reintubated for respiratory distress.
Right Upper extremity Doppler was performed on [**8-30**] due to swelling and demonstrated only a superficial thrombus was discovered, no evidence of occlusive DVT.
EEG showed seizure activity and we increased dilantin to 200 tid.
Over the next several days she continued to have intermittent focal seizures and her Keppra dose and dilantin dose were uptitrated periodically to control seizure at the recommendation of neurology.
Additional family meetings were held between the ICU attending and the family on [**9-3**] and between the Neurosurgery attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the family on [**7-25**] to discuss the options of tracheostomy and PEG in the setting of poor neurological prognosis.
