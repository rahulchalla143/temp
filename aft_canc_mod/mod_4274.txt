History of Present Illness: Pt presents from rehab today with headache and increased confusion at rehab.
Pt recently discharged on [**7-14**] for an admission for headache and altered mental status.
By the time of his arrival to the floor during that admission his mental status changes had essentially resolved and his headache was thought consistent with chronic headache he has had for at least a month.
Apparently the patient was forgetting the details of his recent hospitalization and confused as to where he was and where he had been.
It has not improved with treatment for sinusitis with fluticasone.
The patient also reports he is unsure of the details of his confusion and feels like he has been progressively improving.
He complained of chronic headache but had no other complaints  He had a CT head, which was stable as well as CXR and UA.
His UA showed very mild pyuria and thus he received PO ciprofloxacin *1.
He reports persistent headache.
He reports his abdominal pain, which was an issue during his last hospitalization has improved.
ROS: + Per HPI as well as for weakness (chronic) that he thinks is improving Denies fevers, chills, night sweats.
Denies neck pain or stiffness.
Denies acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Denies dysuria or foul smelling urine.

No evidence of acute abdominal or pelvic processes.
Bilateral common femoral and external iliac thrombus small amount of thrombus within the infrarenal IVC filter.
New left common iliac vein thrombus is also noted.
Stable bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral 4-mm lower lobe nodules.
Hepatic steatosis.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage, new mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Post-treatment changes in the right temporal lobe.
Unchanged left ventriculostomy and slight ventricular enlargement.
Unchanged right sphenoid and mastoid/middle ear sinus disease as described above.
VP shunt courses along the left chest wall into the upper abdomen.
No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
[**2103-7-19**] CXR: No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
[**2103-7-20**] 24 hour EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe diffuse background slowing, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Background activity over the right hemisphere showed more severe focal slowing and occasional sharp waves over the right temporal region.
These findings indicate a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right temporal region.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there were no significant change.
[**2103-7-22**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Lung volumes remain very low with marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, chronic since at least [**2103-5-13**].
Small accompanying right pleural effusion or pleural thickening is also stable.
Moderate cardiomegaly exaggerated by low lung volumes, unchanged.
Increased enhancement demonstrated within the resection cavity, involving the parenchyma of the residual right temporal lobe and also extending in a nodular fashion in its lateral aspect suggestive of subpial involvement and, perhaps, progressive involvement of the overlying dura.
The appearance suggests progression of disease since [**2103-5-28**].
No separate foci of enhancement to suggest new sites of disease.
No evidence of interval infarction.
Expected continued evolution of blood products within the resection cavity, with no evidence of new hemorrhage.
[**2103-7-25**]: H. pylori Ab negative.
Brief Hospital Course: 56yo man with right temporal GBM s/p resection currently on bevacizumab, steroid-induced myopathy (bed bound), and chronic issues with delirium admitted for altered mental status and headache.
Transferred to ICU after found unresponsive on the floor hypoxic, febrile to 104.0F, and having seizure-like activity.
Lumbar puncture was negative for infection.
Hypoxia and fever resolved, so he was transfered out of ICU on IV valproate and antibiotics possible for aspiration pneumonia, though CXRs x2 and cultures were negative.
EEGs showed seizure activity at the site of tumor.
# Seizure d/o and altered mental status: Due to progression of disease.
However, he did not take PO very well because of acute delirium (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]), but tolerated the liquid formulation.
EEG [**2103-7-24**] prelim report showed improvement of the severe diffuse background slowing seen on the previous EEGs [**2103-7-19**] and [**2103-7-20**], but the focal slowing and occasional sharp waves over the right temporal region associated with his tumor remain unchanged.
# Adrenal insufficiency: Low AM cortisol and borderline ACTH (Cosyntropin) stim test is concerning for adrenal insufficiency.
Dexamethasone was stopped [**2103-7-11**] after very slow taper.
# Hypoxia/Fever: Due to aspiration pneumonia vs. seizure.
# GBM: s/p resection, currently maintained on bevacizumab.
Restaging MRI showed progression of disease.
Neuro-oncology had a discussion with family and given evidence of both clinical progression and radiologic progression with poor performance status plan was to discharge patient to hospice care.
# Thrombocytopenia: Possibly drug-related.
# Anemia: Anemia labs unremarkable.
# Acute renal failure: Resolved with IV fluids.
# Abdominal Pain: Chronic since VP shunt was placed.
Continued analgesia prn.
# FEN: Restarted regular diet with normal swallow eval.
# Access: Peripherals.
# Precautions: Seizure.

Altered mental status.
Hypoxia (low oxygen).
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname 13013**] was admitted to the hospital for altered mental status and headache.
He was transfered to the intensive care unit (ICU) and started on antibiotics for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
EEGs measuring brain waves showed chronic seizure activity in the region of the brain tumor.
A brain MRI showed progression of the tumor, the likely cause of confusion and seizures.
Because of continued progression of disease avastin treatment was discontinued and care now focusing on keeping patient comfortable.Mr [**Known lastname 13013**] did develop an increase in bowel movements and because of prior history of clostridium difficile colitis stool cultures were obtained and patient was started on oral vancomycin empirically.
Pending results on d/c: stools for c.dif VDRL to evaluate for neuro-syphilis ( although not highly likely)  Followup Instructions: Please contact Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 724**] for any question or concerns.
