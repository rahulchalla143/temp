Admission Date:  [**2166-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-6-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Betadine / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line ultrasound-guided biopsy of left lower quadrant abdominal/pelvic mass  History of Present Illness: 60yo M with PMH of esophageal ca, melanoma, HTN, cirrhosis, and gout, brought from nursing home with altered mental status x 3d.
Pt was noted to be confused and agitated, pulling out lines and talking to himself.
He was also noted to have a rash on his neck and R arm.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable at the nursing home.
In the ED, he was noted to be awake but confused and disoriented.
Unable to obtain history from patient due to mental status.
Head CT showed a 17 mm low density area in the right lentiform nucleus, c/w prior hemorrhage vs old CVA.
Given leukocytosis (wbc 15), there was concern that infection could be contributing to his delirium.
CXR (-), U/A w/ hematuria (Foley) but no evidence of infection.
No ascites was visualized, however a 10 cm LLQ fluid collection was noted.
Subsequent Abd CT showed that this mass was erroding into bone; also noted was a LLE DVT.
Amelonotic melanoma of the left shoulder s/p excision [**2-14**].
The sentinal lymph node was negative for metastatic disease.
SCC of the left ankle s/p excision.
Esophageal cancer s/p resection [**12/2165**] at [**Hospital3 **].
HTN #.
Chronic Renal Insufficiency, and h/o Acute Tubular Necrosis.
H/O multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers #.
# Relative Adrenal Insufficiency during recent [**2-15**] admission to MICU for GIB diagnosed by inappropriate reponse to cosyntropin.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis # History of EtOH Dependence # Chronic LE Pain.
Seen by Pain center [**2166-7-21**] felt to be neuropathic in origin.
Social History: from [**Location (un) **] NH since [**3-15**], h/o heavy EtOH use before in NH  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE: AF   84   142/85   16   99%2LNC elderly man, alert, oriented only with repeated prompting NCAT, sclerae anicteric, PERRL no JVD or LAD CTAB RRR, nl S1/S2, no murmur/gallop soft, does not respond to palpation, ND, +BS 1+ LLE edema from groin to ankle, not erythematous or tender, no RLE edema, 2+DP pulses b/l  Pertinent Results: 15.1>35.4<418 N:86.8 L:7.9 M:3.5 E:1.4 B:0.3  [**Age over 90 **]|92|29/117 3.2|31|1.1\ Ca:14.6 Mg:1.5 P:2.0  Alb:3.6 PT:13.6 PTT:29.1 INR:1.2      Brief Hospital Course: 60 year-old male with history of metastatic esophageal cancer, melanoma, and squamous cell skin cancer who was admitted for shock and mental status changes.
1) Respiratory failure: On arrival to the MICU, he was intubated for airway protection given his tenuous respiratory status.
2) DIC: He had profuse bleeding after subclavian line was placed.
The DIC resolved rapidly with aggressive treatment of sepsis with volume resuscitation and replacement of blood products.
3) Altered Mental Status: The etiology of his mental status change is unclear.
The differential included hypercalcemia, other metabolic abnormality (TSH was normal), drug reaction (Dilaudid, MS Contin), brain metastasis (none visualized on head CT), infection.
There was no evidence of urinary infection or pneumonia.
There was no ascites so SBP was unlikely.
Another source of infection could be infection in his pelvic mass.
The pelvic fluid collection was drained and was sterile, so this was not likely the cause of his sepsis.
5) Hypercalcemia: Most likely secondary to malignancy, either due to large mass eroding into left pelvic bone or due to PTH-RP secretion from SCC.
7) Left pelvic mass: The mass is most likely metastatic SCC given this was the location of prior positive left inguinal node biopsy.
The mass was drained under ultrasound and cytology was consistent with squamous cell cancer.
8) Adrenal insufficiency: He was diagnosed with relative adrenal insufficiency in ICU [**2-15**] and was scheduled to only receive 7 days of stress dose steroids.
Given the concern for infection he was given stress dose steroids.
During the periods of DIC, he required pRBC transfusion due to excess bleeding.
10) Seizure activity: During his admission, he had arm movements and eye deviations that were concerning for a seizure.
An EEG showed slow wave focus suggesting fixed subcortical abnormality in left hemicortex, possible subclinical seizure activity, and he was loaded with phenytoin.
Abdominal films were negative for obstruction.
11) Aspiration: In the final days of this hospitalization, he began to aspirate copious amounts of bilious fluid.
Three times, he aspirated large amounts of bilious fluid that resulted in [**10-30**] second periods of asystole.
Aggressive suctioning reversed the asystole.
Within hours, he had vomited/aspiration large amount of bilious fluid and expired shortly thereafter.
12) Pain: During the admission, he was maintained on a fentanyl drip and morphine for breakthrough pain.
CXR showed no acute pulmonary and a PPD was negative.
14) Chronic Renal Failure: He developed acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to sepsis.
Metastatic sqaumous cell cancer 2.
Sepsis 3.
Hypercalcemia 5.
Acute on chronic renal failure 6.
