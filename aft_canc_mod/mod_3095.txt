INDICATION: Esophageal mass eroding into trachea.
FINDINGS: There is a soft tissue mass, subsuming the esophagus, extending from the level of the thoracic inlet caudally at least to the subcarinal level.
There is apparent invasion of the posterior wall of the trachea over a segment of approximately 7 cm.
No intraluminal invasion is apparent.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions and mild left basilar compressive atelectasis.
There is bronchiectasis and surrounding peribronchial fibrotic thickening in the right upper lobe of uncertain significance.
This may represent post radiation changes if there is a history of malignancy.
No acute pathology is seen in the partially visualized upper abdominal organs.
A 1-mm area of calcification on the most inferior image slice in the left kidney may represent a nonobstructing calculus or vascular calcification.
The study is not designed for evaluation of abdominal organs.
Soft tissue mass centered around the upper esophagus, inseparable from the innominate artery and tip of aortic arch with likely extension into the wall of the right main stem bronchus and bronchus intermedius.
The mass is also invading the posterior tracheal wall and causing luminal narrowing distal to the endotracheal tube.
Bilateral small pleural effusions and mild left basal atelectasis.
Bronchiectasis with peribronchial, likely chronic, thickening in the right upper lobe of uncertain etiology.
Is there a history of radiation therapy?
Partially visualized stone or vascular calcification in the left kidney.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-10-7**] 7:58 AM Reason: r/o pneumo [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 88 year old man with metastatic esophageal cancer and central airway obstruction REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o pneumo AP CHEST, 8:32 A.M., [**10-7**] HISTORY: Metastatic esophageal cancer.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-6**]: Endotracheal tube has been removed, leaving a mild subglottic edema.
Tracheal stent at the level of the aortic arch is unchanged in position, and the left lung volumes are lower, with new left lower lobe atelectasis.
Mediastinal contours are unchanged, although the extent of the upper esophageal mass is not fully apparent on plain radiographs.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 88M with met esophageal cancer c erosion/compression of trachea p/w SOB now intubated.
Overnight course significant for transient hypotension related to sedation, treated w/ decreasing sedation, neo gtt/ IVF for 3hours.
Hypotension resolved w/ d/c of sedation in am prior to extubation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: metastatic esophageal cancer w/ erosion/compression of trachea.
PMH: esophageal ca s/p radiation and chemo, MRSA pneumnia, c. difficile, anemia, hyponatremia, s/p G-tube.
