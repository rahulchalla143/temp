At that time, she had no specific complaints outside of her baseline shortness of breath that is thought to be related to her significant ascites.
She has had this previously in the setting of coagulopathy with liver disease.
Common variable immunodeficiency complicated by: -E. coli bacteremia [**11-1**] treated with 3 days IV cefepime switched to oral cipro for 14-day course, presumed source was GI  -recurrent CMV disease (adenopathy, [**Month/Year (2) 15482**] suppression, colitis)  requiring IV foscarnet, now on valganciclovir suppression -HPV related vulvo-anal and vocal cord disease s/p laser fulguration -[**Doctor First Name **] adenitis and recurrence with [**Doctor First Name **] enteritis on [**Doctor First Name 107290**] for secondary PPX due to intolerance/failure of azithromycin -granulomatous hepatitis with cholangitic overlay presumed to be from CVID, and clinical cirrhosis -pulmonary disease with some fibrosis s/p wedge resection [**6-25**] with chronic interstitial pneumonitis with mild-moderate inflammatory component interstitial fibrosis, patchy acute organizing pneumonitis -intermittent recurrent diarrhea/colitis 2.
Bleeding disorder - possible PAI-1 deficiency 3.
S/p splenectomy for symptomatic hypersplenism and refractory  ITP; incidentally found large B cell lymphoma with splenectomy -s/p 6 cycles of CHOP [**10-27**] - [**2-26**] 4.
Chronic LE lymphedema 5.
Bilateral arthropathy .
Past Surgical history: 1. hysterectomy [**3-/2198**] for intractable HPV cervical disease 2.
Previously employed as a paralegal, but now on disability secondary to multiple medical conditions.
Family History: Common variable immune deficiency in twin sister who passed from metastatic anal carcinoma and in older brother.
[**Name (NI) **] brother is healthy without immunodeficiecny.
[**Name (NI) **] mother died of lymphoma at 52 and had similar symptoms, but was never diagnosed with CVID.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, face mask on with NRB Neck: supple, neck veins are distended, no LAD Lungs: b/l crackles + at bases, no rhonchi.
small midline hernia in upper abdomen, umbilicus is everted.
Dilated superficial veins are +.
Non tender, free fluid + Ext: b/l LE edema +.
Access:Rt IJ tunneled cath +, no discharge/tenderness/erythema.
[**2205-8-7**] Echocardiography: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the prior study dated [**2205-7-10**] (images reviewed), the degree of ascites has decresed.
Other findings are similar  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 y/o female with a history of common variable immunodeficiency, granulomatous cirrhosis, CRI with recent admission for gram-positive bacteremia who presents with hypotension.
# Severe sepsis with hypotension but no organ failure: Possible sources included right leg cellulitis, line-related, ascites (SBP).
She was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics, and was treated with albumin 1.5 mg/kg for suspected SBP and for paracenesis.
# Hypoxia, dyspnea: Chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
# Hematochezia: Chronic from intraabdominal wounds.
She had one bowel movement with bloody stool during this hospitalization.
# Pulmonary Hypertension: Echocardiography showed a small pericardial effusion but no other new changes.
# Arthropathy: Held hydroxychloroquine, but restarted at the time of discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -gram negative sepsis  Secondary: -common variable immunodeficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted with a blood infection and low blood pressure.
We also noted that you have bloody stool.
