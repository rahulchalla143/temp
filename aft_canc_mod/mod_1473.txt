Pt began experiencing cough and sputum production on [**9-7**] although d/c summary from previous hospitalization reported 2-3wk hx of weakness and SOB.
Pt reported cough intially productive of green sputum.
She denied any fever or chills, recent sick contacts.
Chest CT revealed no infiltrate suggestive of PNA and she was easily weaned off of oxygen overnight so antibiotics were stopped.
Pt continued to be short of breath at home and continued cough productive of brown sputum.
No fevers or chills were present, but reported diarrhea prior to and throughout her hospitalization w/o melena or hematochezia.
Pt denied PND, but had orthopnea and reported new LE edema, although pt has no hx of CHF and echo from [**9-18**] was normal.
Pt presented to clinic on [**9-11**] for taxotere tx but med was held due to poor PO intake, diarrhea, and weakness and instead was given 1L IVF.
She came back to clinic for 2U PRBC transfusion for low Hct and found to have temp to 100.2 O2 Sats of 90% [**Female First Name (un) **] which only improved to 94% on 2 L so she was given 125mg of solumedrol for COPD flare vs PNA.
SCLCA (stage IIIA) hx-found to have lung mass on CXR after syncopal episode in [**2-17**], trqnsbronchial bx revealed SCLCA and she started taxol/carboplatin induction with rad tx in [**3-18**] followed by gemcitibine with RUL resection in [**7-20**].

Small right pleural effusion.
The right hilar mass is also increased in size in the interval.
[**9-14**] Chest CT-hilar mass increased in size with compression of rt mainstem bronchus.
PNA-CXR on admission showed RLL PNA and she continued to have productive cough and wheeze with elevated WBC.
WBC thought to be falsely elevated due to steroid use.
All culture data except for initial sputum cx was negative.
Initial sputum gram stain with GPC in pairs suggestive of staph or strep and culture showing oral flora with sparse Pseudomonas.
Pt initially on Ceftazadime/azithromycin/flagyl then weaned to Levoflox/flagy for partial pseudomonas coverage on, and postobstructive PNA and completed 14 day regimen although flagyl dced on day 5 for possiblity of lowering the seizure threshold and clindamycin added on day #8.
Pt wheeze continued on PE although she has a hx of obstructive pulmonary disease so was treated with stress dose IV solumedrol 60mg intially which was titrated up to 6mg dexamethasone IV q6 hours per neuro after bleeding brain metastasis found.
Pt has partially obstructing lesion of rt main stem bronchus which appeared larger on repeat chest CT and may be cause of wheeze, although held on interventional pulomary at this time.
Pt had video swallow to rule out aspiration which was negative, but S and S recommeded having meds in applesauce and swallowing twice with all food consistencies.
Bleeding in brain initially thought to be embolic although MRI was more suggestive of bleeding metastasis.
Kept all options open so Neuro/Onc consulted and made plan for stereotactic radioablation and have pt seen in tumor clinic.
Pt has no focal neurologic exam findings except for mild left eye and mouth droop at rest and cont hyprereflexic patellar and achilles on left, but no loss of strength.
Thrombocytopenia-Initial fall in platelets thought to be due to platelet clumping and repeat sample in citrate tube suggests pseudothrombocytopenia.

Back pain-Pt with known t4 compression fracture which coincides with her area of pain.
Hydrocodone changed to standing oxycontin now titrated up to 20mg q12 and oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
