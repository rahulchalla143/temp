Admission Date:  [**2179-8-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-8-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-2-6**]       Sex:  F  Service: Mrs. [**Known lastname 17988**] is a 68-year-old caucasian female with history of non-small, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post CHOP treatment approximately two weeks prior to admission  The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of two days of intermittent fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
She subsequently developed respiratory distress.
She was emergently intubated for presumed pulmonary edema as seen on a chest x-ray.
Following the intubation she had a PEA arrest and was given a total of 3 mg of Epinephrine and 3 mg of Atropine before regaining a pulse.
She then required pressors for hypotension which were subsequently weaned done in the Emergency Room which showed new globally depressed left ventricular function.
The patient subsequently ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a CK of 623 and an MB of 123.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes congestive heart failure and history of non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2179-6-11**].
Diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 30 with neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy.
Diffuse large cell lymphoma treated at [**Hospital1 69**] status post two cycles of chemotherapy with CHOP/Retuxen with Neupogen and Procrit.
Hypertension, obesity, renal insufficiency with a history of acute renal failure secondary to interstitial nephritis, hemorrhoids, arthritis, history of vaginal bleeding, negative vaginal ultrasound.
Status post appendectomy, status post third toe amputation.
Pulmonary exam showed rare diffuse wheezing.
Extremities showed 1+ edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Neurological examination the patient moved all four extremities, withdrew to pain and had intact gag reflex.
Chest x-ray findings were consistent with flash pulmonary edema with right base atelectasis verses pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 119.
1/[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression in the lateral leads, poor R-wave progression.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed rate of 183 and [**Street Address(2) 17989**] depression in the lateral leads and in lead 2.
On exam at that point the patient was intubated, unresponsive to sternal rub and had no spontaneous movements.
There was no blink to threat.
There were fine repetitive eye movements.
The neurology service recommended an EEG to rule out status epilepticus, a Head CT and the avoidance of sedative medications.
Head CT was performed on [**2179-8-5**] which showed no acute process.
EEG was performed on [**2179-8-6**] which showed background rhythm of very low voltage, no definite cortical activity was discernible.
Frequent bursts of generalized Delta slowing and widespread severe encephalopathy effecting both cortical and sub-cortical structures.
This again showed no bleed, no mass effect or midline shift, only mild atrophy.
Respiratory:  The patient was intubated in the emergency department on [**2179-8-5**] for respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
Infectious Disease:  Due to fevers and an infiltrate seen on chest x-ray on admission the patient was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime on [**2179-8-5**].
The only positive results of these cultures was urinary tract infection with E. coli.
Throughout treatment with antibiosis, the patient continued to intermittently spike fevers and repeat cultures were performed on [**2179-8-16**].
In light of the continued fevers and this focus of infection, the patient was started on Diflucan on [**2179-8-16**].
Cardiology:  The patient suffered an acute myocardial infarction at the time of admission with subsequently, markedly suppressed left ventricular function.
A follow-up echocardiogram done on [**8-9**] to shows ejection fraction of less than 25%, global left ventricular hypokinesis and 3+ mitral regurg due to the patient's severe neurologic condition.
By [**2179-8-11**] it became apparent the patient's neurologic status was unlikely to improve and that she had suffered a severe anoxic brain injury.
Severe anoxic brain injury secondary to 10 to 15 minute     PEA, cardiac arrest.
Acute myocardial infarction with subsequent suppressed     left ventricular function.
Respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
