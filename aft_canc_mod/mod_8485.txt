Two new posterior cranial fossa/cerebellar lesions, with surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle, concerning for metastatic disease.
A new 1.1 cm mass lesion in the third ventricle, with mild hydrocephalus, concerning for additional site of metastatic disease.
Right cerebellar and third ventricle lesions are new from [**2166-8-18**], concerning for metastatic disease.
If clinically feasible, MRI is more sensitive to detect small lesions and leptomeningeal disease.
The lateral ventricles are slightly enlarged compared to [**2166-8-18**], raising the possibility of mild hydrocephalus due to third ventricle lesion.
MRI with and without contrast [**2-23**]: Supra- and infra-tentorial as well as intraventricular metastatic disease, notably involving the left insular cortex, right cerebellar hemisphere, and third ventricle.
While the right cerebellar lesion is associated with significant mass effect and distortion of the fourth ventricle, there is currently no CSF obstruction or hydrocephalus.
Compression fracture, with mild loss of height of the Thoracic T5 vertebral body with marrow edema pattern.
No retropulsion of the fragments, no canal or compression on the cord.
While this has the appearance of a benign compression fracture, given the history, an associated pathologic lesion within the T5 body cannot be completely excluded.
No enhancing lesions in the cord.
Multilevel mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine without significant canal or foraminal stenosis.
A 3.3 x 3.5 cm nodular lesion in the lower neck/upper mediastinum, new since the prior CT chest of [**2166-11-27**].
There is moderate amount of pleural effusion/pleural thickening noted on the left side.
MRI [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-26**] FINDINGS: Since the prior study, the patient has undergone biopsy of the right cerebellar hemispheric lesion.
Expected postoperative change are seen with relatively extensive intralesional hemorrhage and a circumscribed tissue defect.
The previously reported extensive vasogenic edema as well as mass effect on the fourth ventricle is largely unchanged.
The previously reported additional metastatic lesions within the left insular cortex and third ventricle demonstrate no short interval change.
However, with less motion artefact and better image quality further lesions measuringapproximately 3 mm are identified in the posterior aspect of the left temporal [**Month/Day (4) 3630**] as well as the left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is no evidence of acute infarction.
Status post biopsy of right cerebellar mass with expteced intralesional hemorrhage.
No short-term interval change with regard to the left insular cortex and third ventricle metastatic lesions.
Identification of additional small lesions within the left posterior temporal cortex as well as the left posterior medial cerebellar hemisphere.
No associated intraparencymal or intraventricular hemorrhage identified.
The patient is status post a right suboccipital craniotomy with partial resection of a known right cerebellar mass.
Again there is a small amount of air and expected post-surgical hematoma at the site of the recent surgical intervention in the posterior cranial fossa with an increasingly hypodense appearance consistent with evolution of blood products.
A 2.8 x 2.3 cm rounded hyperdense mass most suggestive of residual tumor, better identified on the prior MRI, and is located just superior to the resection site and unchanged.
Known left insular cortical mass is not well seen, and better evaluated on the MRI.
Surrounding vasogenic edema in the cerebellar hemispheres persists but with minimally improved mass effect on the patent fourth ventricle.
The known 1.1 x 1.0 cm hyperdense mass in the third ventricle is unchanged.
No new parenchymal hematoma or infarct present.
The mastoid air cells, middle ear cavities and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
Status post partial resection of the right cerebellar mass with a stable distribution of surrounding vasogenic edema though with a slight decreased mass effect on the widely patent fourth ventricle.
Residual tumor as described above.
No intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage identified.
Stable mild dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles.
[**2-27**] CT ABD FINDINGS: There is a new left paratracheal mass measuring 3.8 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm causing mild deviaiton of the trachea and left carotid artery concerning for a lymphadenopathy due to metastasis.
There is no , axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy evident.
Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion.
There is a small left pleural effusion with thickened rind evident at the level of the upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**], indicating chronicity.
No significant emphysematous changes are identified.
Changes consistent with left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection are evident.
Nonspecific ground-glass opacities with minimal associated architectural distortion identified in the left lung apex are increased compared to prior study and likely represent post-radiation changes.
Minimal dependent atelectasis in dependent portions of both lungs.
The liver is homogenous in attenuation without discrete masses or lesions.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric or portacaval lymphadenopathy identified.
Multiple small foci of air are noted within the abdomen as well as a layering posterior to the left rectus sheath muscle, likely due to recent insertion of a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt with tip ending lateral to the liver.
No free fluid identified within the abdomen.
No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy identified.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions evident.
New 3.8 cm left paratracheal mass concerning for metastasis.
Increased ground-glass opacities with associated architectural distortion evident within the left upper [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be related to radiation changes, though malignancy is not excluded.
Small left pleural effusion, likely chronic.
Small hiatal hernia.

Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED on [**2167-2-21**] following 2 weeks of headaches, nausea/vomiting, and vertigo.
CT head demonstrated a large mass in the R cerebellum and a smaller lesion in the third ventricle.
She was started on Decadron 4mg Q6 and admitted to the neuro-ICU for monitoring.
She did well overnight without any evidence of hydrocephalus or increasing ICP, and her symptoms began to improve.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and recommended resection of cerebellar lesion and whole brain radiation.
On [**2167-2-24**]: she had increased nausea and headaches.
She was taken to the OR and underwent resection of her cerebellar mass.
Her exam remained stable and post operative head CT showed no hemorrhage.
On [**2-26**] she had a routine head CT for preoperative planning and this showed no change from previous scans.
Postop MRI demonstrated residual cerebellar tumor and so on [**3-4**] she returned to the OR for craniotomy for excision of residual tumor.
FEN: She was maintained on IVF upon admission due to poor PO intake.
ID: She developed no signs of infection during her admission.
