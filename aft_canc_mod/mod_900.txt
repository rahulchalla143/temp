Pt also reports R.side gnawing rib pain, while lying in bed before the onset of chills.
Pt states he went to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED because of a fever of 101.3, however he felt better and did not want to wait to be seen.
ED also treated for possible cholangitis/sepsis and pt was given dose of vanco.
Past Medical History: # GIB [**2184**], EGD revealed duodenal ulcer c/w malignancy # Hypertension.
Recurrence in the left renal fossa and pancreas in [**4-/2182**] 5.
His course has been complicated by a GI bleed with possible small bowel obstruction,  and an admission to [**Hospital3 **] in [**8-/2185**] for anemia and acute renal failure while on full dose Nexavar 400 mg given twice daily.
following CT in [**9-/2186**], which showed progression of pancreatic metastases.
ERCP on [**2187-6-20**] showed a malignant appearing mass in duodenum, pathology consistent with metastatic renal cell Ca.
Perifosine held due to elevated LFTs on [**2187-7-25**].
Imaging: CXR: [**2187-9-30**]: Added density behind the left heart border in the left lower lobe may represent a focus of pneumonic consolidation; alternatively metastases from the known metastatic renal cell cancer cannot be entirely excluded.
Small perihepatic ascites.
Portal vein remains occluded with numerous collaterals.
Gallladder wall thickening and edema but no focal tenderness during scanning.
Large hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreatic head not well assessed due to overlying bowel gas.
No filling defects within previously placed metallic common bile duct stent.
Smooth impression on the common bile duct, proximal to stent, suggests extrinsic compression.
Please refer to GI procedural note for further details.
[**2187-10-3**] MESSENTERIC CATHETERIZAION +/- EMBOLIZATION: ***Prelim Report*** Gastrointestinal arteriograms demonstrated massive tumor staining from multiple feeding arteries originating from celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and isolated pancreatic artery without active ______.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 y.o male with metastatic RCC who presents with HCT drop, melena, recent fever, hypotension.
#melena/HCT drop - Pt has h.o GIB in past that were secondary to bleeding metastasis.
Patient underwent ERCP in which showed ulcerated mass at duodenum, able to temporarily stem blood flow.
This was consistent with patient's stated goals of living long enough to make it to hospice care, where he can be closer to family.
# Infection - Pt with fever, normal white count but with bandemia, recent RUQ/rib pain.
Slightly elevated LFT's, elevated bili -> RUQ u/s finding gallbladder wall thickening and edema, "possible cholecystitis".
# Metastatic RCC - Pain controlled.
# Lactic acidosis - likely from poor perfusion secondary to recent hypotension and infection.
Could also be secondary to metastatic disease.
# Anxiety - receiving scheduled ativan per pt request.
# Thrombocytopenia: - PLT count now improving - no heparin d/t bleed - HIT Ab negative - Transfused prn for bleeding .
