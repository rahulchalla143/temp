The patient presented to the ED today with SOB and cough x 1 week.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted on [**2171-12-4**] with shortness of breath, cough, and peripheral edema.
He was found to have a pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology.
Recent AFB smears have been negative but a recent culture has grown positive for Xanthamonas.
He also was noted for persistent positive B-glucan and Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] was treated with Bactrim to cover both PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 63311**].
Unfortunately, the patient required another urgent admission ([**Date range (3) 63312**]) with pericardial effusion and tamponade.
He became hypotensive to the 70's and neosynephrine was initialed.
His HR remained in the 160's-170's and he was cardioverted (100J) and converted to sinus tacycardia (HR 120's-130's).
A CXR was concerning for RUL PNA and fluid overload.
Cardiology was consulted and performed a bedside ECHO which revealed a loculated effusion unchanged from prior ECHO on [**2172-2-20**].
CT scan revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a disseminated infection.
[**2169-8-17**]: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin complicated by persistent fevers and extensive workup ultimately revealing disseminated tuberculosis infection.
His course was also complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension and the development of a severe cardiomyopathy.
S/P one dose of high-dose ARA-C at 1.5 mg per meter squared, lowered dose due to his disseminated tuberculosis, and then he received a second course of HiDAC at 3 gram per meter squared dose and developed acute onset of gait instability.
Noted for pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for aspergillus and empirically treated with Voriconazole with improvement noted on CT. 5.
Allo course c/b increased LFTs of unclear etiology, possibly from chemotherapy, renal failure attributed to CSA, and received only 1 dose of MTX due to mucositis.
Post transplant course complicated by asymptomatic CMV viremia and viral/URI syndromes.
In [**2171-5-12**] developed diarrhea with e/o GVH on endoscopy.
He also had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus.
Therapy attempted for GVH of liver using pulse of prednisone and increase in CellCept with stabilization but no significant improvement.
Non-onc PMH - Disseminated TB - s/p treatment with INH, levofloxacin and rifabutin - Hypertension and a heart murmur - Diabetes mellitus type 2 - Chemo related heart failure and cardiomyopathy, EF 35-40% [**12-16**] - h/o atrial fibrillation, recent EKGs in NSR - CMV viremia ([**2-17**])  Social History: He is married and lives at home with his wife & children.
He is a machine operator, but is currently not working.
Family History: Notable for mother who passed away of myocardial infarction.

RUQ ultrasound: Perihepatic ascites and gallbladder wall edema, which are without the presence of cholelithiasis or biliary dilatation, the question of third spacing or even hepatitis should be considered.
Known peripancreatic lymphadenopathy.
Echo [**2-24**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echo [**2-26**]: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with mild global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Mild aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Anterior, organized pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
The anterior pericardial effusion is similar.
Multifocal airspace disease as demonstrated on multiple recent chest radiographs.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Moderate ascites, increased compared to prior CT study from [**2168-8-7**].
Right colonic wall thickening including the caecum, consistent with non- specific colitis.
No associated abscess or free/contained air 7.
Several liver calcifications suggesting prior granulomatous disease.
[**3-1**]  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] is a 54 yo M with h/o AML s/p a matched related allo transplant on [**2171-1-8**] with busulfan and Cytoxan conditioning with complications of CMV viremia, GVHD, hemorrhagic cystitis, and disseminated TB with 2 recent admissions with pericardial effusion and tamponade, s/p window on [**2172-1-10**], admitted with respiratory failure and hypotension secondary to pneumococcal sepsis.
# Respiratory failure.
Vent setting were weaned to pressure support with minimal support for several weeks.
Could not extubate secondary to poor mental status.
# Pneumococcal sepsis.
# Acute renal failure.
Massive renal insult from hypotension from pneumococcal sepsis.
Had 4 days of CVVH in an attempt to improve his mental status.
# A fib with RVR - h/o A fib with RVR; cardioverted in ED.
# AML - continued on atovaquone, acyclovir (until copies of CMV noted in blood), and posaconazole.
# GVHD - has GVHD of liver, skins, eyes.
# Liver failure - thought secondary to shock liver + GVHD.
Liver biopsy performed on [**3-10**], demonstrating minimal portal triads but generally burned out liver (from GVHD).
No infection identified.
In the last several days, his pressor requirement increased and he required more support from the ventilator.
