# Anorexia, Fatigue, nightsweats, mild DOE # Eosinophilia Given the subacute nature of her presentation and climbing eosinophilia, there was concern for the possibility of fungal lung infection.
She tolerated the procedure well, but had a pneumothorax following the procedure.
A follow up repeat CXR was obtained, which showed an increase in the size of the pneumothorax, and therefore Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter to treat.
MRI head was performed, which did not show any e/o malignancy, and specifically did not show any leptomeningeal disease.
# Hyponatremia/SIADH Pt was noted to have hyponatremia on presentation, with sodium 126.
Urine studies were obtained, and confirmed the hyponatremia was consistent with SIADH.
# Hypothyroidism - continued home dose synthroid in-house.
# HLP - continued home dose lovastatin .
# HTN - continued home BP regimen (metoprolol, enalpril, amlodipine).

Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized for evaluation of your progressive symptoms of night sweats, poor appetite, fatigue, and weakness.
There is concern for possible fungal infection in your lungs, and you underwent bronchoscopy for biopsies and labs to further evaluate.
You also had an MRI of your head, which did not show any evidence of cancer.
You were found to have a pneumothorax following your bronchoscopy procedure, and a catheter was placed to treat this.
You were also found to have low sodium levels, likely due to a syndrome known as SIADH.
Your sodium levels have corrected with fluid restriction.
You had your AM amlodipine STOPPED on this admission, as you reported that you had been having low BP's as an outpt, and that you had stopped taking your AM amlopdipine.
