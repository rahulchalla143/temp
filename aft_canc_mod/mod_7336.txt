Admission Date:  [**2115-5-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-5-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amiodarone / Quinidine / Radiation  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of temporary hemodialysis line   History of Present Illness: 79 year old male with history of CHF (predominantly diastolic failure, EF 40-45%, multiple admissions for CHF excacerbations), ESRD (not on dialysis), pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus syndrome (s/p dual chamber pacer), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), and recently diagnosed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with possible mediastinal metastases who presents with shortness of breath for the last 3 months, worse in the past day.
Reports that he is chronically dyspneic but typically can lay flat at night.
He endorses orthopnea and PND, but denies worsening peripheral edema and states that he has lost 40 pounds in the last 1.5 years.
He also complains of severe LLE and left "sacroiliac" pain over the last few days.
He had a fall a few weeks ago and injured his left hip, although his current pain symptoms didn't start until a few days ago.
The pain is in his hip joint and radiates down the back of his leg.
T spine, hip/pelvis films were negative for fracture.
CXR showed pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions as well as atelectasis.
On exam, the patient had right basilar crackles and ecchymotic left hip.

Difficulty abducting left hip due to pain.
Pain on palpation of sacroiliac joint.
IMAGING: [**2115-5-16**] CXR: There is moderate pulmonary edema, similar to [**4-15**], [**2114**], but with increased, now moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
A left retrocardiac opacity might represent collapse or postobstructive pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no compression fracture.
[**2115-5-16**] X-ray of left hip/pelvis: Vascular calcifications are seen at the common femoral arteries.
There is no fracture of the pelvis or proximal femurs.
There are no significant degenerative changes at the hip joints.
[**2115-5-18**] X-ray left femur: Single AP view of the left femur shows an intact femur without definite fractures or dislocations.
There is no cortical destruction or focal lytic or blastic lesions.
However, if there is high concern for a marrow replacing lesion, an MRI or perhaps bone scan would be helpful.
There are extensive vascular calcifications.
There is left-sided pacemaker which is unchanged.
There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
There is some atelectasis at the right base.
Overall, the findings are relatively stable allowing for differences in technique and positioning.
There is moderate pulmonary edema.
[**2115-5-21**] left leg LENI: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.
[**2115-5-21**] CT head w/o con: Head CT very limited by patient motion, with no gross acute intracranial abnormality.
[**2115-5-22**] CT head w/ and w/o con: No hemorrhage, major vascular territory infarction, edema, mass, or shift of the midline structures is present.
Moderate periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperdensities are the likely sequela of small vessel ischemic changes.
A small lacune or dilated perivascular spaces is noted in the left posterior limb of the internal capsule.
No abnormal delayed enhancement is noted.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
New left psoas hematoma and slight hematoma of the left upper thigh.
No significant interval change in extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Continued peribronchovascular thickening and pulmonary consolidation in the left upper lobe may reflect post-obstructive consolidation and/or lymphangitic spread of tumor.
There is progressive collapse and consolidation of the left lower lobe.
No change in two heterogeneously dense right renal masses concerning for malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old man with a history of chronic systlic and diastolic CHF, ESRD, pulmonary hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recently diagnosed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma who presented with worsening shortness of breath.
Hospital course complicated by respiratory distress requiring MICU admission, and severe left hip/leg pain.
He was also found to have a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and plan was to perform a thoracentesis with placement of a pleurex catheter which was initially deferred due to patient's discomfort.
He had known mediastinal lymphadenopathy and known adnocarcinoma of unkown primary (see oncology section below) so he was scheduled for a CT head and torso to evaluate his malignancy.
The patient had severe left hip/thigh pain (see discussion below) so he was pre-medicated with tylenol, ibuprofen, lidocaine patch, and IV dilaudid prior to the CT.
A code blue was called and he was administered an amp of narcan, after which he woke up with increased respirations and improvement in his oxygenation on a non-rebreather.
This event was felt to be due to over-sedation from the dilaudid.
# Left hip/thigh pain: Patient reported severe pain in his left hip and thigh throughout this admission.
CT revealed a left psoas bleed with extension into the thigh.
The pain service was consulted and performed a femoral nerve block on [**2115-5-24**].
He has immediate pain relief, however the catheter became dislodged and he again reported excrutiating pain.
His pain was managed with IV dilaudid and a ketamine drip.
# Malignancy: Patient with supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, as well as right renal masses which are concerning for metastatic malignancy.
After discussion with oncology, the plan was to perform a thoracentesis and send the pleural fluid for cytology, and to try and obtain another tissue biopsy for further diagnostic information.
# ESRD on HD: Presumed secondary to DM, HTN, and CHF.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium continued to drop throughout the admission.
Was felt likely secondary to SIADH from his underlying malignancy.
# CHF: H/o of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with LVEF 40-45%.
As noted above, he was initially on the cardiology service and diuresed for suspected CHF exacerbation.
# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 score is 6 so very high stroke risk.
# CAD s/p CABG and PCI: Aspirin and plavix were held.
# Diabetes: Continued glargine and insulin sliding scale.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued rosuvastatin.
# Gout: Continued allopurinol.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole.
