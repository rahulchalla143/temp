Admission Date:  [**2183-12-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: metastatic cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided needle biopsy of RUL mass  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62 year old man with history of COPD who developed neck spasms in [**Month (only) **], PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] revealed lung tumor, with inconclusive results biopsy x 2 (via bronch).
He reports that approximately two weeks ago he developed R shoulder weakness, tingling, and pain that would radiate to his right hand.
At the same time he developed R buttock pain, with intermittent R leg pain.
He was initially admitted to the Neurosurgical service for the concern of spinal cord compression.
Currently he denies pain in his arm.
He states that he is weak in the shoulder and elbow on the right side.
He has no numbness or tingling of his right hand.
ROS: no chest pain.
no shortness of breath.
no bowel or bladder incontinence.
Family History: Brother with MI in mid 60s.
father died of dementia at 93. mother died of MI at 73. no cancers.
Neck: no cervical lymphadenopathy.
bronchial breath sounds on right upper fields.
no I:E prolongation CV: RRR no m/r/g Abd: flat, soft.
mild digital clubbing.
[**4-3**] right bicep.
FTN limited by shoulder strength  Pertinent Results: LABS on admission:  LABS on discharge:  IMAGING:   Brief Hospital Course: 62yo M w/ COPD admitted with right shoulder pain and weakness found to have large lung mass, with lesions to brain (5 solitary lesions), spine (C5 and T11) and possibly the kidney, unknown primary.
1.Lung Mass and HYPOXIA: Lung mass presumed to be the primary lesion, given the multiple lesions in ipsilateral and contralateral lung consistent with advanced disease.
Throughout the course of his admission he became progressively more hypoxic and tachycardic due to diffuse cancerous involvement of lungs bilaterally as well as associated emphysematous changes.
In addition, he likely developed a post obstructive pneumonia.
He was intubated on [**12-25**] for hypoxic respiratory failure according to the patient and his wife's wishes.
He was treated with vancomycin and zosyn for post obstructive pneumonia.
In addition given the late stage and wide spread metastasis of his cancer his prognosis was very poor.
He died within one hour of withdrawing ventillatory support.
METASTATIC DISEASE: Pt has metastatic disease to brain, contralateral lung, and spine (C5 and T11).
Also possible that he has disease in his kidney, given the abnormal 4.5 x 3.4cm L renal mass seen on CT. Also has rising LFTs and RUQ tenderness, raising concern for liver mets.
Most likely etiologies are metastatic lung ca vs. metastatic RCC.
He was continued on dexamethasone for brain/spinal mets and seizure prophylaxis.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: Most likely due to combination of steroids and post-obstructive pneumonia.
TRANSAMINITIS: Elevated LFTs and RUQ pain are concerning for liver metastases.
INR 1.4 so may have synthetic dysfunction as well (though pt's nutritional status is also poor which could be contributing).
