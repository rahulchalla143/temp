MICRO: pleural fluid cultures negative   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 100726**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of esophageal cancer s/p palliative XRT in [**12-7**], h/o angina, who presents with progressive SOB with worsening pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
She had a brief stay in the MICU upon admission to the hospital until her respiratory failure stabilized.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: She was admitted to the MICU with th ddx for her hypoxic respiratory failure included CHF exacerbation, malignant pleural effusion, lymphangitic [**Last Name (LF) 100727**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], worsening renal failure.
She had a thorocentesis on [**2130-4-6**] which ultimately showed malignant cells consistent with esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Over 1L of fluid was removed and she tolerated the procedure well and was less symptomatic afterwards.
On [**2130-4-11**] she had another thorocentesis for symptomatic relief and about 800mL was removed at that time.
She is being discharged with 5L NC, fluticasone IH, and furosemide 10mg daily to help relieve her shortness of breath from fluid overload.
# Malignant pleural effusions: The pleural fluid suggested it was an exudate (LDH ratio 0.6 (right on the border), protein ratio 0.58) which was concerning for malignant effusion given her clinical history.
The cytology returned with esophageal adenocarcinoma cells and no organisms.
Intervential pulmonology suggested a pleurex catheter to help drain the fluid.
She will consider this for symptomatic relief in the future.
# ARF: The reason for her acute renal failure was unclear.
# Esophageal Ca: She has received palliative XRT in [**12-7**].
The patient does not have an outpt oncologist.
Her cancer and the XRT has made it difficult for her to eat.
Once the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion was made, the palliative care team and social work helped to organize home hospice after conversations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending, and the patient and her son.
# Pain control:  She has an allergy to aspirin and acetaminophen which cause breathing difficulties and rashes.
# ARF: The reason for her acute renal failure was unclear.
# Anxiety: Given patient's anxiety/palpitations, we will discharge her on toprol XL to help with those symptoms.
# HTN: The patient was hypotensive initially and then her blood pressure increased to the low 100's.
# GERD: She has a history of hiatal hernia and GERD for which she often sleeps sitting up in bed to limit the acid reflux.
