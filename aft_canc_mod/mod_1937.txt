NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are again prominent, in keeping with mild parenchymal atrophy.
There is periventricular white matter hypodensity, unchanged from prior study, and consistent with the sequelae of chronic small vessel infarcts.
There is no shift of midline structures.
Accounting for small vessel ischemic change, the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved, without evidence for acute large vascular territory infarction.
There are no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no fracture identified.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated and clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Unchanged mild parenchymal atrophy and sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction.
Final Attending Comment: There are increased hypodensities in the left cerebellum which could represent age indeterminate infarcts, recommend MRI for further evaluation.
The lungs remain hyperexpanded, with increased AP diameter and flattening of the hemidiaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
There is interstitial thickening and distortion in the right perihilar region, compatible with radiation change and stable from prior studies.
There is no new consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
Visualized bones demonstrate no acute abnormality, though there is osteopenia with compression deformities of multiple mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-7-28**], the velocity across the aortic valve has increased slightly.
There is no pericardial effusion seen on the current study.
Chronic infarctions in the left superior cerebellar vermis and left cerebellar hemisphere, which are new since [**2161-12-22**].
Also, unchanged chronic infarctions in the right internal capsule, bilateral pons, and left cerebellar peduncle since [**2160-10-26**].
No acute infarction.
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
High-grade, 90-99% stenosis at the origin of the left internal carotid artery.
Approximately 60%, moderate stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old woman with h/o small cell lung cancer, diabetes type 2 on insulin presented with marked hyperglycemia.
# Hyperglycemia with anion gap acidosis:  Patient was admitted with serum glucose of 900, calculated osm of 322, and anion gap in the twenties.
The patient had a urinalysis with minimal bacteria and few WBC, but has been taking ciprofloxacin for approximately 9 days for a urinary tract infection.
Her CXR on [**3-30**] showed evidence of LLL pneumonia, unclear whether she had pneumonia at home which did not "blossom" until she received IVF in the hospital.
Her hyperglycemia with AGA likely represents a mixed picture DKA/HHS.
# Pneumonia:  Patient had leukocytosis of 11.8 on [**3-29**].
Presumably she had pneumonia prior to admission but it did not "blossom" until she received IVF in the hospital.
# Word finding difficulties:  Patient?????
She was found to have "naming" difficulties in the hospital, head CT showed cerebellar hypodensities.
Neurology was consulted who recommended MRA head/neck, which showed chronic infarctions in the left superior cerebellar vermis and left cerebellar hemisphere, which are new since [**2161-12-22**].
It also showed unchanged chronic infarctions in the right internal capsule, bilateral pons, and left cerebellar peduncle since [**2160-10-26**].
No acute infarction was seen.
Neurology felt her dementia is likely vascular dementia.
Left ICA stenosis was felt to be unrelated to cerebellar infarcts, and Neurology suggested that given her baseline dementia, no inpatient workup/intervention is necessary for this left ICA stenosis.
Glucagon (Human Recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
Dextrose 50% in Water (D50W)     Syringe Sig: 12.5 gm Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - Type II diabetes mellitus - Vascular dementia - 90-99% left ICA stenosis .
Secondary diagnoses: - History of small cell lung cancer - Hypertension - Hypothyroidism - Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of high blood sugars.
You finished antibiotic treatment for your urinary tract infection.
You were also found to have pneumonia, and was started on an antibiotic for it.
Also, you had some word-finding difficulties in the hospital.
You were seen by Neurology, who felt that there is no acute intervention required at this time.
On the MRI/MRA scan, you were also found to have severe blockages in the left carotid artery.
