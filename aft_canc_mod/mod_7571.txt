Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room where a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement was performed.
There were no adverse events in the operating room; please see the operative note for details.
The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint until he developed tachycardia and hypotension on [**2146-6-27**].
Cardiac enzymes were initially negative, a TEE revealed a hyperdynamic myocardium.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint until [**2146-6-27**] when he developed shortness of breath, new and increasing oxygen requirement and desaturation.
CTA of the chest revealed no evidence of PE, but the patient had evidence of worsening pulmonary function and ARDS.
The patient was initially putting out about 7-8 liters of bilious fluid a day.
TPN was started due to the elevated NG outputs (dark green bile).
POD#12, the patient decompensated with sudden onset chest and shoulder pain, shortness of breath, tachypnea, new oxygen requirement, EKG new right bundle branch block, and transient abdominal pain.
The patient was taken to the OR and exploration revealed a total of 5 liters of fluid non bilious.
He was found to have one small hole at the proximal anastomosis and purulent pocket.
Subsequently the patient developed multiple organ system failure, with acute renal failure requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis.
Worsening refractory metabolic acidosis requiring multiple boluses and IV drip bicarbonate.
Acute liver failure was also noted with INR>3 and liver transaminases >[**2133**].
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient developed sepsis as discussed above with multiple organisms (K. pneumonia, B. fragilis,...) The patient was placed on broad spectrum IV antibiotics.
The patient was showing signs of multiple organ system collapse with refractory hypotension and acidosis despite maximal medical therapy.
