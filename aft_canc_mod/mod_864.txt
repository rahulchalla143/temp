Admission Date:  [**2143-10-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-11-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-12-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Penicillins / Ciprofloxacin / Wellbutrin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**] Chief Complaint: Ascending and descending aortic aneurysm  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2143-10-30**] Replacement of Ascending Aorta and Total Arch, Four Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag, SVG to OM, SVG to RCA) Left heart catheterization and coronary angiography  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old female with a long-standing history of hypertension.
During a recent ER evaluation, she underwent a chest CT scan that was notable for a very large aneurysm and dilatation of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.
CT was also significant for a large amount of mural thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta.
There was no evidence of contrast extravasation or rupture.
The CT scan was also significant for coronary artery calcifications and left adrenal adenoma.
Given the dimensions of her aneurysm and uncontrolled hypertension, it was decided to admit her for blood pressure management along with further preoperative evaluation and urgent surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: Ascending and Descending Thoracic Aortic Aneursym coronary artery disease Hypertension History of mitral valve prolapse History of Rheumatic Fever diabetes mellitus  Social History: Current smoker, 1ppd for last 16 years.
Admits to infrequent ETOH, no history of abuse.
Family History: Father with coronary disease before age 55  Physical Exam: awake and alert lungs- clear cor- RSR at 88.
BP 130/84 bilat abdomen- benign extremeties- warm, good pulses, no edema wounds- clean and dry.
Pertinent Results: [**2143-10-21**] Chest CTA: CT ANGIOGRAM: Not significant change in the previously described massive aneurysmal dilatation of the entire ascending and descending thoracic aorta, including the arch.
There is mild compression of the main right and left pulmonary arteries by the large descending aortic aneurysm.
Large amount of mural thrombus is associated with the descending aortic aneurysm.
There is no evidence of contrast extravasation or rupture.
Intimal wall calcifications identified throughout the aorta.
The abdominal aorta measures 36 cm in diameter at the level of take off of celiac artery.
Atherosclerotic calcifications seen throughout the aorta.
3D measurements are as follows: aortic root: 34 x 30 mm, ascending aorta: 51 x 47 mm, aortic arch: 61 x 48 mm descending aorta (maximum): 85 x 72 mm, lower descending aorta: 37 x 34 mm CT CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: A 8 x 5 mm hypodense nodule is seen in the right thyroid lobe.
Diffusecoronary artery calcifications are again seen.
There is no pleural effusion.
Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left base.
Low-attenuation nodule again seen in the left adrenal gland, most consistent with adrenal adenoma.
Liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal, kidneys, uterus and urinary bladder are unremarkable.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is markedly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated with extrinsic compression of the left atrial free wall The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Cardiac catheterization was done to reveal significant disease .
Her preoperative workup was notable for a positive urinalysis for which she was empirically started on Ciprofloxacin.
Unfortunately, she went on to develop a drug rash which delayed surgery for several days.
Due to tacycardia despite metoprolol an echo was done, which revealed no pericardial effusion and preserved LV function.
A speech and swallowing evaluation was done due to continued complaints of odynophagia and dysphagia to liquids.
She was found to have aspiration with use of a straw and told to avoid these.
With BP controlled and her strength returning, she was deemed ready for discharge which she was anxious for.
