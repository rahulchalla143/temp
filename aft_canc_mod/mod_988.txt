Admission Date:  [**2168-6-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-6-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-12-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This 83 y/o woman with recent diagnosis of lung cancer after dyspnea/hemoptysis 2wk ago in setting of LE DVT and recurrent contralateral DVT w/ PE in spite of warfarin presents with left sided weakness.
Over the initial 45 minutes of evaluation, her left sided weakness progressed from significant drift to hemiplegia.
No meningismus.
No carotid bruits auscultated.
Speech (w/ daughter translating from English to [**Name (NI) 595**]) hypophonic and severely labially/lingually dysarthric but fluent.
Does not read or name.
Forced right gaze deviation but able to get slightly to left of midline volitionally.
Moderate left facial weakness.
Left UE 0/5 proximally and distally with low tone.
?No dysmetria on right.
The discrepancy between blood volume and mean transit times raises the question of an ischemic penumbra.
There was no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
Corresponding to the area of early ischemia is the presence of a right-sided insular ribbon sign on the conventional head CT images.
There is re-demonstration of the prominent left-sided cavernous carotid and supraclinoid aneurysm, which has substantial calcific components.
With regard to the angiography of the neck, neither common carotid bifurcation exhibits hemodynamically significant stenosis, although there was a markedly tortuous proximal right internal carotid artery demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: Findings consistent with large area of prolonged mean transit time, but with a blood volume "mismatch" within virtually the entire right middle cerebral artery territory.

She is not a candidate for tPA as she currently on therapeutic Lovenox, had recent hemoptysis due to lung cancer.
She is not a candidate for MERCI clot retrieval because there is decreased flow to the right anterior temporal lobe seen on perfusion imaging.
Her diffuse hypercoagulability with both Coumadin and more recently, Lovenox represents a Trousseau-like syndrome.
