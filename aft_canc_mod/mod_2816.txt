Of note, she had a recent admission [**Date range (1) 61319**] (>1 week ago) for back pain and urinary retention - she was found to have T10/T11 vertebral fracture but no cord compression.
She was also treated for pan-S E.coli UTI with Cipro for 7d ([**Date range (1) 61320**]).
Afterwards, she went to XRT, and then she experienced chest pain on the way home.
Not associated with sweating, but did come with some mild breathing discomfort.
She first noticed the pain when she was sitting in the car, and it lasted until she got to [**Hospital6 3105**].
EKG was not concerning for ischemia, and troponin was negative.
For tachycardia she was given 1L NS but due to persistent sinus tachycardia to 120 she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Here, she had no complaints of chest pain.
Troponin 0.2 and EKG with NSR, no concern for ischemia.
CXR suggested increased small b/l pleural effusions and old sternal/rib fractures.
Given her hypotension and febrile neutropenia, she was admitted to the MICU.
Notes that she did get a much milder form of the chest discomfort when moving from stretcher to bed just now; it is barely there but is bothersome.
No mouth ulcers or rash.
Also notable for chronic joint aches (which she thinks is related to GVH).
Chronic issues with constipation (had small BM yesterday).
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Multiple Myeloma --Presented in [**12/2190**] with a compression fracture and hypercalcemia initially thought to be due to hyper-PTH, treated with thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy --Presented again with anemia and renal failure with Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria (5.9 g) but no serum M spike detectable --BM biopsy showed multiple myeloma with 13q abnormalities --Highly aggressive disease and many treatments since in the following order: cycles - auto ([**2192-7-2**]) - cycles - allo ([**2194-10-8**]) remission until [**6-/2196**] then cycles this summer both auto and allo transplants --Cycle therapy: Since [**7-/2196**] Cyclophosphamide, Velcade, Cytoxan, Velcade, Doxil, Velcade --DLI [**2196-10-27**].
Other medical history: # S/p Fracture of 4 vertebrae # S/p Parathyroidectomy and accompanying thyroidectomy for benign nodules seen at time of surgery in [**5-29**] # Hyperparathyroidism # Hypothyroidism (secondary to surgery), on Synthroid now # Hypertension in context of multiple myeloma # Tubal ligation  Social History: -Home: Patient is retired and lives with husband and has 3 grown  children.
Family History: Mother died at 72 of metastatic breast cancer.
No significant ST-T wave changes compared to prior.
CXR [**2198-1-15**] There are increased small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right, with bibasilar atelectasis, underlying consolidation, particularly in the retrocardiac region, can not be exluced.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
Myelomatous bony changes as well as old sternal fracture of multiple vertebral body wedge compression fractures were better evaluated on prior CT from [**2197-12-28**].
No new sternal fracture.
Sternal body fracture healed, unchanged since [**2193**].
Pathologic right second rib fracture, new since [**Month (only) 1096**] [**2196**], is nondisplaced, shows increased callus formation since [**12-28**], but no mass or hematoma.
Healing right seventh rib fracture, stable since [**Month (only) 1096**].
New moderate bilateral pleural effusions, new moderate pericardial effusion, absent any indication of tamponade, and worsening anasarca, presumably related.
Mild increase in pulmonary artery caliber could be due to increased left atrial pressure, although there is no pulmonary edema.
LENI [**2198-1-17**] negative  V/Q 1/25 negative  CXR [**2198-1-19**] Pending read    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 61316**] is a 63y/o lady with history of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, status post allogeneic stem cell transplant, DLI, and ongoing Velcade/XRT who was transferred from an OSH due to chest pain and tachycardia, and was found to have neutropenic fever and hypotension.
Pt was admitted to MICU from OSH with septic shock ([**1-25**] UTI), which was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and responsive to fluids.
On floor, she was treated for neutropenic fever.
She developed acute renal failure, likely [**1-25**] ATN.
Pt ultimately developed afib with RVR, which was controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.
