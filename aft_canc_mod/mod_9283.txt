Patient remained afebrile, without a white count.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old woman with past medical history of etoh abuse, primary hyperparathyroidism s/p left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection in [**2127**], AF and sCHF p/w hypercalcemia, [**Last Name (un) **], elevated troponin, ruled out for ACS with hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
She presented with significantly high Ca and elevated PTH > 1300.
She subsequently underwent further imaging with thyroid ultrasound and parathyroid scan which showed a large left parathyroid adenoma.
T spine and L spine did not show any fractures, lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Her previous left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection operative reports and surgical pathology from [**Hospital3 3287**] were reviewed among her inpatient and outpatient endocrinologists, surgery, and radiology.
The decision was made to pursue  an exploratory surgery for resection of the neck tumor on [**2134-6-30**]  rather than FNA alone, for concern of possible seeding if it were to be a malignant tumor and the ultimate goal of treatment.
Pt was maintained  on IVF and intermittent lasix dosing, to gently diurese and allow for slow calcium excretion.
Her normocalcemia was most likely secondary to surgery but could be also due to the cinacalcet.
#Respiratory failure: After extubation from surgery, patient developed respiratory distress with O2 sat approaching 60% and hypotension with BP 80s/50s.
Pt previously had a PICC line, but  was found to be not working well.
The etiology of hypoxemia was unclear.
Most likely diagnosis was post-op apnea from anesthesia.
Hypotension was unlikely acute coronary syndrome with troponin downtrending since admission.
Felt most likely related with hypoxia vascular constriction causing right heart strain, in the  setting of severely impaired LVEF.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF.
Patient has history of cardiomyopathy with EF=30% in [**2130**].
Exam consistent with right-sided failure at admission (JVD, LE edema) and repeat echocardiogram showed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and EF = 25%.
She received large volume IVF for treatment of hypercalcemia with frequent dosing of Lasix.
Her CT neck/torso revealed pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and anasarca.
She was restarted on 40 mg PO Lasix and 6.25 mg PO carvedilol, but her blood pressure dropped to the 80's, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
# Elevated troponin: Patient had TropT = 0.13 at arrival.
She did not have cardiac complaints.
It is thought that elevated troponin was likely due to decreased clearance in setting of heart failure.
# Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease.
# Altered mental status/Delirium.
She presented with lethargy and some confusion.
However, she remained somewhat lethargic with decreased motivation while on the medicine floor.
Patient remained afebrile, without a white count.
# Macrocytic anemia.
She was noted to have increased reticulocyte counts.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Atrial fibrillation on warfarin.
# Seizures.
Patient reports history of seizures when she was drinking EtOH.
# Type 2 Diabetes.
She is discharged on her home anti-diabetic agents except for metformin given her kidney disease and Cr 1.5 on discharge.
# History of Breast Cancer, s/p left mastectomy.
# GERD: Stable.
