She states that she has a high threshold for pain and did not realize how bad it was during the day while at work but then when she got home at night she noticed it.
The patient noticed "silvery spects" in her vision and she had trouble with some simple tasks like finding the tags on the back of her clothing in the morning.
She has had some dizziness, but no nausea or vomiting.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
[**Last Name (STitle) 21881**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing "unchanged mass effect and edema around large right parietal mass, without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage following biopsy."
FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there is now mild linear hyperdensity within the basal cisterns of this could be hemorrhage, occasionally the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] can be somewhat denser appearing, in the setting of increased intracranial pressure, which would mimic the presence of subarachnoid blood.
No other new intracranial or extracranial abnormalities are discerned.
CONCLUSION: Possible small amount of subarachnoid blood or relatively stagnant vascular flow, in the face of increased intracranial pressure, as noted above.
ADDENDUM: There is a tiny residual gas collection superior to the biopsy site, definitely decreased in extent compared to the prior study of [**4-17**].
No previous tracing available for comparison.

HISTORY: Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.
WET READ REPORT: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] interpreted this study as revealing "bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic disease.
The largest mass in the right parietal lobe has a complex appearance, at least 5 cm in greatest dimension with at least 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema and 7 mm leftward midline shift."
FINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal, irregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny "daughter" cystic components extending towards the cortical surface.
As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 1131**], there is a substantial area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right atrium and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
A smaller area of edema is seen within the white matter of the left occipital lobe, but I cannot delineate any specific area of enhancement associated with it.
A third, very well circumscribed 18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen contiguous to the left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether the lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale.
Again, there is no associated enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted, either.
There is no overt extracranial abnormality noted.
CONCLUSION: Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent either a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm.
The additional abnormalities within the left temporal lobe and left occipital lobe, while they may represent extremely unusual manifestations of metastatic disease, which would then render the right parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have alternative diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left temporal meningioma as an explanation for the left temporal lesion, and either an inflammatory or ischemic process to account for the left occipital lesion.
I discussed this case this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast head CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to further characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior to brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.

PORTABLE CHEST: There are no priors for comparison.
Lungs are clear, and there are no effusions or pneumothorax.
No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
No evidence of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, but PA/Lateral CXR or CT would be more sensitive than a portable study and may be helpful for more complete assessment, if not already recently obtained.

1) Glioblastoma Multiforme: She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after fall and was noted to have a brain mass.
She was noted on [**4-21**] to have headache, with 4/18 she had mental status changes and imaging c/w herniation.
She was maintained on keppra and decadron for seizure/cerebral edema prevention.
She remained stable without signs of elevated intracranial pressure during this so was thought stable to go home and continue XRT as an outpatient.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
These could be signs of elevated intercranial pressure and could require urgent treatment.
