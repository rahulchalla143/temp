Bronchoscopy: Stain POSITIVE for PCP.
CXR: [**11-5**] - Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and pulmonary vascularity remains engorged.
Diffuse hazy opacities have progressed bilaterally accompanied by underlying interstitial opacities.
Although at least partially due to pulmonary edema, coexisting infection should be considered, particularly in the left upper lobe.
Extensive ground-glass change along with subpleural reticulation, airtrapping and traction bronchiectasis most likely representing the known PCP infective change.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
[**Last Name (un) **] pathology [**2195-11-19**] INTERPRETATION Non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
cytometry: Atypical cell present, favor reactive pneumocytes.
No viral cytopathic effects seen.
ECHO [**11-19**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D or saline contrast.
Images were suboptimal - a patent foramen ovale or secundum ASD cannot be definitively excluded on the basis of this study   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 66 y/o M w/ NHL-DLBCL with primary involvement of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach, s/p R-[**Hospital1 **] p/w neutropenic fever with episode of symptomatic SVT with hypotension now in NSR without intervention.
# PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]: Upon admission - CXR c/w multi-focal pneumonia.
Pt with tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis.
Fever as high as 103.3.
Previously started on cefepime and levofloxacin for neutropenic fever (ANC 240 on admission).
Initial sputum cx showed 1+ GPC in pairs but negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] maintained high suspicion due to bilateral infiltrate on CXR, rising LDH and hypoxia.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] with a component of heart failure requiring diuresis.
He the had a protracted course with pulmonary microatelectasis complicated by barotrauma, pneumothoraces, and oxygen toxicity from ventilation with high O2 and pressure/volume requirements.
He underwent 2 BALs with no addititive information, and he has continued to decline despite antibiotic therapy, steroids, and a trial of proning.
# Hyperkalemia: his course was also complicated by elevated potassium.
#Hyponatremia: he had persistent and worsening hyponatremia during the last few weeks of his stay.
Pt had normal EF with some diastolic dysfunction and a negative bubble study by ECHO.
Per EP/ Cardiology appears to be atrial tachycardia given p-waves.
Hx of lightheadedness and palpitations in the past.
Has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for paroxysmal SVT in the past, treated with atenolol.
New event [**11-10**] with rates to 180s, no conversion with Valsalva or carotid massage.
He was covered with beta blockage and amiodarone and had no further episodes throughout his stay.
# Elevated LFTs: Mildly elevated, will cont.
A abdominal film showed now obvious impaction or dilation of his colon or small bowel.
# CAD: S/p 2 stents in the past.
No chest pain w/ SVT.
# NHL:  S/p neulasta, initially neutropenic given recently completed final cycle of chemotherapy.
BAL revealed atypical cells - could not r/o lymphoid origin.
# Iron deficiency anemia: Hct at baseline.
This was complicated by high residuals which limited his feeding.
