She denied any motor, sensory, bowel or bladder dysfunction.
She presented to the [**Hospital6 6640**] in [**Location (un) 8545**] where a CT scan of the head was done and showed a small right occipital hypodensity 1 cm X 1 cm near the surface of the brain and right-sided 2-cm X 1.5-cm area of hypodensity in the right parietal paramedian region.
There was also a left hypodensity of 1 cm X 0.5 cm in the left parietal convexity.
The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further neurosurgical and neurologic evaluation.
Migraine with no reported migraine headaches in the preceding two years prior to admission.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 4.
Laryngeal carcinoma and status post radiotherapy for this.
Prior history of colon cancer.
Left subclavian clot with a Port-A-Cath in the past.
Transverse colectomy for colon cancer.
Prior dilatation and curettage.
ALLERGIES:  Allergy history includes PENICILLIN and a reported allergy to YELLOW DYE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was seen while sitting comfortably in bed, in no obvious distress.
There was no jugular venous distention, and no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination showed a left Port-A-Cath site with S1 and S2 normal, and no added sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
There was no tenderness over the spine, and no flank or costovertebral angle tenderness.
Cranial nerve I was deferred; II was normal visual acuity and fields; III, IV, and VI revealed extraocular movements were intact, no nystagmus; nerves V and VII revealed motor and sensory modalities in the face were normal; cranial nerves VIII, IX, X and XII were normal uvula and palatal movement, tongue was central, no fasciculations, and lateral movement was normal; cranial nerve [**Doctor First Name 81**] revealed the trapezius was with good motor strength.
The motor strength of all major muscle groups of the bilateral upper and lower extremities was [**4-8**], and there was no pronator drift.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Due to the clinical findings the patient was admitted with a history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a history of colon cancer and laryngeal cancer, and being on Coumadin for subclavian thrombosis.
MRI with contrast and MR venogram were done to rule out sinus thrombosis, and coagulations were repleted after the fresh frozen plasma, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was noted to be stable on [**8-9**] as well as early on [**8-10**], but in the late afternoon of [**8-10**] and early evening of [**8-10**] she complained of recurrent increased headache.
She went for an angiogram on [**8-12**] in the early morning hours, and this showed an occluded left internal jugular vein with drainage through collateral circulation, and the superior sagittal sinus with good drainage.
There was a patent severe sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, and internal jugulars on the right.
There was focal stenosis at the junction of the left subclavian vein with Port-A-Cath tip present at that level.
The patient was subsequently returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with no sequelae from the angiogram, and a head CT was scheduled for the following day.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was seen during this hospitalization with Neurology/Oncology as well as Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy.
It was felt that the patient would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehabilitation center, and arrangements were made for this to occur at the time of discharge with arrangements for the patient to be directly transferred to an acute rehabilitation center with plan for discharge on [**2158-8-18**].
