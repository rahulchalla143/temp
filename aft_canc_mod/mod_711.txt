Briefly, 56 y/o F with PMH of metastatic melanoma, on dacarbazine therapy, anxiety, sarcoid, and hyperthyroidism who presents with anemia.
The patient recently had her 2nd cycle of chemotherapy on [**2-1**] followed by Neulasta who initially came to the hospital with fatigue & SOB and was found to have a Hct of 13.
CXR showed no new infiltrate.
CT abd/pelvis showed progression of her matastatic disease.
At that time chest CT showed RUL collapse.
Interventional pulmonology did a bronchoscopy which revealed extrensic mass compressing on the bronchus, mucus plugging and evidence for post-obstructive pneumonia.
They also noted evidence of reflux and paradoxical vocal cord closure.
Past Medical History:  Oncologic History Ms. [**Known lastname 17264**] was noted to have a 5- cm right axillary mass on mammogram in [**7-/2181**] with surgical resection revealing melanoma.
She underwent right axillary completion lymph node dissection in [**10/2181**] with no melanoma in three remaining lymph nodes.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed an abnormality with followup CT raising concern for lymphadenopathy versus sarcoidosis.
She underwent mammogram revealing bilateral breast masses with biopsy revealing metastatic melanoma.
Torso CT revealed subcutaneous and paraspinous nodules as well as mediastinal, pericardial, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
She underwent bronchoscopy and cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy revealing sarcoidosis.
PET scan revealed FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
She began ECOG protocol 2603 with carboplatin, taxol +/- sorafenib on [**2183-4-2**] with course complicated by neutropenia requiring dose reductions and delayed treatment.
She completed 7 cycles with therapy stopped due to pancytopenia.
Torso CT on [**2184-5-21**] revealed disease progression.
She developed atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**2184-6-30**] in setting of hyperthyroidism.
She completed 4 cycles on the RAF 265 protocol with evidence of disease progression.

S1S2, 2/6 SEM at LLSB Gastrointestinal: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
[**2185-2-23**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
MRI is more sensitive for detection of small masses.
Interval increase in size of left posterior scalp subcutaneous nodule, concerning for metastasis.
Significantly progressed metastatic disease as demonstrated by new pulmonary nodule, new right adrenal nodule, and increased size of pre-existing metastases.
No abdominal aorta aneurysm or rupture.
No retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
No new osseous spinal disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 17264**] is a 56 y/o F with PMH of metastatic melanoma, on dacarbazine therapy, anxiety, sarcoid, and hyperthyroidism who presents with shortness of breath and fatigue and was found to have a HCT of 13.
ANEMIA: The most likely etiology was thought to be myelosuppression from recent chemotherapy, however the degree of anemia is lower than expected.
She had leukopenia but no thrombocytopenia which would argue against this.
There was no evidence of bleeding during her hospitalization.
She was guaiac neg and CT of abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
She remained hemodynamically stable during the admission and was not tachycardic which one would expect with an anemia of this degree.
She had a CT of her abdomen and pelvis which showed progression of disease.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17265**], who follows her as an outpatient, met with the patient and her family for over an hour to discuss the CT results and plans for future treatment.
Her ANC improved and she was no longer neutropenic on discharge.
She was continued on Valacyclovir for viral prophylaxis.
Her aspirin was held during this admission due to concern for bleeding.
Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Anemia 2.
Metastatic Melanoma   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with anemia which is low red blood cells.
You were monitored for 72 hours without evidence of bleeding.
You were started on Omeprazole (Prilosec) 40mg by mouth once a day and should continue to take this to prevent any bleeding in your stomach.
You were started on Augmentin to take twice a day for 10 days for your ear infection in the left ear.
You could come to the hospital for shortness of breath, severe fatigue or any bleeding in your bowel movements.
You should check your stool for blood, black or tarry stools and come to the emergency room if this develops.
