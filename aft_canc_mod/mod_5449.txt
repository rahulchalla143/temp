This pregnancy was complicated by severe IUGR of this twin.
Infant was born by a Cesarean section due to maternal preterm contractions and ongoing concern of lack of growth, oligohydramnios and absent end diastolic flow.
Fetal ultrasound at 18 week gestation revealed that this infant had a central nervous system anomaly consistent with Dandy-Walker malformation.
Infant had a weak cry on delivery which improved.
Infant had a very large anterior fontanel with splitting of the sagittal sutures and large posterior fontanel.
Her lens have increased lenticular vascular pattern consistent with immaturity.
No masses, no adenopathy.
Genitourinary: Consistent with preterm infant.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the NICU, intubated for management of apnea and surfactant deficiency.
Chest film done on [**3-12**] because of ongoing oxygen needs showed low lung volumes but no specific findings.
Because of her ongoing oxygen needs most likely due to her severe growth restriction, she will be f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9340**] at [**Last Name (STitle) 46080**] pulmonary clinic.
On [**2-20**] a repeat ECHO was performed beause of an ongoing murmur with  requirement for nasal cannula.
She will be discharged home on FiO2 of 100% at 75 cc L flow, with low oxygen saturation limit at 90%.
She was on enteral feeds of 138 cc/kg and remaining peripheral IV which required slow weaning because of hypoglycemia when  trialed off IV.
Anterior fontanell has always been slightly full but soft.
Repeat head ultrasound on [**2-22**] showed stable dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and inferior vermian hypoplasia, but a new finding of bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhages.
Repeat HUS on [**3-14**] showed no change in the germinal matrix hemorrhage and mild dilitation of the ventricles with dysgenesis of corpus callosum.
Radiology felt no further HUS's are necessary, but an outpatinet MRI will be done post discharge.
No further recommendations.
Endocrine: On repeated state screens [**Known lastname **] had elevated TSH values with normal T4's.
At this time TSH remained elevated at 19, T4 of 8.9 and free T4 of 1.4.
