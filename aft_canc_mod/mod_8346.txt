Heterogeneous predominantly hyperechoic liver parenchyma that may relate to underlying hemachromatosis.
More severe forms of liver disease including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded by ultrasound.
Nonobstructing left renal calculi.
Probable upper pole left renal cyst.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.
The degree of aortic stenosis is similar.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male with history hemachromatosis and cirrhosis who was transferred from an outside hospital with an UGIB.
The pt had an EGD performed by the liver service which demonstrated significant portal gastropathy but no focal site of bleeding.
His home BB, spironolactone, Bumex and [**Last Name (un) **] were held in the setting of acute GI bleeding.
## ESLD: The pt had no evidence of SBP on exam.
As above, he was initially treated with Cipro for possible variceal bleed and his diuretics were held while hypotensive with his acute bleeding.
He was instructed to stop drinking alcohol in order to improved his liver function and decrease the risk of bleeding from his gastropathy.
Anemia likely worsened by portal gastropathy bleeding.
##CAD: He had no history of CAD or prior MI, stated had "false positive" stress test here in [**2158**] followed by negative cath.
Had TTE from [**2-14**] with mild AS, trivial MR. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9413**] was noted on physical exam concerning for AS, thus a repeat TTE was obtained which was unchanged from prior study except for increase in mild MR and no LVH.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Multifactorial Anemia Portal gastropathy Cirrhosis Hemachromatosis   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, hemodynamically stable, ambulating without difficulty   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed and anemia.
Your colonoscopy showed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
You were given multiple blood transfusions.
Your anemia is due in part to your liver disease and portal gastropathy.
Please return to the hospital if you experience fevers/chills, shortness of breath.
Bloody or black stool, bleeding, or any other symptoms that concern you.
Followup Instructions: You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office for an appointment.
