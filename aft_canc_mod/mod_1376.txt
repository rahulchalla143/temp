He recently had developed bad mucositis [**1-14**] round 3 of CHOP, and had some difficulty swallowing.
A BAL was done and showed mold, with suspicion of Aspergillus (outside record does not state why aspergillus suspected).
He improved on zosyn/voriconazole, and repeat CXR on [**7-2**] showed improvement in LUL infiltrate, but large right sided pleural effusion.
Pt's course was also complicated by hypernatremia up to Na+ 160, resistant to treatment.
MRI of the brain was ordered, and showed among other findings increased uptake in the pituitary stalk, concerning for pituitary involvement with diabetes insipidus.
MRI also significant for multiple lesions in leptomeningeal and posterior parietal compartments, involvement of cerebellum.
He does have a cough that is sometimes productive and feels SOB.
He denies recent fevers, chills, or night sweats.
Has diarrhea but states that this is a chronic problem, no [**Name2 (NI) **] or mucous.
Since he has been in [**Hospital1 18**], he has received Methotrexate x 2 days and last [**Hospital1 **] level today was 0.13 and high dose dexamethasone  that has been tapered to 8mg Qday.
He was also diagnosed with b/l DVT and an IVC filter was placed.
Of note this was his first x-ray since his CT scan on [**7-8**] which was negative for pneumoperitoneum.
Today he denied abdominal pain,nausea, emesis SOB, CP, night sweats chills or hematochezia.
However he complains of fatigue and weakness.
He had an ECHO in [**2133-5-26**] per report gross nl with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and estimated EF of 60%.

Diffuse homogeneous enhancement is seen within the lesion on the postcontrast scans.
There are multiple nodular and linear areas of leptomeningeal enhancement in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, right parietal cortex, and the optic chiasm.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction is seen.
IMPRESSION: Nodular areas of enhancement seen in the right periventricular white matter and involving the optic chiasm.
Multiple other linear and nodular areas of leptomeningeal enhancement are seen in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and in the right parietal lobe.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Small-to-moderate pleural effusion is present on the right, free flowing and of low density.
A trace effusion is present on the left.
In the left upper lobe, there is a large cavitating mass with a thick irregular enhancing rim.
The lesion measures 73 x 52 mm in axial dimensions and is contiguous with bronchovascular thickening that tracks towards the hilum.
The patient has mild-to-moderate emphysema as well.
An ill-defined nodule along the left major fissure has a base measuring up to 13 mm with a height of 5 mm (3:31).
Mild interstitial changes are noted in the periphery of the left lower lobe.
In the right lung, there are a number of ill-defined irregular pulmonary nodules, the majority of which are pleural-based.
A representative nodule along the right lower lobe medial pleural surface measures 14 x 10 mm in diameter.
There is also a more patchy ill-defined consolidative and ground-glass opacity in the right lower lung suggesting atelectasis or perhaps infectious or inflammatory pneumonitis.
This is also a focal band-like opacity in the left lower lobe suggestive of atelectasis.
The largest measures 13 mm in diameter and is low in density, suggestive of a simple cyst.
There is a widespread infiltrative abnormality throughout the central retroperitoneum that fully encases the aorta and inferior vena cava, although these are patent.
It encases bilateral duplicated main renal arteries as well as the left renal vein and small lumbar vessels.
It tracks superiorly and closely approaches the splenic vein and infiltrates the retroperitoneal fat, which shows increased attenuation that obscures the left adrenal gland.
An extensive, more dense central mesenteric mass measuring approximately 82 x 46 mm in axial dimensions (3:71) encases but does not splay or narrow multiple mesenteric arteries and veins passing through it.
There is an aneurysm of the lower abdominal aorta, with rim calcification and thrombus measuring up to 32 x 28 mm in axial dimensions.
There is also a fusiform aneurysm of the right common iliac artery with peripheral calcification and thrombus of 29 mm in diameter.
These are fully encased by mostly hypoenhancing infiltrative soft tissue, although immediately anterior to the lower aorta, a rim of enhancing tissue that measures 24 x 7 mm in axial dimensions (3:79) is also noted and may represent an area of persistent lymphoma.
Scattered diverticula are present throughout the colon.
Each kidney demonstrates moderate hydronephrosis with surrounding fat stranding and ureters pass through the region of high attenuation.
Although it is possible that hydronephrosis is secondary to bladder distention, the possibility that the ureters are blocked by retroperitoneal fibrosis associated with malignancy should be considered.
The upper left ureter, upstream of the area of more dense area of retroperitoneal infiltarion, shows enhancement that may be inflammatory or potentially due to malignant infiltration.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is an expansile nearly occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein.
A deep inguinal lymph node on the left measures 24 x 13 mm in axial dimensions (3:108).
A deeper pelvic sidewall lymph node of 15 x 25 mm (3:97) is also noted, worrisome for active lymphoma.
There is no ascites.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Mild degenerative changes are present along the lower lumbar spine.
A small sclerotic focus along the right iliac crest is nonspecific but most likely due to a small bone island.
Lower thoracic interspaces are mildly narrowed and irregular with small anterior osteophytes.
The large left upper lobe abscess has not grown, but continues to cavitate and there may be a new small nodule in the right mid lung just above the elevated right hemidiaphragm.
Moderate right pleural effusion largely posterior has increased.
There is no pulmonary edema or other widespread pulmonary abnormality.
Heart size is normal and there is no evidence of mediastinal venous engorgement.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 34578**] is a 58yoM with a history of B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma who presented to an OSH with fever and hypotension, found to have CNS lesions and a cavitating lung infiltrate, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Since he has been in [**Hospital1 18**], he has received Methotrexate x 2 days and last [**Hospital1 **] level today was 0.13 and high dose dexamethasone  that has been tapered to 8mg Qday.
He was also diagnosed with b/l DVT and an IVC filter was placed.
Of note this was his first x-ray since his CT scan on [**7-8**] which was negative for pneumoperitoneum.
A surgical consult was called and given the new finding of pneumoperitoneum, he was taken urgently to the operating room for exploration of a potential GI tract perforation.
Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 34579**] operative dictation for additional details.
After identification of the problem, he was reversed with Protamine 50 mg and a head CT was performed to ensure no evidence of intracranial bleed -- it was negative.
He remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
On POD 5, Mr. [**Known lastname 34578**] developed relatively sudden onset tachycardia to the 120s and hypotension to a systolic of 70s.
A CXR done at the time showed significant amount of free air -- over the amount one would normally expect as residual from the laparotomy four days ago.
Death was confirmed by 2 minutes of no spontaneous respiration or pulse.
