There is no acute hemorrhage, or large acute territorial infarction.
No blood in the ventricles.
The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear normal.
There is no fracture seen.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdense round mass in the right cereberal hemisphere, with significant amount of vasogenic edema, concerning for metastasis.
4 mm shift of midline structures.
MRI Head [**6-23**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse edema identified in the right parietooccipital region extending from the periatrial right region.
Mass effect is seen on the right lateral ventricle without midline shift.
Within the area of edema there is heterogenous T2 abnormality seen measuring approximately 3 cm, which demonstrates enhancement following gadolinium administration.
There is also subtle subependymal enhancement seen along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There are no other foci of abnormal enhancement seen within the brain.
There is no hydrocephalus identified.
IMPRESSION: Right periatrial approximately 3 cm enhancing mass with extensive surrounding edema.
The mass also demonstrates subtle subependymal enhancement along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Chronic blood products are seen within the mass.
The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, glioma or metastatic disease.
A region of ground-glass opacity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (3:11) appears unchanged measuring 9 mm.
There are stable-appearing multiple bilateral pleural plaques which are consistent with the patient's history of asbestos exposure.
There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is no hilar adenopathy.
There is calcification of the aortic arch without evidence for aneurysm or dissection.
There is coronary artery vascular calcification.
No pericardial effusion.
There are no pleural effusions.
The partially visualized lobes of the thyroid appear normal.
The right and left adrenals appear unremarkable.
The pancreas is slightly fatty replaced but appears otherwise normal.
In segment VII of the liver is a predominantly hypodense mass measuring 3 x 2.2 cm with peripheral area of enhancement consistent with prior diagnosis of a hemangioma within the liver.
Segment sVI small hemangioma is unchanged.
Segment II hemangioma seen in [**2108**] is not apparent today.
There are multiple smaller hypodensities throughout the liver, too small to fully characterize but appear unchanged.
No new masses are identified in the liver.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is a hypodensity in the interpolar region of the right kidney (3:56), too small to characterize.
Left renal size has decreased since [**2108**] from 10.9 cm SI to 9.2 cm SI and there is slight cortical thinning and delayed enhancement compared to the right.
There is narrowing at the iorigin of the left renal artery with calcified plaque and slight post-stenotic dilation that likely reflects high-grade left renal artery stenosis, though it is not optimally evaluated on this non- angiographic study.
The abdominal aorta is densely calcified with calcific and non- calcific atheromatous plaque, but no aneurysm.
Celiac artery origin narrowing appears mild There are scattered non- pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes.
No free air or free fluid is seen in the abdomen.
Stomach and abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear grossly normal.
The rectum is normal; however, there is sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Remaining pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear normal.
There is no free air or free fluid in the pelvis.
There are scattered mesenteric nodes but none are pathologically enlarged.
No inguinal lymphadenopathy.
There is extensive atherosclerosis with apparent moderate to high grade narrowing of the left common iliac artery at its origin and similarly at the origin of the left external iliac artery.
There is also moderate-highgrade narrowing in the mid right external iliac artery.
No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions are present.
No foci concerning for new primary malignancy.
The patient's multiple pleural plaques secondary to history of asbestos exposure appear stable.
Chronic changes from right lower lobectomy.
Left renal artery origin stenosis, likely high-grade, with decreased size of left kidney since [**2108**], cortical thinning, and delayed enhancement.
Bilateral iliac artery stenoses detailed above, but not optimally evaluated on this non- angiographic study and because of calcified atherosclerosis.
If not evaluated in the past MRA is recommended because of the extent of calcification limiting CTA assessment.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Head CT [**6-27**](post-op) FINDINGS: There is a hyperdense 3 x 2.5 cm mass in the right cerebral hemisphere causing significant vasogenic edema and approximately 6 mm of leftward shift of the septum pellucidum, unchanged since [**6-22**], [**2113**].
There are no areas concerning for hemorrhage.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears normal apart from the marked edema around the right cerebral mass.
There are no areas concerning for an acute infarction.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to a hyperdense mass in the right cerebral hemisphere with stable vasogenic edema and 5 mm of midline shift.
No areas concerning for hemorrhage postoperatively.
Post-surgical changes, with hemorrhage in the right parietal resection bed and a small amount of layering hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles, unchanged from study of 11 hours earlier.
Unchanged vasogenic edema of the right cerebral hemisphere.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after having a newly identified right parietal mass in the setting of increased confusion and left sided weakness.
In the setting of a relatively benign CT torso; it was best thought to biopsy the lesion in the head first to determine pathology.
Preliminary pathology revealed a likely metastatic pathology.
Post operative scan which was performed within 4 hours revealed some bleeding in the operative bed with extension to the third and lateral ventricles.
On clinical exam patient was easily arrouseable, but had some left lower extremity weakness with planter flexion.
Given our concern for the development of hydrocephalus, the patient was sent for a repeat CT scan within two hours, which was not concerning for hydrocephalus.
On [**7-10**] patient was transferred from the floor back to the Stepdown for desaturation episodes and decline in mental status.
Patient underwent a CTA of the chest to rule out PE and a noncontrast CT. CTA was negative for PE, and the CT of the head was unchanged from a study done on [**7-6**].
Patient was pan cultured and had LFTs and dopplers ordered to further work up his fevers.
The bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.

If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
