Of note the patient was admitted from [**2199-7-13**] through [**2199-7-16**] with BRBPR, acute on chronic anemia and chest pain with ECG changes.
The patients chest pain subsequently resolved and she was discharged home.
There was a recommendation for tagged RBC scan during that admission, however she had no further episodes of bleeding during the hospitalization.
Since discharge the patient has had mulitple episodes of BRBPR.
On the morning of admission patient reported substernal chest pain across her chest that resembled prior episodes of chest pain.
Past Medical History: -Acute on Chronic GI Bleed ([**2199-7-13**]) with associated CP requiring 4pRBCs -L MCA infarct [**2181**], residual R sided deficits -AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.1 cm2 by TTE [**3-2**]) -HTN -Carotid stenosis -Moderate pulm HTN -Cecal and splenic flexure mass ([**4-1**] Bx showed superficial fragments of colonic mucosa with rare dilated crypts, granulation tissue formation and focal ulceration may be seen overlying/adjacent to a mass lesion or may represent superficial  sampling of an inflammatory-type polyp) -Diverticulosis -Internal hemorrhoids   Social History: H/o tobacco use.

[**2199-8-2**] Colonoscopy Report Impression:	Mass in the hepatic flexure Mass in the splenic flexure Polyp in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the rectum Diverticulosis of the whole colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to Terminal ileum .
GI BLEEDING STUDY	Study Date of [**2199-7-30**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of active gastrointestinal bleed.
Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F with hx of prior CVA with residual R-sided weakness, AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2  cm2), known cecal and splenic flexure masses, recently admitted for sub-sternal chest pressure in the setting of BRBPR and a Hct of 20.8 presents with substernal chest pressure in setting of BRBPR.
She was ruled out for MI by EKG and enzymes.
She continued to have melenic and frankly bloody bowel movement.
Colonoscopy showed splenic flexure and hepatic flexure masses concerning for malignancy; also showed rectal polyp that was presumed to be the source of bleeding (although was not bleeding at the time of colonscopy).
# Substernal Chest Pressure: Resembles prior episode in setting of ECG changes suggestive of ischemia.
Likely demand ischemia in setting of gastrointestinal bleed.
# HTN: BP stable.
# Prophylaxis: Pneumatic boots.
Colonic masses at the hepatic and splenic flexures   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had several studies or procedures performed, and we determined that your bleeding was coming from a rectal polyp.
