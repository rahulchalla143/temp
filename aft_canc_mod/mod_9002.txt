She did not have an EEG, since her seizures were clinically evident.
She also had an LP positive for malignant cells, and received intrathecal cytarabine, complicated by chemical meningitis with mental status changes.

EEG: [**10-2**] EEG - IMPRESSION: This EEG is severely abnormal and gives evidence for bilaterally independent-appearing paroxysmal epileptiform transients.
There is a severe diffuse encephalopathy also seen suggestive of multifocal structural pathology +/- metabolic component.
[**2187-10-3**] EEG IMPRESSION: This EEG shows a diffuse and moderately to moderately severe encephalopathy with background slowing, loss of any normal frequencies, but predominance over the posterior head regions and greater slowing in the right hemisphere suggestive of structural  pathology bilaterally and more posteriorly in location.
The activity on the right also had fairly persistent pseudoperiodic epileptiform  discharges.
Overall, the encephalopathic and slow wave features of the record seemed to gradually increase.
[**2187-10-4**] EEG IMPRESSION: This EEG is markedly abnormal and it shows multifocal independent interictal epileptiform activity, the most active area being the right central and posterior quadrant but independent discharges were seen in the left fronto-polar, left fronto-parasagittal, and left temporal regions.
There is also severe diffuse slowing of the background with periods of asymmetry suggesting more structural pathology in the right posterior quadrant but the likelihood of multifocal abnormalities exists.
Overall, this tracing appears to have deteriorated in several ways, including the encephalopathic features and the multifocal epileptiform features.
[**2187-10-5**] EEG IMPRESSION: This bedside recording continues to be markedly abnormal, with the presence of a severe, diffuse encephalopathy that also has some focal features in the right posterior quadrant.
Multifocal interictal epileptiform activity is again identified.
[**2187-10-17**]: EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed a slow and disorganized background throughout, indicative of a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
In addition, there were bursts of generalized slowing and there were several generalized sharp waves.
Focally, there was some suppression of the background over the right hemisphere early in the recording, in the same area, especially the right fronto-central area, had runs of semi-rhythmic slow waves with very sharp features.
Nevertheless, these were not overtly epileptiform, and there were no runs of sharp features rhythmic or fast enough to suggest ongoing seizures.
The right fronto-central sharp features early in the recording along with the suppressed background in the same area suggests a focal structural abnormality in that region.
A periodicity is reminiscent of periodic lateralized discharges, and these sometimes occur at the end of a clinical or electrographic seizure or even status epilepticus.
[**2187-10-18**]: EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Regular sampling showed a slow encephalopathic background throughout plus additional focal slowing in the right centro-temporal region.
There were multifocal sharp waves, including in the area of focal slowing on the right, but these were seen in isolation.
There were no repetitive discharges or electrographic seizures.
Multiple intracranial metastases appear grossly stable, within the limitations of noncontrast CT. MRI would be more sensitive for their evaluation, if clinically indicated.
Extensive vasogenic edema and postradiation changes in bilateral supratentorial white matter.
2-3 mm leftward shift of the anterior falx is increased since the [**2187-8-10**] exams.
A right PICC terminates within the cavoatrial junction.
The left moderate pleural effusion is unchanged.
No pneumothorax or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
[**10-2**] MRI Head c/s gadolinium FINDINGS: Discrete interval progression of supra- and infratentorial metastatic disease with increase in size and perifocal edema of the lesions.
Infratentorial lesions, most notably the largest in the inferior aspect of the vermis, are stable.
As many of the lesions reach the surface of the brain, there is concern for leptomeningeal disease.
No dynamics are seen with regard to the hemorrhagic component of various metastasis.
There is no new significant hemorrhage and no change in mass effect.
Specifically, there is no evidence of new new fourth ventricle obstruction.
With unchanged position of the right frontal ventriculostomy, there is no new onset hydrocephlus.
Incidential note is again made of an expanded and fluid-filled empty sella with no displacement of the pituitary stalk, most likely corresponding to a partially empty sella versus an arachnoid cyst.
IMPRESSION: Discrete interval progression of metastatic disease without evidence of immediate complications such as new onset relevant hemorrhage, infarction or hydrocephalus.
[**2187-10-15**] portable chest x-ray: Compared to the prior study there has been a dramatic increase in a large left pleural effusion with only a small amount of residual aerated lung on the left.
There is a small right effusion and either some volume loss or small infiltrate in the right lower lobe.
IMPRESSION: Interval dramatic increase in left pleural effusion.
[**2187-10-15**] portable chest x-ray (post-thoracocentesis): FINDINGS: There has been interval decrease in the left-sided effusion.
There continues to be some loculated effusion in the left mid lung and some areas of volume loss in the left lower lobe.
There is a small right effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2187-10-19**] chest X ray: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-15**], there is substantial increased haziness of the hemithoraces bilaterally, consistent with recurrent effusions, substantially worse on the right.
Indistinct pulmonary markings is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
[**2187-10-19**] head CT: FINDINGS: Compared to prior, the extensive hypodensities within the right frontal and parietal white matter has increased in volume.
This is likely due to increasing vasogenic edema compounded by post-radiation changes.
There has been further shift of the midline structures to the left by approximately 0.2 cm.
No evidence for herniation; however, there has been progressive effacement of the basilar cisterns.
Again seen are numerous supratentorial and infratentorial hyperdense metastases which have slightly increased in size since previous examination.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
No suspicious osseous lesions or fractures.
Increase in the extensive vasogenic edema with further leftward shift of the midline structures.
No herniation or new hemorrhage.
[**2187-10-21**]: chest X ray: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion has progressed and thus now occupies the entire right hemithorax.
This hemithorax is completely opacified by the effusion, resulting in displacement of mediastinal organs and the heart decreases the volume of the left hemithorax.
Presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Low precordial voltage.
PATHOLOGY: Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
Skin, left breast, punch biopsy: Poorly differentiated carcinoma, diffusely present within dermis (stroma and lymphatics), morphologically consistent with patient's previously resected breast carcinoma.
PERTINENT LABS ON DISCHARGE: [**2187-10-21**] 05:46 WBC RBC Hgb Hct MCV MCH MCHC RDW Plt Ct 5.6 3.20* 11.1* 32.1* 100* 34.8* 34.8 18.2* 40* [**2187-10-21**] 05:46 Glucose UreaN Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap 191*1 25* 0.2* 141 3.8 106 28 11 Calcium Phos Mg 8.4 2.7 1.6 [**2187-10-15**]: LDH 981   Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o F with h/o metastatic breast cancer with brain mets and h/o seizure, who presented on [**2187-10-2**] with recurrent seizures and mental status decline.
After her seizures were controlled she was transferred from Neurology to the Medicine Service for acute respiratory distress due to malignant pleural effusion.
#) Malignant Pleural Effusion.
Pt was noted to be tachypneic on the morning of [**10-15**] and stat CXR showed large pleural effusion with lung collapse.
Pleural fluid studies were consistent with exudative effusion, and cytology showed malignant cells.
On [**2187-10-19**] she triggered with SBP 170s, and repeat CXR showed interval increase in pleural effusions, with evidence of volume overload.
She continued to breathe spontaneously with good oxygenation and minimal evidence of respiratory distress, although she appeared to make grimaces that responded well to pain relief (see below).
#) Seizure: Per Neurology notes, the patient presented with a rapid sequence of recurrent seizures without return to her baseline neurologic status that was consistent with status epilepticus.
Her LTM EEG showed severe diffuse encephalopathy with bilateral paroxysmal epileptiform transients with subsequent suppression of her epileptiform discharges overnight on [**10-3**].
She had no further seizures post extubation.
Imaging showed interval progression of brain metastases, the likely cause of her seizures.
Per her neurooncologist, she could not be offered further interventions for these metastases.
LTM EEG was again performed, and no seizures were noted.
A repeat head CT showed further interval progression of brain edema and midline shift.
#) Metastatic Breast Cancer / Goals of care - She had an Ommaya reservoir placed in [**8-/2187**] for salvage chemotherapy as her breast cancer had been refractory to prior treatments.
Her glucose levels were also followed and she was placed on insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia due to corticosteroid use.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3877**], her oncologist, all therapeutic options for her malignancy had been exhausted.
This was thought to be due to both prerenal hypovolemia and acute tubular necrosis secondary to low perfusion.
Creatinine was stably low at 0.2-0.5, possibly because of decreased muscle mass from low nutrition.
#) Nutrition: Given her mental status and concern for aspiration, a Dobhoff tube was placed but she was able to demonstrate adequate and safe PO intake and it was pulled on [**2187-9-11**].
On [**2187-10-19**] after the trigger event, she was deemed unstable to proceed with Dobhoff placement, and received TPN thereafter for parenteral nutrition.
#) Pain control: pt was on oral oxycodone prn, which was converted to sublingual oxycodone prn, per palliative care recommendations, when her PO intake dropped.
This was thought to be due to essential hypertension and pain.
We continued to monitor her platelet counts daily.
#) L breast lesion: Pt was noted to have an indurated, erythematous lesion covering the entire left breast, which was the site of her mastectomy.
Neurology service continued her antibiotics (cefazolin) out of concern for infection, although she was afebrile throughout hospital course.
We consulted dermatology, who performed tissue biopsies and Gram stains, showing poorly differentiated carcinoma and no evidence of infection.
#) GERD: no active issues were noted.
