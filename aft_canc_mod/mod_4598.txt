The casodex was discontinued recently (w/in past year) because of constitutional side effects and back pain.
The patient has had rising PSA since then.
On [**2174-5-27**], had a tonic clonic seizure, was evaluated at an OSH with a CT head and MRI non-contrast that demonstrated R frontal lobe lesion.

He tolerated the procedure well without complications.
He is A&Ox3, no focal findings.
He has no specific BP goals.
Currently, he has mild headache, but says that he is otherwise feeling much better.

Pertinent Results: STUDIES: MRI Brain [**6-1**] 2.2 x 2.9 cm cortical-based right frontal mass with imaging characteristics most consistent with lymphoma.
Given the limited degree of white matter infiltration and edema, etiologies such as glioma or metastatic disease are somewhat less likely.
Post-surgical changes in the right frontal region with blood products in the right frontal lobe at the surgical resection site.
Hence assessment for abnormal enhancement is limited.
There is persistent cortical thickening with surrounding FLAIR hyperintense signal as on the preoperative study.
However, the majority of the enhancing lesion noted on the preoperative study is not seen on the present study indicating interval removal, with limited assessment for subtle changes.
Necrosis and vascular proliferation are present.
Tumor infiltrates adjacent brain parenchyma.
The tumor is newly diagnosed   Brief Hospital Course: NEUROSURGERY COURSE: Patient was admitted on [**5-30**] for seizure and found to have right brain mass.
neurosurgery was consulted for evalaution for possible biopsy vs resection.
On [**6-1**] he underwent an MRI witha dn without contrast after many failed attempts and it was determine that the patient woul go to the OR for resection of the right frontal lesion on [**6-3**].
His Post op check was stable and his CT showed no signs of complications.
BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname 13959**] is a 59M with history of prostate CA, who presented from OSH with seizures, new brain mass.
Pt is now s/p partial right frontal lobectomy, with pathology suspicious for glioblastoma.
The patient had a partial frontal lobectomy to resect the lesion.
Prelim frozen pathology c/w malignant glioma, final pathology consistent with glioblastoma.
The patient was monitored s/p surgery, without complication.
No calcium/vit d or insulin was prescribed as dexamethasone will most likely be further weaned in future.
# Impulsivity, bahavioral issues: Patient with impulsivity, aggressive and atypical behavior on admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1. follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67139**] in [**Hospital **] clinic (assess valproic acid level at that time, address dexamethasone at that appointment, wound assessment at that meeting)  Medications on Admission: 1.
)(s)* Refills:*0* 9. diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.
Hold for loose stools.
hold for loose stools.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation: hold for loose stools .
)(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Brain Lesion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
It was found that you had a tumor in the right frontal lobe of your brain, which was resected by our neurosurgeons.
You should continue taking all of your medications as you had prior to your hospitalization, EXCEPT:  STOP atenolol/chlorthalidone STOP aspirin START atenolol 50mg per day START valproic acid 250mg twice per day START dexamethasone 4mg every morning START acetaminophen 325mg, take 2 tablets every 6 hours as needed for pain START omeprazole 20mg once per day START diphenydramine 25mg by mouth every six hours as needed for itching START oxycodone 5mg, one tablet every 4-6 hours as needed for pain.
START colace, senna and bisacodyl as needed for constipation.
Hold for loose stools.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.

Any confusion or change in mental status.
