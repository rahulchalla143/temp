At the OSH she was very agitated and combative, she was sedated and intubated to complete imaging studies and for airway protection.
A CT head at the OSH was negative, she had a fever to 101, found to be hypokalemic, hypomag and was given vanc/cefepime and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation.

There is likely some gas within a mediastinal vein just posterior to the sternum likely related to injection with the heart and great vessels appearing otherwise unremarkable with mild atherosclerotic calcifications involving the aortic arch and aortic root.
No large pleural or pericardial effusions are present.
Some scattered mediastinal nodes are identified, the largest 7 mm in short axis within the lower right paratracheal chain.
There are biapical bullae with no other concerning opacities and nodules within the lungs.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver with no focal concerning hepatic lesions identified.
Moderate amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted and periportal fluid and the gallbladder is moderately distended.
The spleen, adrenal glands, and right kidney appear unremarkable.
There is suggestion of pancreatic divisum, but normal szie to the pancreatic duct.
Small hypoattenuating lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney is noted, likely a benign cyst, but too small to definitely characterize.
Multiple short segment jejunojejunal intussusceptions are noted within the left upper quadrant with no findings of bowel obstruction or enhancing lead points seen.
Mild induration is noted within the mesentery, likely related to edema and free fluid.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes or free air.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: Large bowel and appendix as well as the uterus and adnexae appearing unremarkable.
A mild amount of free fluid is noted within the cul-de-sac.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph nodes are present.
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are seen.
A healed left sixth rib fracture is noted.
No etiology for fever identified.
Fatty deposition in the liver.
Pericholecystic fluid, gallbladder wall edema and intra-abdominal fluid suggestive of underlying aggressive fluid resuscitation/third spacing.
Small short segment jejunojejunal intussusceptions without obvious lead point.
These are often seen in the adult population transiently and likely of no significance, in this case possibly related to third-spacing.
No findings of bowel obstruction.
Possible pancreatic divisum without pancreatic abnormalities.
[**2108-7-13**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to attenuate, slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm.
This finding is consistent with a severe encephalopathy.
No areas of focal slowing, epileptiform features or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, distal inferior wall, and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LAD distribution).
Takotsumbo cardiomyopathy would also be included in the differential.
[**2108-7-13**] abd u/s FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely echogenic consistent with fatty  infiltration.
No focal liver lesion is identified.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen.
There is gallbladder wall thickening, which is likely due to the patient's low albumin state.
No ascites is seen in the lower quadrants.
Gallbladder wall edema is seen likely due to low albumin state.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
[**7-21**] PCXR:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
At discharge: WBC: 8.8 H/H: 11.5/36.2 PLT: 816 ESR: 51   Brief Hospital Course: #) Hypotension/Shock: Presented with fever as well as abnormal cardiac enzymes and EKG consistent with [**Month/Day (4) **], as well as history of heave ETOH use.
It was felt hypotension likely both septic and cardiogenic.
U/A at OSH, and meningitis considered given altered mental status.
However, unable to pursue an LP at this time due to heparin gtt for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] empirically covered for meningitis with vanc, ceftriaxone, meropenem, and acyclovir, eventually discontinued and narrowed to Levofloxacin given PCN allergy for total 10 day course to treat HCAP given sputum positive for S. pneumo.
#) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: EKG's have been evolving throughout her course, initial EKG at OSH showed sinus tach at 124bpm, with ST depressions in V2-V4, II, III, and she had negative cardiac enzymes at that time.
In our ER initial EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3, and initial Troponin=0.46.
Her EKG again evolved to have STE in V2-V3 with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in II, III, aVF as well.
CE's peaked on HD 2 and ECHO showed hypokinesis in LAD distribution though some apical ballooning so takasubo also a concern.
Given sepsis and trend down in enzymes, cardiac cath recs were to determine the need for catheterization after pt was extubated.
Cards also requested a stress echo on [**7-20**].
No episodes of CP or SOB.
Telemetry on floor showed no ischemic events.
#) AMS: Unclear if infectious, an ingestion that was never found in bloodwork, especially in the setting of an anion gap with a normal lactate or due to alcohol or other drug withdrawl.
EEG done and showed generalized slowing, no seizure.
Mental status improved post extubation and discontinuation of sedation and pain medication.
Pt with occasional delirium.
Likely had benzo withdrawal with low grade temps and tachycardia to 100s on days prior to discharge.
#) Respiratory Distress: Initially intubated due to agitation and airway protection.
She had no evidence of pneumonia, although aspiration in the setting of AMS was considered.
Sputum culture grew strep pneumonia and given her penicillin allergy was given IV levofloxacin (not absorbing PO well), then transitioned to PO for total 10 day course.
Repeat CXR on [**7-22**] showed LLL PNA, but afebrile and decreasing leukocytosis.
#) Electrolyte Abnormalities: patient profoundly hypocalcemic, hypokalemic, hypomag and hypophos on admission, likely due to poor nutrition Trended lytes [**Hospital1 **] and aggressively replete lytes via sliding scales.
#)Social Issues: [**Name (NI) **] boyfriend initially HCP, but this was changed to her mother.
Sepsis 2.
Altered Mental Status/Delirium 3.
Myocardial Infarction   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with altered mental status.
You were also given antibiotics for a likely blood infection and pneumonia.
You had evidence of a heart attack but you were not a candidate for catheterization.
