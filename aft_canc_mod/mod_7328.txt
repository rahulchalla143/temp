Pt reports coughing large quantity of blood on to hands and soaked one towl at 3pm yesterday.
He did have hemoptysis with his malignancy presentation early this year but not this degree.
ROS: + hunger, - abd pain, -n/v/d, - le edema, -ST. Pt notes ongoing mild cough mainly at night in the past week.
As he had poor access, a right SC line was placed at OSH.
CXR [**2110-1-24**]: Chest, a single AP upright view at 11:30 p.m. is interpreted without prior films available for comparison.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The lungs are clear with linear atelectasis in left lung base.
No pleural effusion is seen, however the right costophrenic sulcus is not entirely included on the film.
CT Chest [**2110-1-25**], post-bronch: FINDINGS:  There is extensive central adenopathy, most pronounced at the left hilus and widespread in the mediastinum.
The left lower lobe bronchus is occluded by the hilar mass at the level of the superior segment producing severe volume loss in the lower lobe and heterogeneous consolidation distally, either atelectasis or postobstruction pneumonia.
Adenopathy extends centrally posterior to the left main bronchus to a 31x16 mm subcarinal mass.
Enlarged lymph nodes are present throughout the right and left upper and lower paratracheal stations including a 15-mm wide node posterior to and inseparable from the right subclavian artery, image 2:9. .
Severe narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein and milder generalized narrowing of the superior vena cava are not due to mass and probably represent strictures from long-term catheterization.
Small pericardial effusion is present with no indication of tamponade.
Study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note the absence of adrenal mass or obvious hepatic metastasis.
There are no lung nodules, consolidation or interstitial abnormality except for subpleural findings in the right lung base probably due to dependent atelectasis.
There is heavy calcification in the aortic valve which could be hemodynamically significant.
Obstructing left hilar mass producing severe left lower lobe atelectasis and/or obstructive pneumonia.
Extensive bilateral mediastinal adenopathy and small pericardial effusion suggest widely metastatic carcinoma.
Possible calcific aortic stenosis.
No evidence of opportunistic infection.
There there found an extensive submucosal irregularity in LLL bronchus c/w SCLC recurrence.
A CT of the Chest was obtained to eval for SCLC recurrence, and prelim radiology read showed LLL consolidation and that LLL bronchus was not patent, along with L paratracheal and hilar [**Doctor First Name **] (final Radiology read pending at time of transfer).
They recommended urgent radiation of LLL lesion to prevent further hemoptysis.
