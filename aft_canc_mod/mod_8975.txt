malignant hypotermia  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, Emesis, Vertigo, Syncope, Imbalance with leaning to the L  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 69  year-old right handed man with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM type 2, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,  who presents with progressively worsening nausea and "imbalance" throughout the day, followed by a syncopal/apenic event, with left sided weakness.
This did not improve during the afternoon, and he developped nausea then vomiting.
When his symptoms got worse and he was unable to sit up anymore and was leaning towards the left, he was taken to [**Hospital1 2436**] emergency room where he was still awake and responsive, but at 7:30 pm a few minutes after his arrival, he collapsed on the chair, was unresponsive and stopped breathing.
A torso CT was done with contrast after he was seen clutching his chest, in order to rule out a dissection and it was negative.
On neuro ROS, throughout the day the pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, , tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denied focal weakness.

[**2163-3-6**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
No previous tracing available for comparison .
Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary Process.
No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage or evidence of large vascular territorial infarction.
Focal encephalomalacia in left periatrial white matter, with dystrophic calcification, which may relate to previous hemorrhage.
Relatively mild non-calcific atherosclerotic disease involving the aortic arch and great vessel origins, with no significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis involving cervical vessels or the intracranial anterior and posterior circulation.
Extensive dependent and subsegmental atelectasis involving the lung apices, incompletely imaged.
Abnormal appearance to the thyroid gland, particularly its right lobe with at least two discrete nodules.
No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no evidence of an acute ischemic event.
Chronic blood products with gliosis in the left periatrial region with no evidence of hemorrhage elsewhere.
This may represent prior hemorrhage related to underlying cavernous malformation or other vascular anomaly or, alternatively, primary hemorrhage related to underlying hypertension, though a somewhat unusual location, or to cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Moderate global atrophy.
However, in theright lung base, triangular opacity with subtle air bronchograms is visualized.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary edema.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Area of atelectasis at the right lung base.
No evidence of recent pneumonia.
No pleural effusions, both the on frontal and the lateral radiograph.
Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, solid masses, or stones in either kidney.
No perinephric collections are seen.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis, calculi, or evidence of renal abscess.
LABS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: [**2163-3-13**] 06:20AM BLOOD WBC-5.8 RBC-4.57* Hgb-13.1* Hct-40.0 MCV-88 MCH-28.8 MCHC-32.8 RDW-12.7 Plt Ct-224 [**2163-3-13**] 06:20AM BLOOD Glucose-144* UreaN-16 Creat-0.9 Na-134 K-4.2 Cl-98 HCO3-26 AnGap-14  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old right handed man with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM type 2, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, who presented with progressively worsening nausea and "imbalance" throughout the day, followed by an apneic event for which he was intubated at an outside facility.
#Vertigo: Patient initially arrived intubated/sedated from OSH, after it was reported that patient had a syncope in the ED at the outside facility.
Patient on his imaging (see full reports above) did not have evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage with incidental finding of previous left periatrial hemorrhage, possibly secondary to cavernous malformation.
Patient continued to report dizziness especially on positional change.
Possible causes in this setting with lack of hearing loss and tinnitus would include BPPV or vestibular neuronitis.
Patient had his stroke risk factors evaluated with LDL 64 and HbA1c 6.3%.
#Urinary Tract Infection with Bacteremia: Patient complained of dysuria and had a Urine Cx with pan sensitive Klebsiella Pneumonia.
He did not have a resolution of his fevers and was found to have 1 blood culuture positive with Klebsiella Pneumonia.
A renal U/S was performed (see full report above) and did not show any abscess or hydronephrosis.
He was afebrile >24 hours and was switched to oral ciprofloxacin which he will complete as an outpatient.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Neurology 2) Follow-up with PCP 3) Discuss incidental finding of thyroid nodule with PCP  Medications on Admission: Med Rec with Pharmacy: Simvastatin 40mg daily Lisinopril 20mg daily Metformn 250mg [**Hospital1 **] Aspirin 81 mg daily Vitamin D [**2150**] mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. ciprofloxacin 750 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every twelve (12) hours: Last day is [**3-23**].
Outpatient Physical Therapy Patient has a diagnosis of Vertigo (undetermined source).
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Vertigo, Urinary Tract Infection with Bacteremia Secondary Diagnosis: Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, Hypertension, Hyperlipidmia, Hashimoto's Thyroidits  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted initlally form the outside hospital after having a syncopal episode and being intubated and sedated.
In addition, you had a urinary tract infection and a bacteria in your blood.
On your imaging scans we identified an old bleed on the left side of the brain, this is concerning for an underlying abnormality in the blood vessels in the brain.
Also, there was an incidental finding on one your scans.
There was an abnormal appearnce in the thyroid gland with two nodules identified.
