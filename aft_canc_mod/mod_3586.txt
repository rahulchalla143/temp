Over last 3 days, she reports decreased eating/drinking and feeling "funny".
C/O increasing back pain and bruising (abd bruising d/t injections).
At [**Location (un) 620**], her U/A was positive for infection.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for transfusion and bone marrow biopsy to R/O progression to AML.
Anemia secondary to myelodysplasia 3.
Hypertension - on 480mg Verapamil qd.
5. s/p hysterectomy 6. s/p cholecystectomy 7. glaucoma 8. lentigo melanoma on right face - [**9-/2103**] with wide excision.
PAN - Polyarteritis Nodosa.
Family History: One son and brother has hemochromatosis, a sibling died of leukemia at age 30.
Physical Exam: T: 99.4  P: 76  BP:  112/60  RR: 22  96% on 2L NC (90% on RA) Gen: alert and oriented, pleasant woman sitting upright in bed, conversant, breathing comfortably HEENT: NC/AT, pupils surgical, anicteric, MMM, OP clear CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: No wheezing.
O/w CTA bilaterally.
U/A: 50-100 WBC, Many bacteria BCx x 4: 1 of 4 bottles grew coag neg staph resistant to erythromycin and pcn.
No evidence of intra or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Splenomegaly as above with increased heterogeneity and possible focal splenic lesions.
Small left pleural effusion and associated atelectatic changes.
Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known lastname 50155**] was initially admitted to the BMT unit but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with progressive hypoxia on the floor on [**9-8**].
Because she was increasingly uncomfortable with the BiPAP mask, she was changed back to a NRB for awhile, and was eventually placed on nasal CPAP.
Overnight on [**9-8**], she began having increasing hemoptysis, first having blood-tinged sputum and then coughing up frank blood.
She also developed worsening diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR.
The bronch revealed increasingly bloody fluid with successive lavage, so it was felt she may have DAH (vs a fungal or bacterial pna).
On [**9-10**], she developed a pneumothorax on the R side that was moderate sized (R IJ TLC was placed on evening of [**9-8**] with 2 subsequent CXRs not demonstrating a ptx, had bronch [**9-9**], then had ptx on CXR [**9-10**], so unclear etiology.)
She had another episode of bleeding and underwent repeat bronchoscopy [**2107-9-14**].
She has persistent patchy alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on CXR, esp in her LLL.
The etiology of her respiratory failure was never fully confirmed.
Her [**9-9**] bronch grew out a spore called sporobolomyces salmonicolor, which both the ID fellow and the Microbiology lab felt was a contaminant (as it didn't grow out until [**9-23**]).
She definitely had at least a superimposed component of diastolic failure, and she was diuresed aggressively while on the floor, approximately 1-2 liters per day.
In terms of the etiology of her disease, there was also a question of vasculitis (as she has a hx of polyarteritis nodosum which was reportedly treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].)
She initially did not respond to any of these measures, and the dilt gtt was maxed out at 20 mg/hr.
Later on in the ICU, she developed what was originally felt to be atrial flutter and was evaluated by Cardiology.
They felt she had a combination of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation ,and recommended control with a dilt gtt as needed, and po verapamil.
ID:  Given her fxnal neutropenia, she was begun on empiric antibiotics when she originally developed diffuse opacities on CXR.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] rest of her bronch studies were negative for organisms other than the spore mentioned above.
Her antibiotics were all eventually stopped and she remained afebrile for a while.
She also developed a sacral decubitus ulcer while in the ICU, which was evaluated by the Wound Care nurses and dressed per their recommendations.
She had a negative urine culture and CXR showed a possible worsening of her LLL infiltrate.
She expressly stated that she did not want to take any antibiotics, oral or intravenous.
She did have evidence of hemolysis, with a low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, elevated indirect bilirubin, and a reticulocyte count of 6%.
Because of her large transfusion requirements and possible hemolysis, a super-Coombs and an anti-platelet antibody test were sent, and were pending at time of discharge.
On examination of her bone marrow biopsy, the attending heme pathologist felt that it was likely her cells were so dysplastic they did not survive long in the periphery.
Liver:  There was a question of whether the patient had hemochromatosis, whether iatrogenic or otherwise.
(Has son and brother with this disease.)
You do not need to resume taking epogen, neupogen, or danazol.
She does not wish to have any antibiotics, and wishes only to have transfusions as needed.
