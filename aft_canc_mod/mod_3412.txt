Admission Date:  [**2143-3-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-5-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-7-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea on Exertion, Fatigue, Low grade fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R-CVL by IR Pericardiocentesis Bone marrow biopsies x4 R neck biopsy L PICC line placement diagnostic thorocentesis by IP bronchoscopy x2   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 52 year old man with no major medical problems who presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
He developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, which prompted an admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital, at which time his hematocrit was noted to be 16.
The day prior to admission at [**Hospital1 18**], he complained of worsened dyspnea and band-like chest pain across his chest, at which time his wife insisted that he come to [**Hospital1 18**].
He denies recent weight loss, but has noticed a low-grade temperature over the past week, along with night sweats, chills, and diffuse abdominal pain (no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
He has had a headache which responds to ibuprofen.
During his hospitalization at [**Hospital **] Hospital, he developed a rash after receiving a blood transfusion.
Past Medical History: s/p multiple back surgeries, including cervical spinal fusion s/p basal cell carcinoma removal Nephrolithiasis Hypercholesterolemia Had cardiac cath in [**2134**] (per report, was "clean", after failing multiple thallium stress tests) Chronic numbness and neuropathic pain of left upper extremity/chest  Social History: Lives in [**Location 14840**] with his wife.
Sexually active with one partner, wife, no extramarital sexual exposures.
No previous STD's.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.9, BP 122/72, HR 67, RR 18, Sat 94% on 2L (documented, but when seen he was off oxygen) Gen: Pale appearing, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, ?petechiae on uvula Neck: Supple, no thyromegaly Nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular or subclavicular lympahdenopathy appreciated; shottly inguinal lymphadenopathy L>R Heart: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normal bowel sounds; no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated Back: No spinal tenderness, no costovertebral angle tenderness GU: Painless chancre on left side of penis, between shaft and head of penis, draining purulent material Ext: No clubbing/cyanosis/edema Neuro: A&O x 3   Pertinent Results: .
Linear atelectasis is seen at the left lung base.
Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle is also seen.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Linear atelectasis left lung base and probable tiny left pleural effusion.
Minimally increased streaky density at the left base appears more confluent than on the earlier study.
IMPRESSION: Minimally increased density at the left base which may represent evolving pneumonia.
The morning after admission the pt triggered for a drop in SaO2 to 83% RA.
On the day of admission to the BMT service ([**2143-4-3**]) he complained of chest pain and had diffuse ST elevations on EKG.
Stat ECHO showed a pericardial effusion although he had no pulsus paradoxus.
They removed over 300mL of fluid and those cultures were negative.
# pericardial effusion/tamponade:  As described above, ECHO showed these results.
This was thought to be related to malignancy and to his initially pericardial effusion.
The pleural effusion persisted throughout admission.
He had a diagnostic thorocentesis by IP which removed 30ml of bloody fluid.
He was intially given 7+3 idarubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy to induce remission with the plan to have a donor allo transplant.
His day 14 bone marrow showed continued hypercellular marrow.
His course was complicated by febrile neutropenia.
He had several reactions to these antifungals including rash (likely with caspofungin and micafungin) and elevated LFTs.
As his counts returned, a repeat bone marrow preliminarily showed a sick marrow but no obvious evidence of leukemia.
He also developed mucositis which required morphine PCA and TPN for malnutrition.
His chest CT and xrays showed patchy infiltrates.
Given the elevated beta glucan and the fact that he defervesced on antifungal therapy, it was thought that he likely had a fungal infection and was discharged on voriconazole.
He seemed to have elevations with posaconazole and ambisome the most.
He had two MRIs of the liver (one while still neutropenic and one after his counts recovered) to rule out obvious fungal infections in the liver; both were negative.
# Chest Pain: He has a history of cervical spinal fusion surgery and chronic left-sided chest pain.
He was intially ruled out for AMI with negative cardiac enzymes and had a negative CTA to rule out PE.
His chest pain persisted throughout admission and moved around his chest, was pleuritic in nature.
This was thought to be related to resolving pleural effusions as well as a suspected fungal pneumonia especially after his counts returned.
# Penile ulceration.
No history of extramarital affairs, no previous STD's.
Differential included primary syphilis, lymphogranulosum venereum (although very rare), skin ulceration secondary to trauma and worsened by neutropenia.
# renal lesion: Incidentally found on chest CT initially and a renal ultrasound also could not characterize it will.
Radiology felt it might appear to be a papillary RCC, but recommended a renal MRI to fully evaluate.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for nausea or insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for constipation.

Your course was complicated by fevers and a suspected fungal infection in your lungs.
You should take 30mg of MS contin twice a day and hydromorphone for breakthrough pain.
As your pain improves, you should decrease the MS contin to 15mg twice a day- please speak to your doctor about tapering this down.
You should notify your physician or go to the emergency room if you have fevers >101, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, bleeding in the gums or blood in the urine or stool or black or tarry stools or any other symptoms which are concerning to you.
