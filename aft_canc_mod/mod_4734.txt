In tha setting he developed chest pain.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he was given one dose of IV lopressor and cardioverted with return of blood pressures and resolution of his chest pain.
Labs were notable for a low glucose of 66, a troponin of .44, and a lacatate of 1.4.
A heparin drip was started for NSTEMI, Cardiology saw the EKGs, which looked like demand ischemia in the setting of rapid AFIB.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Large circumferential pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2177-11-3**], pericardial effusion is probably larger.
Short-term clinical and echocardiographic follow-up for stability of pericardial effusion is recommended.
Successful pericardiocentesis via left sternal approach using echo guidance and micropuncture technique.
Large pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Successful pericardiocentsis with drainage of 260cc of straw colored fluid.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites and a small right pleural effusion as seen on CT. 5.
Interval decrease in fluid component of pericardial effusion with new gas within the pericardial effusion, likely secondary to drain.
The pericardial drain lies along the inferior margin of the right ventricle and traverses the pleural space.
New left upper quadrant and left flank fluid collections, the upper quadrant fluid collection is high in attenuation suggesting hemorrhage and is separate from the larger right upper quadrant hemorrhagic collection which is unchanged.
The left flank collection is most likely ascites.
Slight interval worsening in appearance of acute cholecystitis.
Bilateral moderately large pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, with slight interval enlargement since [**2178-1-4**].
Trans Esophageal Echo [**2178-1-12**] No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or abcess seen.
PENDING RESULTS Pericardial Fluid Cytology Pending Abdominal Fluid Cytology Pending Final Culture data from Blood, Urine, Pericardial Fluid and Abdominal Fluid not all finalized  Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 77 year old gentleman with complex medical issues, including recent hospitalization for medically managed cholecystitis, presenting with chest pain, found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and admitted to Medicine.
Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring after pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, procedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently developed fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with phenylephrine.
These discussions arose in the setting of initiation of permanent dialysis and prolonged and profound physical and emotional decompensation.
The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for management of pain and positioning therapy.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated large circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
Since the patient had been having transient episodes of hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better clarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a pericardiocentesis was performed.
Per report, 260 cc of yellow serous fluid was removed.
Two hours post-procedure the patient became hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then requiring Neo for pressure support.
He was pan-cultured and started on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and metronidazole.
He then became febrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely septic shock.
Studies were consistent with an exudative effusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
A TEE was negative for evidence of valvular vegetations.
Repeat imaging showed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was removed.
# HYPOTENSION: The patient was noted to be hypotensive on admission, thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO intake.
He also had a recent history of transient hypotension during hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine.
Echocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion (details above).
Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated with fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed septic shock.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-Stim test was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor intravascular osmotic pressure.
Given his history of recent medically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid collections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential sources of infection.
Surgery was consulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), and IR performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid collection, a hematoma.
# SUSPECTED CHOLECYSTITIS: The patient had a recent history of medically-managed cholecystitis.
CT torso demonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Surgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low suspicion on physical exam.
HIDA scan was positive and a percutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was complicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with acute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma.
# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on T/Th/Sat.
HD initially was on hold given new pressor requirement and stable electrolytes.
Culture of the catheter tip revealed no growth.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: Present on admission.
The patient has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] S2 score of 3; however, given his history of intraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for anticoagulation.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Presented with CP in setting of AF with RVR, found to have ST changes and elevated troponin consistent with demand ischemia.
Enzymes were cycled and the patient ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction.
# ANEMIA: No evidence of acute bleeding.
Likely secondary to chronic inflammation.
# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Medical Management: Management of pain and optimization of positional comfort.

Discharge Instructions: You were initially admitted to the hospital after experiencing several episodes of low blood pressure.
During your hospitalization you were noted to have a large fluid collection around your heart which was drained and thought to be infectious.
You were treated in the intensive care unit due to the large fluid collection and your low blood pressure.
After a discussion with you, your providers and your family you decided you did not want any further medical treatment and wanted to transition care to management of your pain and positional discomfort.
You are being discharged to a facility to help with your pain management.
You also refused dialysis and were able to tell us the consequence of stopping dialysis.
