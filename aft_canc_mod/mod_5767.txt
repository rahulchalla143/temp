Admission Date:  [**2143-3-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-3-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Tetanus / Biaxin / Clindamycin / Zometa / Enoxaparin / hydrochlorothiazide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation Arterial Line placement   History of Present Illness: * Pt intubated and with no accompanying family so below information obtained from ED report and OMR review* 86 yr/o F with Hx of metastatic breast CA (lungs, skull bones), DVT (on Fragmin via study protocol), HTN (on nifedipine) who presented to clinic today for an appointment feeling acutely SOB.
O2 sat found to be 60% on RA when EMS arrived.
Pt found to have bilateral rales, perioral cyanosis, 2+ pittle LE edema, and very poor mental status unable to answer questions or discuss code status.
EKG was reported to have peaked T waves V1-V4 as well as ?
Cards fellow thought T waves rate related and did bedside ECHO with normal EF but hypokinesis in LAD distribution.
This new swelling is apparently different than past DVT swelling and had raised question of cardiac congestive cause in ambulatory setting.

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal septum and apex.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Severe pulmonary edema, scattered subsegmental atelectasis, and moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Given substantial parenchymal abnormality, supervening consolidation or focal lesion cannot be excluded.

# Pulmonary Edema: Patient had severe hypoxia at rest in clinic and only mild improvement to high 70s with NRB.
Presumed cause of hypoxia was flash pulm edema although unclear what baseline lung function is with prior documentation of lung mets.
CT read confirms that lung findings most likely due to severe pulmonary edema.
# CORONARIES: No history of coronary disease.
Only has HTN documented as RF although no recent lipid panels/A1C and last A1C in [**2140**] was mildly elevated at 6.4.
There is evidence of coronary disease on chest CTA.
Bedside ECHO in ER showed some question of hypokinesis in LAD distribution consistent with CAD but EKG without signs of active ischemia and biomarkers negative x 2.
No need for cardiac catheterization as did not appear that presentation due to acute ischemic event.
# PUMP: Preserved LVEF ECHO with some mild regional dysfunction with hypokinesis of distal septum and apex.
CXR showed signs of acute pulm edema likely related to hypertension.
# HTN: BPs in last few months have been documented in 130-140s systolic with diastolics in 60-70s.
Pt had significantly elevated pressures on presentation with Sys BP >200 but came down to 130s with lasix, nitro paste, and intubation/sedation.
She is only on nifedipine at home for BP control and was recently placed on low-dose lasix for LE edema more than BP.
# Breast Ca: Patient has known mets to both skull bones and lungs although documentation of lung mets not noted in our imaging as no chest imaging present.
Head CT showed no evidence of intra-cranial bleed or intra-cranial mets.
# DVT Hx: Hx DVT last year in setting of known malignancy and multiple past ortho proceedures.

Discharge Instructions: Your blood pressure was very high and you developed acute diastolic congestive heart failure with fluid in your lungs.
We gave you diuretics to get rid of the extra fluid and your dose of this diuretic (lasix) may need to be increased by your outpatient doctors if [**Name5 (PTitle) **] continue to retain extra fluid.
Please weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2204**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
