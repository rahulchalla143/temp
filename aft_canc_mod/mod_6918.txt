Admission Date:  [**2118-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-3-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2356**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE  History of Present Illness: 75 yo M w/ COPD, CRI transitioning to HD, mult CVA, ongoing EtOH abuse, esophageal varices presents with 1 day history of CP.
The patient is a poor historian and most of the history was obtained from his wife.
The pain is described as a substernal pressure which radiates to the back.
The pain was not related to activity and did not improve with rest.
He also had N/V, chills but no diaphoresis.
At this point in time the patient is pain free.
His wife claimed the pain was worsened with deep inspiration and he was coughing productive of dark sputum.
Also the patient recently had an AV fistula placed in his L arm for HD on [**2-11**].
He had cellulitis which was tx with oxacillin [**Date range (1) **] and then augmentin since.
Also has a chronic cough.

CXR - RLL infiltrate .
TEE- no dissection .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities, which may represent infection vs. aspiration pneumonia.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is no evidence of dissection, though it is not excluded given that no IV contrast was administered.
Consolidation vs. atelectasis in the right lower lobe posteriorly.
Small pleural effusions bilaterally.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
Small lymph nodes in the axilla and retroperitoneum that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
L4 compression deformity.
Sclerotic lesions within the pelvis as described.
TEE- no evidence of aortic dissection.
Video Swallow- Significantly delayed oral transit and pharyngeal swallow initiation.
Acute cough was effective in clearing the aspirated material.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2.The right atrium is markedly dilated.
3.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include apical distal inferior, basal and mid inferolateral hypokinesis.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is an echogenic density in the right atrium consistent with a pacemaker lead.
Originally admitted w/ pna after being ruled out for MI, neg CTA, hct drop during admission led to colonoscopy w/ polypectomy- one of which was positive for adenoca ([**Location (un) 6553**] B).
During that time pt rec'd lg volume resusciation after which he became increasingly SOB after diuresis held.
1) PNA- patient initially admitted with diagnosis of pneumonia.
Given that patient originally presented with pleuritic chest pain he underwent CTA to rule out PE, which was negative.
During transfer to ICU [**2-2**] resp failure/CHF (see below) the patient was started on steroids for presumed COPD contribution (although no PFTs ever performed by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] previous O2 sat ever recorded in office, CT w/o bullae or hyperinflation).
Pt had no h/o CHF but TTE showed mild systolic dysfxn.
During week 3 of hospitalization the patient developed increasing SOB.
The attending physician had asked that diuresis be stopped as it was felt that the patient had a primary pulmonary process.
BNP returned elevated at 21K, w/ increasing vol  congestion on CXR.
The patient was developing increasing SOB and was transferred to the ICU for emergent HD.
3) Adenocarcinoma of colon- during admission, pt developed ongoing HCT drop w/ guiac positive stools.
The pathology on a polyp removed from the transverse colon revealed adenocarcinoma within several millimeters of the margin.
CEA was elevaed but of unclear significance in the setting of renal failure.
4) CRF- on admission pt was being transitioned to HD and had already had an AVF placed.
However, the fistula was not yet mature and when he developed resp failure it was necessary to place a quintan catheter.
He should be assessed for DM as an outpt and started on oral hypoglycemics, if necessary.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please take your medicatations as directed 2) Please attend your follow up appointments 3) Return to medical care if you develop increased wheezing, sob, fever, bleeding per rectum, or abdominal pain.
