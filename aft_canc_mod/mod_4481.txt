There was a 99% stenosis in a large ramus.
The RCA had a discrere 90% stenosis in the distal vessel just prior to the RPDA which filled via collaterals.
Left ventriculograph revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The LVEF was calculated to be 45% with moderate inferior hypokinesis.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Cath revealed right dominant system with diffusely diseased mid LAD with 90% stenosis, 99% discrete proximal circumflex lesion, and discrete 90% distal RCA stenosis.
Left sided filling pressures were just mildly elevated, and LVEF was calculated to be about 45% with moderate inferior hypokinesis.
No intervention was done; patient was maintained on heparin drip and evaluated by CT surgery, awaited clopidogrel washout for several days.
On [**7-1**], chest and bilateral forearm pain returned with ST depressions in V4-V6, so nitroglycerin drip was restarted and controlled pain.
Intraoperatively, Urology was consulted due to a urethral stricture and difficult foley placement.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
Transplant surgery evaluated the patient for colonic distention.
