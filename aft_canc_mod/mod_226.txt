No pneumothorax has developed.
No new pulmonary or pleural abnormalities are seen.
The amount of remaining pleural effusion in the posterior pleural sinus appears grossly unchanged when comparing the findings on the lateral views.
[**2191-4-9**]: Improved aeration in right lung compared with earlier the same day However, considerable persistent opacity diffusely throughout right lung, which appears to represent a combination of diffuse alveolar opacity and pleural thickening and/or fluid.
[**2191-4-4**]: Improving right upper lung postoperative hematoma Decreased asymmetric right pulmonary edema.
Decreased minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged small left and tiny right pleural effusions [**2191-4-3**]:  The patient is status post right upper lobe resection.
Large homogeneous opacity extending from the right apex to the right hilum appears similar compared to the previous post-operative studies and could reflect a large hematoma.
Linear bibasilar atelectasis is present, left greater than right, with interval worsening on the left compared to the prior study.
Small left pleural effusion is apparently new.
The degree of subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe has improved and right middle lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
[**2191-3-30**]: New right lower lobe opacity is consistent with large right lower lobe atelectases.
Patient has known right middle lobe atelectases.
There is probably a small right pleural effusion.
In the left lung, there is a small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectases.
[**2191-3-26**]:  new right paramediastinal opacity, which is concerning for either mediastinal hematoma or newly developed atelectasis of right middle lobe with questionable torsion.
A severe narrowing, just distal to the origin of the artery supplying the right middle lobe and incomplete visualization of the right middle lobe bronchus are concerning for right middle lobe torsion with active extravasation into a small hematoma in the region.
Atelectasis in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
There is no pericardial effusion.
On [**2191-3-28**] his chest film showed right middle collapse.
He was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy with showed large mucus plug.
On [**2191-3-31**] his CXR showed collapsed right lung he was taken to the operating room for flexible bronchoscopy and removal of small clot in the distal bronchus intermedius.
He transfer to the ICU intubated for positive pressure support.
Series of quotidien fevers and spike to 101.8 [**4-6**] prompted CT chest concerning for infection/necrotic RML.
Bronchoscopy performed [**4-9**] for concern of mucus plugging in RLL.
Cardiac: intermittent atrial fibrillation 100-140's.
He was started on amiodarone infusion converted to sinus rhythm within 24-48 hrs, but continued to have intermittent atrial fibrillation with rates of 140-150's with hypotension requiring low-dose pressors, IV amiodarone & PO 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] transitioned to 200 mg daily [**2191-4-6**] after completing 6 gm load.
No pericardial effusion.
No left atrial dilation.
Amiodarone and diltiazem were titrated in relationship to HR and systolic blood pressure with patient intermittently alternating between afib and sinus rhythm.
Tolerated a regular diet  Renal: Foley required re-insertion for low urine output.
Serum creatinine increased from 0.9, Peak 2.8 in setting of tobramycin, vancomycin, flagyl, zosyn for RML necrotizing PNA s/p resection.
FeNa: 1.1% and FeUrea 42% consistent with ATN likely secondary to aminoglycoside toxicity.
ID: low-grade fevers with mild leukocytosis he was started on Levofloxacin [**2191-4-2**] for possible PNA.
Pan cultured with no growth.
Giving finding of necrotic RML, started on vancomycin, tobramycin and zosyn [**4-9**].
