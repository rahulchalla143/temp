Pt stated that in [**Month (only) 547**], he noted vision changes, as diagnosed with CMV retinitis.
He was started on valganciclovir, with improvement of vision changes, but later had worsening malaise.
Pt attributed his symptoms to the medication and stopped valgancilovir three weeks ago.
Reportedly, pt had undetectable CMV viral load in the blood prior to d/c'ing the medication.
Pt continued to have chill, malaise, night sweats, ~10 lbs weight loss in last month, anorexia, and intermittent diarrhea.
He reportedly had a axillar lymph node biopsy, and was found to have CMV lymphadenitis with no [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells and negative flow cytometry.
In [**Month (only) 958**] [**2132**], a CT abd showed splenomegaly to 14 cm, which in [**2132-8-10**] has increased to 17.5 with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, periaortic lymphadenopathy and a 2.9X3.8 splenic mass.
Lab was notable for WBC 1.8 with 29% neutrophil, mild anemia with HCT 33.4, transaminitis with ALT 211, AST 451, ALP 829, T-bili 6.5, normal coag, and Alb 3.1, hyponatremia to 128, and lactate 2.4.
Because of hypotension and transaminitis, he was transferred to the ICU.

Small right axillary lymph nodes measuring less than a centimeter do not meet criteria for significant adenopathy.
Additional prominent scattered lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinum in the prevascular, pretracheal regions, with the largest in the right paratracheal region measuring 10 mm (3:23).
The lungs are clear, without suspicious pulmonary nodules or masses.
Small pleural calcifications are seen anteriorly in the left lung (3:25).
Small bilateral simple pleural effusions are seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate-to-severe coronary arterial calcifications are noted.
Mild atherosclerotic calcification is seen in the thoracic aorta.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No focal liver lesions are identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Mild gallbladder wall edema in the setting of a decompressed gallbladder likely relates to third spacing.
Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis or renal masses.
A 6.5 cm simple renal cortical cyst is seen in the interpolar region of the left kidney.
Additional smaller renal cysts are seen in both kidneys.
Small scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen, with the largest node in the left paraaortic region measuring 10 mm (3:72).
There is a small amount of perihepatic ascites and fat stranding in the right paracolic gutter.
The abdominal aorta has moderate atherosclerotic calcification, without aneurysmal dilation.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is decompressed with mild bladder wall thickening, which may relate to prior radiation treatment or outlet obstruction.
A small amount of simple ascites is seen within the pelvis.
No significant pelvic adenopathy is seen.
A small fat-containing left inguinal hernia is present.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:  No bone lesions suspicious for infection or malignancy are detected.
Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the facet joints of L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.
Numerous axillary lymphadenopathy (largest in left axilla measuring 3.4 x 2.4cm) and splenomegaly.
These findings are concerning for lymphoproliferative disorder.
Bilateral small simple pleural effusions and a small amount of abdominal ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE  # T Cell Lymphoma / Lymphadenopathy:  Patient has history of axillary adenopathy which had been biopsied in [**2128**], with results consistent with CMV-lymphadenitis, negative for [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 93840**] cells, negative flow cytometry.
Results of the pathology were c/w T cell lymphoma.
Patient developed liver and kidney failure, thought likely to be secondary to infiltrative disease.
Patient was found to have worsening mental status.
CT scan was performed which did not show evidence of bleed or malignancy.
Potential hepatorenal syndrome was considered, but urine sodium > 10 was not consistent with HRS.
Patient was started on Vanc/Cefipime for concern for febrile neutropenia/sepsis.
# Fevers: Differential included sepsis vs. disseminated CMV infection vs. lymphoma.
Patient had a transaminitis with obstructive hyperbilirubinemia but RUQ u/s did not show concern for cholecystis or biliary obstruction.
Patient had history of fevers secondary to CMV, for which he was taking valgancyclovir.
He was cultured and covered for febrile neutropenia in the ED with Vanc and Cefepime because his white count came back at 1.8 with 28% bands.
given his low white count and positive EBV titers.
After diagnosis of T cell lymphoma, these constitutional symptoms were thought to be secondary to his underlying malignancy as opposed to active infection.
# Obstructive jaundice: He had elevated liver enzymes with an elevated direct biliribin, consistent with an obstructive process.
RUQ ultrasound failed to reveal biliary duct dilation or stones.
CT abdomen/pelv with contrast failed to show focal liver disease or intra or extra hepatic biliary dilation.
# CMV retinitis: The patient was placed on valgancylovir initially for concern for CMV reactivation.
Outside records were obtained, which showed that he was diagnosed with CMV retinitis in [**2132-4-10**] after experiencing worsening vision in his left eye.
He was followed by [**Hospital 13128**], who prescribed systemic valgancyclovir with resolution of his ocular symptoms.
His valgancyclovir was halted for a few weeks prior to admission for concern for marrow suppression.
His valgancyclovir was discontinued on D3 of admission after an ophthalmology evaluation revealed no retinitis and his CMV load was negative.
Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Medications: Patient expired [**2132-9-25**]  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: T cell lymphoma  Discharge Condition: Expired in hospital
