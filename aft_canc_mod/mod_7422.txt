Admission Date:  [**2199-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-11-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-4-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Hydrochlorothiazide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**] Chief Complaint: Intracerebral hemorrhage, Headache, change in mental status.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 105462**] is a 77yo LH man with a PMHx significant for metastatic melanoma (mets to liver and lymph nodes), afib on coumadin, placement of a pacemaker and lumbar spinal stenosis who was originally admitted to neurosurg on [**11-12**] and transferred to OMed on [**11-15**].
He is being transferred to the Neuro ICU because of concern for altered mental status this AM.
To briefly recount his history: he had been in his USOH until the day of admission, when he developed a sudden left temporal headache.
He was having difficulty walking and eventually was unable to stand up.
He was found down with decreased movement of his left side next to his bed.
There, a NCHCT showed a right temporal IPH with intraventricular extension.
He was also started on PHT on admission for seizure ppx.
A head CT with contrast on [**11-13**] was concerning for an intracerebral hemorrhage,      On the AM of [**11-15**], he was found to have decreased responsiveness -- he barely responsive to name, would have difficulty opening his eyes and and difficult to arouse.
He also had a fever to 100.4 with perseveration and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.
Metastatic melanoma, diagnosed in [**3-/2199**] (lesion on vertex of head) with mets to LNs of neck and LLL of lung.
Atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker placement in [**2196**].
Lumbar spinal stenosis with resultant severe symm.
peripheral neuropathy -- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic for many years 6.
Remote history of seizure.
His mother died at age [**Age over 90 **] from congestive heart failure.

No right-left confusion.

Given history of melanoma, underlying mass lesion is a possibility and may be evaluated with MRI (not possible given pacer).
Follow-up CT's stable on [**11-15**]/10-->done for altered mental status.
Portable chest films revealed cephalization and edema, resolving during the admission.
No frank consolidation.
EKG's revealed atrial fibrillation with atrial pacing and some periods of AF with RVR earlier in admission.
A Head CT with contrast on [**11-13**] demonstrated a right temporal hamorrhage and was read as having no underlying mass.
On further inspection of the scan it was felt that there was an underlying mass consistent with metastatic melanoma.
Intracerebral Hemorrhage Contributors: Likely cerebral metastases of melanoma (difficult to further evaluate in this context and given MRI could not be performed owing to pacer), coumadin, striking of head (possibly occurred after bleed - unclear).
[**Name2 (NI) **] should remain on Lovenox prophylaxis given lesser risk of more bleeding, but likely hypercoagulable state at present.
This should be revised after Dilantin is stopped and with continued evaluation of mental status.
Given underlying melanoma, dexamethasone was started, with dosing revised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] at NeuroOnc follow-up.
Melanoma Scalp lesion presently not active.
Metastatic disease.
Fluid Overload Patient with significant pulmonary edema on transfer to neurology.
Likely primary reason for increased respiratory rate and hypoxia.
Pneumonia Patient likely aspirated and given overall fragile state, treated.
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Respiration Echo not performed, but may contributors likely low-output cardiac state or due to hemorrhage or even metastases.
Given stability and attribution of increased work of breathing to edema, was not further worked-up.
Atrial Fibrillation Metoprolol continued through the admission with good rate control.
Hypothyroidism Would recommend outpatient TSH check given interaction of levothyroxine with calcium.
Hyperlipidemia Continued atorvastatin at 10 mg.  Hematuria and Urinary Management Trace in context of Lovenox treatment and Foley in place.
