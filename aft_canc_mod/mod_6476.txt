CN I: not tested II,III: unable to cooperate with formal VF testing; pupil 1.5-.1mm bilaterally, unable to visualize fundi due to myosis III,IV,V: EOMI aside from decreased upgaze; no ptosis; R esotropia; No nystagmus V: sensation intact V1-V3 to LT VII: L NLF flattening VIII: decreased hearing to voice bilaterally IX,X: palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline [**Doctor First Name 81**]: SCM/trapezeii 5-/5 bilaterally XII: tongue protrudes midline, mild tongue atrophy  Motor: diffusely decreased bulk throughout; motor impersistence and paratonia; pt does not sustain elevated arms long enough to test pronator drift.
Antigravity in arms and has 5- finger flexion; the R leg is antigravity, but the left is not.
Further testing against resistence of the L leg was deferred given his recent hip fracture  Reflex: No clonus [**Hospital1 **] Tri Bra Pat An Plantar C5 C7 C6 L4 S1 CST L 1---------- tonically up R 1---------- tonically up  -Sensory: responds to pain in all extremities symmetrically  -Coordination: pt does not cooperate with formal testing  -Gait: Deferred  Pertinent Results: [**2119-8-30**] 12:55AM BLOOD WBC-16.0* RBC-3.50* Hgb-10.6* Hct-32.1* MCV-92 MCH-30.4 MCHC-33.1 RDW-14.9 Plt Ct-308 [**2119-8-30**] 12:55AM BLOOD Glucose-85 UreaN-26* Creat-1.2 Na-142 K-4.3 Cl-106 HCO3-15* AnGap-25* [**2119-8-30**] 12:55AM BLOOD ALT-15 AST-16 LD(LDH)-298* AlkPhos-136* TotBili-0.5 [**2119-8-30**] 06:10AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.2 Mg-2.0 Cholest-159 [**2119-8-30**] 06:10AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.5 [**2119-8-30**] 06:10AM BLOOD Triglyc-97 HDL-44 CHOL/HD-3.6 LDLcalc-96 [**2119-8-30**] 06:10AM BLOOD TSH-3.8 [**2119-8-30**] 06:10AM BLOOD Phenyto-5.3* [**2119-8-30**] 09:44AM BLOOD Lactate-1.1  TTE: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old RH man with melanoma and multiple metastasis, an extensive PMH including afib on Coumadin, seizures, and a pacemaker.
He was transferred from an OSH after an episode of altered mental status at the OSH and found to have multiple ICH with no history of trauma.
His brain hemorrhages were attributed to be due to metastatic melanoma.
head CT: No change in the appearance of multiple intraparenchymal hematomas.
The CTA demonstrates narrowing and irregularity of the distal left vertebral artery, the basilar artery, and the right middle cerebral artery, with a pattern that suggests atheromatous disease.
There are no vascular abnormalities associated with the hematomas.
As per his paliative care: 1) If able to swallow, continue his usual cardiac meds (such as b-blocker) to prevent rapid afib.
2) morphine 5-15 mg SL q2h prn pain or dyspnea - would use the concentrated oral solution 20 mg/mL.
This is available on POE 3) Continue for ativan prn 4) haldol 0.5-1 mg SL q2h prn agitation/delirium - He has no signs of agitation currently.
Morphine Sulfate 1 mg IV Q4H:PRN as needed for pain 4.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Port Rehab & Skilled Nursing - [**Location (un) 5028**]  Discharge Diagnosis: melanoma, Afib, HTN, seizure   Discharge Condition: His family has decided to focus on comfort, no resuscitation (DNR/DNI) and their priority now is to facilitate his return to [**Hospital3 **]   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with melanoma, Afib, HTN, seizure who was admitted on [**8-30**] for altered mental status, found to have multiple sites of intracranial hemorrhage (probably due to brain metastasis of melanoma).
