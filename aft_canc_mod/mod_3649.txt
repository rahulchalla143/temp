He presented to [**Hospital 882**] hospital yesterday with mental status changes, BG18 and hyopthermia.
He returned w/hypoglycemia and was thus transferred to BDIMC.

74M w/MMP as above admitted w/hyoglycemia, hypotension, and low-grade fever 13d s/p circumcision.
He has an evident ballantitis which could also be contributing.
1) Hypoglycemia- Thought to be most likely [**1-26**] glyburide in the context of recent illness and polypharmacy.
The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia.
3) Balantitis- Patient was found to have balanitis after recent circumcision approximately 2 weeks prior to this admission.
The wound culture was found to grown Diptheroids (Corynebacterium) and Coag Negative Staph consistent with skin floral.
Additionally, a DFA was negative for HSV.
Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned as a rare side effect of vori, but per ID's assessment of risks vs. benefits, would not stop Voriconazole.
Patient's platelets rose from 60s-80s at baseline to 112, making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia.
5) Pulmunary aspergillosis- The patient was continued on lifelong voriconazole therapy for history of pulmonary aspergillosis.
6) Thrush- Patient was thought to have evidence of oral thrush upon admission to the MICU.
He had no further evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU.
