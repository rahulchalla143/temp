The patient presented for a bronchoscopy for increasing shortness of breath, weight loss and hemoptysis of the last 2 weeks duration.
He states that he has a cough that has been progressing over the last three months.
He developed scant hemoptysis which ranges from a pink color to frank blood over the last 2 weeks.
The patient also endorses brownish sputum over that time.
He also has been having increasing dyspnea and fatigue.
He also endorses a 13 pound weight loss over the last 2 weeks.
He has a history of atrial fibrillation that is hard to control tachycardia.
His oncologic history is significant for lobectomy of right lung and s/p radiation and chemotherapy.
Then, post-procedure he had tachycardia and hypotension with HRs in the 150s despite 2 doses of 5 mg IV lopressor and his home dose of 50 mg PO.
He denied chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath.
He had no current complaints and was more alert than on initial evaluation.
He has had no further episodes of hemoptysis.

Chronic atelectasis of the right upper lobe and distortion of both hila indicate tumor infiltration.
There is no pneumothorax.
New multifocal pneumonia, most severe in the left lower lobe.
The pattern of distribution could also represent aspiration pneumonitis.
Persistent subtotal collapse of RUL and RML, with tumor infiltration causing the persistent bronchial obstruction.
Unchanged marked left hilar lymphadenopathy with mild mass effect on adjacent left atrium.
Bronchial Brushings: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Bronchial Washings: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
FNA, Lymph node station 11L: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
FNA, Lymph node station 7: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
Lung, left lower lobe, transbronchial biopsy: Alveolar tissue with increased intra-alveolar macrophages, fibrin deposition and organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonia (BOOP/COP).
No malignancy identified, multiple levels are examined.
Brief Hospital Course: 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and AAA was admitted to the MICU after AFib with RVR s/p bronchoscopy, which showed recurrence of nonsmall cell lung cancer.
# Nonsmall cell lung cancer: The patient was found to have a recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung which was diagnosed by bronchoscopy.
The patient was notified of his diagnosis by his interventional pulmonologist.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR and low blood pressure after the bronchoscopy.
The decision to continue to treat or not with antibiotics was addressed with his interventional pulmonologist who thought that they should be stopped as there was no evidence of infection during the bronchoscopy.
Pathology, which returned following the patient's discharge, demonstrated features consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonia (BOOP/COP).
# Hemoptysis: The patient was on anticoagulation and has metastatic cancer.
# Hypoxia: The patient became hypoxic with ambulation to the 80s when on room air.
# Diarrhea: The patient noted recent diarrhea.
# PVD: Stable.
No symptoms in the hospital.
# AAA: Stable.
