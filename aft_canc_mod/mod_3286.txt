Admission Date: [**2194-1-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2194-1-25**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  F  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and alcohol use transferred from an outside hospital on [**2194-1-25**] secondary to hyperbilirubinemia, newly diagnosed pancreatic head mass, a CBD occlusion, hepatic abscess with blood cultures positive for E. coli, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] glabrata, Lactobacillus.
The patient was intubated for subsequent ARDS on [**2194-2-1**] and subsequently had an ERCP with bronchial brushings revealing atypical cells consistent with adenocarcinoma, CA99 of 36,000.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-1-26**] and taken to the ICU on [**2193-2-1**] after hypoxic respiratory failure.
Over the past eight days, the patient's T bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase have slowly risen which was thought secondary to worsening biliary obstruction.
The patient subsequently developed increased diarrhea.
Clostridium difficile was negative times three, thought secondary to pancreatic insufficiency.
Today, the covering Medicine Team was called at bedside secondary to decreased mental status and hypotension with blood pressure down to 70/40, tachycardia 158.
The patient had a fingerstick blood glucose at that time of 10.
The patient was given 2 amps of D50 with blood glucose returning to about 170 and resolution of mental status change.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 158, rate-related ST depressions in the lateral walls, CKs and troponins were negative.
The chest x-ray revealed mild volume overload.
The patient was transferred to the ICU given the hypotension requiring pressors, mental status change, and profound hypoglycemia most likely secondary to hepatic failure due to hepatic abscesses.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer per bronchial brushings, CA99, and imaging studies.
Chronic pancreatitis.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Soft, tender in epigastrium, an epigastric mass is palpable.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 158, rate-related ST depressions in V4-V6.
Chest x-ray revealed mild volume overload.
No pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Fenard ICU for severe sepsis with profound bandemia, profound hypoglycemia, and acidosis.
The cause of the patient's severe sepsis was most assuredly her numerous hepatic abscesses and the metastatic cancer that she had most likely involving biliary obstruction.
CT of the abdomen revealed unchanged nodules throughout the liver which were thought once again to be secondary to hepatic abscesses.
The GI fellow and attending felt that emergent ERCP would not change the patient's prognosis and it was held off.
Per the ICU attending, Zygress was held off secondary to high INR and what appeared to be fulminant liver failure.
As far as the patient's profound hypoglycemia, it was most likely due to liver failure secondary to her metastatic pancreatic disease as well as her hepatic abscesses.
The patient was placed on an insulin drip with tight glucose control and despite a D10 drip, the patient's blood sugar continued to dip down as low as the 20s with episodic mental status change.
Further cause of the patient's profound hypoglycemia was thought secondary to severe sepsis and this was being treated.
As far as the patient's acidosis, the patient was given bicarbonate ampules throughout the night and was subsequently started on a bicarbonate drip.
The patient subsequently went into acute renal failure.
There was thought to be a postobstructive component to the renal failure but most likely the patient was in ATN secondary to profound hypotension.
The patient underwent an ERCP the next morning which revealed ischemic gut.
