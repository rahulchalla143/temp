Pt was in her USOH until [**First Name3 (LF) 2974**] when had acute onset low back pain.
Per husband, pt was being transferred from bed to commode, she then let herself down onto the commode when suddenly felt acute onset of lower back pain.
Throughout the course of the day her back pain improved with percocet and warm compresses.
She did not pass out or lose consciousness.
She denied any urinary or stool incontinence, no numbness or loss of sensation of her legs.
BP responded to fluid which increased to 100/palp.
No recent travelling or sick contacts-recently hospitalized [**6-/2122**] for mastoiditis.
No dysuria, no abdominal pain/N/V/Diarrhea.
No HA, Confusion or word finding difficulties.
NSTEMI [**2122**] s/p PCI [**4-/2122**] noted below.
Subacute stent thrombosis of the LCX bare metal stent.
Hypotension requiring pressors consistent with hypovolemic and vasodilatory shock.
Possible anaphylactoid reaction to ReoPro.
Blood loss anemia status post 5 units of PRBC.
Chronic left upper extremity brachiocephalic DVT #.
ankle fracture in left ankle s/p surgical repair [**8-17**] #.
No illicits .
Physical Exam: VS: 97.6 BP 102/74 HR 74 RR 17 100%RA GEN: lying in bed, NAD, breathing comfortably, speaking in full sentences HEENT: + Cushingoid/moon facies, PERRL, no scleral icterus, mm dry, no lesions CV: Reg, nl S1,S2, No M/R/G, unable to assess JVD due to body habitus Pulm: CTA bilaterally, no wheezing or stridor Abd: soft, ND/NT +BS, hyperpigmentation at lovenox injection sites with inderation noted Ext: bilateral 2+ LE edema, LE's warm, LEU with digits x4 amputated.
IMAGING: MRI LUMBAR SPINE [**2122-8-3**]: Moderate compression fracture of the T11 vertebral body and possibly also a minimal fracture of the L4 vertebral body.
Perhaps these fractures relate to osteoporosis secondary to steroid administration, if this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was administered on a chronic basis .
Diffuse altered signal intensity of the bone marrow in the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, indicating fatty replacement.
No significant change in the wedge compression fracture noted at T12 level (not T11 as the patient has transitional vertebra at L5-S1).
Significant change in the small fragment retropulsed with moderate indentation on the ventral thecal sac.
No new areas of compression fracture in the thoracic spine.
ECHO [**2122-8-3**]: - Mild Regional [**Last Name (LF) 47663**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 45-55% - 1+ MR, No AR - No pericardial effusion .
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2122-8-19**] No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 40 yo F with AML s/p related allogenic bone marrow transplant in [**10-14**] with GVHD who presented for acute back pain and was found to have T11 compression fracture on MRI.
She was admitted to the medical ICU for hypotension and transferred 2 days later to [**Date Range 3242**] service after stabilization.
Back pain: MRI showed compression fracture of the T11 vertebral body and possibly also a minimal fracture of the L4 vertebral body, likely due to osteoporosis from chronic steroids use.
There was no evidence of an infectious process or spinal canal compromise.
There were no neurologic symptoms to suggest cord involvement and MRI showed no cord compression; neurology was consulted and agreed.
Orthopedics was consulted, and recommended TLSO brace and possible vertebroplasty if pain persists.
She was fitted for TLSO brace to support her back and minimize risk of cord transection.
A repeat MRI for new onsent upper back pain (see below) showed a change of a small fragment retropulsed with moderate indentation on the ventral thecal sac.
Orthopedics was reconsulted and, since there were no neurological symptoms, it was recommended that she wear the TLSO brace when HOB >45 degrees and for all transfers.
Home antihypertensive medications were held because of low BP readings.
She was initially ruled out for a myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes x3 and EKG.
Pt did not have any indication of sepsis as she was afebrile without leukocytosis.
Later, BP readings were found not to correlate between left arm (PICC line inserted in right arm) and the thighs, likely because of severe vascular disease.
Unstable angina with acute inferior posterior MI in a previously infarcted territory:  On [**2122-8-5**], the patient developed substernal chest pressure, and an EKG was performed that showed a change from admission, with inferoseptal depressed and downward sloping ST segments.
The pain subsided with SL NTG, and the patient remained without clinical evidence of hypotension with the NTG.
Pt continued to have episodes of chest pain, and troponin peaked to 0.27.
UTI:  Pt had a U/A suspicious for UTI and because of her hypotension and concern for sepsis was initially started on Ceftriaxone.
MSK pain in upper back and bilateral scapula:  On [**8-19**], left UE swelling was noted.
As she was being transferred for an ultrasound study (negative for DVT), she developed acute back and scapular pain.
Repeat MRI did not show a new fracture and no evidence for aortic dissection was noted on this nonideal study.
Pain was relieved with muscle relaxants and narcotics and continued to improve.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Tizanidine 4 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO three times a day as needed for muscle cramps.
Miralax 17 g (100%) Powder in Packet Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Hydromorphone 4 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain (for chest pain only if not relieved by SL NTG).
