He is s/p multiple recent admissions, most recently from [**3-7**] - [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload from a missed HD session.
He has had continued cough occasiionally productive of a rusty-colored sputum associated with some dyspnea on exertion, though he is not able to quantify the amount of exertion required.
He denies rest dyspnea, and denies orthopnea or PND.
In ED, he denied any symptoms including CP, SOB, LH, or fatigue.
A laboratory evaluation revealed a Hb of 7.9 and Hct 27.0 (Hct prior to discharge appears 26-28, though last Hct 35.4 but no evidence of transfusion).
CXR showed a new left basilar opacity, thought to represent atelectasis vs infection.
Currently, his only complaint is his chronic neck pain, which is less well controlled this morning because he may have missed a dose of his pain medication.
Developed neck pain and found to have C2 pathological fracture, [**11-22**] cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Likely non-small cell lung carcinoma, with RML mass and metastasis to the cervical and sacral spine.
The only manifestation of his disease currently is cervical neck pain, s/p pathologic fracture and posterior cervical arthrodesis C1-C3 and palliative XRT.

Multifocal areas of opacity scattered throughout both lungs are largely similar to previous exam, and consistent with metastatic lung cancer.
Dominant right hilar mass is similar in appearance.
There is new streaky opacity at the left lung base, with associated volume loss, which may represent atelectasis, although underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Radiopaque density projecting over the upper thoracic spine is unchanged in appearance, maybe related to prior vertebroplasty.
New left basilar streaky airspace opacity and volume loss, may represent atelectasis, although this is concerning for underlying infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
Unchanged appearance of multifocal opacities consistent with metastatic lung cancer, and dominant right hilar mass.

FINDINGS: There has been interval development of extensive tumor infiltration of the sacrum since the prior exam of [**Month (only) 1096**] [**2196**].
Previously, the patient had a capacious thecal sac extending into the sacrum.
Now there is extensive tumor infiltration throughout the sacrum, which obliterates the spinal canal at L5-S1 and presumably infiltrates the nerve roots below this level.
There is a defect within the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] posteriorly with T1 hypointense scar tissue extending to the skin consistent with the patient's prior graft donor site.
The visualized portion of the lumbar spine is unremarkable with no abnormal signal intensity within the vertebral bodies, conus, or cauda equina.
There is mild edema in the inferior endplate of L5 and disc desiccation at L5- S1, likely degenerative.
The L5-S1 disc bulges into the sac causing mild indentation of the thecal sac ventrally.
IMPRESSION: Extensive tumor infiltration of the sacrum with obliteration of the thecal sac (and presumably the nerve roots) below the L5-S1 level.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yo M with metastatic poorly differentiated CA, likely NSLCA, CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, here with urinary retention/UTI and compression of sacral nerve roots [**1-6**] metastatic dz.
# Cauda equina syndrome.
of urinary retention with 1.2L upon straight cath.
Further neurologic exam revealed LE weakness, decreased sensation and absent sphincter tone.
Stat MRI showed sacral involvment of metastasis and compression of sacral roots.
Unfortunately, his leg weakness has persisted despite maximal therapy.
# Anemia - Hct 27.0 in ED here, not clearly different from his baseline during his recent admission.
epo @ HD - guiac neg, no signs of blood loss.
# Onc - poorly differentiated histology, likely NSCLC; with mets to cervical and sacral spine.
With neck pain s/p c1-c3 arthrodesis.
No chemo currently offered from onc team, but are aware.
- continue oxycodone/oxycontin for pain control - neck brace as previously ordered - for pain relief.
# CAD - with prior stenting, and evidence of prior MI by ECG - continue [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Last Name (STitle) **], B-blocker, ACE-I, statin, and nitrate .
# Chronic systolic congestive heart failure - depressed EF of 25-30% in [**2198-1-5**].
The patient developed acute pain and became hypertensive and had flash pulmonary edema necessitating transfer to the MICU, where he received emergent hemodialysis and avoided intubation.
# HTN - currently well-controlled - continue B-blocker, ACE-I, and nitrate .
# ESRD - last HD on [**3-28**] - renal diet - nephrocaps - hemodialysis per routine .
