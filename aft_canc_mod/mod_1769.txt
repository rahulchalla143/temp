Admission Date:  [**2145-6-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-9-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Brain mass compressing brain stem  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Diagnostic cerebral angiogram with embolization -Left sided craniotomy with placement of EVD catheter -Left suboccipital craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: 32 year old woman with past medical history significant for nonhodgkins lymphoma and basal cell carcinoma who presents after being referred by her PCP after an MRI scan showed a brain lesion.
She describes that about 3 years ago she started to experience dizziness with postural changes which was felt to be related to vertigo.
More recently over the past few months she had episodes of choking, increasing dizziness, vertiginous symptoms, and abnormal echoing in her left ear.
She had been followed by her PCP for these symptoms and after her last visit on [**4-23**] it was felt that an MRI to assess for any intracranial pathology that was contributing to her symptoms was warranted.
She had her MRI which showed a dural based lesion compressing the pons.
She complains only of dizziness, she denies nausea, vomiting, headache, blurry vision, difficulty with bowel or bladder function.
Past Medical History: NonHodgkins lymphoma diagnosed at birth, stomach tumor diagnosed at age 2.5years s/p chemo and radiation, prophylactic brain radiation, basal cell carcinoma s/p excision in [**2144**] as well as [**2145-5-5**], genital herpes, reverse cataracts.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
spont slight R LE mvmt.no move R UE   Pertinent Results: MRI [**6-23**] Wand study: IMPRESSION: Unchanged large dural-based mass lesion, apparently extra-axial, causing severe mass effect in the pons, displacement of the basilar artery and narrowing of the fourth ventricle with dural-based along the clivus, left cavernous sinus as well as the left internal carotid artery, likely consistent with a meningioma, however given the history of lymphoma this is also an alternate possible diagnosis.
Status post left frontotemporal craniotomy, with a small surgical fluid collection extending from the anterior aspect of the left temporal region throughout the convexity, there is mild-to-moderate mass effect and shifting of the midline structures towards the right with approximately 4.4 mm of deviation and left frontal pneumocephalus.
Residual mass lesion with surgical changes and partial debulking, extending along the clivus and causing significant mass effect within the pons, mid brain and left cerebral peduncle.
There is also moderate restricted diffusion in the anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe, suggesting post-surgical edema.
Unchanged appearance of the petroclival extra-axial mass with unchanged compression and rightward displacement of the brainstem.
Postoperative changes within the left temporal lobe.
Decreased compression of the left lateral ventricle and interval resorption of previously seen pneumocephalus.
CT Head [**7-1**]: Status post resection of a left petroclival extra-axial mass lesion, with expected post-surgical changes including moderate amount of pneumocephalus and a small extraaxial fluid collection in the left posterior cranial fossa and middle cranial fossa.
Hypodensity/edema in the left temporal lobe, and brainstem.
Within the right lung there is newly developed right lower lung consolidation most likely consistent with right middle lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse especially giving the right mediastinal shift.
No interval increase in pleural effusion and no pneumothorax is noted.
MRI Brain postop [**7-2**]: New acute infarcts in the left thalamus, left internal capsule, left posterolateral pons/midbrain junction, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and left cerebellar hemisphere.
Subacute infarcts in the brainstem and temporal lobes are again noted.
The extra-axial mass at the interpenducular cistern is significantly decreased in size and there is decreased mass effect on the midbrain and decreased rightward displacement of the basilar artery.
Temporal lobe and brainstem edema are again noted.
Rightward midline shift and cerebellar tonsilar heriation are not signicantly changed.
Lower Extremity venous dopplers [**7-2**]: Occlusive thrombus within the left posterior tibial veins.
However, no evidence for clot elsewhere in either the left, or right lower extremity.
No change from the [**7-2**] MRI and the [**7-1**] CT, with subacute infarcts in the left thalamus, internal capsule, left hemipons, midbrain, cerebellar hemisphere and temporal lobe.
Extensive temporal lobe and brainstem edema causing cerebellar tonsillar herniation and effacement of the left-sided basal cisterns.
No new acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.
[**7-6**] ECHO- The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No large ASD or left ventricular thrombus seen.
Occlusive thrombus within the left lesser saphenous vein.
Resolution of previously noted thrombus within the left posterior tibial veins.
No significant change in the appearance of extensive infarction involving the left temporal lobe, left thalamus, left internal capsule, pons, mid brain, and left cerebellar hemisphere.
No significant change in the degree of edema within the left cerebral hemisphere and mid brain.
Persistent cerebellar tonsillar herniation, unchanged over the series of studies, may relate to the original posterior fossa mass.
No evidence of new acute large vascular territorial infarction or acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT Head [**2145-7-8**]: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
LENIS [**2145-7-9**]:  CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity  CXR [**2145-7-9**]  In comparison with the study of [**7-9**], there is decreasing opacification at the right base with a small residual.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
On 5.17 she remained stable and on 5.18 she underwent craniotomy for resection of her petraclinoid lesion as well as placement of a rigth sided EVD.
She continued to require a shovel mask for her respiratory status.
Immediate postoperative head CT demonstrated no acute blood with minimal pneumocephalus.
She had minimal withdrawal of her right lower extremity.
She had no withdrawal in her right upper extremity.
Chest Xray demonstrated rightsided consolidation and lower lobe collapse and so she was started on the VAP protocol.
Postoperative MRI demonstrated new infarcts within the left thalamus and internal capsule.
Lower extremity doppler US on [**7-2**] demonstrated thrombus in left posterior tibial veins.
IVC filter was not indicated due to small size of thrombus.
At approximately 6 am on [**7-7**] she was noted to have difficutly breathing and using accessory muscles.
It was noticed that she had increased swelling in her neck therefore it was decided to intubate her.
Her tubefeeds were held on the evening of [**7-11**] in preparation but due to OR availability it was postponed.
Medications on Admission: Aviane, ibuprofen   Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: [**2-7**]  PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Pain or fever.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Dural based brain [**Hospital **] Hospital Acquired Pneumonia Respiratory insufficiency Right sided hemiparesis Left calf DVT   Discharge Condition: Trach, Left 3rd nerve palsy left pupil 6mm fixed, right pupil [**5-9**].
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?Please remove one suture at rehab on [**7-17**] (Right side of head EVD suture) ?????
