Admission Date:  [**2142-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-1-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Taxol / Taxotere  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, constipation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Ultrasound-guided therapeutic paracentesis [**2142-4-12**] -Exploratory laparotomy with loop ileostomy [**2142-4-14**] -Bronchoscopy [**2142-4-14**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 28138**] is a 65F with a PMH s/f stage 4 ovarian cancer s/p taxol and carboplatinum, and most recently enrolled in the volociximab trial (c1w7 on [**4-5**]).
Over the past few weeks, she had been experiencing increasing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, constipation, and ascities- requiring therapeutic paracentesis.
Her most recent ultrasound-guided paracentesis on [**4-9**] noted colonic distention.
A CT torso showed colonic distention to the sigmoid colon with collapse, suspicious for obstruction due to possible drop metastasis.
In addition to this, there was interval enlargement of pulmonary nodules and development of a left sided pleural effusion.
She presents today with increasing abdominal distension, mild nausea, and mild discomfort.
In the ED a KUB was performed which showed no free air, but multiple distended loops of small bowel with air fluid levels.
Her exam was consistent with distention, tympany, and tenderness to palpation without peritoneal signs.
Stage IV Ovarian cancer -Diagnosed [**5-/2141**] when she presented with a malignant pleural effusion -Initiated on Taxol and carboplatinum, which she did not tolerate despite taxol desensitization.
She subsequently developed neuropathy and visual loss -Started the volociximab clinical trial after progression of disease, receiving c1w7 on [**4-5**] -Taken off of the volociximab trial on [**4-9**] secondary to disease progression, documented interval increase in lung nodules and possible drop metastasis.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Soft and non tender to palpation, no peritoneal signs.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**4-9**]: Interval progression of parenchymal lung nodules, with interval development of left-sided pleural effusion and probable worsening of large bowel distention.
Findings in the sigmoid region are worrisome for drop metastasis to the sigmoid colon.
A degree of bowel obstruction at the level of the sigmoid colon is not excluded .
KUB [**4-11**]: There is no free air.
There are multiple loops of dilated small  bowel measuring up to 3.5 cm.
There are air-fluid levels within the small bowel.
Early high grade or partial small bowel obstruction cannot be ruled out, ileus is also in the differential.
Ultrasound-guided therapeutic paracentesis [**2142-4-12**]:  Limited abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an apparently small amount of ascites throughout the abdomen.
Using direct ultrasound guidance a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was inserted into the peritoneal cavity with approximately 1.3 liters of a clear yellow liquid aspirate.
There were no complications immediately post-procedure.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided therapeutic paracentesis with removal of 1.3 liters of clear yellow ascites.
The NG tube is slightly high with the proximal port at the GE junction and the tip in the stomach.
There are bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates left greater than right and a moderate right effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: ONCOLOGY SERVICE COURSE: Ms. [**Known lastname 28138**] is a 58F with a PMH of stage IV ovarian cancer s/p carboplatin and taxol, and most recently taken off of the volociximab trial secondary to progression of disease.
Nausea, vomiting, and constipation: Based on CT scan and KUB findings, this is likely a partial small bowel obstruction vs. an ileus from likely drop metastasis from her ovarian cancer.
-Bowel rest, NPO, D5NS, and advance diet as tolerated -Anti-emetics with compazine and lorazepam -Aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, bisacodyl, and lactulose -NGT decompression prn -Therapeutic paracentesis prn -Repeat CT and general surgery consultation if she acutely worsens .
Pleural effusion: New right sided pleural effusion, not large and likely malignant.
Ovarian cancer: Now with progression of disease on volociximab trial, documented on CT torso.
-Will discuss options with primary oncologist .
Hyperlipidemia -continue home regimen of lovastatin .
SURGICAL SERVICE COURSE: The surgical service was consulted on [**2142-4-11**] for patients progressive abdominal distension and apparent obstruction at the sigmoid colon likely from cancer metastasis.
The patient requested decompression and resection of the tumor burden.
However, she had an episode of acute desaturation with somnolence and she was reintubated by anesthesia.
A CXR was obtained, which demonstrated: increased haziness overlying the right lower lung likely representing effusion layering posteriorly, with opacity in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss/atelectasis.
She had elevated PIPs and required high PEEP (max of 22) on PCV.
She was fluid resuscitated and this culminated in approximately 5 liters of crystalloid and 3 doses of colloid given in the SICU and over 3 liters of cystalloid in the PACU.
Her lactate progressively increased to a max of 5.9 and she became persistently neutropenic.
