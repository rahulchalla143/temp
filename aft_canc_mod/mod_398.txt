Admission Date:  [**2105-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-2-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2033-5-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11552**] Chief Complaint: syncope, UGIB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy  History of Present Illness: 71M with a history of ESRD [**3-10**] GN and HTN s/p transplant in [**2102**] with chronic rejection recently admitted for hyperkalemia and found to have gastric and duodenal ulcer after melena x1 in the hospital admitted after being found on the floor of his home surrounded by melenotic stool.
He denies chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, or focal weakness.
He has a L black eye from his fall which is sore.
He also reports mild chronic SOB more or less unchanged.
Head, neck, and torso CTs showed no acute fratures or bleeds.
ECG showed deepened ST-depressions in II, III, aVF, and V5-6 but initial CEs were negative.
Past Medical History: end stage renal disease due to chronic glomerulonephritis on hemodialysis hypertension hypercholesterolemia gout  Social History: The patient is originally from [**Location (un) 4708**].
Brother has diabetes and gout.
There is no family history of any renal failure, diabetes, or any coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: On admission: GEN: NAD, pleasant, conversant HEENT: MMM, no OP lesions, palpable jugular briuts from AV fistula CV: RR, NL S1S2 no S3S4 MRG PULM: CTAB ABD: BS+ NTND, no masses or HSM LIMBS: No LE edema, no clubbing, RIJ c/d/i SKIN: No rashes or skin breakdown NEURO: CN II-XII intact, grossly non-focal  Pertinent Results: Images: - CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2105-1-30**] 10:34 AM FINDINGS: There is slight, possible anterior wedging of the C5 vertebral body without prevertebral soft tissue swelling, but in association with a large anterior bridging osteophyte arising off its anteroinferior aspect.
There is moderate narrowing of the C6-7 disc space, with smaller anterior but a moderate posterior osteophytic ridge, the latter causing mild impression upon the ventral margin of the thecal sac.
No other cervical spine fractures are seen.
There is moderately prominent degenerative narrowing of the atlanto- dental articulation, with a small superiorly situated osteophyte arising from the anterior arch of the dens.
There are no other osseous abnormalities detected.
There is a moderate atherosclerotic calcification of the right common carotid bifurcation.
CONCLUSION: Mild anterior wedging of the C5 vertebral body which is probably chronic, in association with degenerative changes at this as well as the C6-7 levels.
No sign of subluxation or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
No evidence of acute abdominal process.
Left adrenal lesion again seen, incompletely characterized on single phase CT. .
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2105-1-30**] 10:33 AM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There is mild diffuse cerebral atrophy.
There is moderate atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous internal carotid arteries.
There is a prominent, likely dystrophic dural calcification adjacent to the falx cerebri in the vertex region, to the right of midline.
No other osseous abnormality is seen.
There is prominent left premaxillary soft tissue swelling which is incompletely delineated on this head CT scan.
CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
COMMENT: The above-noted findings were indicated in the preliminary report section of the electronic requisition.
Stomach: Excavated Lesions A single chronic cratered non-bleeding 8 mm ulcer was found in the antrum.
Additional findings include heaped-up margins with clean based ulcer.
Duodenum: Mucosa: Localized erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Excavated Lesions Multiple chronic superficial non-bleeding 5mm ulcers were found in the duodenal bulb.
Impression: Ulcer in the antrum (biopsy) Ulcers in the duodenal bulb Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: follow-up biopsy results Please check H.Pylori Ab.
Excavated Lesions A single cratered oozing 12 mm ulcer was found in the pre-pylorus.
A gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully after 3 clips could not be sucessfully applied due to the depth of the lesion.
Duodenum:   Excavated Lesions A few superficial non-bleeding ulcers were found in the duodenum.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus; Blood in the stomach; Ulcer in the pre-pylorus (thermal therapy); Ulcers in the duodenum ; Recommendations: serial hematocrits EGD in [**9-17**] weeks; [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor; Repeat EGD if acutely rebleeds .
EKG: Sinus, 98/min, L axis deviation, LVH by wave criteria, ST-D in II, III, aVF, V5-6, no ST-E  Brief Hospital Course: # Melena: Initially felt to be [**3-10**] UGIB from known duodenal and gastric ulcers.
EGD revealed an oozing pre-pyloric ulcer which was cauterized.
Colonoscopy showed multiple polyps and an anal mass.
Biopsy results showed invasive adenocarcinoma with mucinous features most consistent with perianal mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma.
Outpatient appointments with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] were set up for outpatient surgical follow up, as well as an MRI for investigation for metastatic disease.
Sucralfate and a PPI were started for his upper GI ulcers.
Iron replacement was provided for his low HCTs given low intake of iron and continued guiaic positive blood in stool.
Given his history of renal failure and immunosupression, the tissue obtained from the ulcers in the duodenum were also checked for CMV + staining.
# Hyperkalemia: This was felt to be [**3-10**] chronic renal failure vs. tacrolimus.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Due to history GN and hypertension.
S/p transplant in [**2102**] complicated by chronic rejection.
Patient was continued on Tacrolimus with daily levels and mycophenolate.
# ECG changes: Has subtle deepening of chronic ST depressions in II, III, aVF, V5-6.
ECG changes resolved without any elevation on serial cardiac enzymes.
Likely will need an outpatient stress prior to any surgical interventions for further investigation/treatment of his anal mass.
Was pan-cultured; blood grew out 1 positive Enterococcus in 1 of 4 bottles.
Urine also grew out enterococcus.
A TTE echo was performed which showed no vegetations.
At time of discharge, fevers, dysuria, flank pain had resolved.

To find out exactly where the bleed was, we placed a scope inside you which found that you had a small ulcer that was actively bleeding.
We treated this ulcer by cauterizing it and the bleeding stopped.
We also started you on a new medicine (sucralfate) which can help prevent these ulcers from forming and bleeding again.
If you feel stomach pain in the interim, you can try over the counter Zantac or Mylanta.
We also found that you had a urinary tract infection caused by bacteria that were also found in your blood.
Please call your primary care doctor or return to the emergency department if you notice blood in the toilet bowl again, if you vomit up blood, if you feel increasingly dizzy or lightheaded, or if you have any worsening fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
