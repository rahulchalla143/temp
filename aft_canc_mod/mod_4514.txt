Admission Date:  [**2109-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-7-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2026-6-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: History of vomiting x 3 month  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2109-7-16**]: Classical Whipple with open cholecystectomy.
History of Present Illness: This 83-year-old woman has been very healthy, but has developed anemia over the last few months.
This has led ultimately to endoscopy which showed an ulcer in the duodenum which was treated with H. pylori.
However, she has now developed gastric outlet obstruction, and she vomits semi digested food 3-4 times a week.
Imaging suggested a mass in the pancreatic head region enveloping the outflow of the stomach at the duodenum as well.
There was a high suspicion this was duodenal cancer.
Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, hyperlipidemia PSH: Tosillectomy   Social History: Tobacco-17 pack years, EtOH-4 drinks per week.
Currently lives alone in [**Location (un) **] Beach   Family History: Father died of PNA, Mother died of Heart Failure.
A 2.3 x 2.6-cm mass is present at the junction of the pancreatic head and its uncinate process.
An adjacent pancreatic cystic lesion is noted, measuring approximately 1.1 x 1.9 cm.
The former has direct mass effect on the adjacent duodenum.
Prominent bilateral adrenal glands.
A hyperdense lesion located within the left liver lobe of the liver, most likely represents a hemangioma.
[**2109-7-15**] EKG: Sinus bradycardia with first degree A-V block.
Intraventricular conduction defect.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Chronic cholecystitis.
Small intestine: Polypectomy; Segmental Resection; Whipple procedure (Pancreaticoduodenectomy, partial or complete, with or without partial Gastrectomy Synopsis MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type:  Whipple procedure.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma (not otherwise characterized).
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Circumferential/radial (mesenteric or retroperitoneal) margin:         Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Distance of carcinoma from closest margin:  3 mm.
Comments: The tumor invades pancreas but appears to invade less than 2 cm.
Her workup led to a CT scan that showed two lesions in her pancreas (a 2.3 x 2.6-cm mass at the junction of the pancreatic head and its uncinate process; an adjacent pancreatic cystic lesion measuring approximately 1.1 x 1.9 cm with direct mass effect on the adjacent duodenum).
The patient was admitted to the hospital and worked up for her pancreatic lesions.
Her vomiting and fullness was attributed to gastric outlet obstruction from compression of the duodenum by one of the masses, and the patient was decompressed w/ an NG tube and scheduled for a Whipple procedure.
In the PACU the patient was noted to have low uop (5-10cc/hr) and respiratory depression.
The patients UOP improved with resuscitation and her respiratory status improved on a Narcan drip.
Intermittent dilaudid and Fentanyl patch were d/c'd, patient received minimal dose of Dilaudid IV prn for pain control.
Patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition, NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and intermittent dilaudid for pain control.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with intermittent dilaudid, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
At the time of discharge on [**2109-7-23**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
