Admission Date:  [**2148-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-12-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Anemia and upper GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD [**2148-7-4**].
Result: Stricture with nodular, ulcerated and very friable overlying mucosa - differential diagnosis includes changes following recent upper endoscopy, post-radiation or recurrence of esophageal cancer.
Multiple bands that were disclodged from the mucosa were noted No lesions amenable to endoscopic treatment were noted.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 69 year old male with a history of COPD (FEV1 of 1.9 requiring 3L NC at home), pulmonary hypertention, CAD/CHF (unknown EF), Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell type, diagnosed in Feruary [**2146**] who presents from [**Hospital6 19155**] with a chronic upper gastrointestinal bleed.
In [**2147-12-15**], he had an EGD that showed some "irritation in the stomach" but no direct source of bleeding.
In [**2148-5-14**], a colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticulosis and he had three polypectomies that were positive for signet ring carcinoma identical to his esophageal adenocarcinoma.
This failed to resolve his anemia and an elective EGD done today [**2148-7-3**] showed a large clot in the proximal stomach with ongoing oozing from the gastric cardia contained within a small hiatal hernia.
The patient continued to have a low level of chronic oozing and was admitted to [**Location (un) **] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher management and argon plasma coagulation.
He denies BRBPR and says that his stools are "dark chocolate".
He has some numbness and tingling in his lower extremities that has been chronic due to diabetic nephropathy.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 69 year old male with a history of COPD (FEV1 of 1.9 requiring 3L NC at home), pulmonary hypertention, Barrett's esophagus, CAD/CHF (EF unknown) and esophageal adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell type, diagnosed in Feruary [**2146**] who presents from [**Hospital6 19155**] with a chronic upper gastrointestinal bleed.
#Upper GI Bleed: Patient has a history of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p chemo-radiation with radiation gastritis and oozing from a clot in the gastric cardia.
An EGD was performed on [**2148-7-4**], which showed a stricture at the gastroesophageal junction which was attributed to either post-radiation changes, a recurrence of his esophageal adenocarcinoma or changes related to a recent endoscopy.
There was no active bleeding.
No biopsies were taking due to the high risk for bleeding.

You were transferred here from [**Hospital3 12594**] because your red blood cell levels were low and you were found to have a bleed in your stomach.
On [**2148-7-4**], you had an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which showed a stricture at the junction between your esophagus and your stomach.
There was no bleeding visualized during the endoscopy and no procedures could be performed to stop or prevent future bleeding because there was a high risk of creating more bleeing.
Your red blood cell levels are more stable now than when you came into the hospital, but we expect that you will continue to need close followup as well as red blood cell transfusions.
