Admission Date:  [**2175-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-11-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-4-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Calcitonin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4421**] Chief Complaint: Left femur fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Fixation with intramedullary nail, Bone biopsy.
History of Present Illness: 44 F with history of squamous cell cancer of the thigh, and metastatic to bone and lung, s/p local resection and chemotherapy presents with spontaneous left femur fracture.
She was having difficulty completing sentences during interview.
However, she did state that on [**2175-11-1**] she experienced an atraumatic fracture of her femur, which was corroborated by accompanying records.
Of significance, she is a Jehovah's Witness and refuses to accept any human blood products.
She has also had profoundly abnormal electrolytes.
In addition to this large inner left thigh mass, a similar smaller mass developed several years ago on the lateral aspect of her left knee.
While this mass has never eroded or drained throught the skin, she feels that an aspect of this mass has begun to thin the overlying skin, in a similar manner to how her left inner thigh mass behaved before it spontaneously drained through the skin.
On [**2175-6-5**], CT scan of the pelvis and thigh obtained at [**Hospital1 83480**] showed a cavitated thick-walled soft tissue mass in the superficial soft tissues of the mid left thigh with air fluid level and a superior focus that appeared to be draining to the skin.
The wall of the cystic mass varied in thickness from 5 to 12 mm; its superior portion was 3.5 cm in diameter while its inferior portion was 6.5 cm in diameter; the longitudinal dimension of the lesion was 9.1 cm.
Pelvic images were said to be normal, with enlarged "hyperemic" lymph nodes in the left groin.
In addition to this left inner thigh mass was a subcutaneous bilobed 4 x 2.2 cm nodule in the lateral soft tissues just above the knee, lateral to the lateral femoral condyle.
On [**2175-6-6**], the cyst was drained by fine needle aspiration, and material was sent for cell block preparation.
This showed "poorly differentiated non-keratinizing SCC with necrosis and acute inflammation."
The biopsy specimen measured  1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm; the surface was "focally hemorrhagic and slightly friable."
This showed "ulcerated basosquamous cell carcinoma."
Metastatic workup revealed adenopathy involing the iliac vessles and superficial inguinal region.
The surgeon recovered eight inguinal and femoral lymph nodes, two of which showed metastatic tumor without clear-cut extracapsular extension.
He also excised 12 lymph nodes from the true pelvis, one of which again showed tumor, but no clear-cut extension.
Finally, 12 proximal left common iliac lymph nodes were all normal.
Her primary tumor was  a deeply invasive squamous cell carcinoma, which was at least 17  cm in size with negative margins.
Within the left pelvis, although only one lymph node was positive, there was a second lymph node, which showed tumor within the afferent lymphatics but not within the true lymph node sinuses or parenchyma.
Iron deficiency anemia - During workup for her SCC she underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy which showed no cause for her anemia.
Family History: Her father and sister have had sebaceous cysts.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs Abdomen: Linear scar, NT, ND, No rebound or guarding, No HSM GU: foley in place Ext: Left mid medial thigh with area where tissue removed and Right thigh with area of discoloration from skin graft placement.
Femur XRay ([**11-3**]): There is an oblique fracture at roughly the mid diaphyseal level with nearly one shaft width lateral displacement of the distal fragment.
No additional fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: There is an oblique/transverse fracture of the mid femoral shaft.
The pre-existing massive bilateral hilar and mediastinal masses have slightly increased in size, there is no obvious narrowing of both the right and the left main bronchus.
There still is the suggestion of a small left-sided pleural effusion.
New focal parenchymal opacities that would suggest infectious lung disease are not present.
No evidence of bone destruction.

# Fracture of Femur: On admission, the patient was found to have a pathologic fracture of her femur.
She was taken emergently to the OR, where she underwent fixation with intramedullary nail, and bone biopsy (results pending) with minimal blood loss.
On [**11-3**], the patient was transferred to the oncology service, where her pain was initially controlled with a Morphine PCA.
She was subsequently transitioned to long acting po pain regimen with morphine iv for breakthrough pain.
Ortho recs for further follow up are: (1) Femur fracture: - Weight bearing activity as tolerated, under the direction of physical therapy - Continue lovenox for 4 weeks (2) Shoulder nondisplaced fracture of the acromion: - Range of motion as tolerated - Sling for comfort - Follow up with outpatient surgeon .
Urine lytes were consistent with SIADH, which was thought to be secondary to post-op pain.
# Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:  Patient was continued on ferrous sulfate supplements.
# Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient has a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma, for which she is treated by her primary oncologist on [**Hospital1 6687**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7049**], and for which she is also followed at [**Hospital1 18**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
# Electrolytes: Patient had persistent hypokalemia to 2's and hypophosph to 1's.
# Sinus Tachycardia: Patient was persistently tachycardic with HR in 130s-150s.
This was thought to be secondary to her anemia, pain, and anxiety.
She was treated w/ procrit, pain medications, and ativan.
An evaluation for etiologies such as PE or infection was planned, and the importance of this was explained.
However, the patient was anxious to return to [**Hospital3 22439**], and her primary attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is comfortable with pursuing further evaluation at that institution.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC has increased from 18.7 to 26.5.
CXR not significant for focal parenchymal opacities.
The patient has remained afebrile since admission, and the patient has not had any focal signs of infection.
# Left Lower Extremity Edema:  The patient has had progressive left lower extremity edema on this admission up to her hip.
However, on [**2175-11-6**], the edema was more than the husband had noticed in the recent past.
