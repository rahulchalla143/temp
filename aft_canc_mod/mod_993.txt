Gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.
Hyperechoic area in the left lobe of the liver is also seen on the CT from the same day.
Differential includes old lymphomatous infiltration, area of greater fatty infiltration, or possibly an unusual appearance of a benign lesion such as an atypical hemangioma could be considered.
There has been no definite recent change although the lesion is easier to visualize on this study.
Chronic pulmonary embolism with no evidence of new acute pulmonary embolism.
Geographical distribution of a hypodense area in the left lobe of the kidney, also seen on the ultrasound of the same day.
Differential includes old lymphomatous infiltration with marked atrophy involving the left lobe or atrophy of other etiology; there may be relative fatty infiltration at the site and an unusual benign lesion such as a hemangioma could also be involved.
Overall, extensive mediastinal, retroperitoneal, celiac and pelvic lymphadenopathy appears to be stable to slightly decreased in size since the PET-CT from [**2106-3-28**].
No acute intra-abdominal or intrathoracic process to explain the patient's pain.
[**2106-7-22**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT) FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph there are now small bilateral pleural effusions.
Left retrocardiac opacity likely represents lower lobe pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions.
Retrocardiac opacity likely represents left lower lobe pneumonia.
Opacification of the left base represents atelectasis or consolidation.
Persistent small right pleural effusion with increased small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Persistent small pleural effusions bilaterally.
Left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.
[**2106-7-19**] 4:19 pm DIRECT ANTIGEN TEST FOR VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS  DIRECT ANTIGEN TEST FOR VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS (Final [**2106-7-20**]): POSITIVE FOR VARICELLA ZOSTER.
Brief Hospital Course: # Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient has history of atrial fibrillation in setting of Hodgkin's lymphom diagnosis.
He experienced intermittent atrial fibrillation starting [**2106-7-17**] with rates up to 150's.
He had numerous conversions into and out of afib: he was first converted to sinus rhythm with 5mg IV metoprolol, however went back into atrial fibrillation with rates in the 130's to 150's.
He was converted a second time with IV diltiazem drip, but returned to atrial fibrillation after trying to transition to PO diltiazem.
With recommendations from cardiology, he was also started on sotalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] for addtional rate control.
He had been on lovenox for PE in [**Month (only) 956**], and was increased from 75mg to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to account for his weight.
# Abdominal Pain: LUQ abdominal pain and rib pain.
Laboratory values notable for mildly elevated alk phos, ALT and lactic acid (2.5).
Per [**Hospital1 18**] records, his Alk Phos had been elevated in the past few months, likely secondary to his chemotherapy.
RUQ ultrasound showed biliary sludge without any evidenc of cholecystitis.
No acute processes seen on CXR.
CT abdomen and chest notable for hypodense area in liver, chronic PE and stable LAD.
ECG NSR without any evidence of ischemia.
Patient spiked fever to 102.7 and was started on Unasyn and cultured.
Antibiotics were subsequently discontinued due to low suspicion for infection.
Etiology unclear, but no evidence of acute processes; may have been due to mild ileus from chemotherapy.
# Zoster:  Patient had right sided chest pain wrapping around torso during week prior to admission.
He developed a herpetic rash in T9 dermatome during admission consistent with zoster.
He was seen by dermatology who did a biopsy (positive for varicella zoster) and was started on IV acyclovir 1000mg q8hrs and put on precautions.
# Hodgkin's Lymphoma:  Patient has stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma.
You were admitted for abdominal pain of unclear etiology.
You also developed atrial fibrillation during your admission which has converted back into sinus rhythm.
