In the MICU her mental status was observed to wax and [**Last Name (un) **] with periods of near unresponsiveness.
There is a tinge of blood in her urine, but a Foley was either placed or replaced on admission (not clear if she has at baseline).

Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated when at 30 degrees (actually flat), no LAD.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, trivial crackles in the bases, some transmitted upper airway sounds, impression of some COPD based on cardiac auscultation and slightly slow exhalation.
CV: Distant sounds, normal S1 with quiet S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops appreciated.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
No pitting edema, some venous stasis dermatitis.

There are low lung volumes.
There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is left basilar atelectasis.
The pulmonary arteries are prominent bilaterally and there is mild increased interstitial markings.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine, including compression deformities are noted.
Severe degenerative changes of the left shoulder are unchanged.
Head CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major vascular territorial infarction, mass effect, or edema.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity is unchanged and consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is consistent with diffuse parenchymal volume loss, unchanged from prior.
There may be mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, but evaluation is limited due to patient motion.
The remainder of visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
There is calcification of the bilateral cavernous carotids.
Right bundle-branch block.
Read by: [**Last Name (LF) 578**],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 579**] Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 81 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 105372**]/466 1 -140 27    Brief Hospital Course:   This 84-year-old woman had an episode of desaturation on several days of more labored breathing.
Likely CHF exacerbation.
Shortness of Breath and Desaturation   Likely CHF exacerbation.
Also with evidence of COPD exacerbation on exam.
No evidence of pneumonia, ACS, tachyarrhthmias.
Patient had no respiratory distress by the time she was transferred to the floor.
Given wheeze, is likely that COPD is also present.
Altered Mental Status and Functional Status   Actually appears to be at baseline per [**Hospital3 2558**] and more difficult to rouse per daughter.
Without the rest of the panel, it is not possible to interpret her high TSH and start treatment, although the most likely cause is hypothyroidism at the level of the thyroid (rather than central hyperthyroid).
Difficulty in arousing the patient from sleep may relate to dementia and hypothyroidism.
However, primary disorders of the arousal system, rather than cortical dementia are worth considering.
Another contributor that was considered was supratherapeutic phenytoin level (due to present renal insufficiency, although this degree of renal insufficiency is unlikely to require dose adjustment being mostly hepatically metabolized).
Seizure Disorder   No seizures during admission.
Hypertension   Presently not active problem.
Acute Renal Failure   Cr 2.2 on admission.
Most likely a combination of poor forward flow in context of CHF exacerbation effect of furosemide.
Another likely contributor is multpile myeloma.
Hypernatremia   Possible salt load as etiology, but not obvious cause.
Gradually and carefully adjust given possible CHF exacerbation, with sodium restriction only (rather than giving additional hypotonic fluid).
Urinanalysis with WBC and Blood   Not impressive enough to treat, but should be followed.
Hematuria has been a chronic problem and may warrant further work-up at the discretion of her PCP.
Diabetes   Only one supplemental dose of two units of regular insulin was given on one evening.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO 1X/WEEK (SA) as needed for Saturday.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) Neb Inhalation Q6H:PRN as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Exacerbation of congestive heart failure (systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 26%).
Secondary Dementia Renal Failure Hematuria   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable  Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after a few days of more difficulty with breathing and increased sleepiness.
We found that you were slightly volume overloaded here, secondary to your heart failure, and diuresis of this fluid had already commenced at the nursing and during the trip here.
