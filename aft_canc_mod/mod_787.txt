She was admitted last week [**Date range (1) 19274**]/08 with hypercalcemia and treated with pamidronate 30mg, calcitonin, and dialysis.
Hospital course was complicated by an episode of hypotension following dialysis on [**2153-1-12**].
She also began treatment for myeloma and amyloidosis last week with Revlimid.
Besides generalized pain worst in back, legs, and jaw and weakness, she also notes intermittent SOB x 2 days(at home is on 2-3LNC).
Denies cough, fever, chills, chest pain or palpitations.
Restarted levophed around 0900 because tachycardia due to dopamine.
CXR showed a worsening pleural effusion and CTA chest was performed which demonstrated stable chronic changes and no PE.
TTE in the ED was w/o evidence of large pericardial effusion.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denied night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
With relapse of her myeloma, she received thalidomide from [**Month (only) **] to [**2143-10-25**].
Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor in 11/[**2143**].
Noted for recurrent disease in the summer of [**2145**] and received a donor lymphocyte infusion in [**8-/2145**] with relatively a stable disease after this.
Noted for slow progression of her disease in the fall of [**2150**] and status post a second donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2151-2-5**] given at a dose of one x10 to the seventh T-cell/kg.
Admitted on [**2151-9-13**] due to worsening renal insufficiency with creatinine of 3.4 and new lung mass causing right lower lobe collapse.
Following [**Year (4 digits) **], she was started on thalidomide for a short period of time, but was readmitted on [**2151-9-28**] due to left lower edema and new DVTs.
Received Cytoxan [**2151-9-30**] with Decadron 20mg X 4 days with no change in disease.
Received Velcade 1.3mg/m2 D1 and D4, but then admitted due to worsening lower extremity edema and increased creatinine.
C5 started on [**2152-1-31**] with D8 Cytoxan held and D11 Velcade held due to low counts.
Also on dialysis for renal failure.
Another admission on [**2152-3-9**] due to increasing shortness of breath and worsening/recurrent pneumothoraces on the left side.
She underwent pleurodesis and although had a reaction to the talc procedure, she was discharged home after only about a one-week stay in the hospital.
Other Pertinent Past Medical History - Per [**Year (4 digits) **] and Confirmed with Pt - s/p 3 episodes of epiglottitis/supraglottitis requiring intubation in [**2145**], [**2149**], [**2151**] - Amyloidosis - involvement of lungs, tongue, bladder, heart - CKD - thought secondary to amyloid disease progression - Diastolic dysfunction - likely secondary amyloid - Multiple DVT's (L IJ, L popliteal, L sup femoral)-IVC filter, due to R sided DVT propagation; on coumadin intermittently (due to fluctuating platelet counts on Velcade) - Pulmonary emboli in the past associated with DVT's - Osteopenia s/p Zometa infusions - HTN - s/p tonsillectomy - Hx of disseminated herpes in [**2146**] - Urge incontinence - Subdural hemorrhages in [**2-/2151**] in the setting of elevated INR    Social History: Married and lives in [**Location 3786**].
Family History: Notable for hypertension.
No family history of malignancies or premature cardiac death   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97 BP: 94/49 on 0.06 levophed P: 73 R: 13 O2: sat 96% on NRB General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: bronchial BS and crackles at left base; decreased BS on left, no wheezes, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Rectal: guaiac (-) Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema; +edema on right wrist, no tenderness w/passive motion Neuro: A&O x 3, CN 2-12 in tact, [**5-29**] upper and lower extremity strength Skin: No rash, warm and dry.
No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Cholelithiasis, no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Gallbladder wall thickening is likely secondary to ascites and also be seen in the setting of chronic liver disease.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yo woman with multiple myeloma, s/p allogeneic transplant [**2143**] with recurrent disease and with systemic amyloidosis(cardiac), ESRD on hemodialysis s/p recent hospitalization for hypercalcemia and supratherapeutic INR who represents for the same issues as well as hypotension.
Pt was started on broad spectrum Abx for concern for sepsis resulting in hypotension.
However On night of [**1-18**], pt had an episode of bradycardia, hypotension and she passed away within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.
# Hypotension: It was in the setting of poor PO intake, likely due to hypovolemia.
# Hypercalcemia: It was in the setting of diffuse, recurrent MM c/b amyloidosis.
# Respiratory: Pt has chronic oxygen requirement due to amyloidosis involvement of the lungs.
Also has h/o PEs and is s/p pleurodesis.
CT and CXR w/stable chronic findings.
No suggesition of PNA at this point.
# Tachycardia: Pt had 2 episodes of tachycardia with drop in her BP.
initially it was thought to be ventricular tachycardia and hence pt was loaded with Amiodarone.
Cardiology was consulted who thought that it was atrial fibrillation and not Vtach.
#Elevation in liver enzymes: Pt had severe rise in ALT, AST and LDH.
# Multiple myeloma: Recurrent; c/b hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.
# ESRD on HD: management per renal team.
