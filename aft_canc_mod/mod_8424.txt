Patient intially tolerated the procedure well, but post procedurally developed bright red blood per rectum and melanotic stools.
Patient underwent a second endoscopy which showed a large adherant clot at the site of the resection and 4mg of epinephrine was injected into the site with out obtaining hemostatis.
Patient continued to pass melanotic stools and BRBPR and was emergently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He did not become hypotensive nor tachycardic while in GI.
During the placement of the line patient had several vagal episodes with passage of bright red stool and dropped his systolic pressures to the 60s.

Stomach Contents: Small amount of dark blood was seen in the stomach.
There is a large clot at the site of EMR.
Active bleeding is noted.
Impression: Small amount of dark blood was seen in the stomach.
There is a large clot at the site of EMR.
Active bleeding is noted at the site of EMR.
Fluoroscopic assisted right femoral access and retrieval.
Subsequently, the access on the right side was aborted, the needle and microsheath were removed, and 10 minutes of manual compression achieved hemostasis.
There was no evidence of contrast extravazation.
The long 5F sheath was exchanged for a short 5F sheath, which was securely sutured to patient's skin.
No complications ensued.
Conventional celiac trunk anatomy.
No active extravasation was identified; however, known region of leeding was supplied by the GDA artery.
Multiple selective and super selective angiograms were obtained, without exactly identifying the source of bleeding.
Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization of the GDA artery, with a  andwich technique, until successful stasis was achieved.
IMPRESSION: Prophylactic embolization of a GDA artery given patient's significant duodenal bleeding symptoms.
No immediate post-procedure complications were noted.
[**2181-7-26**] - CT abd/pelvis LUNG BASES:  There are small bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis.
There is no focal consolidation or nodule seen.
ABDOMEN:  Limited assessment of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous  contrast demonstrates no contour abnormality of the liver, spleen,  and bilateral kidneys.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Small nodule posterior to the pancreatic body is seen, measuring 1.7 cm, previously seen on the recent MRI of [**2181-6-25**], whic was characterized as tuber omentale.
Within the tail there is loss of feathery apperance, corresponding to accessory spleen seen on MRI.
There is minimal stranding around the second segment of the duodenum and pancreatic head, post-procedure and embolization.Small amount of high attenuating stranding within the right anterior pararenal fossa (2:53), without evidence of hematoma.
There is no hematoma.
There is contrast within the gallbladder, consistent with vicarious excretion from the prior embolization study.
The visualized small and colonic loops of bowel within the upper abdomen are normal in appearance with no evidence of abnormal dilatation or wall thickening.
There is a small fat-containing ventral hernia.
There is fat stranding around the right inguinal region, post-placement of a femoral line; however, there is no evidence of retroperitoneal or inguinal hematoma.
Atherosclerotic plaques are seen along the aorta and iliac arteries without aneurysmal dilatation.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Minimal lumbosacral spondylosis without evidence of destructive lytic lesions.
No evidence of hematoma within the abdomen or pelvis.
Minimal stranding around the second segment of the duodenum and the pancreas, likely related to post-procedure, however correlation with biochemical pannel is recommended to assess for potential pancreatitis.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Stranding along the right inguinal region, post-central line placement, however, with no evidence of retroperitoneal or inguinal hematoma.
Small nodule posterior to the body of pancreas and loss of feathery appearance within the pancreatic tail, which correspond respectievely to tuber omentale and accessory spleen seen on the prior MRI.

GI bleed: Post-procedure patient developed bright red blood per rectum and melanotic stools.
Patient underwent a second endoscopy which showed a large adherent clot at the site of the resection and 4mg of epinephrine was injected into the site with out obtaining hemostatis.
Patient continued to pass melanotic stools and BRBPR and was emergently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
During the placement of the line patient had several vagal episodes with passage of bright red stool and dropped his systolic pressures to the 60s.
Out of concern for hematoma formation at the groin sites or a retroperitoneal bleed, CT scan was performed which showed no hematoma or RP bleed; there was no pseduoaneurysm of the femoral arteries.
CHRONIC ISSUES 1.
Additionally, he did have an elevated white blood cell count without signs of infection; this should be followed with the CBC in a week.
Biopsy of duodenal adenoma pathology pending.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check a CBC on [**2181-8-3**] with results faxed to Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Name (STitle) 5395**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103723**]  (discharge HCT 33, Hgb 11) ICD-9, 285.1   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Doudenal adenoma ERCP biopsy hemorrhage Mistaken insertion of 9French trauma line to the right femoral artery   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit after having massive bleeding from the biopsy in your small intestine earlier in the day.
You were emergently transfused 4 units of red blood cells and had the bleeding artery embolized by our interventional radiologists.
You tolerated this procedure well and had no signs of further bleeding for 2 days afterwards.
If you develop any bleeding in your leg, your neck or in your stool please call your doctor immediately.
You will need to have a blood count checked in a week's time to ensure that there is no further bleeding.
