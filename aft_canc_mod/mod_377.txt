CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-2**] 5:11 AM IMPRESSION: Overall, minimal change re-demonstrating a large left parenchymal hemorrhage and associated mass effect.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
A dedicated PA and lateral radiograph may be obtained if a pneumonia is a clinical concern.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-3**] 10:00 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Overall, minimal interval change since the prior study, with no change in position of ventricular catheter or size of the ventricles.
Large left parenchymal hemorrhage, with associated edema and mass effect with mild uncal herniation on the left, unchanged from prior study.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2195-9-4**] 11:19 AM IMPRESSION: Recent placement of a left frontal approach VP shunt with the tip of the catheter terminating in the midline, slightly more anterior than on the prior study with associated postop pneumocephalus and small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Large left parenchymal hemorrhage, with associated edema and mass effect, unchanged from prior study.
Large left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with increasing vasogenic edema leading to worsening mass effect, with increased subfalcine herniation.
Portable Abdominal Xray  [**2195-9-6**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
A moderately large amount of retained stool is identified throughout the colon.
No bone destruction.
Small area of calcification adjacent to the left hip that is of unknown etiology but doubtful significance.
There is no evidence of free air beneath the hemidiaphragms.
There is unremarkable bowel gas pattern with retained contrast within the colon.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of free air.
There is no evidence of free air on the decubitus film.
However, there are multiple air-fluid levels, which appear to be colonic in nature.
The supine film shows a distended large bowel up to 8 cm.
These findings suggest a colonic ileus.
In comparison to yesterday, there is no barium seen within the colon.
Gas pattern is now normal without evidence of dilated bowel.
There is no evidence of free air.
Neurophysiology: EEG	Study Date of [**2195-8-21**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of an unvarying 9 Hz alpha frequency background.
Clinical correlation is recommended as this may represent this patient's usual background, but in the context of a severe subcortical disturbance, the usual regulators of background activity may be disturbed.
There is no evidence of ongoing or incipient seizure activity seen.
EEG	Study Date of [**2195-8-25**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of focal attenuation and moderate diffuse background slowing over the left hemisphere, mild diffuse slowing over the right hemisphere, and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, as well as more severe focal dysfunction over the left hemisphere which is consistent with the patient's history of left parietal hemorrhage.
FIRDA can be seen with diffuse encephalopathies, midline structural lesions, hydrocephalus, or increased intracranial pressure.

These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, as well as more severe focal dysfunction over the left hemisphere which is consistent with the patient's history of left parietal hemorrhage.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) can be seen with diffuse encephalopathies, midline structural lesions, hydrocephalus, or increased intracranial pressure.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there is no significant change.
No electrographic seizures were present.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o right handed man with a PMH significant for HTN and DMII, who presented to the ED with acute onset of right sided weakness, speech changes and confusion [**8-20**].
His exam at admission was notable for right sided neglect, nonfluent aphasia but also with receptive defecits, possible right hemianopia, mild right NLF flattening, right sided hemiparesis and hemisensory loss.
His NCHCT showed a large left frontoparietal IPH that extended from the thalamus to the cortex and on further imaging was found to have multiple cerebral mets.
An EVD was inserted due to worsening ICH and it was not possible to remove this due to high ICP spikes.
Staging CT-torso revealed a large lung mass and associated adrenal metastasis.
Patient had spontaneous movement on the left side and had eyes open GCS E4 V2 M5 and due to poor prognosis oncology felt that no chemotherapy or XRT was indicated at this time.
Patient deteriorated and was transferred back to th ICU on [**2195-9-5**] due to increasing somnolence and CT showed worse edema and herniation.
After PEG placement the patient developed a mild ileus that resolved with conservative treatment.
# Neuro: Patient has risk factor of HTN and presented to the ED with acute onset of right sided weakness, speech changes and confusion on [**2195-8-20**] and although Code Stroke was called patient was noted to have a large ICH on CT-head.
Admission exam was notable for right sided neglect, nonfluent aphasia but also with receptive defecits, possible right hemianopia, mild right NLF flattening, right sided hemiparesis and hemisensory loss.
His NCHCT showed a large left frontoparietal IPH that extended from the thalamus to the cortex.
The patient's conscious level decreased and repeat CT showed worsening of the ICH and associated edema and midline shift.
Cytology with flow cytometry showed rare atypical epithelioid cells suspicious for metastases.
[**8-23**] MRI head with contrast was done that showed numerous enhancing foci in the bilateral occipital lobes and the right parietal/frontal lobe, concerning for metastatic disease.
CT torso showed a 6.2 cm right upper lobe mass, multiple lymph nodes, including a right supraclavicular lymph node and a left adrenal lesion.
On [**2195-8-25**], an ultra-sound guided supraclavicular lymph node biopsy was done at the bedside that showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, presumed to be primary lung cancer.
Given the patient's relatively severe neurological deficits due to the IPH, as well as the extent of spread of the cancer, the med onc team did not see a role for them to pursue any treatment at present.
Despite efforts to clamp the EVD, ICP rose to >25 and this continuied to drain blood tinged CSF and it was not possible to be removed.
Patient was empirically treated with IV levetiracetam and on [**2195-8-26**], the LTM showed some delta rhythmic activity in the frontal lobes however that resolved.
LTM did not demonstrate electrographic seizures and levetiracetam was latterly stopped.
Patient initially required nicardipine drip for BP and latterly transitioned to home meds.
Due to high tumour burden and edema, patient was started on dexamethasone and this was titrated down.
A family meeting was held on [**8-27**] with the wife, daughter, and son (via phone) with the medical oncology team and Neuro ICU team regarding the metastatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis and prognosis.

There are no signs of pneumonia and respiratory status is stable on room air.
# GI: Due to his large ICH, patient failed multiple swallow evaluations.
After the PEG was placed, the patient did not tolerate tube feeds well and developed abdominal pain and distention.
Imaging suggested a mild ileus.
# Renal:Cr 1.6 on presentation and improved to normal with hydration.
HCTZ was stopped due to hyponatremia that has now resolved.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Large intrcranal hemorrhage secondary to hypertension in the context of bleeding cerebral metastasis s/p EVD and VP shunt insertion, PEG placement Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung .
Secondary diagnoses: Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Type 2   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Unfortunately it was discovered that this bleed was due to one of several metastatic brain lesions from a primary lung adenocarcinoma.
For the brain bleed it was necessary to place a drain to decrease the pressure within the skull.
