Admission Date:  [**2173-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-5-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Nsaids / Vitamin K  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**9-19**]: Posterior Fossa Craniotomy for resection of bilateral cerebellar masses.
History of Present Illness: 60F h/o colon CA and on coumadin for DVT who is s/p fall on [**9-13**].
She went to see her PCP who decided to do a CT scan of her head, as she is on coumadin and was found to have bilateral cerebellar lesions.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive neurosurgical care.
HEENT: Pupils: PERRL        EOMs-intact with bilateral horizontal nystagmus Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No pronator drift.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: Slowed finger-nose-finger bilaterally, + dysmetria.
She has no drift.
There is perilesional edema with some effacement of the fourth ventricle and folia.
Ventricles are stable in size without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
A hyperattenuating lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere is also stable (series 2, image 6).
There is effacement of soft tissue over the left occiput, but no underlying fracture is demonstrated.
MRI Head [**9-18**]: FINDINGS: There is extensive edema identified in the cerebellar hemisphere with two discrete mass lesions identified One mass lesion is seen in the midline and extending to the right cerebellar hemisphere measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm with central area of low signal indicating blood products.
There is peripheral enhancement identified.
There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle with compression.
The second mass is identified in the left cerebellar hemisphere measuring approximately 1.2 x 1.5 cm in size.
The mass demonstrate intrinsic low signal on T1- and T2-weighted images indicative of acute hemorrhage.
There is no acute infarct seen.
There is moderate ventriculomegaly including dilatation of the temporal horns bodies of the lateral ventricle and the third ventricle indicative of obstructive hydrocephalus.
Mild changes of small vessel disease are seen.
IMPRESSION: Two discrete mass lesions are identified in the cerebellar hemisphere as described above which most likely due to metastasis which are most likely due to metastatic disease.
Mass effect on the fourth ventricle is seen with mild-to-moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.
Extensive edema is seen in the cerebellum.
The examination was performed with fiduciary markers for preoperative planning.
Similar material extends into the superficial femoral and popliteal veins which are also noncompressible.
Color Doppler analysis reveals only trace flow in the popliteal vein and common femoral veins, with no observable flow in the superficial femoral vein.
The right peroneal and posterior tibial veins in the calf are not identified.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral extensive deep venous thrombosis.
Note that proximal extent of thrombus is not characterized above the common femoral veins.
CT Torso [**9-19**]: FINDINGS: There is a large necrotic mass in the right lower lung.
The exact size of this mass is difficult to discern due to surrounding dense consolidated and collapsed lung however the necrotic portion measures 60 x 51 mm.
This mass encases the posterior right inferior pulmonary vein and extends along the juxtamediastinum to abut the posterior wall of the right main pulmonary artery.
There is a moderate pericardial effusion.
Mild enlargement of the main pulmonary artery to 32 mm suggests mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Small left pleural effusion, the lungs are otherwise clear with no further nodules or mass.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: There is a 22 x 36 mm poorly defined area of low attenuation in the periphery of the right lobe of the liver at the junction of segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb (3.44) near the ligamentum teres, is not seen on the non-contrast or delayed images and there is no contour bulging.
No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
The right kidney is normal with the exception of a small cystic abnormality in the medial interpolar cortex- 11 mm and a 3 mm lower pole cyst.
No small or large bowel dilatation, surgical sutures in the sigmoid colon are consistent with the patient's previous bowel resection.
There is a wide-mouthed anterior abdominal hernia which contains bowel loops without evidence of strangulation or obstruction.
Multiple dilated and varicose gonadal vessels in the pelvis surroung the uterus.
No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions, however, there are marked degenerative changes throughout the thoracolumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Large necrotic right lower lobe mass is most likely a primary lung neoplasm and is obstructing the right interlobar bronchus, encasing and compressing the right inferior pulmonary vein abutting the posterior wall of the right posterior pulmonary artery.
Subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes as described.
Focal area of low attenuation in the liver at the junction of segments [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb near the falciform ligament is likely perfusional, however attention should be paid on follow up to exclude metastasis.
Wide-mouthed anterior abdominal hernia contains bowel loops without evidence of obstruction or strangulation.
Cardiac Echo [**9-19**]: There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Very small pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.
MRI Head [**9-20**](post-op): FINDINGS: There is a bilateral suboccipital craniectomy, as seen on the preceding CT scan, and a small extra-axial fluid collection deep to the craniectomy defect.
There is no definite evidence of mass- like contrast enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest residual tumor.
There is persistent edema surrounding the surgical cavities and extending into the cerebellar peduncles, right greater than left.
There is a right frontal approach ventriculostomy, as seen on [**2173-9-19**], which crosses the anterior falx and terminates in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There is a small focus of slow diffusion (image 18 of series 8 and series 9), in the left anterior corpus collosum, lateral to the ventriculostomy catheter.
As there is no evidence of corresponding blood products on the gradient echo or pre-contrast T1-weighted images, this is consistent with a small acute infarction.
There is a small subdural collection along the anterior right frontal convexity and the right anterior falx, also new since the pre-operative study, which could be related to the interim ventriculostomy placement.
Foci of high T2 signal are again seen in the subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the pons, likely related to moderate chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the anterior ethmoid air cells.
There is a small amount of fluid in the right mastoid tip air cells.
Status post resection of bilateral cerebellar masses with blood products in the surgical cavities.
While there is no definite evidence of masslike enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest residual tumor, follow-up is recommended upon resolution of blood products.
Slightly decreased compression of the fourth ventricle.
New small acute infarction in the left anterior corpus callosum, lateral to the ventriculostomy catheter.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2173-9-23**] FINDINGS: Again noted are changes from a suboccipital craniectomy with post-operative changes in the cerebellum.
There is evolving hypodensity in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, which could represent ischemic sequela.
There is a right frontal ventricular catheter with its tip in the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
IMPRESSION: Evolving hypodensity in bilateral inferior cerebellar hemispheres which appear slightly more prominent than on the prior MRI from [**2173-9-20**].
These could represent ischemic sequela and recommend correlation with followup MRI.
Ventricles are unchanged in size, and there is no hemorrhage along the ventriculostomy tract.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the neurosurgical ICU after identification of new bilateral cerebellar lesions.
Post-resection MRI revealed complete mass resection, however a small area of decreased diffusion along the corpous collosum was noted.
Heme-onc was consulted, and they determined that there was no acute intervention needed for these, and she could follow up with her home oncologist in [**Location (un) 14663**].
The drain was removed that afternoon and another CT scan revealed no hemorrhage after drain removal.
She was neurologically stable on [**9-24**], there were no signs of increased intracranial pressure.
