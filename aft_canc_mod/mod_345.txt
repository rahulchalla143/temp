He had increased venous collaterals but not obvious portal hypertension.
The liver was large and cirrhotic with large regenerative nodules.
There was a mass lesion in segment VIII extending and pushing into segment [**Doctor First Name **] with involvement of the peripheral branches of the middle hepatic vein but the proximal right hepatic vein was clear.
There were no other lesions in the remainder of the liver demonstrated by intraoperative ultrasound.
Initially, he did well, but was also having decreased urine output.
On POD 3 he was noted to have worsening encephalopathy and repeat liver doppler ultrasound was done showing new ascites.
As the findings were concerning for portal vein thrombosis versus slow flow a CT was obtained showing thrombosis of the left portal vein and main portal vein, extending to the confluence of the SMV, portal vein, and splenic vein.
He had a portal venogram suggestive of acute expansile thrombus within the main portal vein.
Successful exclusion of the right portal vein stump with placement of covered stents in the main and left portal vein was done with no further extravasation, however there was still persistent thrombus in the main and left portal veins after mechanical thrombectomy (Angioget).
Attempt was made at another thrombectomy with TPA and on [**12-3**] there was interval improvement, but still some thrombus in the stent and the main portal vein.
Also due to his worsening mental status he was intubated.
LFTs were notable for progressive increase of total bilirubin, worsening jaundice and worsening mental staus consistent with hepatic failure.
The patient underwent Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (brain dead donor)non- ABO compatible liver transplant.
Procedure consisted of piggyback, portal vein-to- portal vein anastomosis, common bile duct-to-common bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube, infrarenal iliac artery conduit to the common hepatic artery of the donor, and portal vein thrombectomy for portal vein/superior mesenteric vein/splenic vein thrombosis.
On [**12-28**] he was brought back to the OR for Abdominal washout, Tru-Cut biopsy of the liver, reclosure of Silastic abdominal closure.
He was unable to be closed and then on [**2196-1-2**] he was taken once again to the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy, drainage of subphrenic abscess, liver biopsy and Vicryl mesh closure which was attached to the fascia for closure of the intra-abdominal wall.
Liver biopsy results from [**12-28**] showed Zone three hepatocyte apoptosis/necrosis with focal drop-out, consistent with preservation/reperfusion injury.
Mild to moderate, predominantly zone three cholestasis, with focal feathery degeneration of hepatocytes and rare bile plug formation.
No acute rejection was seen.
He received 19 days of linezolid and then per ID recommendations he was switched to Tigecycline because on [**1-13**] he underwent a technically successful aspiration/drainage of a complex intraperitoneal fluid collection.
On [**1-9**] he had drainage of a non-infected pleural effusion.
LFTs were notable for persistent bilirubin elevation.
Cholangiogram revealed a tight curve/loop in the mid common bile duct, with possible evidence of a subtle stricture just above this curve with mild upstream biliary dilation, An 8cm by 10Fr biliary stent was placed across the mid-CBD.
The patient had multiple speech and swallow evaluations including video swallow that demonstrated aspiration.
The patient has had a VAC to the abdominal wound since the mesh was placed.
The wound is slowly closing although healing has been very slow.
On [**1-22**] thyroid function tests were sent (TSH 13, T4 3.0) , he was found to be hypothyroid and was started on Levoxyl.
Intermittent HD was performed and on [**1-28**] had successful uncomplicated placement of a 15.5 French x 23 cm tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis catheter via right internal jugular venous access with the tip of the catheter terminating in the right atrium ready for use.
The xray done at the time of the line placement was concerning for increased bilateral pleural effusions.
There was concern for aspiration.
The patient had a head CT which showed no evidence of acute intracranial pathological process.
ID followed throughout and recommended a 4-week course of therapy, which changed to tigecycline, from the day of the first negative blood culture for VRE ([**1-16**]) and an indefinite course of fluconazole given his many anastomoses and high likelihood of recurrence.
Multiple c diffs were sent (all negative) for multiple loose stools.
The cellcept has been changed several times due to its potential GI effects and is now 250 QID.
