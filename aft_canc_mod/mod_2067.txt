he has been admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] for sork-up for a newly identified pancreatic mass found during a recent episode of gallstone pancreatitis.
ERCP was unable to perform sphincerotomy or obtain brush sample secondary to significant inflammation and edema.
The patient was sent to [**Location (un) **] NPO on TPN for bowel rest in the hope that there would be a redcution in the edema so that a Whipple procedure might be possible.
He states that he then began to have severe, non-bloody diarrhea - up to 20 bowel movements a day.
Per report from the OSH, TPN was switched on [**12-28**] and diarrhea began.
Stools were sent for c.diff and are pending.
Patient was transferred to the ICU for further management fo sepsis   Past Medical History: Pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
CAD , history of MI [**2174**], CABG s/p AICD (followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]) Asthma Hyperlipidemia s/p TURP Diverticulitis Hypertension, benign Hard of hearing, mild Small unbilical hernia  Social History: Smoking: 40 pack year (quit in [**2158**]).
No acute distress.
Eyes: PERRL, no pallor or icterus ENT: Moist oral mucosae.
No ulcers or thrush.
No exudates or erythema.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Peripheral vascular access.
RS: No crackles or wheezes.
Mild tenderness to palpation in RUQ.
No rebound tenderness or guarding.
No masses palpable but limited exam given obesity.
Umbilical hernia seen.
No peripheral LE edema.
Skin: no rashes or ulcers noted.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2181-3-5**] 3:14 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-28**], there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Low lung volumes persist with some opacification at the left base that could represent some combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
ECHO Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or clotis seen in the body of the left atrium.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three mildly thickened aortic valve leaflet with trace aortic regurgitation.
There is no vegetation on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with mild (1+) mitral regurgitation but no vegetation.
No clear vegetation or regurgitation is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valve.
The atrial and ventricular ICD leads are visualized and there are no massess or vegetations on the leads.
The atrial lead terminates in the right atrial appendage.
IMPRESSION: no evidence of endocarditis or myocardial abscess on TEE.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Post-surgical changes of Whipple, with moderate fat stranding in the surgical bed, but no evidence of discrete fluid collection to suggest abscess.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2181-2-22**] 9:03 PM IMPRESSION: Evolution of left hepatic lobe lesion which is now more ill- defined with mixed echogenicity suggests that this was related to acute injury as previously described.
No other focal hepatic lesions.
No biliary ductal dilatation.
Small amount of fluid around the liver edge.
Right pleural effusion incompletely imaged.
A couple of foci of gas are consistent with removal of the drainage catheters, but no new fluid collections identified.
Decrease in size of a left lobe hepatic lesion likely reflecting retractor injury.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Overall decrease in size of the previously noted several small intraabdominal fluid collections.
No new fluid collections are identified.
No significant change in position of the surgical drains as above.
Nonspecific filling defect seen in several loops of small bowel that may be related to enteric feeds.
Findings concerning for anastomotic leak at the hepaticojejunostomy, within the lesser sac.
There is no discrete abscess formation at this time, however there is more gas than expected at six days postoperatively.
Likely retraction injury within the left lobe of the liver, although a developing abscess would be difficult to exclude and clinical assessment as well as close interval followup is advised.
Markedly distended stomach with relatively decompressed small-bowel loops.
Unlined, inflammatory and hemorrhagic cyst with giant cell reaction.
No carcinoma seen.
Compared to prior exam, the inflammatory change surrouding the head of the pancreas is improved and there is slight decrease in the size of the enlarged uncinate process containing tubular cystic structures.
Additionally, the relative contribution of the cystic portion of the mass appears subjectively decreased in size.
Diagnostic consideration for this lesion include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm versus pseudocyst related to prior pancreatitis.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo male with recent pancreatitis from pancreatic CA on TPN sent in for fever and hypotension SBP 70s concerning for sepsis.
Sepsis - currently stable - normotensive, afebrile s/p 2L IVFs, IV vanc, levo and flagyl.
Blood cultures grew out gram positive cocci both here and OSH - send stool studies, inc c.diff toxins A and B - f/u cx from ED - gram pos cocci - f/u cx from OSH - gram pos cocci - continue to monitor for s/sx of sepsis including hypotension, change in mental status and fever.
- CT scan ABD - cont vanc, and flagyl - can now d/c levo as has not grown any gram neg's in 48 hours - surveillance cultures to make sure is clearing infection - consider Echo to r/o endocarditis - goal to keep fluids even, can give IVFs is patient dry or febrile - catheter tip - coag negative staph  .
- multiple cdiff negative, have good reason for diarrhea with bacteremia, will d/c flagyl .
Due to significant inflammation around pancreas, ampulla could not be visualized and brushings could not be obtained.
Duodenal biopsy negative.
- General Surgery consult appreciated - CT ABD - Pain well controlled with dilaudid.
# Hypertension: holding current regimen of amlodipine, lopressor and losartan for now until blood pressures stable.
