Admission Date:  [**2153-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-1-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: I&D of abdominal wall abscess with placement of drainage ostomy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 56684**] is a 80 yo F NH resident with PMHx of DM2, HTN, dementia, POD admitted for a lower abdominal abscess from perforated diverticulosis.
Patient was transferred from OSH for abdominal pain/distention, found to have CT with a possible bladder rupture which turned out to be an abscess.
Past Medical History: dementia HTN diverticulosis GI bleed DM cholescystectomy hysterctomy tonsillectomy   Social History: Unable to obtain due to mental status  Family History: Unable to obtain due to mental status  Physical Exam: NIGHT FLOAT PHYSICAL EXAM Gen: NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
OP clear, no exudates or ulceration, dry MM Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated.
Faint crackles at b/l bases, no rales, wheezes or rhonchi.
Abd: Obese, mildly distended but soft and NT.
No HSM or tenderness.
Ostomy noted in suprapubic region with pink-brown liquid Ext: 2+ edema to bilateral thighs/lower back, 1+ dependent edema b/l upper extremities Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars.
L CVL in place, no surrounding erythema or signs of infxn No JVD CTAB anteriorly but poor lung exam, no labored breathing S1 S2 are regular for a bit then spontaneously break into irregular tachycardia, no murmurs are heard.
She is able to nod yes that she is having pain when abdomen is deeply palpated.
BUE with scattered ecchymosis, but LUE is somewhat larger than RUE and on medial aspect RUE is erythematous macule BLE with pitting edema to just below mid shin.
[**4-12**] EKG Regular supraventricular rhythmn with baseline artifact precluding definitive rhythm analysis, possibly sinus rhythm with diminutive P waves.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Short P-R interval.
Low voltage.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Opacity at the left lung base is probably atelectasis or a very small pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
Accounting for patient rotation, there is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
There is no increase in interstitial markings.
There is extensive subcutaneous air in the left abdominal wall, tracking along the left chest wall.
Left lung base opacity may indicate atelectasis or layering pleural effusion.
Extensive subcutaneous air overlying the left abdominal wall, tracking to the left chest wall.
OSH abdominopelvic CT (reviewed on a separate workstation and not available on [**Hospital1 18**] PACS) demonstrates this to extend from a large abscess in the anterior pelvis.
[**4-15**] EKG Probable atrial fibrillation but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Low precordial lead QRS voltage.
Modest low amplitude T wave changes.
Since the previous tracing of [**2153-4-13**] the rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and substantial left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Moderate left pleural effusion has increased, small to moderate right pleural effusion is new.
Left lower lobe previously collapsed is still consolidated and there is new right infrahilar consolidation which could be atelectasis or developing pneumonia.
Heart size is obscured but mediastinal vasculature is mildly engorged indicative of volume overload or cardiac decompensation.
[**4-24**] RUE U/S IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right arm.
Persistent large abdominal wall hernia with nonobstructed loops of bowel 5.
Increased large pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe collapse.
Na 139 K 4.3 Cl 108 BUN 23 Creat 0.5 Gluc 155 WBC 7.5 Hct 27.3 Platelets 389  Brief Hospital Course: 80 yoF with DM, HTN, dementia, diverticulosis/GIB who was admitted to SICU after found to have perforated diverticulosis/abdominal abscess/fistula which is now s/p drainage/I&D and 3 wk course of vanc/zosyn, whose post-op course complicated by re-intubation for CHF vs aspiration PNA, extubated after diuresis; also with tachy-brady (atrial tach, asymptomatic bradycardia) syndrome and malnutrition.
Respiratory failure: Unclear if truly CHF vs aspiration pneumonia, but pt with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular engorgement reflective of gross volume overload.
She was called out of the ICU and diuresed further, and had no further respiratory issues through admission, was satting well on RA and not tachypneic by discharge.
Abscess: Pt was admitted to SICU septic from abdominal abscess.
Assumed fistula between GI tract, abscess, and skin; however pt not a surgical candidate given poor nutritional state.
Tachy/bradycardia: Pt noted to have runs of narrow complex SVT through SICU and started on Metoprolol; then noted to have bradycardia and beta blockade held.
Off beta blockade, had fewer episodes of bradycardia and noted to have 4.5 second pauses, so transferred to CCU for further monitoring.
After transfer to the CCU, a family meeting was held to discuss the possibility of pacemaker placement, however not consistent with goals of care which are to avoid further interventions and procedures.
Pt was discharged off of her bblocker given risk of bradycardia, and HRs in the low 100s were tolerated.
Mental status: Has baseline dementia with superimposed delirium, although unclear whether this may also be her new baseline mental status.
Nutrition: Pt with low albumin precluding fistula repair.
Discussion of goals of care was held with family and palliative care, who opted for no further interventions to help improve pts nutrition other than supervision while eating and nutritional supplements.
She had an echo while admitted that showed EF 60% but with some evidence of diastolic failure through elevated pulmonary pressure.
She was grossly anasarcatous but unlikely due to CHF, more likely due to poor albumin and overly aggressive volume resuscitation.
Her bblocker was held due to her bradycardia, and simvastatin and asa were dc'd on discharge given newly defined goals of care.
She was discharged on a smaller dose of lasix than what she was taking on admission due to her poor PO intake.
Ostomy contents were guaic and were positive, so likely having chronic slow ooze from GI tract.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate  Inhalation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ruptured abdominal abscess with likely communicating fistula.
Tachy-brady syndrome, s/p pacemaker placement Malnutrition Volume overload/Anasarca Altered mental status   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for septic shock in the setting of a ruptured abdominal abscess.
Please call your doctor if you feel that your pain is not well controlled or you are not comfortable.
