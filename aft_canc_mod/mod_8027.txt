Her post op course was notable for re-intubation in the TICU on [**12-8**] and extubation on [**12-9**].
Shortly following the valvuloplasty, pt developed GI bleed and had a EGD/colonoscopy, which revealed the large cecal mass.

No alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
JVP=12cm LUNGS: bilateral crackles to mid lung bilaterally and upper lung on left, mild diffuse wheeze.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: bilateral mild pitting edema but erythema suggestive of chronic venous stasis.
Healing wounds on lower extremities bilaterally.
TEE ([**2195-12-8**]):Initial exam: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild global biventricular hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
By the end of the procedure there had been no significant changes .
Chest X-Ray ([**2195-12-13**]):FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-12**], there is again substantial cardiomegaly with some [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
The small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again appreciated.
Required ICU monitoring due to extensive cardiac disease.
Early in day, pt had some hypercarbia that improved modestly.
Patient transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] however continued to have persistent hypercarbia, and somnolence.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was transferred for further management of hypercapnia and her volume status.
She was seen by cardiology in consultation who felt that she needed gentle diuresis, and that when she was ready to leave the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] should be transferred to the cardiology service for further management of her volume status.
hypervolemia: patient has known dCHF and systolic dysfuction with EF 45-50%.
In addition, she still has AS with valve area about 0.8.
With fluid boluses for low UOP, strongly suspect cardiogenic edema and hypervolemia.
CXR shows consistent pulmonary edema.
likely from poor forward cardiac flow and prerenal physiology.
hypercapnea:   Thought to be due to increased work of breathing from CHF from her AS and diastolic CHF, Patient likely had mild CO2 retention at baseline as reflected in elevated bicarb on prior labs, acute worsening may have occurred in setting of peri-op sedatives/pain meds, atelectasis and volume overload.
ABGs have been stable throughout course and there was no acute worsening to precipitate ICU transfer, upon arrival to ICU, patient?????
Cardiology Course:  Patient was transferred to the cardiology service on [**2195-12-12**] for further management of her volume status.
#) Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: most recent echo from [**11-3**] showed diastolic dysfunction with an overall preserved EF.
Based on clinical exam with findings of crackles in her lungs, LE edema and CXR with volume overload, she likely received too much fluid in the setting of post-op low urine output.
She was diuresed with with IV lasix as needed with a goal of taking off about 1L per day for to help maintain her BP since she is very preload dependent with her severe AS, with most recent valve area of 0.8cm2.
At rehab she should receive LASIX 40 IV BID AND BE EVALUATED DAILY IN TERMS OF VOLUME STATIS.
She should NOT be given lasix if her systolic blood pressure is under 100 as she has severe aortic stenosis.
If given IV lasix she should have her electrolytes checked to make sure potassium is above 4 and her magnesium is above 2. urrently she has crackles in her lungs left>right and some wheeze for which she is receiving ipratropium nebs.
She has difficulty completing sentences due to mild SOB.
She also has edema in her LE bilaterally.
As stated above her volume status is very tenuous and needs close monitoring since her AS makes her preload dependent.
#) CAD s/p CABG: currently stable, she was continued on her outpatient regimen of atorvastatin and metoprolol.
Since she has no history of stroke, TIA, DVT or PE she did not have an indication for bridging so she has been on her home coumadin dose, and we have been allowing her INR to increase slowly especially in the post operative setting.
#) Hypercapnia: patient was extubated then reintubated post operatively due to hypercapnia.
After her eventual extubation, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increasing somnolence, which has been improving during her stay.
#) S/P Right Hemicolectomy: patient had a right hemicolectomy for a sessile polyp found on colonoscopy after a GI bleed after her valvulplasty for her severe AS.
Pathology showed low grade adenocarcinoma, per surgery T2N0, so no further treatment needed at this time.
#) Venous Stasis with Ulcerations: patient with chronic venous stasis ulcers, wound care evaluated the patients and provided the following recommendations: Recommendations:  Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines Support surface: Atmos Air Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn Heels off bed surface at all times Waffle Boots to B/L LE's If OOB, limit sit time to one hour at a time and sit on a pressure relief cushion, Gaymar Cushion .
Elevate LE's while sitting as tolerated (has pain due to arthritis) Moisturize B/L LE's, periwound tissue and feet [**Hospital1 **] with Aloe Vesta Moisture Barrier Ointment .
Commercial wound cleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse all open wounds B/L LE's.
Her creatinine continued to improve and was back to her baseline with further diuresis, making the cause of her renal failure likely poor forward flow from volume overload.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Venous stasis ulcers Recommendations: 1.Pressure relief per the following -Support surface: Atmos Air -Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn -Heels off bed surface at all times -Waffle Boots to B/L LE's -If OOB, limit sit time to one hour at a time and sit on a pressure relief cushion, Gaymar Cushion - Elevate LE's while sitting as tolerated (has pain due to arthritis) -Moisturize B/L LE's, periwound tissue and feet [**Hospital1 **] with Aloe -Vesta Moisture Barrier Ointment .
-Commercial wound cleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse all open wounds B/L LE's.
-Apply Aquacel dressings over the wound beds to absorb drainage -Cover with dry gauze, Sofsorb sponge -Secure with tubular stocking (she states she does not tolerate -Kling or Kerlix -Dressing changes were increased to twice daily due to large amounts of drainage on the dressings.
SBP>100 prior to administration (is preload dependent due to severe AS).
She should be on as minimal dose of oxygen as possible to maintain o2 sats between 90-94% BUT NOT HIGHER AS IT CAUSES SOMNOLENCE.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain: Hold for sedation or RR<12.
INR Check pls check INR on [**2195-12-18**] and adjust coumadin dose as needed   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Right hemicolectomy for low grade adenocarcinoma Severe aortic stenosis Diastolic CHF Atrial Fibrillation Hypercapnea Venous stasis ulcers Acute renal failure .
Secondary diagnosis: CAD s/p CABG HTN Hyperlipidemia Glaucoma   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented x3.
After the surgery you required admission to an intensive care unit because you were having trouble with your breathing (due to retaining carbon dioxide which caused sleepiness) and because you needed to have lasix due to having extra fluid in your body.
Three days ago you also had an increased heart rate and you received some extra medications by mouth and by IV to slow your heart rate down.
The following medications were started: digoxin 0.0625mg daily ipratropium neb 1 every 6 hrs prn sob or wheeze Aspirin 81mg daily Colace 100mg twice a day heparin sc 5000 units three times a day oxycodone 5mg po q8hrs prn leg pain- need to monitor for sedation .
