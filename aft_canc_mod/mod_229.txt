Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-1-7**] QRS voltage is decreased, bradycardia is present.
Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass with destruction of the left sacrum.
The involvement of the colon with the tumor is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules, consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
Right ventricle is dilated, mildly hypokinetic, and has elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressure.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Radiology Report LUNG SCAN Study Date of [**2151-9-3**] IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ration for recent pulmonary embolism.
Mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
No contrast is seen passing into the bladder from the distal left ureter.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2151-9-10**] 7:53 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Slight interval increase in right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer admitted for shock/hypotension, bradycardia, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
Hypotension/Shock: The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension, the cause of which was felt to be multifactorial, including hypovolemia, possible urosepsis vs. atenolol overdose in setting of renal failure.
She initially received glucagon drip for possible beta blocker toxicity but bradycardia did not improve.
VQ scan was obtained which showed no evidence of PE and no evidence of tamponade on echo.
Patient was slowly weaned off pressors, although blood pressures never returned to her hypertensive baseline.
She continued to have SBPs in the 80's which were initially responsive to fluid boluses but the patient gradually became persistently hypotensive, especially in the setting of receiving pain medications.
Acute Renal Failure: The patient had chronic kidney disease due to hypertension, with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2 since [**6-15**].
Urine studies gave evidence of ATN with muddy brown casts.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated left sided hydronephrosis and this was ultimately felt to be due to a left sided pelvic mass.
Diarrhea: The patient had a history of c. Diff colitis requiring PO Flagyl.
It was felt that recent XRT and may have caused radiation colitis.
The patient did not have further episodes of diarrhea following admission.
Leukocytosis: Pt was noted to have a chronically elevated WBC count since [**Month (only) 216**].
It was unclear whether this was secondary to infection or malignancy.
Blood smear showed toxic granulations, but only evidence of infection was UTI.
CT ABD/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of inflammation/abscess.
Thrombocytopenia/LLE - The patient was noted to have an acute decrease in platelet count over a few days of hospitalization.
There were no sx of bleeding.
The patient was noted to have significant edema of the left lower extremity and LENIs were positive for an old DVT, there did not appear to be active clot.
No further interventions were made.
Pain Control/Goals of care/End of Life:  The patient had extensive bony metastases from her cervical cancer and she had an established pain control regimen as an outpatient.
On transfer from the ICU, the patient reported [**9-17**] left lower extremity pain and her home pain regimen was reinstated.
However, the patient responded with hypotension and somnolence.
The pain and palliative care service was consulted for assistance managing the balance between mental clarity, pain control and blood pressure.
