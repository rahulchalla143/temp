G0 referred to triage for evaluation of increasing abdominal girth, lower extremity edema.
palpable abdominal masses bilaterally.
She was seen at [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation, and had a transabdominal ultrasound [**1-3**] (pt refused transvaginal u/s) which showed 2 large fundal pedunculated fibroids.
The pt reports that over the past month, she has had increasing abdominal girth and distention - no pain, fevers, bleeding, changes in urination, nausea/vomiting, or any weight changes beyond abdominal girth.
Has had light vaginal spotting x 2 days, but is due for her period.

The left was slightly smaller at 8.8 x 6.8 x 10.6 cm; both lesions had cystic components.
The uterus was unremarkable but there was a massive amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid noted.
Additionally, there was a question of a focus of soft tissue thickening along the anterior/inferior aspect of the body of the stomach.
These findings were concerning for either ovarian cancer or bilateral Krukenberg tumors.
Bilateral lower extremity dopplers were also obtained to rule out DVT given the pt's lower extremity edema which were negative.
Given the question of stomach-thickening on CT scan, GI was consulted to rule out a GI primary prior to proceeding w/ an exploratory laparotomy.
The pt underwent an EGD on HD#2 at which point an ulcerated, fungating and infiltrative mass w/ malignant appearance was noted in the stomach body and cardia.
The heme/onc service was also consulted regarding the pt's condition and, conjointly, the decision was made to take the pt to the OR for a debulking procedure both for symptomatic relief for the pt as well as to decrease her tumor burden for possible chemotherapy and ascertain more definitively the extent of peritoneal disease.
Also, it was felt that if the ovarian metastases were the only areas of extensive disease, then a gastrectomy performed in the near-future may be able to render the pt w/ no evidence of disease.
Approximately 8 liters of ascites were additionally drained intraoperatively.
The pt did receive a large amount of IV fluids intraoperatively, and a CXR obtained in the PACU demonstrated moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
It was felt that the pt's O2 requirement was secondary to volume overload and she was given 10 mg of lasix in the PACU to help reverse this.
The pt was temporarily monitored in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight on POD#0/1 given her O2 requirement but diuresed well and was transferred out on POD#1.
The pt continued to diurese well without any further diuretics necessary and was weaned from O2 completely on POD#3.
