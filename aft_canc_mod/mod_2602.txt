Admission Date:  [**2142-2-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-6-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Vancomycin / Oxycodone / Daptomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Neutropenia and Fever   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] is a delighful 31 year-old female day +229 status post a matched related allogeneic transplant for [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative ALL now in remission.
Her course was complicated by Grade II skin GVHD, and recently new pancytopenia with BM biopsies X 3 negative for leukemia.
It remains unclear whether she has graft failure versus graft rejection.
She has been neutropenic since [**12/2141**], and was on Neupogen which was discontinued yesterday by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].
She now presents with new fever starting last night, with Tmax 100.5 at home.
On ROS, she reports mild rhinorrhea, no sore throat or new cough.
No headache or visual changes.
No urinary complaints.
Some diarrhea yesterday, self-limited, without abdominal pain.
Family History: Significant for an uncle with prostate cancer and another uncle who had neck cancer.
Integument: No petechiae or ecchymoses.
RESP: CTAB, without adventitious sounds.
No murmur or rub.
Pertinent Results: [**2142-2-13**] CT Neck: Possible tiny retropharyngeal fluid collection.
[**2142-2-13**] CT Sinus: Prominence of the nasopharyngeal tissues has evolved, compared with [**2141-7-28**] CT scan of the head.
[**2-13**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2142-2-17**] Skin Left Dorsal Hand: Spongiotic dermatitis with vesiculation and lymphocyte exocytosis (see note).
Small nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
[**2142-2-23**] CT Sinus:  Slightly more extensive mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses, but no air-fluid levels or other change.
[**2142-2-23**] CT Neck: Persistent thickening of the prevertebral and parapharyngeal soft tissues, for which correlation with clinical exam is suggested, as further details are difficult to discern by CT. No discrete fluid collection, however.
[**2142-3-6**] CT Chest: Multiple new tiny pulmonary nodules.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal  [**2142-3-19**] CT Chest: Several tiny pulmonary nodules, which were seen in the previous study, become slightly larger and more numerous.
With given history of neutropenia and fever, the differential diagnosis may include fungal infection such as aspergillosis and nocardia.
[**2142-3-26**] CT Chest: No new or progression of a handful of subcentimeter pulmonary nodules.
Increased small pericardial effusion, no pleural effusion.
[**2142-4-3**] CT Chest: Stable appearance of small pulmonary nodules.
No new nodules identified.
Unresolved small pericardial effusion.
[**2142-4-5**] CT Sinus: Increased paranasal sinus inflammatory changes since [**2142-3-6**].
[**2142-4-9**] CT Chest/Abdomen: Faint tiny bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules, which are different in location than on previous examination.
Nodules seen on prior CT are no longer present.
These findings are more consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process.
Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which overall do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Small pericardial effusion.
No acute intra-abdominal abnormalities identified.
[**2142-4-14**] CXR: No pneumothorax.
No acute pulmonary disease   Brief Hospital Course: 31 year-old female admitted day + 231 status post matched allogeneic transplant for [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative ALL in remission, with febrile neutropenia, no clear source.
ONCOLOGY: ALL/Pancytopenia: Patient had allo transplant ~240 days prior to admission but was found to have low counts and found to have graft loss.
Sent peripheral blood for FISH/XY/chimerism x 3 which showed, 58% XY, 42% XX the first time and 54%XY and 46%XX the second time.
Initially thought this was likely graft rejection, but no underlying cause to explain why this would have occurred 240 days out from transplant (all viral data negative: parvo, adeno, HHV-6, HHV-8, CMV viral load all negative).
Patient given high dose steroids x 3 days in hopes of immunosuppressing to prevent rejection of donor cells.
Patient had stem cell transplant from  brother (donor) [**3-16**] and had pre-treatment with ATG, fludarabine and cytoxan.
Her methotrexate was stopped because of elevated LFTs.
Her counts started to come back around day 10 and patient did well with no pulmonary symptoms.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient was admitted for febrile neutropenia, and had no clear localizing signs or symptoms.
CXR without acute cardiopulmonary process.
Multiple blood cultures and urine cultures obtained and showed no growth.
Viral washings x 2 were sent for rapid respiratory antigens and were negative x 2.
CT sinus was done on [**2-13**] was negative except for soft tissue density in nasopharyngeal region.
Neck CT performed to further delineate and very small retropharyngeal fluid collection was seen.
ENT was consulted, reviewed films with neuroradiology, and felt fluid collection too small to aspirate or to be cause of fevers.
CT of torso negative for acute infection.
Fever curve trended down and patient was afebrile for several days.
Fever curve trended down and was afebrile for several days, then became persistently febrile and was found to have stomatoccocus/micrococcus in one bottle of bcx on [**3-5**].
of small infectious nodules in lung.
Was treated with multiple abx and antifungals for bacteremia with ID input.
She again was afebrile for a few days, but spiked again so Aztreonam and Linezolid were added.
Patient developed a rash during her stay.
Was unclear which drug was causing the rash, but azithromycin, cefepime and dapto were dc'd b/c of concern for rash and it eventually improved.
The patient was getting ready for discharge and had been afebrile for days, when she again began spiking fevers with a diffuse full body rash.
A CT sinus showed diffuse sinutsitis.
Her fevers started to improve around the time of adding double coverage for fungal infections and adding the linezolid.
There was discussion of this being serum sickness (2 weeks after receiving ATG) because complement levels were progressivly going down.
She had no further episodes during hery stay.
The patient was noted to have scleral icterus at that time.
Ambisome could have caused some LFT abnormalities, but LFTs trended down while the patient remained on amiodarone.
Could have been secondary to biliary sludge or possibly GVHD.
Persistent diarrhea: Patient had diarrhea throughout her admission.
She also had persistent nausea.
She was also started on TPN for persistent nausea and poor PO intake.
SCALP: Patient also have GVHD lesions on scalp vs. fungal infection.
The lesions appeared to improve over the course of the admisssion.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please take all of your medications as prescribed 2) Please call your PCP or return to the ED if you have fevers, chills, night sweats, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that are of concern to you.
