Admission Date:  [**2137-12-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2138-1-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-10-13**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old female with past medical history of thymic cancer, status post resection at [**Hospital6 1129**] in [**2125**]; status post chemotherapy times 18 sessions, who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] office after having undergone a work-up of her dysphagia for one month's duration.
The patient found that she was having difficulty swallowing which was progressively worsening over the course of one month.
The patient denies having any hematemesis.
Over a course of six months prior to admission, the patient reported having a 12 pound weight loss.
The patient denied having any other symptoms such as fever, chills, diaphoresis, chest pain; denied having other significant pulmonary symptoms.
Despite reporting history of chronic right sided pleural effusion, status post radiation therapy for thymic cancer.
On [**2137-11-22**], the patient presented to [**Hospital6 2121**], the place of her usual health care, and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a "concerning lesion at the proximal esophagus."
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As noted above, significant for thymic cancer, diagnosed in [**2125**].
The patient also reports a significant history of Crohn's disease for eight years, relatively well controlled on Asacol.
The patient has a history of hypertension and aortic stenosis.
Last echocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1130**] showed "moderate aortic stenosis."
The patient's past medical history is also significant for osteoporosis, tinnitus and history of colonic polyps seen on colonoscopy in [**2129**].
The patient also has a history of vitiligo and a history of seizures versus syncope, a total of two episodes, the last episode in [**2136-5-2**], for which she was evaluated at [**University/College 4700**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned above, status post thymus resection in [**2125**] for thymic cancer.
The patient also reports lumbar fusion and surgery in [**2113**].
The patient denies any known allergies to medications.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Patient reports her mother having died of complications of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Father also had emphysema and had hypertension and died at the age of 86.
The slide was reviewed by the pathology staff at [**Hospital1 190**] which concurred with the diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
This was a high risk procedure due to the prior operation and radiation and comorbidities, but other options were very limited.
Cardiovascular examination:  Rate and rhythm were regular with S1 and S2, in mild sinus tachycardia, with grade III out of VI systolic ejection murmur, heard greatest in the aortic area.
Respiratory examination:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, despite given history of chronic right sided pleural effusion.
Examination of the chest showed a well healed median sternotomy site with a small amount of scarring.
Abdominal examination was with bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, without evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient did not have any inguinal hernias and the rectal examination was negative for occult blood.
There were no gross anomalies in sensory modalities and the upper and lower extremities were with full range of motion with bilaterally equal 5/5 strength.
The patient's preoperative radiologic studies showed right sided chronic pleural effusion.
Please see the operative report for specific details.
While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, on postoperative day number zero, the patient was found to have CVP of 2; slight decrease from the baseline of 6 to 9, and decrease in the urine output, trailing from 100 cc per hour to 30 cc per hour.
The patient was assessed to be volume depleted and was given lactated Ringers solution bolus with elevation in blood pressure to 100 systolic.
The patient was noted to be in respiratory distress by the nursing staff.
The patient was examined by the anesthesia resident and was found to have a left vocal cord in paramedian position and the right vocal cord fully extended out.
Chest x-ray done showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
The patient was also cycled with cardiac enzymes, to rule out myocardial events.
Electrocardiogram done at the time also did not show any evidence of myocardial ischemia.
The patient was seen by the ENT team for the finding of left vocal cord paralysis seen on intubation the day prior.
However, it wasn't clear whether this was a new finding after the surgery given her prior history of thymic resection.
However, she was found to have increased shortness of breath during the night of postoperative day number one.
The patient became tachycardiac with sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram; however, she was found to have a new right bundle branch block.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay ranged from [**2137-12-22**] to [**2138-1-9**] and the Intensive Care Unit course will be summarized by systems as follows:  Neurologic:  The patient's postoperative pain was initially addressed with epidural combination of Bupivacaine and Dilaudid; however, this was turned off with ensuing events in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and the patient's Dilaudid was split off from the epidural and was administered with PCA.
The patient was treated with low dose intravenous Lopressor, given the nature of the surgery and the propensity for development of atrial fibrillation postoperatively.
The patient had occasional low grade tachycardia which was attributed to other issues going on during her Intensive Care Unit stay.
The patient did rule out of myocardial infarction with four different troponin levels less than 0.01.
In terms of electrocardiogram, the patient was noted to have right bundle branch block which was new prior to her Intensive Care Unit admission.
There was also a left anterior fascicular block that was noted on the previous electrocardiogram noted [**2137-12-12**].
Respiratory:  The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay involved events and issues mostly involving her respiratory system and is summarized below.
However, on postoperative day number three, [**12-24**], the patient was again found to have respiratory distress.
The patient's pressure support was weaned down further and the patient was gently diuresed with intravenous Lasix drip given her positive volume status through this time on postoperative day number six, [**2137-12-26**].
However, during that day, the patient was found to have respiratory distress with clear stridor and tachypnea.
The patient was put on increased oxygen with improvement in saturation; however, because the patient was breathing with much significant amount of work, the patient underwent a direct laryngoscopy which showed the same findings as prior with paramedian position of the left vocal cord and a subglottic edema that was visible.
Also on [**2137-12-27**], postoperative day number seven, the patient was noted to have changed in the quality of her right sided chest tube with suspicion for chylothorax.
The patient received a #7 Por-Tex trach tube for failure to be weaned off the vent and respiratory distress requiring reintubation three times postoperatively.
On [**2137-12-30**], postoperative day number 10 and 1, the patient's right sided chest tube fell out accidentally; however, there were no respiratory complications resulting from that event and there was no pneumothorax seen on the chest x-ray.
From then on to the end of her Intensive Care Unit stay, on [**2138-1-9**], the patient did not have any significant respiratory issues.
The patient did experience occasional subjective shortness of breath, associated with tachypnea and tachycardia, which resolved with aggressive chest physical therapy and good tracheostomy care.
The patient tolerated having trach mask and, on transfer to the floor on [**2138-1-9**], the patient tolerated being on trach mask, breathing spontaneously without respiratory difficulty.
As noted above, also on that day, the patient's right sided chest tube accidentally fell out; however, there was no pneumothorax noted and the right sided chylothorax persisted with drainage out of the former chest tube site, in excess of 700 cc per day.
With continuing chylothorax, the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2138-1-3**] by the thoracic surgery team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] for right sided thoracoscopy with evacuation of pleural effusion and talc pleurodesis.
However, there was no obvious point of leakage of chyle from the surgical site and some oozing from around the area of the aortic arch was noted.
The patient succesfully underwent a right sided VATS with evacuation of pleural effusion and talc pleurodesis and replacement of the right sided chest tube on [**2138-1-3**].
On transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2138-1-9**], the patient's right sided chest tube continued to be relatively high but no longer was chylous, with a very low lymphocyte count and triglyceride level.
this seemed to be a pure lymph leak from disruption of the multiple collaterals which had formed following her radiation.
There was an episode of urinary tract infection to be described in detail under the infectious disease section, which was treated appropriately with antibiotics and resolved.
There was no evidence of acute bleeding.
There was no evidence of active bleeding and no evidence of oozing from the surgical sites.
The patient did have red blood cells that were noted coming out of the pleural fluid and there were concerns that the patient may be having hemolysis and DIC.
The patient's laboratory values were checked and there were no indications that the patient was having DIC or had been in septic shock.
After that point, the patient did not require any blood product transfusion.
On [**2138-1-7**], the patient was noted to have right upper extremity swelling and received ultrasound of the right upper extremity.
The patient was found to have a non occlusive thrombus involving the right internal jugular vein, which was the site of a previous central venous line.
The current central venous line at that time was located in the right subclavian vein and did not have any evidence of thrombosis.
Infectious disease:  When the patient's chylothorax was noted on [**2138-12-28**], postoperative day number seven, the pleural fluid was also sent off for gram stain and culture, with positive urine culture.
Gram stain showed 3+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no micro organisms.
The culture did grow out Staphylococcus coagulase negative species and alphastreptococci; however, given that the patient did not have any rise in white blood cell count and did not show any evidence of infection on physical examination, these findings were credited to be contaminants.
However, the patient did have a rise in white count on [**1-1**], postoperative day number [**11-4**] with jump in white count from 9 to 15.
The patient was pan cultured and her urine was found to grow pan sensitive E. coli and enterococcus species.
The patient blood culture, also from the same day, showed Staph coagulase negative; however, this was considered a contaminant, given that the catheter tip was negative.
The pleural fluid was recultured on [**2138-1-2**], which showed pan sensitive enterococcus, staph coagulase negative species and bacterium species as well as a probable micrococcus species.
Also, by this time, the urine culture from [**1-1**], came back with E. coli and Enterococcus and the patient was started on intravenous Levaquin and intravenous Vancomycin.
The patient received a full course treatment of Levaquin for her urinary tract infection and continued on her Vancomycin through her stay in Intensive Care Unit.
During those times, the patient did not have any fevers and did not exhibit any signs of sepsis.
Repeat cultures done after [**1-2**] were negative for any micro organisms with negative blood cultures on [**1-3**], [**1-5**] and negative catheter tip culture on [**1-5**] as well.
The patient's urine was negative for microorganisms on [**1-5**] and despite negative cultures, the patient continued to have elevated white count of 16 on discharge from Intensive Care Unit.
With the patient having been stable for some time, without further respiratory issues after her tracheostomy, was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2138-1-9**].
However, the second talc pleurodesis was not effective and the patient continued to have relatively high chest tube output.
The patient's right sided chest tube output was matched cc per cc by intravenous fluids/total parenteral nutrition and the patient was maintained relatively euvolemic with only minimal pedal edema on physical examination.
She was found to have some tachycardia on [**2138-12-12**] without evidence of respiratory distress.
Because her levels had only increased mildly to 76 despite having been on tube feeds, she was slowly advanced.
As mentioned above, the patient was noted to be tachycardia in 110's despite any respiratory distress.
The patient also was started on Levaquin on [**2138-1-12**] for suspicion of aspiration pneumonia.
The gram stain initially showed 3+ gram negative rods; 1+ gram positive cocci in pairs and 1+ gram positive rods; however, the final culture only grew out sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Repeat urine culture on [**1-15**] showed a 10 to 100,000 organisms per cc of yeast as well as sputum culture which showed rare growth of yeast.
The patient was found to have leakage of clear, serous, pleural fluid around the former chest tube site; however, the patient remained afebrile with vital signs stable with very mild tachycardia.
The patient was not in apparent distress at the time.
Given the patient's persistent elevated white count, despite being on Vancomycin, Levaquin and Fluconazole, other source of infection were investigated.
However, given the elevated white count, the patient did receive a right upper quadrant ultrasound to rule out any gallbladder disease and she did not have any evidence of cholecystitis.
The infectious disease service also recommended ruling out for Clostridium difficile colitis, despite no evidence of abdominal pain or distention and this was started.
As per patient's request, the patient was suctioned three times and was found to have minimal secretions.
Early in the morning of [**2138-1-18**], the patient was found by nursing staff to be unresponsive during early morning rounds for vitals check.
At that time, the patient was cyanotic without heart rate, apneic and without blood pressure.
Automatic external defibrillator was applied.
The patient was given an amp of Atropine and an amp of epinephrine with continued ventilation and chest compression.
