History of Present Illness: 62M with NSCCa in R bronchus with recent massive hemoptysis.
Patient also has C. diff colitis.
He was admited to [**Hospital 1727**] medical center on [**2101-3-29**] with 2 wk h/o hemoptysis and COPD exacerbation.
Patient had flex bronch that showed mass in right mainstem bronchus.

Soft tissue thickening and nodularity of anterior wall proximal right main bronchus with nonobstructive luminal narrowing.
In a patient with history of lung cancer, this is concerning for endobronchial neoplasm involvement.
However, if the patient has had prior stent placement or other intervention, granulation tissue is an additional consideration.
Abrupt cut off of the proximal right lower lobe bronchus, possibly due to previous surgery for right lower lobe resection for lung cancer.
Correlation with operative history is recommended to differentiate truly obstructed bronchus from postoperative change.
Extensive abdominal ascites and mild anasarca.
KUB [**4-12**] IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated air-filled loops of large bowel, consistent with colonic ileus.
No evidence of obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**State 1727**] and on HD#2, underwent right mainstem bronchus stenting as a way to treat his malignant obstruction and hemoptysis.
The patient was hypotensive through the procedure requiring pressors and and also had transient episodes of hypoxemia.
The patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated, and a stat trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed showing severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP estimated at 101mmHg), severe hypokinesis of the RV / septum, no evidence of shunt, and a relatively normal LV.
He was found to have C. difficile colitis without signs of toxic megacolon, and was treated with IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin.
During extensive conversations with both the family and the patient, it was again reiterated that he wanted no surgery or no extraordinary measures to save his life.
