There is no intraconal or intraaxial cerebral extension.
Given the clinical history obtained from the online medical record of prior facial laceration and infectious symptoms, as well as the rapid development of symptomatology, this most likely represents chronic aggressive infection- fungal or indolent bacterial, with or without a foreign body reaction.
The differential diagnosis includes Langerhans cell hisitiocytosis or round cell tumor or rhabdomyosarcoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2186-7-19**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval left frontal craniotomy.
Post-surgical changes underlying the left retro-orbital region, with pneumocephalus and a thin rim of hyperdense material consistent with blood products.
Heterogeneous attenuation material with mottled lucencies ( series 2, im 8 and 9) within the region of the prior retro- orbital lesion is possibly consistent with packing material or foci of air in the soft tissues, though correlation with operative note and close interval follow-up is advised to exclude retained material.
Small subdural hemorrhage is noted in the elft frontal and parietal regions.
There is no significant intraparenchymal hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Residual osseous destruction is again seen involving the left lateral orbit and left frontal bone.
Orbits are incompletely assessed on this study, though the degree of mass effect upon the left extraocular muscles and globe appears reduced compared to MRI performed one day prior.
Status post craniotomy and wash out of left retro-orbital lesion.
Expected postoperative changes, with pneumocephalus and small peripheral blood products.
Heterogeneous material within the surgical bed likely represents packing material or air in the soft tissues related to the procedure.
Persistent osseous destruction involving the left lateral orbital wall and frontal bone.
There is apparent decreased mass effect upon the left orbital contents.
Small subdural hemorrhage along the left vertex.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 23M in good health, s/p MVA in [**5-4**], w/ left frontal laceration, left black eye; noticed a few weeks afterwards to have left periorbital swelling; treated with erythromycin drops, which made it better; swelling recurred, w/proptosis and left retroorbital pain.
An MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.1-cm lesion within the left retroorbital space and middle cranial fossa, adjacent soft tissues, laterally and into infratemporal fossa, and preseptal soft tissues, with osseous destruction invovling sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] and intraorbital extension causing mass effect upon the rectus muscles, optic nerve and globe.
Interop cultures and tissue pathology suspicious for old abscess; final microbiology cultures and tissue pathology is pending at this time.
Patient was also diagnosed with a right upper extremity DVT =, aspirin and heparin started.
On [**7-28**] sutures were removed and skeletal survery showed no additional tumor sites.
His DVT is being controlled with coumadin, upper extremity doppler scan showed improvement of clot in SVC and stable right basilic clot.
Hydromorphone 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Headache.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
