HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple myeloma who was - on the day of admission - day 41 status post a matched unrelated nonmyeloablative allogenic transplant.
His initial presenting complaint was shortness of breath and cough.
The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the Fall of [**2143**] when a bone marrow biopsy revealed myeloma with hypercellular marrow with 66 percent plasma cells.
Post transplant course was complicated by acute graft-versus-host disease of the gastrointestinal tract, congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly, and renal insufficiency.
A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate on day plus 30 showed extensive involvement by plasma cell myeloma.
He was subsequently tapered rapidly off his Neoral, which he tolerated without any acute exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease.
On [**2147-5-31**], he presented to clinic with increasing shortness of breath and an increased nonproductive cough.
A repeat computer tomography of the chest was obtained which revealed a linear opacity in the right middle lobe that was felt to be either focal atelectasis versus focal pneumonia as well as an increased size of pleural-based soft tissue lesions.
ALLERGIES:  KEFLEX (which caused nausea and dizziness).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general,  the patient was a pale and ill-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.
Skin revealed there were no rashes.
The lungs had crackles at the right base.
Poor air movement throughout.
There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The chest revealed no tenderness to palpation over the sternum or the anterior ribs.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
The extremities revealed there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
No calf tenderness.
Back revealed there was costovertebral angle tenderness.
No vertebral tenderness.
Mild tenderness to palpation over the right posterior ribs.
An increased opacity in the right middle lobe; called as focal atelectasis versus pneumonia.
An echocardiogram from [**2147-5-22**] revealed left atrium and right atrium moderately dilated.
Left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  PULMONARY ISSUES:  His initial presenting complaint was cough, mild shortness of breath, and a concern of a right middle lobe process.
He was treated with Levaquin initially; however, early on became febrile and was changed to therapy with cefepime.
He was continued on treatment with cefepime and Levaquin with minimal change in fever curve or symptoms.
There was a discussion over the patient undergoing a bronchoscopy; however, prior to that happening, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate with resulting hypotension and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Thus, voriconazole was initiated for concern over a possible fungal etiology.
On [**2147-6-5**], the patient had a repeat computed tomography scan of the chest which showed an interval decrease in the right middle lobe infiltrate with no new consolidations.
Due to this radiographic improvement, it was felt that holding off on bronchoscopy was advisable, and the patient was continued on Levaquin and voriconazole alone.
Thus, it was decided to complete a course of antibiotics as there was still no clear indication of the etiology of this right middle lobe process.
Throughout the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he continued to have a nonproductive cough as well as to be tachypneic.
However, he remained afebrile to the date of this summary.
The Renal team was consulted to help with interpreting this, and they felt that this represented a chronic respiratory alkalosis, and that the low bicarbonate was compensation for that and did not represent a primary metabolic acidosis.
The Renal and Pulmonary teams worked together to develop a differential diagnosis which included hypoxia; such as secondary to a pulmonary embolism, a central process such as a cerebrovascular accident, or meningitis/encephalitis, and medication.
The suspicion for a pulmonary embolism was low given his pO2 of 100 on room air, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was undesirable given the patient's increased creatinine, and a V/Q scan would not be a good study given the soft lesions.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed no cerebrovascular accident or evidence of basilar meningitis.
A lumbar puncture was performed to explore the potential of a central nervous system infection or an infiltration by his myeloma given this respiratory alkalosis as well as due to new onset somnolence (as will be described below).
The cytology revealed plasma cytoid cells, but it was felt to not be diagnostic of multiple myeloma.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient did have a history of atrial fibrillation.
During his course he had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate with resultant hypotension requiring overnight stays in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Following that, the patient became somnolent, and one of the possibilities included high doses of amiodarone.
Eventually, the amiodarone was stopped due to the patient's dysphagia and inability to swallow pills.
Eventually, a nasogastric tube was placed and the medications were being given down the nasogastric tube at 400 mg a day, but subsequently - on [**6-20**] - the patient developed atrial fibrillation again with a rapid ventricular rate; again causing hypotension.
SOMNOLENCE ISSUES:  As mentioned above, following the patient's amiodarone load on [**6-4**] he became somnolent.
It was unclear if this was related to an infection, or a medication such as amiodarone, or being over liberal with Ativan for nausea.
As discussed above, a lumbar puncture was performed due to the concern of a central process causing tachypnea as well as somnolence.
It was felt it could be an aseptic meningitis due to medication versus due to multiple myeloma, and it was never clear if the cerebrospinal fluid findings corresponding to the patient's somnolence; as over a number of days, with the titration of his amiodarone and the holding of his Ativan dosing, the patient's mental status returned to baseline.
A swallow study was performed which revealed major deficits in swallowing, putting the patient at very high risk for aspiration of even his own secretions.
It was recommended that he be completely nothing by mouth including medications, and that a Neurology consultation be obtained.
They felt there were cranial nerve abnormalities that accounted for the dysphagia and the speaking difficulties that the patient was having.
Their differential included soft tissue lesions at the base of the skull compressing the cranial nerves at they exit the skull versus cerebrospinal fluid involvement by multiple myeloma, and less likely a paraneoplastic syndrome.
Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans of the base of the skull revealed no evidence for lesions compressing the cranial nerves.
There were plans for a repeat lumbar puncture; however, this was held off due to the fact that the patient had a soft tissue lesion located at L3, and there was concern for seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid or for getting a false-positive result on the lumbar puncture.
It was eventually decreased to use empiric radiation therapy to the base of the skull to treat possible basilar meningitis or any compressive lesions not able to be seen by imaging.
NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND DIARRHEA ISSUES:  Early in the patient's course, he had high-volume diarrhea as well as frequent nausea and vomiting.
However, biopsies revealed evidence of graft-versus-host disease.
BACK PAIN ISSUES:  The patient with baseline back pain on admission; however, it became more and more severe leading to a magnetic resonance imaging of the spine which revealed metastatic disease in all visualized bones with soft tissue masses at T10-T11 and C11 with collapse of T7, and soft tissue masses at L3, but no cord compression, as well as a questionable pathologic fracture of the coccyx and sacrum.
The patient's pain was managed with a Dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia.
He Fentanyl patch had been stopped due to a theoretical risk of asystole with amiodarone and Fentanyl.
MULTIPLE MYELOMA ISSUES:  Despite a falling IgG level and a relative stability in the patient's blood counts, there was evidence for extensive worsening of his myeloma including the metastatic bone disease and questionable central nervous system involvement (as discussed above).
The patient was therefore started on further chemotherapy with Velcade and Decadron, and there was discussion as to the possibility of eventual donor liver site infusion.
In the setting of the rapid ventricular rate and the high risk for aspiration, it was felt that an aspiration pneumonia could be contributing so he was started on a course of Levaquin and Flagyl.
He was due for his dose of pamidronate, and this was given on [**6-21**] with good results.
PANCREATITIS ISSUES:  Due to abdominal pain, the patient's amylase and lipase were checked - which were found to be elevated.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient with mild diastolic and systolic dysfunction shown on the echocardiogram.
He had evidence of fluid overload including crackles in S4 and elevated jugular venous pressure, but diuresis was difficult due to his tendency to go back into atrial fibrillation when he became dry as well as a tentative blood pressure.
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  After the hypotension following his first episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, a cortisol stimulation test was performed.
