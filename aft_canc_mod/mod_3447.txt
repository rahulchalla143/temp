Since discharge she has developed progressively worsening lower extremity pain and shortness of breath, especially with exertion.
LENIs demonstrated bilateral DVTs.
Because of her h/o variceal bleeding and guaiac positive stool, plan was made for IVC filter placement.
After discussing with the oncology service, plan was made for admission to ICU overnight for closer monitoring, no anticoagulation and CTA and IVC filter implantation in the morning.
Also in clinic, note was made of increasing abdominal distension.
She is also having worsening diarrhea, and metronidazole was started on top of vancomycin PO for C. difficile associated diarrhea.

[**2177-2-10**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process .
An appropriate spot was marked in the right lower quadrant for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical team.
US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2177-2-19**] 1:00 PM FINDINGS: There is a large amount of ascites present.
Review of the CT scan of [**2177-2-6**] shows evidence of a biliary stent in place, pneumobilia, and mild-to-moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Ultrasound examination done today confirms the presence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation, the degree of dilatation is mild.
Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P (updated): 36F PMH metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal varices with h/o variceal bleed, recent admit for ascending cholangitis and GNR bacteremia presents with BLE DVT and PE, worsening diarrhea, and worsening abdominal distension.
# Hypotension: likely related to hypovolemia as below.
She was likely third-spacing much of the volume given during fluid resuscitation: ascites, anasarca, complicated by poor nutrition and protein loss in ascites and ascitic fluid removal which was performed to relieve abdominal discomfort.
# Renal failure: She developed renal failure likely from hypoperfusion from low intravascular volume (see above).
# Abdominal distension: Repeated re-accumulation of ascitic fluid due to portal hypertension and peritoneal studding.
RUQ US shows complete occlusion of right portal vein and partial occlusion of main portal vein.
She received a peritoneal drain port for symptomatic care.
She continued to be uncomfortable at the port site and also continued to leak fluid from other previous paracentesis sites.
Drainage of ascitic fluid resulted in large fluid shifts and resuccitation with IVF --> interstitial space edema.
# Anemia: Unclear cause, likely anemia [**3-15**] inflammatory block - no hemoptysis, hematochezia.
DIC and hemolysis labs wnl.
Likely due to inflammatory state from metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and recent infections.
Asymptomatic at rest but tachycardic to 150s with ambulation to bathroom, likely from poor reserve.
No signs of right heart strain by EKG.
EGD [**2177-2-12**] showed 4 cords of [**3-16**] grade esophogeal varices not bleeding, gastropathy, and metastasis in 2nd portion of duodenum.
# diarrhea: She had considerable diarrhea during her stay.
She had long course of vancomycin PO and no recent positive stool.
She was given stool bulking agents for symptomatic care.
# Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: Before admission, she had undergone only one cycle of palliative chemotherapy because of her multiple complications.
She was eventually made CMO given her very poor prognosis and overall decline.
