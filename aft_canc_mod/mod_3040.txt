Admission Date:  [**2179-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-12-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: direct admit for work up of pulmonary nodules  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: * Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female with a h/o myocardial infarction ([**4-12**] s/p stents now on ASA/[**Month/Year (2) **]) who is s/p matched unrelated allogeneic BMT for acute monocytic leukemia 3 years ago who presents for work-up of pulmonary nodules found on CT scan at OSH.
Her transplant course was complicated by grade 1 acute graft versus host disease of the skin as well as acute renal failure.
Reportedly, following her transplant, she developed chronic graft versus host disease of the GI tract, lungs and eyes.
She was admitted for this in [**State 1727**] one month ago and has felt to have a component of diastolic heart dysfuntion with an elevated BNP in the 400's.
PFT's performed at that time revealed a significant obstructive defect with mininal response to bronchodilators felt consistent with interstitial lung disease.
Since this time, she notes that her symptoms have been worsening with increasing more rapidly.
Now, she becomes SOB walking approximately 100ft or climbing [**4-14**] steps.
She has also developed some pain on deep inspiration at her left costal margin.
Because of these findings, there was concern for Aspergillus, and she was subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 18**] given the majority of her care is under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**].
* At the time of admission, the denies any fevers, chills, change in weight or appetite over the past several months.
She reports persistent nausea as well as bouts of constipation interspersed with diarrhea.
She has also had a persistent ulceration in her right upper buccal mucosa which has not healed despite a course of famvir and oral diflucan.
She additionally has been followed for persistent conjunctivitis believed to be ocular GVHD.
She reports a sensation of facial pressure but denies any nasal drainage, visual or hearing changes, headache, dizziness, or any focal neurologic symptoms.
Past Medical History: 1) Acute monomyelocytic leukemia s/p allo-MUD transplant 3 years    ago as above.
4) Intersitial lung disease 5) Diastolic heart dysfunction  Social History: Lives in [**State 1727**], smoked 1 PPD x 30 years but quit in [**4-12**] after having MI, denies any ETOH or drug abuse.
HEENT: PERRL, mild bilateral scleral injection sparing the [**Doctor First Name 2281**], oropharynx significant for a 2cm ulceration with minimal whitish exudate in the left upper buccal mucosa.
CV: RRR, no m,r,g RESP: bilateral late expiratory wheezes in the lower lung zones, otherwise CTA, poor aeration ABD: Obese, firm, non-tender, no appreciable HSM.
EXT: lower extremities show scant proximal muscle mass, 1+ pedal edema to above the ankle bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: * Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female 3 years s/p matched related allogeneic BMT AML now severely immunosuppressed, who presented with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in the setting of persitently worsening dyspnea on exertion and brown-rust colored sputum.
Therefore, opportunistic infections were considered on admission.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initially started on Ambisome for empiric coverage of fungal infection such as aspergillus.
The tissue biopsy obtained during VATS was negative; however, the BAL was positive for Aspergillus.
Follow up CT scans of the chest showed findings consistent with invasive aspergillosis.
The patient also has chronic pain on top of this acute pain for which she takes a very low dose of MSIR as an outpatient.
The acute pleuritic pain was on the same side of the VATS, so it was thought to be post-procedural pain, possibly from nerve injury.
She also had an effusion and pleural thickening, so it may have been pain due to pleural inflammation related to the VATS.
A CTA was performed on [**11-28**] which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
The Pulmonary Service was consulted and their impression was that her pleuritic pain was due to post-procedural pleural inflammation.
The patient was started on Ibuprofen 400 mg PO BID and her pain significantly improved.
* 3) MUCOSAL ULCER: The patient had an oral ulcer on admission, which was thought to be secondary to graft vs. host disease.
At one point, this ulcer became worse and appeared to have an exudate.
* 4) EDEMA: The patient had swelling in her left upper and bilateral lower extremities.
She had been net positive since admission (up 10 pounds), therefore likely it was thought to be due to fluid overload.
There was also concern for CHF given the patient had an MI in [**4-12**], and there was no echo on file since [**11-11**].
The lower extremity edema was likely due to GVHD.
A left upper extremity doppler U/S was also performed for the finding of unilateral upper extremity edema.
This study was positive for a left IJ clot.
She was not anticoagulated due to her high risk for bleeding given cavitary lung nodules due to invasive aspergillus.
* 5) ERYTHEMATOUS LEFT FOREARM RASH: During her hospitalization, the patient had redness on her left forearm.
This was concerning for cellulitis.
* 6) CAD: The patient has a history of MI in [**2179-4-10**].
On [**11-30**], the patient had had increased secretions and poor O2 saturation.
A repeat CXR was performed and showed a worsening RML pneumonia.
Over the next 48 hours, she had several more episodes of desaturation.
Eventually, the patient had episode of desaturation requiring 100% non-rebreather to maintain saturation in the mid 90's.
* ICU course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress with an increasing O2 requirement, felt to be secondary to an aspiration event.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was unable to intubated because of significant upper airway anatomical obstruction from her GvHD, so an emergent tracheostomy was performed.
)Respiratory failure -- Multiple factors were felt to contribute, including aspiration, GvHD/capillary leak syndrome, invasive aspergillois, and decreased chest wall compliance (from GvHD/anasarca/obesity).
For aspiration, she was intially treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, though this was stopped because of thrombocytopenia and vancomycin.
With antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and decreasing sedation/positive pressure, these were both weaned off, and she was able to maintain adequate pressures on her own.
She had severe third-spacing, and after a family discussion, she was made comfort measures only.
