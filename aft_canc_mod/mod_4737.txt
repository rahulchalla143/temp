She was taken back to [**Hospital3 **] where a head CT showed a Right extraaxial bleed, likely a SDH.
A-fib 2. diabetes 3. asthma 4. platelet disorder   Social History: Unknown  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On Admission: O: T: 97.9 BP: 121/40 HR: 98  R 15  Neck: In hard collar Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
no significant midline shift.
small SDH along anterior falx  CT C spine [**11-16**]  no acute fracture or malalignment  CT Head [**11-16**] Interval increase in size and extent of the right parietal extra-axial collection, in a configuration concerning for epidural (or combined epidural and subdural) hematoma.
No new or impending herniation.
CT Head [**11-17**] Overall stable appearance of right parietal collection, concerning for epidural or combined epidural/subdural hematoma with possible foci of subarachnoid extension.
Stable small subdural hemorrhage along the anterior falx.
CT Head [**11-18**] No significant short-interval changes.
Large, but stable right extra-axial hemorrhage, with minimal subarachnoid extension.
No intraventricular hemorrhagic extension.
No new foci of intracranial hemorrhage.
No developing hydrocephalus  CT Head [**11-19**] Stable right extra-axial hemorrhage, with little change since the prior study.
Minimal subarachnoid extension and a small area of subdural hematoma along the anterior right falx is unchanged.
Small amount of layering hemorrhage within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is also unchanged.
No new acute hemorrhage.
Enlarging lenticular extra-axial collection along the right frontoparietal convexity.
This likely represent an epidural hematoma which is enlarging.
Slightly enlarging subdural hematoma along the right frontotemporoparietal convexity.
Subarachnoid blood products in the right frontal and parietal sulci are more extensive on MRI than they have been on prior CT with edema involving the adjacent gyri.
Bilateral intraventricular blood products layering in the occipital horns.
Overall, the ventricular size has not changed dramatically since the prior study of four days earlier, and there is no new hydrocephalus.
Evidence of underlying chronic small vessel ischemic disease within the white matter of both hemispheres.
EEG [**11-21**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to the presence of mild generalized background slowing and focal attenuation over the right fronto-central region.
The background slowing is consistent with mild encephalopathy, which can be caused by toxic-metabolic derangement, infection or medications  [**11-24**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of extra-axial hematoma with no new associated mass effect.
brain infarction, MRI is more sensitive for detection of this pathological process.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is somewhat less distinct grey-white matter differentiation in the right cerebral hemisphere, compared to the prior CT study, which could indicate persistent, subarchnoid blood products (seen on the prior MR study), and possibly an admixture of minimal brain edema.
[**Date range (1) 41989**] EEG: Negative for seizures  CXR [**2130-11-26**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube is just 1.5 cm away from the carina.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged mild left basal atelectasis.
No pleural effusions.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia  CXR [**2130-11-28**] Mild atelectasis persists at both lung bases.
Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged.
ET tube, with the chin elevated is only 25 mm above the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm for optimal placement.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
She was given 1 unit of platelets for her thrombocytopenia and repeat laboratory studies showed increase in platelet count to 82,000 consistent with goal platelet count greater than 80,000.
Her cervical collar was removed on [**11-16**] when CT C spine showed no fracture or malalignment and she had no c spine tenderness to palpation.
A repeat CT head on the morning of [**11-16**] showed slight increase in size of right sided subdural hematoma and she remained in the ICU for further care including q1 neurochecks.
On [**11-17**], patient was noted to have increased expressive aphasia.
On examination, patient was a&ox3 with prompting and 5-/5 weakness noted in the LUE, otherwise full throughout.
On [**11-19**], she was aphasic, MRI showed no major infarcts and her CT was stable with no changes.
EEG showed continuous seizure activity so the patient was transferred to the surgical ICU and was intubated and sedated.
On [**11-20**] EEG showed no seizure activity.
On [**11-23**] patient's exam improved and patient was extubated but failed and was re intubated due to stridor.
On [**2132-11-25**] her exam improved and the ICU began weaning down her vent settings and she was extubated on [**11-26**], but was unable to maintain her airway and was re intubated.
On [**11-26**] her 48hr EEG was negative for seizure activity.
Overnight, patient became hypotensive and tachycardic.
She remained in the step down unit for management of copious secretions.
Dilantin level corrected to 12 from 7.5 in the setting of low albumin level of 2.6.
Medications on Admission: Unknown  Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
