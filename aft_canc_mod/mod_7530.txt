She initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2166**] with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting from an OSH.
A CT scan showed a multicystic pelvic adnexal mass.
She was diagnosed with ovarian adenocarcinoma during that admission along with a PE and was started on lovenox.
Gyn tumor board recommended that patient start neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
She started carboplatin/paclitaxel cycle #1 on [**2166-3-26**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 19948**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], her primary medical oncologist, but developed worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting a few days later.
She presented to an OSH and was diagnosed with free intraperitoneal air and a retroperitoneal abscess.
Heme-onc also consulted for febrile neutropenia on [**2166-4-1**] and recommended starting G-CSF (Neupogen) and transfer to the Oncology service.

Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and S.aureus if sparse growth or greater.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2166-4-26**]): NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Induced Sputum [**2166-4-12**]: AFB negative, PCP negative, no bacteria Induced Sputum [**2166-4-13**]: AFB negative PICC tip Cx [**2166-4-9**]: Negative.
Cytology: [**2166-4-7**] Pleural Fluid Cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Interval significant decrease in size to right retroperitoneal collection likely related to known perforated duodenal ulcer with appropriate positioning of indwelling pigtail catheter.
Persistent moderate right and large left pleural effusion resulting in mild right lower lobe atelectasis but complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
There is a large left-sided pleural effusion.
Decreased size of air fluid collection suggesting functioning drain, however the persistent oral contrast within the collection indicates sustained perforation.
Organizing multiloculated fluid collection inferior to the original collection.
This will likely respond to conservative treatment and is in a difficult position for percutaneous drainage.
Redemonstration of complex multicystic adnexal tumors.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with compressive atelectasis and likely persistent left upper lobe pneumonia.
Unchanged small nodules seen in the right lung, assessment is incomplete of the left given large pleural effusion.
Decreased size of air fluid collection suggesting functioning drain, however the persistent oral contrast within the collection indicates sustained perforation.
Organizing multiloculated fluid collection inferior to the original collection.
This will likely respond to conservative treatment and is in a difficult position for percutaneous drainage.
Redemonstration of complex multicystic adnexal tumors.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with compressive atelectasis and likely persistent left upper lobe pneumonia.
Unchanged small nodules seen in the right lung, assessment is incomplete of the left given large pleural effusion.
[**2166-4-17**]: PCXR & L lat decub: LUL infiltrate smaller (likely due to decreased vascular congestion), L pleural effusion unchanged and layers on decubitus film.
Small R pleural effusion.
[**4-13**] R LE Doppler U/S: 1.
No evidence of DVT in right common femoral, right superficial femoral and right popliteal vein.
Edema noted behind the right knee but no focal fluid collections were noted.
Left suprahilar opacity with interstitial thickening is unchanged and may represent pneumonia.
However as this has been present since [**2166-3-3**] if this does not radiographically resolve, the possibility of a mass should be considered.
Moderately large left-sided effusion has increased in size.
Worsening left upper lobe opacity.
Worsening superimposed interstitial edema and increasing bilateral pleural effusions.
Given that the left upper lobe opacity has persisted over two months, an underlying malignancy cannot be excluded.
The previously identified tiny apical separation of the pleural space in the left hemithorax, a finding related to the preceding successful thoracocentesis, has now disappeared.
The previously described pulmonary findings which include a massive density in the left upper lobe area remain rather unchanged.
No significant increase of pleural effusion is identified.
Decreased left pleural effusion with new small left apical pneumothorax status post thoracentesis.
Slightly increased right moderate pleural effusion.
Differential includes neoplastic or infectious etiologies as described above.

Complex cystic lesion in the adnexa with multiple irregular thick septa with interval increase in size compared to prior CT. No clear fat plane between the cystic lesion and the urinary bladder.
Complex exophytic hyperattenuated cystic lesion in the right kidney, incompletely characterized.
[**2166-3-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimally improved left upper lobe pneumonia, could have malignant component.
OSH CT: (report in OMR from ob gyn admission note from past [**2-/2166**] admission): Small L pleural effusion, atelectasis vs. scarring in RML/lingula, abnormal adnexal region/uterus, 8.5cm irregularly shaped cystic focus with nodular enhancing margines in the L adnexa.
Uterus dieplaced to the R with heterogeneous low level echoes in the central portion.
Other cystic foci above the uterus, may represent thick-walled cysts involving the R ovary.
Small loculated pockets of pelvic fluid in bilateral adnexae.
Mildly dilated small bowel loops, distal small bowel decompressed, suspicious for early or partial SBO.
Small to mod amt of diffuse ascites.
No peritoneal implants.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo woman with ovarian cancer transferred from the surgical service for febrile neutropenia in the setting of bowel perforation secondary to a duodenal ulcer.
The perforation occurred one week after starting chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) for a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
Hypoxemia persisted and a CXR showed a persistent LUL infiltrate, unresolved from a pneumonia treated the month before as well as a left pleural effusion.
Bronchoscopy AFB, pleural effusion AFB and deaminase were all negative.
Pleural effusion cytology was POSTIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA.
She required a short (two day) stay in the ICU [**Date range (1) 42061**] for worsening hypoxemia despite furosemide the same day after placement of a G-J tube for tube feeding.
CXR revealed reaccumlation of her left pleural effusion and mild right pleural effusion.
Her subsequent course was notable for copious, frequent stools in the setting of increasing her tube feeds to their target volume that improved somewhat when the tube feed rate was decreased.
In the last week of her hospitalization, abscess drainage had markedly decreased.
Repeat abdominal pelvic CT revealed that the drain was in place and the abscess was resolving and much decreased in size.
# Febrile neutropenia and infectious disease work up: Fever due to retroperitoneal abscess and extravasation of bowel flora into patient's abdomen.
Blood cultures and C. diff toxin negative.
Coag-negative Staph, Enterococcus, and yeast grew in abscess culture.
Pleural fluid culture has been negative, but cytology was POSTIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA.
The persistent LUL infiltrate on CXR may be a malignant process given that it has not resolved on broad spectrum antibiotics and pulmonary workup has been negative for infection although a tissue diagnosis has not been pursued.
Beta glucan falsely elevated by pip/tazo.
# Perforated bowel and retroperitoneal abscess: Due to a duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection.
Drain into abscess placed [**2166-3-31**].
TPN was converted to tube feeds after G-j tube was placed [**2166-4-11**] for feeding and for perforated ulcer bypass.
Pt developed recurrent fevers on [**2166-4-21**].
CT scan showed development of a new organizing fluid collection.
IR advanced the tube [**2166-4-25**] beyond the point of the fluid collection  with placement of [**Doctor Last Name **] to minimize risk of tube migarting again.
Sinugram also showed that perforation at mid duodenum-resection would require a Whipple's procedure which pt would not tolerate.
# H. pylori infection: Continue PPI.
# Hypoxemia: Repeat CXR showed worsening LUL infiltrate.
Repeat CT showed persistent LUL infiltrate, new effusions, and pulmonary nodules.
Thoracentesis [**2166-4-7**] drained 1.3L from left side, complicated by small pneumothorax now resolved.
Effusion cytology positive for malignancy.
The etiology of worsening hypoxemia requiring a brief 2 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission [**Date range (1) 90111**] was likely  multifactorial: LUL infiltrate, recent PEs, atelectasis, splinting from right abdominal pain s/p J tube placement, recurrent malignant pleural effusions.
The LUL infiltrate is not clearly infectious and differential includes lymphangitic pulmonary metastases in light of pulmonary nodules and recurrent malignant pleural effusion.
Treatment for malignant effusions would be chemotherapy, but this was on hold due to her bowel perforation.
The patient underwent pleurex catheter placement by interventional pulmonary service on [**2166-4-29**] for recurrent malignant pleural effusion.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Skin breakdown exacerbated by poor nutritional status.
# Neutropenia: Chemo-induced.
# Anemia: Anemia labs reflected anemia of inflammation (chronic disease).
Stool guaic was positive as expected with a perforated duodenal ulcer.
# HTN: Anti-hypertensives held for BP lower than baseline in setting of infection.
# PE: Enoxaparin has been held as necessary for procedures and then restarted when procedures are completed.
Enoxaparin for PE treatment.
# Pain (abdominal pain): Hydromorphone IV prn for most of hospitalization, switched to oxycodone per J tube prior to discharge.
# Precautions: Fall.
# Lines: Peripheral.
PICC placed [**2166-4-1**], but removed [**2166-4-10**] because of mild surrounding erythema.

Abdominal abscess.
Metastatic Ovarian cancer.
Recurrent malignant pleural effusions.
Left Upper Lobe Infiltrate that has not cleared with antibiotics suspicious for malignancy.
Lower extremity edema Hypoxemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and distention due to a perforated duodenal ulcer.
An abdominal abscess formed from the perforation and needed a drain placed to help clear the infection along with IV antibiotics and G-CSF (Neupogen), a medication to help produce white blood cells, as your white blood cell count was initially very low due to chemotherapy.
While the ulcer was healing, you were fed with high calorie fluids (TPN) through the vein and then through a J-tube placed in your small intestine.
The tube feedings caused you to have diarrhea that was treated by changing the type of feedings, adding banana flakes, and occasionally using anti-diarrhea medicine after tests showed the diarrhea was not infectious.
A CXR and CT scan of the chest both showed that the pneumonia from your last admission had not cleared and you had fluid around the lungs.
You also had a bronchoscopy of your lungs that did not show evidence of infection.
You will need to remain on antibiotics until the abscess and ulcer resolve, as determined by future CT scans (ideally with oral gastrograffin to evaluate the ulcer perforation; contrast through the J-tube will not reach this location).
These antibiotics will also treat the H. pylori infection, a bacteria that often causes ulcers.
While you were in the hospital, you developed thrush and were temporarily treated with nystatin swish and spit.
