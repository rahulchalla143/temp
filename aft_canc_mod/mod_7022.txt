History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 122**] is a 57-year-old woman who experienced a recent 30-pound weight loss over the last month.
She has had no abdominal or back pain, denies diarrhea, diabetes, and notes only reduced appetite.
She subsequently developed jaundice and pruritus, and presented for an ERCP, which demonstrated a 1.5-cm distal biliary stricture.
Brushings were performed and negative for malignant cells.
A CT scan of her chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrates no evidence of pulmonary or hepatic metastasis.
She has a replaced left hepatic artery, with a dilated pancreatic and bile duct above what appears to be a heterogeneous and somewhat subtle mass in the uncinate portion of the pancreas immediately adjacent to the portal vein.
There is no teardrop malformation of the vein or evidence of encasement.
After discussion of all risks, benefits and possible outcomes, the patient was scheduled for elective Whipple resection.

[**Doctor Last Name **]/rate  SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: FS liver biopsy left lobe, pancreatic and bile duct margins, common hepatic artery, gallbladder, whipple specimen.
Left lobe, liver biopsy (A): Benign bile ductular proliferation consistent with microhamartoma; no carcinoma seen.
Chronic cholecystitis.
Pancreatic margin, pancreatoduodenectomy (E-G): Pancreatic parenchyma with no carcinoma seen.
Incidental low grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (Pan-In1a).
Bile duct margin, pancreatoduodenectomy (H-L): Bile duct segment with acute and chronic inflammation; no carcinoma seen.
Two of twenty-six regional lymph nodes with involvement by carcinoma ([**3-28**]-pN1).
C.  Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are present.
D.  Bile duct segment with reactive changes commonly seen in association with in situ metal stents.
One  lymph node with no carcinoma seen (0/1).
No new fluid collection or abscess.
Edematous pancreaticobiliary limb of the jejunum within the region of the porta hepatis with surrounding fluid and edematous efferent gastrojejunostomy are both unchanged.
Stable narrowing of the main portal vein near the portal venous confluence related to post-surgical changes.
The previously seen small pocket of air and debris noted posterosuperior to the porta hepatis now just contains air.
No evidence of collection.
Resolved left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
Small foci of air tracking from the left incision site to the peritoneum but not within the abdomen.
Increased intra-abdominal air surrounding the anterior abdominal drain.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with newly diagnosed pancreatic head mass was admitted to the HPB Surgical Service for elective Whipple procedure.
On [**2184-9-9**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with liver biopsy, pylorus sparing radical pancreatoduodenectomy with en bloc resection of portal vein, internal jugular vein interposition graft, transgastric feeding jejunostomy and placement of gold fiducials, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
She was extubated on POD # 1 without difficulties and on POD # 3 she was transferred on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.
Epidural was split on POD # 3 and Dilaudid PCA was added for pain control.
The patient was started on Roxicet via with good effect and adequate pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient started to spike low grade fevers and her diet was changed to NPO on POD # 10.
ID: The patient spiked fever on POD # 4, her blood and urine cultures were sent.
The patient was continued to have low grade fevers and on POD # 12, her blood and urine cultures were sent again.
The patient's temperature and WBC returned within normal limits after initiation of antibiotics.
Wound care: The patient wound was found to have a leak on POD # 6, her wound was open laterally from both sides and started with moist-to-dry DSD packing.
On POD # 9, patient's wound was open and VAC was applied.
The average daily output from the wound was 100-200 cc.
Finger stick was slightly elevated and patient required minimal amount of insulin.
After starting TF, patient's blood glucose increased and [**Last Name (un) **] was called for consult.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a clear liquids diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
