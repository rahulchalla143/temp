In preparation for the procedure he developed right pneumothorax in an attempt by anesthesia to do a paravertebral block to decrease pain during the procedure.
He got esmolol during procedure and with low blood pressures, (SBPs upto 80s) he was placed on neo for rest of procedure.
Patient was uncooperating and confused but able to move extremities.
After evaluation by ICU team, he was deemed stable for the floor given stable BPs and improved mental status.
(he does have confusion/poor memory at baseline).
On ROS, he denied any recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea or dysura.

Compared with [**2153-5-12**] at 7:37 a.m., there has been interval clearing of opacities at the right base.
Cardiomegaly and increased retrocardiac density with additional opacity in the left midzone is unchanged.
Right apical pneumothorax, minimally smaller.
Interval clearing of opacities at the right base   COMPARISON:  [**2153-5-12**] chest radiograph.
FINDINGS:  Following removal of a right pleural catheter, a small right apical pneumothorax is essentially unchanged in size.
Small right pleural effusion also appears similar.
Diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are unchanged.
Left retrocardiac opacity also appears similar to the prior study and may reflect atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation.
Adjacent moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Currently awaiting pathology results and biopsy to make final diagnosis.
This was an elective procedure for the right pleural effusion to be drained and a pleurex cathether placed.
Procedure led to a pneumothorax which resolved with placement of a chest tube.
Patient had the left sided pleural effusion drained as well.
After subsequent xrays to monitor progression of right sided pleural effusion and to ensure there wasn't a new pneumothorax on the left side, patient was discharged.
Levofloxacin was intially started for concern of pneumonia however was discontinued prior to discharge.
# Hypotension: Patient had borderline low normal pressures and was on neo in PACU.
Etiology of hypotension is likely due to anesthesia and poor PO intake for NPO for procedure.
Patient currently normotensive and further fluids were held to prevent lung collection.
# Pneumothorax: Occured in the setting of paravertebral block on right side.
Serial Chest Xrays showed improvement of pneumothorax.
Final chest xray hours prior to discharge and after left pleural fluid tap showed no pneumothorax on left side.
# Hypothyroidism - Patient was stable while in patient and on levothyroxine  # Atrial fibrillation: Warfarin was briefly stopped due to procedures, however it was restarted on discharge.
# CKD: At baseline.
Patient initially had reduced urine output on admission, but with good PO intake and hydration his urine output increased and his creatinine was at his baseline of 1.4-1.6  # CAD: No active issues.
# Psych: Patient was continued on mirtazapine   Medications on Admission: - Levothyroxine 112 mcg PO daily - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Zantac 75 mg PO daily - Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO bid - Mirtazapine 15 mg PO DAILY - Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily - Ambien 5 mg PO QHS - Warfarin 0.5 mg PO daily - Tylenol 650 mg prn arthritis - Phytonadione 5 mg PO 2 tablet by mouth Thursday night and 1 tablet on Friday morning (pre-procedure)  Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 112 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
