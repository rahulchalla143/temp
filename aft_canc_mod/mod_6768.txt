Admission Date:  [**2200-7-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-3-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Neurontin / Iodine / Shellfish Derived  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, RUQ pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line placement, A line placement  History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer s/p completion of topotecan chemorx ([**2200-6-27**]) who was initially admitted for failure to thrive, anemia, and dehydration; now transferred to MICU for new onset of acute right-upper quadrant abdominal pain, tachycardia, and relative hypotension, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis.
He was initially admitted 3 days after initiating topotecan therapy for small cell cancer recurrence due to diarrhea, fatigue, and anemia.
Patient had been on ciprofloxacin for neutropenic fever prophylaxis.
There was no history of fever, and patient denied chills or feeling febrile.
He noticed acute onset of abdominal pain last night while in bed, and denied nausea/vomitting.
Patient acknowleged passing flatus and having loose bowel movements.
On the morning of transfer, patient remained persistently tachycardic and blood pressure was much lower than baseline at 110mmHg systolic (normally 150s-160s systolic).
Although he denied dyspnea or chest discomfort, patient was also noted to have new hypoxia to 85% on room air after receiving IV fluids, and was placed on nasal cannula with improvement of saturation to mid-90%.
Due to concern lactic acidosis and abdominal pain, CT angiography of abdomen was ordered to rule-out mesenteric ischemia, in addition to CT Torso.
In addition, cardiac enzymes were cycled starting at admission, and patient was found to have elevated troponin to 0.57, with no baseline for comparison.
Initially, patient had no ischemic ECG changes, and only sinus tachycardia.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended deferring anticoagulation for the moment until mesenteric ischemia was ruled-out.
Of note, patient also had some change in his baseline mental status per his wife.
Reportedly, he has had this occur in the past due to opioid therapy.
He is chronically on oxycodone SR [**Hospital1 **] for diffuse pain related to his malignancy.
On arrival to MICU, patient was noted to have progressive respiratory distress.
Patient became agitated, tachypneic, and began pulling off oxygen mask.
Endotracheal intubation was performed for progressive respiratory distress.
Limited stage small cell lung CA diagnosed in [**7-/2199**] ----[**7-/2199**]/[**2199**] carboplatin etoposide and radiation from [**2199-8-6**] ----[**1-/2200**] frontal lobe metastases, S/P whole brain radiation ----[**5-/2200**] soft tissue metastases and started on topotecan #.
Hypertension #.
Neutropenia #.
Anemia post chemoRx requiring transfusions   Social History: Married, lives with wife and 2 children.
Smoked 100-150 pack-years, occasional alcohol, no illicit or intravenous drug use.
Family History: Mother with diabetes mellitus, CVA.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP: HR: RR: O2Sat: GEN: Respiratory distress, agitated, unable to speak in full sentences HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, dry MM, edentulous NECK: No JVD, trachea midline, no adenopathy COR: tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs, +1 radial, DP/PT pulses faint PULM: bilateral rhonchi, left>Right, diffuse expiratory wheezes ABD: Soft, Tender to palpation diffusely, guarding in RUQ, +BS, no organomegaly EXT: Feet cool, no oedema NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time, initially SKIN: Reticular rash on abdomen and arms   Pertinent Results: No evidence of acute process as abscess, free air or peritoneal fluid.
The mass located posterior to the left kidney measures 22 x 16 mm and is unchanged in size.
The liver presents some perfusion abnormalities in the venous phase, otherwise unremarkable.
There are no gallstones.
Previously described hypoattenuating lesions in the right kidney are again noted and probably correspond to cysts.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
No evidence of peritoneal fluid.
The mass described in the subcutaneous fat on the left side (series 30, image 110) just superior to the gluteus muscles, now measures 12 mm and has decreased in size (it was 15 mm previously).
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no definite osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY: There is diffuse atheromatous disease with mural thrombus and calcification of the abdominal aorta and branches, including iliac arteries.
There is no evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
No evidence of abscess, cholecystitis, mesenteric ischemia or perforation.
Stenosis of the celiac trunk.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with mural thrombus in the aorta 4.
Previously described soft tissue masses are again noted, with decrease in size in some of them as described above.
Please also refer to clip number [**Serial Number 77248**] for more images and chest report.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to MICU for lactic acidosis and was intubated due to progressively increasing respiratory demands in order to compensate for metabolic alkalosis.
Due to intermittent episodes of hypotension and lactic acidosis, sepsis was a presumed diagnosis and a central venous line was placed.
Presumed source was pulmonary due to infiltrates on chest x-ray.
CT Angiography of the adomen did not demonstrate any compromised abdominal vasculature or ischemic bowel.
There was also no intra-abdominal pocket of infection evident radiographically.
Patient was also found to have positive cardiac enzymes during the course of the admission.
Ultimately, it was felt that the biomarker elevation was secondary to demand ischemia rather than a thrombotic process and heparin was stopped.
He was transiently hypotensive and then developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, although he maintained a pulse.
Family was notified of his critical condition and after much discussion, it was decided to make patient comfort measures, and subsequently expired.
