Admission Date:  [**2169-11-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-12-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, nausea, vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Extubation [**First Name3 (LF) **] RIJ central venous line placement, removal PICC placement   History of Present Illness: This is an 85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who presented to [**Company 191**] today with dyspnea and vomiting.
In addition, the patient has had dyspnea with minimal exertion associated with nonproductive cough and chronic orthopnea.
She has also experienced weakness and 2 mild falls (no trauma or LOC).
She has had diarrhea four to five times a day, although may have chronic diarrhea.
Due to report of COPD history, she initially received combivent and methylprednisolone, as well as ASA and ceftriaxone.
Once labs revealed a septic picture, she received vanc and pip-tazo.
While undergoing RUQ U/S, she became acutely dyspneic with new opacities on CXR.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild mitral annular calcification.
The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable, with unchanged enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, compatible with underlying hypertension.
The lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Degenerative changes are seen within the right shoulder.
New surgical clips are also noted within the epigastric region.
Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
No gross evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
In this patient with clinical concern for ascending cholangitis,there are no imaging studies sensitive for this.
An opening draining bile and pus consistent with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A single 2.5-3cm filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.
Since the previous tracing of [**2169-7-27**] the single beat showing a more leftward axis and right bundle-branch block morphology is no longer present.
Sinus rhythm.
EKG [**11-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific T wave flattening.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-7-27**] atrial fibrillation is new.
Left pleural effusion with atelectasis have not changed.
Pulmonary arteries are markedly enlarged, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2169-12-1**]):       ANAEROBIC GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
CLOSTRIDIUM SPECIES NOT C. PERFRINGENS OR C. SEPTICUM.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory failure and septic shock.
# Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Admitted with worsening dyspnea on exertion, stable orthopnea.
Became acutely SOB requiring intubation in the ED, likely due to metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation leading to fatigue.
Repeat CXR showed increased bilateral opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
Heart failure was considered her BNP elevation and history of orthopnea, although she has no known heart failure and ECHO was not particularly concerning for CHF ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, LVEF > 55%).
Viral DFA was negative, pneumonia was less likely in the absence of sputum and change in CXR.
She has smoking history, but no wheezing or CO2 retention to suggest COPD.
SBTs starting [**11-23**] with intention to extubate were unsuccesful (RR into the 40s, tachycardic), likely secondary to volume overload.
She was diuresed with lasix and repeated almost daily SBTs continued to show elevated RR and tachycardia.
RSBI was 156 on [**11-29**], but given that she is an elderly female with baseline tachypnea and small TVs, extubation was attempted on [**11-29**] and was successful.
Of note, RSBI is not likely a good indication of this patients suitability for extubation given her baseline tachypnea and small TV and as she did very well s/p extubation with a pre-extubation RSBI of 156. .
# Septic shock: Initial WBC with bandemia, elevated lactate, fever, tachycardia, and pressor requirement.
Most likely biliary source given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known choledocholithiasis.
[**Month/Year (2) **] was done on [**11-21**] and showed large amounts of sludge and a sludge ball obstructing flow in the CBD.
Blood cultures showed G positive rods and Clostridium species (not perfringens) in anaerobic culture bottles, but have not yet been speciated.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She developed atrial fibrillation on [**11-23**].
# ARF: Likely related to sepsis (ATN), as well as hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea.
# Anion gap acidosis: Most likely related to elevated lactate, initially 4.5 improved consistently with IVF, now 1.7.
No history of ingestion and no clear offenders on med list.
She spontaneously converted from atrial fibrillation back to NSR on [**12-1**].
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] [**Hospital1 189**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic shock Cholangitis s/p [**Hospital1 **] Acute renal failure Respiratory failure  Discharge Condition: Stable, on room air, normal vital signs, tolerating PO diet.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing and vomiting; you were found to have a fever and abnormal labs.
