Her prior hospital course had complications including post-operative pulmonary embolus and GIB in the setting of heparin drip/coumadin that stabilized after transfusion of 2U pRBC.
Her course was also complicated by multifocal atrial tachycardia.
She then represented with 1 day  melena and shortness of breath with right lower quadrant pain, no nausea or vomiting.
She was then admitted to the ICU for observation and colonoscopy.
Rt breast cancer s/p lumpectomy in [**2135**]; no XRT or chemotherapy.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia vs sinus tach with atrial ectopy diagnosed [**7-/2140**]   Social History: Russian immigrant who lives near to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Location (un) **].
skin pink CV: RRR no m/r/g.
mild abd pain RUQ and epigastrium Ext: + pedal edema   Pertinent Results: [**8-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or free intraperitoneal air.
No evidence of obstruction.
Significant improvement in paraaortic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid collection within the cul-de-sac.
No change in hepatic cysts.
Fibroid uterus.
[**8-8**] colonoscopy: small polyp.
No bleeding seen .
[**8-10**]: Pill endoscopy with active bleeding and clot distal to anastomosis site.
No AVMs or diverticuli seen.
[**8-19**]: There is interval decrease in size in the previously demonstrated rim enhancing fluid collection, now measuring 33 x 9 mm, previously 34.7 mm on [**2140-8-6**], and measuring 56 x 33 mm on [**2140-7-19**].
There is a calcified fibroid uterus.
Bone windows reveal degenerative changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 72 yo F with diffuse large B cell lymphoma originally presenting in [**Month (only) 205**] with small bowel perforation, s/p D-J and J-J anastamosis and post-op pulmonary embolus.
With history of GI bleed on heparin who represented with GI bleed on lovenox.
She had a colonoscopy in the MICU which did not reveal any cause of her bleeding but did reveal a polyp which was not biopsied.
The patient was hemodynamically stable with adequate blood pressure, although she did have tachycardia to the 150's.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had had an upper endoscopy in the setting of GIB on her last admission which showed normal post-operative changes without bleeding.
Therefore the patient had a pill endoscopy on [**8-10**] wich revealed active bleeding in the area of the distal jejunum, but did not find a specific source.
Then on [**8-12**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] had another GIB in the setting of a supratherapeutic PTT (approx 100) with 7 point hematocrit drop and 2 episodes of melena.
She did have a J-J anastamosis but it was difficult to assess if the surgical site was the source of bleeding versus her abdominal lymphoma.
Interventional radiology was called and an IVC filter was placed on [**8-12**] without complications and anticoagulation was not resumed.
CT abdomen on [**8-6**] showed decrease in retroperitoneal LAD implying response to the chemotherapy.
She has had no signs of tumor lysis syndrome.
She tolerated the chemotherapy will with some mild nausea and anorexia as side-effects.
She was treated with GCSF injections daily due to her rapid nadir on last admission.
Tachycardia: Ms [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed on her last admission with multifocal atrial tachycardia vs sinus tachycardia w/ atrial ectopy on her last admission and was started on metoprolol and diltiazem as per the recommendations of cardiology consult service.
This admission Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had sinus tachycardia with questionable atrial ectopy up to 150's.
It was difficult to decide how to treat her tachycardia becuase of the undesirability of suppressing a reactive sinus tachycardia.
She was tachycardic for a few days in the 100-140 range and then abruptly had a decrease in her HR to 70-100.
Kliebsiella bacteremia: Ms [**Known lastname **] was finishing a course of levofloxacin for klebsiella bacteremia from her last admission.
She finished and was afebrile until [**8-17**] when she had a temperature of 100.6.
CXR showed only some minor atelectasis.
Abdominal CT only showed decreased size of lymphoma and no abcess.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed oral thrush prior to dispo and is recieving a 1-week course of nystatin + fluconazole.
PE: Ms [**Known lastname **] had a small pulmonary embolus on her last hospitalization in the post operative setting.
Therefore; and IVC filter was placed without complication on [**8-12**].
She was advanced to a regular diet prior to discharge which she has tolerated with some mild nausea, but mainly with poor appetite in the post-chemotherapy setting.
