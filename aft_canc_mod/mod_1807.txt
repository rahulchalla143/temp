Admission Date:  [**2193-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2151-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Speech arrest and confusion.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 41 year-old left-handed with a past medical history significant for metastatic breast cancer and a stroke in [**2189**] (left facial droop)who presents now after an episode of confusion and a motor vehicle accident.
It seemed to him that she had a limited verbal vocabulary but was not dysarthric.
On briefly obtaining the history from the patient's husband it became clear that the patient had 3 metastatic lesion related to her breast cancer with edema.
Extinction and inattention: 2  In the ED the patient had a non-contrast head CT that was suspicious for blood in the area of encephalomalacia on the right and there was considerable vasogenic edema on the left.
In the scanner the patient had a right sided seizure that included right head deviation.
The patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast in [**2189-5-28**].
The patient's husband notes that the patient has a left sided pleural effusion related to her lymph node dissection.
In [**2190-8-28**] the patient had a stroke with left facial droop.
The initial thought was that she either had another stroke or worsening of her stroke, but her husband reports that it was ultimately diagnosed as lepotmeningeal spread of her breast cancer.
ROS Unable to obtain, but husband reports no fevers, chills, weightloss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain or shortness of breath.
She complained of some right sided neck pain.
There no obvious focal neurological deficits.
No ETOH, Tobacco or drugs.
No field cuts.
No nystagmus V:  sensation intact V1-V3 to LT VII:  Facial strength intact/symmetrical VIII:  hears finger rub bilaterally IX,X:  palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline [**Doctor First Name 81**]:  SCM/trapezeii [**4-1**] bilaterally XII:  tongue protrudes midline, no dysarthria  Motor: Normal bulk, no tremor, no asterixis or myoclonus.
No pronator drift.
No hemorrhage.
Encephalomalacia in the right frontoparietal lobe containing areas of linear calcification most consistent gyral mineralization.
Extensive edema surrounding a focus of calcification in the left parietal lobe is concerning for underlying metastases.
No fracture or subluxation.
6-mm sclerotic focus in the left inferior endplate of T1 worrisome for metastasis.
MRI/MRA Head - IMPRESSION: Irregular ring-enhancing lesion is identified on the left parietal lobe, measuring approximately 1.6 x 1.9 mm in size in the axial projection, associated with extensive vasogenic edema and possible focus of calcification.
Encephalomalacia is identified on the right frontoparietal lobe demonstrating areas of linear and gyral hyperintensity signal, possibly consistent with gyral mineralization or pseudolaminar necrosis.
Punctate focus of enhancement noted on the right frontal lobe measuring approximately 2-3 mm in size as described above, worrisome for metastatic lesion.
MRA OF THE HEAD:  There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids and the anterior circulation without evidence of aneurysm or significant stenosis.
IMPRESSION: Possible bilateral stenosis versus artifact involving the vertebrobasilar junction as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 41 y/o woman with breast Ca (metastatic to the CNS, lung, bone) s/p RT and chemoTx on current carboplatin therapy admitted with speech arrest/nonverbal/obtundation and three witnessed generalized seizures.
Once the MRI was performed (showing enhancing metastatic lesions in the left parietal and left frontal region) and the results for the ID screening came back, we believe the seizures were related to edema from her CNS metastasis.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizures secondary to edema in the conext of CNS metastatic lesions (breast Ca primary).
No field cuts.
No nystagmus V:  sensation intact V1-V3 to LT VII:  Facial strength intact/symmetrical VIII:  hears finger rub bilaterally IX,X:  palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline [**Doctor First Name 81**]:  SCM/trapezeii [**4-1**] bilaterally XII:  tongue protrudes midline, no dysarthria  Motor: Normal bulk, no tremor, no asterixis or myoclonus.
No pronator drift.
