Her treatment course was complicated by pneumonitis felt to be due to her fludarabine.
Cold agglutinin syndrome- She is transfusion dependant.
Hypertension 4.
Family History: Her father had a stroke and age 69.
General: Lying in bed in no acute distress.
HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive, oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Resp: Bibasilar crackles Abd: Soft, nontender, distended upper abdomen with palpable mass, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding.
Ext: Warm and well perfused without cyanosis or edema Neuro: Alert and oriented.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year-old female with past medical history signficant for marginal zone lymphoma and aplastic anemia who was admitted with sepsis and pancytopenia.
She had a torso CT scan that demostrated a dilated esophagus.
Subsequently, an upper endoscopy with ultrasound showed severe [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes without abnormal esophageal thickening.
She was initially treated with ambisome and voriconazole for severe [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 99813**]; however, the voriconazole was stopped secondary to elevated alkaline phosphatase.
Since she was febrile and neutropenic, she was also covered broadly for febrile neutropenia with aztreonam, daptomycin, and flagyl.
Bactrim was started for nocardia coverage, but stopped due to nausea and vomiting.
For further infectious work-up, she had a chest x-ray and CT that showed multifactorial pulmonary nodules.
When she began having mental status changes with somnolence and unresponsiveness, an LP was performed that showed [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus on PCR.
Pancytopenia: She had pancytopenia on admission, which was thought to be secondary to aplastic anemia from her fludarabine treatment.
She had several drops in her hematocrit while she wsa hypothermic, and these drops were attributed with cold agglutinin syndrome.
IVIG treatment was attempted for treatment of hemolytic anemia, but she had a febrile and hypertensive reaction to it.
She subsequently was treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for her aplastic anemia; however, she had a hypersensitivity reaction that required emergent intubation for 2 days.
Since she had persistent VRE bacteremia and remained neutropenic, it was decided to pursue ATG desensitization to treat her aplastic anemia.
After treatment with ATG, she continued to have VRE bacteremia and was also found to have [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus in her CSF.
Unfortunately, the ATG did not take effect, and she remained neutropenic and pancytopenic.
She was maintained on G-CSF for neutropenia.
Mental Status Change: On one occasion, she became somnolent and unresponsive to voice and painful stimuli.
An MRI was negative for mass effect or structural brain lesion.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
Neurology was consulted and felt that the change in mental status likely secondary to toxic/metabolic causes.
However, later, she had a second episode of somnolence and unresponsiveness.
Again an MRI was negative and an EEG was negative for seizure activity.
She did not recover her mental status and remained unresponsive to painful stimuli.
She did have some spontaneous movements.
These were restarted once she was no longer hypotensive.
Respiratory alkalosis: On several occasions, she had 2 episodes of paradoxical breathing in which an ABG showed a respiratory alkalosis.
However, one episode of paradoxical breathing required intubation and mechanical ventilation for 5 days.
It was unclear the cause of the respiratory alkalosis.
Atrial Fibrillation: She was found to have atrial fibrillation during her second period of unresponsiveness.
This new atrial fibrillation was though to be related to toxic/metabolic causes.
A CTA at that time showed a pulmonary embolism that was thought to be from her catheter [**Male First Name (un) **] thrombus from her right IJ catheter.
9) Rectal bleeding: In the middle of her admission, she had isolated episode of rectal bleeding.
She remained hemodynamically stable and did not have a drop in her hematocrit.
However, at the end of her hospital stay, she had persistent rectal bleeding.
11) Access: She had several central lines placed and replaced during her period of persistent bacteremia.
However, once she remained unresponsive and was found to have persistent infections in the setting of neutropenia, she was transitioned to DNR/DNI.
She did not improve and there was no indication that her counts would return.
