# Septic Shock - Felt to be most likely [**1-24**] urosepsis given + urine cultures (40,000 e. coli and +group B strep) and h/o urosepsis with only 10,000 pseudomonas growing in urine 3 yrs ago after urologic procedure.
CXR concerning for concurrent pneumonia in the left intrahilar region.
CXR also concerning for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate.
Ddx includes gastroenteritis (viral and bacterial), aspiration pneumonia, biliary source.
No clear obstructive or cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
Pt initially covered broadly for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime, flagyl, azithro all started on [**2130-2-17**].
Ultimately, his antibiotics coverage was narrowed to Cefpodoxime for a full 14 day course for pneumonia and UTI.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line placement.
CXR consistent with volume overload, patient has history of dCHF.
Cardiac enzymes negative, ECHO on [**2130-2-20**] showed dilated LA, mod dilated ascending aorta, no masses or vegetations, mild MS, trivial MR, mild PAH.
Pt was extubated on [**2130-2-18**] without complications.
Upon transfer to the Medicine floors, Lasix was briefly held given his acute renal insufficiency, with improvement in his Creatinine.
# Emesis - Possibly secondary to urosepsis vs viral/bacterial gastroenteritis vs pneumonia vs. intubation/sedation.
No evidence of obstruction.
# Acute Renal Failure - Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension and later poor PO intake, with FeNa of 0.2% and resolved with IVF.
Discussed with wife that recently hydrocortisone/ketaconazole were resumed and she was concerned that these caused renal impairment in past.
Coumadin continues to be held in setting of elevated INR.
Given concerns for thrombolic events with his prosthetic valve, patient was started on heparin gtt.
# Delirium: Patient was hyperactively delirious in the ICU, likely due to the multiple factors of ICU admission, recent intubation, sedative/hypnotic medications, stress dose steroids, pneumonia/UTI etc.
He was treated with Zydis given concern for laryngospasms with Haldol, to good effect.
On the Medicine floors, he continued to wax and wane and showed signs of emotional lability (tearful).
Continue aspiration precautions and crush meds, moist ground solids, thin liquids, 1:1 supervision with meals - Zydis as needed  # Prostate CA: Oncology recommended repeat PSA which is elevated to 95, approximately doubled from one month ago.
Held ketoconazole in setting of acute illness and supratherapeutic INR.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection and pneumonia that progressed to septic shock.
Your kidneys were also found to be functioning less well, likely due to the septic shock.
You also developed some confusion due to the many insults to your body (ICU stay, strong medications - steroids, sedatives, pneumonia/UTI, intubation/extubation etc).
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
