[**7-2**] new Option IVC filter plaved via R internal jugular vein, inferior to the pre-existing Optease filter by Interventional Radiology  History of Present Illness: 50-year-old male with a past medical history of extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p 9 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin (last [**2183-6-20**]), hepatitis C, multiple pulmonary embolisms with the last while on lovenox, endocarditis who presents with right thoracic pain and productive cough x several days.
He notes that over the last few days he has developed fatigue, nausea and vomiting, productive cough with brown sputum, intermittent fevers and abdominal pain for the last week.
RLL revealed diminished breath sounds.
At that time he was triggered for altered mental status.
He had bilateral rhonchi R>L.
A CTA showed large right PE with new cavitation of RLL suggestive of necrotizing pneumonia.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: He presented in [**2182-11-20**] with constipation and abdominal pain and was diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Pathology of an  omental biopsy showed adenocarcinoma staining positive for CK7 and CDX2 and focal weakly positive for CK20, negative for TTF-1.
Findings were suggestive of pancreaticobiliary or upper GI tract primary.
Given  these findings, the presentation was most consistent with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.
His first cycle was complicated by left-sided pneumonia due to MSSA, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter.
Past Medical History: - chronic hepatitis C genotype 3.
Initially, he was tolerating therapy relatively well except for mood swings, irritability and insomnia and he was closely monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1681**] in Psychiatry.

IMAGING: [**6-27**] LENI - INDICATION: Right lower extremity swelling.
Occlusive thrombus is seen in the right femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and one of the peroneal veins.
IMPRESSION: Extensive DVT in the right lower extremity.
Acute thrombus is seen in the right main (3:56), right upper lobe (3:50), right middle lobe (3:65) and right lower lobe (3:67) pulmonary arteries as well as the right posterior basal branch (3:81).
Despite the large thrombus burden, no CT evidence of right heart strain is seen.
A loculated pleural effusion is seen in the right major fissure as well as effusions layering in the dependent right lung right pleural space.
Patchy peribronchovascular consolidations are seen in the left upper lobe.
Dense consolidation and air bronchograms are seen in the left lower lobe (3:89), right lower lobe and right middle lobe (3:81).
A cavitary lesion is seen in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (3:80).
No mediastinal, hilar, or axillary adenopathy is present.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Acute pulmonary embolism with marked thrombus load to the right main, upper, middle and lower pulmonary arteries as well as left lingula.
Patchy and confluent areas of consolidation in the lower lungs with an area of cavitation in the right lower lobe.
The distribution and appearance of the opacities is not consistent with pulmonary infarct, per se.
[**6-29**] CXR: Interval increase in loculated right pleural effusion is noted.
There is also interval increase in left pleural effusion.
Analysis is performed in comparison with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of [**2183-6-29**].
The previously existing extensive loculated pleural effusion in the right hemithorax persists rather unchanged.
No pneumothorax has developed.
Some amount of pleural effusion on the left base also unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Grossly unchanged findings with advanced loculated pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Increase in extent of the partly loculated right pleural fluid without evidence of pleural thickening or increased contrast uptake by the pleura.
Slight progression of a cavitary right lower lobe lesion with increase in size.
The overall extent of the parenchymal opacities in the right lung may have minimally decreased.
Unchanged extent of parenchymal opacities in the left lung, with a small newly appeared left pleural effusion.
No evidence of right heart strain, but given the examination protocol, embolic load after PE cannot be determined.
[**7-4**] CXR: A right loculated effusion along the chest wall is slightly smaller compared to the prior examination with evidence of aerated lung behind it.
There is mild adjacent opacity likely representing atelectasis.
A small left effusion is noted as well.
[**7-5**] CXR: Interval placement of a right basilar chest tube.
Tip of the chest tube does project over the right mid and lower lung peripheral opacity although satisfactory positioning should be based on the clinical assessment as the tube appears to have a central lucency suggestive of air rather than fluid.Pleural-based opacity at the right mid to lower lung remains overall unchanged.
Patchy airspace opacity at the left lung base also seen and may reflect patchy atelectasis and/or pleural effusion.
Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
No pneumothorax is appreciated.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
[**7-6**] CXR: Right basilar pleural catheter remains in place.
There is a small loculated pneumothorax.
Residual linear opacity at the right lung base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.
There also continues to be patchy opacity at the left base with associated effusion, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is no evidence of tension.
Unchanged left pleural effusion and left atelectasis.
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema.
CYTOLOGY: [**6-29**] Pleural fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells .
Brief Hospital Course: ==================================================== BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY ==================================================== 50-year-old male with history of cholangiocarcinoma on chemotherapy who present pneumonia and pulmonary embolus.
==================================================== ACTIVE ISSUES ==================================================== # Pulmonary embolus: Pt found to have a large R-sided pulmonary embolus while on lovenox for home anticoagulation, suggesting failure of the Lovenox therapy.
This is his third thromboembolus in the past five months while on Lovenox.
Given his underlying cholangiocarcinoma and history of DVT/PEs he remains is chronically hypercoagulable and in need of anticoagulant therapy.
He was also found to have significant R leg DVTs and an IVC filter was placed by radiology.
He had been transferred to the floor, but due to worsening hypoxia was sent back to the ICU, where interventional pulmonology changed his chest tube.
# Pneumonia: Initially imaging showed additional pulmonary processes in the R lower lobe, included multi-loculated pleural effusions and possible necrotizing pneumonia.
Pulmonary infarct and/or pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to his large R PE was considered as a possibility, so a diagnostic thoracentesis was performed.
Pleural fluid was exudative with elevated WBC and low pH, suggestive of an infectious exudate.
Sputum cultures grew Staph aureus, which was sensitive to gent; blood cultures had no growth, pleural fluid preliminarily had no growth.
Cytology of the pleural fluid showed no malignant cells.
In the third week of [**Name (NI) 216**], pt became more hypoxemic with a rising white count and patient was reinitiated on broad spectrum antibiotics for a second HAP.
#Hypoxemic events: Pt had a number of hypoxemic events in the third and fourth week of [**Month (only) 216**], most likely secondary to mucous plugging and/or aspiration in the setting of existing significant lung disease (effusions and PNA).
Pt recovered with high flow O2 via facemask +/- deep suctioning.
No evidence of active bleeding on exam but hemorrhage into a R pulmonary infarct or cavitary pneumonia was considered.
# Acute kidney injury: On admission his creatinine had increased to 1.5 from baseline of 0.8, but it improved to 1.1 after IVF.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary dehydration or to transient decrease in cardiac output from pulmonary embolus.
#Altered mental status/encephalopathy: Mr. [**Known lastname **] became encephalopathic towards the end of his hospitalization.
Initially thought to be due to oversedation with narcotics, this subsequently was attritubed to progressive disease.
We were considering initiating a round of palliative chemotherapy, but Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] further chemotherapy.
