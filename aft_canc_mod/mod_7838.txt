Biapical scarring is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study secondary to patient's extensive spinal surgery with inability to lay flat inside the magnet.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited due to the presence of extensive streak artifacts due to the thoracic spine fixation hardware.
The thoracic aorta is normal without evidence of acute aortic dissection.
Bilateral pleural effusions are large, likely simple.
There is associated compressive atelectasis of both lower lobes, left greater than right.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules seen diffusely distributed throughout both lungs, are consistent with metastatic disease.
No significant axillary or hilar adenopathy is detected.
A soft tissue density lesion in the subcarinal region measuring 51 x 30 mm (3:31), likely represents subcarinal adenopathy.
Enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the epicardial region (3:62) and in the retrocrural region (3:69).
The study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic organs.
Multiple hypoattenuating hepatic lesions are faintly visualized and not completely assessed.
A large wedge-shaped opacity involving the superior pole of the spleen, is consistent with a splenic infarct.
Minimal amount of perisplenic fluid is present.
Lobulated soft tissue lesions are seen in the left upper quadrant, raising concern for peritoneal masses.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES: The patient is status post posterior spinal fixation of the thoracic spine.
No obvious hardware malalignment.
No acute thoracic aortic pathology.
No pulmonary embolism is seen in the main and segmental arteries.
Bilateral large pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes.
Innumerable pulmonary nodules and subcarinal lymphadenopathy, consistent with metastatic disease.
Multiple hepatic hypoattenuating masses are not completely assessed in this single phase study.
Wedge-shaped sharply marginated splenic hypoattenuation, likely represents a splenic infarct given the history of atrial fibrillation.
Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
Multiple peritoneal soft tissue masses in the left upper quadrant are not completely assessed.
Patient presented with aphasia which resolved soon after admission.
She remained without neurologic signs until [**2185-9-13**] when she was noted to be less interactive, aphasic, and with an apparent left neglect versus paresis.
A code stroke was called and a CTA showed occlusion of the right MCA.
Given the gravidity of the her embolic CVA, it was clinically indicated for her to be started on tPA infusion.
A STAT head CT showed left frontal and right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, extending into the subarachnoid space, with edema.
