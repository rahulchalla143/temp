Admission Date:  [**2182-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2154-11-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Left Leg / Hip Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - left quadriceps I&D with wound vac placement ([**2182-5-7**]) - left quadriceps I&D with wound vac change ([**2182-5-10**]) - left quadriceps I&D with wound vac change ([**2182-5-12**]) - CT-guided arthrocentesis of left hip ([**2182-5-13**]) - left quadriceps I&D with washout of left hip joint and wound vac change ([**2182-5-14**]) - left quadriceps I&D with debridement of necrotic muscle ([**2182-5-17**]) - left quadriceps I&D with biopsy of proximal femur  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 27 y/oM with a history of IVDU (more in the past, most recently admitted to 2 weeks ago) who developed non-specific fatigue within the last 2 weeks, and six days of left sided groin/hip pain after lifting a heavy object.
This was accompanied by nausea, but no emesis, and no rashes.
He functionally has been unable to walk well, or lift his left leg secondary to pain in the groin/proxleg and back of knee.
In the last day he felt that some pain was spreading to his right leg.
He has had constipation (reports no BM in 2 weeks) but no urinary hesitancy, overflow incontinence, or reduction in urine output.
CT scan of the thigh showed abscess in left proximal quads, the area where pain was concentrated.
Past Medical History: prior alcohol abuse (quit 3 yrs ago) IV cocaine abuse (last use 3 wks prior to admission) anxiety  Social History: Occupation: Metal Worker Drugs: IVDU (cocaine) last approx 2 weeks ago after period of sustained sobriety Tobacco: [**12-21**] ppd Alcohol: none presently; former alcohol abuse, sober for 3 years per report   Family History: CAD in Father, Diabetes.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Pertinent Results: Studies: ECG ([**2182-5-7**]): Sinus rhythm at 122 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, 1 mm Q waves in inferior leads and V4-V6, no ST segment/T wave changes.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
MRI L-spine with/without contrast ([**2182-5-10**]): There was no sign for the presence of a disc or vertebral abnormality to suggest either an inflammatory process or other pathologic entity.
There is no other intrathecal abnormality seen.
No overt paraspinal pathology is identified either.
CONCLUSION: Very limited study due to poor pain control.
Stomach and duodenal loops of small bowel and large bowel appear unremarkable.
The rectum, sigmoid colon, prostate, and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
There is new rim-enhancing fluid collection lateral and medial to the left iliac bone, which is concerning for an abscess collection.
UPPER THIGHS: There is interval development of new enhancing fluid collection of the left hip joint.
Enhancing fluid collection is also abutting the left proximal femoral shaft.
Multiple foci of rim-enhancing fluid collection are noted within the left quadriceps femoris muscle.
Moderate-to- severe degree of swelling of the left upper thigh is noted.
Small amount of gas bubbles are noted deep to the subcutaneous tissue in the superficial fascia that are most likely related to the recent surgical procedure.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
No signs of epidural abscess are noted within the lumbar spine.
MRI Thigh ([**2182-5-19**] - prelim): There is edema and enhancement in the proximal left femur compatible with osteomyelitis.
There are small intramuscular abscesses and edema surrounding the proximal left femur.
There is a large soft tissue defect extending from the skin to the left femur.
HIV Ab: negative HCV Ab: positive HCV viral load: 48,800 IU/mL  Brief Hospital Course: 27 year old male with history of IVDU presents with MRSA bacteremia, left thigh abscess, left hip septic srthritis, and left femur osteomyelitis.
He was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to his tachycardia and ill-appearance.
His blood and wound cultures grew MRSA and a TTE showed no vegetations.
Cardiology reviewed his TTE and felt that, given its excellent quality, a TEE was unlikely to add any diagnostic benefit and thus felt that the potential risks of TEE outweighed the benefit.
An ultrasound of his LLE showed no DVT.
He was having increased pain at his left thigh incision site and thus a CT of his pelvis/thighs was obtained which showed multiple fluid collections and possible evidence of necrotizing fasciitis, and thus he was taken urgently to the OR again late on [**2182-5-10**] for an additional washout.
Intraoperatively, there was no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.
Due to low vancomycin levels, his dose was eventually increased up to 1500 mg IV q8h.
Due to his continued fevers and leg/groin pain (as well as ongoing leg weakness), he was taken for CT of his abdomen/pelvis/thighs to evaluate for septic thrombophlebitis versus spinal osteomyelitis/discitis versus epidural abscess (due to pain, he could not tolerate MRI).
The CT scan showed no evidence of spinal disease, but did show a new peri-articular fluid collection at his left hip concerning for a septic arthritis.
CT-guided arthrocentesis of the left hip on [**2182-5-13**] had a marked leukocytosis and eventually grew out MRSA.
He was taken for an additional elective washout on [**2182-5-17**] which involved resection of a significant portion of necrotic thigh musculature.
Post-operatively, his fevers were up to 105 and he required 5 units of pRBCs due to blood loss presumably related to the extensive muscle debridement.
Also of note, he became somewhat leukopenic, and there was concern that his leukopenia and fevers may have both been due to vancomycin (i.e.
An MRI of his thigh done on [**2182-5-19**] was limited due to the patient's poor pain control, though it did show evidence of osteomyelitis of his proximal femur.
The thigh wound was then closed and vac dressing was placed.
Following the wound closure there was no further bleeding and his hematocrit was stable.
His left thigh incision was evaluated prior to discharge and found to be intact without surrounding erythema or drainage.
On [**5-24**] he was found to have a mildly puritic erythemaous macularpapular coalescing rash on his bilateral upper extremities, chest, and abdomen after restarting tizanidine.
At the time of discharge, he had been afebrile for greater than 72 hours, was on PO Linezolid and Cipro, surveillance cultures were negative for greater than 10 days, had good pain control on PO pain medications, and was ambulating with assistance.
Of note, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by significant constipation, likely exacerbated by his narcotics requirement and prolonged immobility.
The HIV Ab was negative, though his HCV Ab and viral load were positive.
He will followup with orthopedics clinic for evaluation of his wound and healing.
He will need regular follow-up with new PCP and arrangement of a chest CT to evaluate mid right lung pulmonary nodule seen on CXR.

While in the hosptial you were also diagnosed with hepatitis C virus, and you will need follow-up for this as an outpaitent.
2) Infectious Disease - After you are discharged you will need weekly blood tests to monitor your infection.
3) Orthopedics - You will follow-up in orthopedics clinic on [**6-3**] to evaluate your thigh wound and to see if your staples are ready to be removed.
4) Liver Clinic - During this admission you were diagnosed with hepatitis C virus.
You should use condoms to protect yourself from new infections such as HIV.
5) Substance Abuse - It is important that you stop using drugs after you are discharged, because you are at high risk of having serious complications due to your infections.
You should seek care from your PCP or return to the hospital emergency department if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers greater than 100 degrees, chills, night sweats, worsening thigh/hip pain, redness and discharge from your thigh wound, serious skin rashes, or any other worrisome symptoms.
