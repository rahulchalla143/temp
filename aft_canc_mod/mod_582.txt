CXR with fluid overload and he received lasix 40mg iv once.
He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, PND or orthopnea.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

, No(t) Jaundice Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Oriented (to): person, place, time, purpose, Movement: Purposeful, Tone: Normal   Pertinent Results: EKG: Bradycardic with AF at 30 with slow ventricular rate.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Stress Echo [**11/2197**]: 57 yo man with Afib and recent episode of CHF was referred for evaluation of shortness of breath.
No neck, back, arm or chest discomfort was reported.
Appropriate increase in shortness of breath with the exercise.
No significant ST segment changes were noted.
Rapid increase in  ventricular rate at a low level of exercise.
No anginal type symptoms or  ischemic EKG changes.
Urine lytes [**2198-6-29**] 01:54PM BLOOD Glucose-182* Na-140 K-4.1 Cl-97* calHCO3-29  Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo M with history of atrial fibrillation presenting with bradycardia likely from beta blocker use with heart rates in the 40's now s/p PPM.
# RHYTHM:  Patient with history of atrial fibrillation.
Admission EKG with Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response with heart rates in the 30-40's.
Etiology thought secondary to beta blcokade BB as patient with a similar presentation in [**2196**] in setting of beta blocker use.
HRs remained in 40s and though patient largely asymptomatic decision made to placed pacemaker for rate control.
Stress echo in [**11/2197**] with no evidence of ischemia.
Biomarkers in house negative and EKG without evidence of ischemia.
# PUMP:  [**2198-6-30**] TTE demonstrated normal left and right ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, with global systolic function with LVEF 65% however due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded.
Patient without signs or symptoms of CHF on exam.
On admission decision made to hold beta blocker secondary bradycardia and [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
Elevation likely pre-renal in setting of bradycardia and poor forward flow.
# Alcohol Abuse: Per report drinks 5-6 drinks/week with no h/o of withdrawal symptoms or seizures.
Patient was monitored closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal.
Most recent imaging shows slow disease progression.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart failure Hypertension Lymphoma Diabetes, diet controlled   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
AFter waiting 2 days for the metoprolol to wear off, you still had a low heart rate so a pacemaker was placed.
You will need to watch the pacemaker site for any evidence of bleeding, increasing swelling or pain or redness.
No lifting your left arm over your head or lifting more than 5 pounds with your left arm for 6 weeks.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Known lastname **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Start taking Cephalexin three times a day for 2 days to prevent an infection at the pacer site.
