Microbiology: Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2114-5-21**]):                              ESCHERICHIA COLI .
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2114-5-20**]):    NO GROWTH .
Imaging: Most recent CXR: PA and lateral chest radiographs show bilateral low lung volumes.
There is associated mild bibasilar atelectasis and the lungs are otherwise clear.
Scattered air-filled loops of small bowel are partially visualized.
Interval placement of a pigtail catheter in the right subhepatic fluid collection with interval decrease in size.
The fluid collection in the right paracolic gutter has slightly decreased in size.
Unchanged large midline pelvic fluid collection posterior to the bladder.
Slight worsening of bibasilar lower lobe collapse and small bilateral pleural effusion.
[**2114-5-29**] CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a 6.3 x 5.4-cm well-defined fluid collection posterior to the bladder appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.
Residual sessile adenoma (up to 4.0 cm in greatest dimension, located 2.5 cm from distal colonic resection margin) with foci of high grade dysplasia; no invasive adenocarcinoma identified.
Associated fibrosis, mild architectural distortion and mural anthracotic pigment deposition, consistent with prior polypectomy and ink tattooing.
Additional incidental adenoma (0.1 cm).
Ileal segment with no diagnosis abnormalities recognized.
Appendix with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
No intrinsic colonic mucosal abnormalities otherwise recognized.
Thirteen regional lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/13).
Colonic perforation with surrounding coagulative-type necrosis of muscularis propria and transmural acute inflammation.
Severely active colitis with ulceration surrounding perforation site.
Ileocolonic anastomosis intact.
He was on heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
On the afternoon of [**5-18**], the patient developed fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia with O2 Sat 85% on RA, improving to 95% on 3L.
Labs revealed leukopenia (2.9K, decreased from 10k the day prior) with 34% bands.
CXR was notable for pneumonperitoneum.
A bowel leak was discovered, thought to be secondary to a thermal injury, with gross stool in the peritoneal cavity.
In addition, he was on 6L face mask satting 94% and mildly tachypneic (RR 20).
He was transferred to the MICU and found to have a pansensitive E. coli bacteremia and was treated with Flagyl/Vanco/Cipro.
Respiratory distress likely [**1-22**] ARDS from sepsis/surgical stress, as well as from restrictive physiology [**1-22**] pain/distention in the abdomen given low lung volumes.
Patient continued to have fevers ranging to 101F at the time of transfer to the floor.
Anxiety: Patient become very anxious at night requiring prn haldol.
Most likely secondary to sepsis.
He was transferred to the floor on [**5-24**] with improving oxygentation, decreased fever curve but never afebrile.
A CT abd/pelvis on [**5-25**] revealed right upper quadrant fluid collection with multiple smaller additional right retroperitoneal fluid pockets which may be in continuity with the largest right upper quadrant collection as well as a large midline pelvic fluid collection.
On [**5-25**] he had IR guided aspiraiton of both collecitons with RUQ collection growing enterococcus and pelvic colleciton with GNR.
On [**5-30**], repeat CT showed that the subhepatic fluid collection extends in the paracolic gutters and has slightly decreased in size compared to the prior study now measuring maximally 4.7 x 2.4 cm.
The fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space has also decreased in size now measuring maximally 5.6 x 1.7 cm.
No free intra-abdominal air is noted.
Patient c/o of multiple loose stools, c-diff was negative and imodium was started with good effect.
