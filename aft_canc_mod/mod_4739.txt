Brief Hospital Course: 86yo M w/hx of SCC s/p XRT who presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia and multifocal PNA.
# Multifocal pneumonia: Pt started on vancomycin, unasyn, and levofloxacin to cover CAP v. aspiration pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient.
Pt was initially maintained on face mask overnight but weaned easily to NC, satting 92% on 4L on transfer to the floor.On the floor had episodes of desaturation to 80's.
Repeat cxr showed development of pleural effusions,rt>lt and worsening of consolidation.Unasyn was switched to zosyn and pt also underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic rt sided thoracentesis.
1 lit of fluid was drained which was c/w a non-complicated parapneumonitic effusion.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Attributed to multifocal PNA as above as well as volume overload which developed after INF hydration for hypotension.
No PE seen on CTA chest.
Initial concern for ACS leading to acute CHF (see below) but ruled out; echo showing normal EF.
Hypoxia improved with treatment of pneumonia, thoracentesis and diureses.On d/c pt'd O2 sat 99 on 3 lit per NC.Pt also likely has COPD and was treated with nebs and started on advair.
Shock: Likely combination of septic and hypotensive shock.
Pt treated for pneumonia as above; cultures were all negative.He was also fluid-resuscitated and weaned off low-dose norepinephrine.
As above, no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
NSTEMI: ECG with lateral ST depressions and mild ST elevation in v1/v2.
However, Cards fellow felt this was more consistent with early repolarization from LVH.
Echo with no wall motion abnormality and normal EF.
# New onset atrial fibrillation: Did not aggresively rate control for HR in low 100?????
?s initially given underlying hypotension.
No evidence of PE on CTA.
Left atrium markedly dilated and right atrium moderately dilated on TTE.
Thought likely due to increased sympathetic tone in setting of illness and hypovolemia.
He was initially treated with restarting metoprolol, however,given recurrent episodes of RVR and COPD , metoprolol was discontinued and pt started on a low dose of diltiazam.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pre-renal in setting of hypovolemia and shock.
Stool studies ordered, but pt without further diarrhea while in-house...  #.
