Admission Date:  [**2129-11-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-11-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2062-6-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old woman who presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] approximately a year after an episode of acute pancreatitis attributed to alcohol abuse.
At the time of that pancreatitis episode, she had a CT scan which revealed a small pseudo cyst.
However, on recent CT scan, she was found to still have a small cyst, under the size of one cm, in the head of her pancreas.
Clinically, she remained well over the previous year, without fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or other troubles.
In [**2129-9-19**], she developed rapid onset of painless jaundice.
CT scan at this time revealed only dilated extra hepatic biliary tract.
She had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a dilated common bile duct and gallbladder but no evidence of common bile duct stones.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed and a high grade focal stricture of the distal common bile duct was observed.
The patient denies fevers, chills or other symptoms of cholangitis.
She also denies weight loss, history of cancer or recent exacerbation of alcohol use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; mild mitral insufficiency and an alcohol history of four Manhattans a day.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she has jaundice and has scleral icterus.
She had normal carotid pulses without bruits and no jugular venous distention.
She did have grade II out of 6 mid systolic ejection murmur, heard best at the apex.
Her abdomen was soft, nondistended and nontender.
Postoperatively, she was placed on prophylactic benzodiazepine for possible delirium tremens.
She was also placed on subcutaneous heparin, Zantac, Testall and her pain was controlled with an epidural.
The evening of postoperative day one, her epidural was switched to a PCA for better pain control; however, she was found to be over narcotized and required a Narcan drip to alleviate this problem.
On postoperative day four, she required some Lasix for mild pulmonary edema on clinical examination.
On postoperative day number seven, she was noted to have a large amount of wound drainage and her wound was open for copious amounts of somewhat enteric looking drainage.
She went for CT scan to rule out fistula or leak.
The hematology consult agreed with our management and furthermore, advised holding any anticoagulation, secondary to a risk of bleed, given that her platelet count was only nine.
She was taken to the operating room for exploration of possible abdominal bleed.
Upon opening the abdomen in the operating room, however, the small bowel was found to be entirely infarcted with catastrophic abdominal findings.
