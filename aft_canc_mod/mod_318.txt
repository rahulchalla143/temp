History of Present Illness: 84M with stage 4 lung CA s/p 6 cycles carboplatin and pemetrexed (last treatment 8 weeks ago) p/w dyspnea at rest and b/l LE edema.
He was in Poland for past 6 weeks and per family report began to accumulate edema and progressive DOE along with periodic low-grade fevers over past 3 weeks.
He returned to the USA on Sunday partially due to progression of these symptoms, and at that time his daughter (a physician) observed he had signficant dyspnea on minimal exertion (walking a few feet) and had pitting edema of the ankles.
Since Sunday his symptoms have worsened, with dyspenia at rest and difficulty catching his breath as well as increased edema to the knees.
The chest CT performed [**2171-7-22**] revealed several new lung nodules as well as a moderate right pleural effusion.
His oncologist sent him to the emergency department for treatment of hypoxia and thoracentesis of the effusion.
He complained of difficulty breathing and non-productive coughing, but denied chest pain/pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, or any other pain.
He had R thoracentesis with removal of 2 liters of exudative fluid.
Thoracentesis helped somewhat but still requiring oxygen and still tachypneic, though significantly improved.
Tachypneic, some abdominal rounding Anicteric, PERRL, MMM with no OP lesions.
JVD to [**1-17**] ASA with significant drop during inspiration Neck supple, no adenopathy Heart regular, borderline tachy.
Lungs with symmetric expansion, L posterior with expiratory wheezing and fine crackles at base; R posterior with coarse crackles throughout (basilar [**Last Name (un) 11840**]) Abdomen +BS, soft, NT.
Extrem warm, [**12-16**]+ LE edema, no sacral edema.
Several new nodules in the right lung concerning for metastatic disease.
Mixed response of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with decrease in size of pretracheal nodes and increase in size of left paraaortic nodes.
Increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate in size.
Increased atelectasis in the right lower and middle lobes.
Stable appearance of lymphangitic spread in the right lung.
No evidence of intra-abdominal metastatic disease.
No pulmonary embolism.
S/p right throacentesis with small residual effusion.
Extensive right lower and middle lobe consolidation and interlobular septal thickening progressed since [**7-22**] and concerning for extensive tumor spread and superimposed PNA (rather than atelectasis).
Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
No left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 84yo man with metastatic NSCLC admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia.
Thoracentesis drained ~2Lve cytology was positive for malignancy.
Family meeting discussed poor prognosis and limited options for treatment of malignancy.
However, continued treatment of acute illness was desired by family.
CTA chest showed no evidence of a PE and a cardiac echo showed no evidence of heart failure.
# Hypoxia: Due to progression of disease with evidence of lymphangitic spread, pneumonia, and malignant effusion.
Broadened coverage for bacterial pneumonia with ceftriaxone ([**2171-7-26**]) and azithromycin ([**2171-7-25**])followed by vanco and zosyn, without significant clinical benefit.CTA negative for PE and cardiac echo without evidence of heart failure.
# Metastatic NSCLC: Multiple family meetings took place with the assistance of the palliative service.
After ruling out other possible causes contributing to hypoxia pt was transitioned to hospice care and discharged  home with hospice services.Pt was started on low doses of oral morphine to help alleviate symptoms of sob.
Anemia labs consistent with  anemia of inflammation.
# Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis: Reactive, due to infection or tumor.
# Hyperlipidemia: Discontinued atorvastatin given evidence transaminitis  and short life expectancy.
# BPH: Continued doxazosin.
# DVT PPx: Enoxaparin for hypercoagulable state/ h/o brain emboli.
# Precautions: None.
# Lines: Peripheral.

Shortness of breath.
Metastatic lung cancer.
Malignant effusion (fluid on the lung due to cancer).
Pneumonia (lung infection).
Fever   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname 11841**] was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.
This was due to a combination of fluid in the right lung (pleural effusion), pneumonia (lung infection), and progression of lung cancer.
The fluid was caused by the cancer and drained by the pulmonary specialists.
A chest CT-angio was negative for a pulmonary emboli ( lung clot) and an echocardiogram showed good heart function.
MEDICATION CHANGES: 1. discontinued atorvastatin because of mildly elevated liver function tests.
Liquid morphine 2.5 mg four times daily for shortness of breath 5.
Ativan as needed for shortness of breath   Followup Instructions: Please contact Dr [**Name (NI) **] for any questions or concerns.
