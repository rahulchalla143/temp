History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old female with metastatic uterine cancer diagnosed [**8-/2133**] s/p TAH, DM2, HTN who presents with acute onset of substernal chest pain beginning this morning at 1AM.
The patient went to bed in her usual state of health and awoke at 1AM with a substernal burning which she attributed to heartburn.
She tried to go back to sleep and was successful on and off until 6AM when the pain increased from [**1-10**] to [**5-9**].
At this point the pain was more of a tightness sensation.
She had some mild radiation to her left shoulder and had associated nausea and diaphoresis.
No vomiting or shortness of breath.
EKG showed ST elevations and cath lab was activated.
In terms of her oncologic history she initially presented with abnormal uterine bleeding and underwent biopsy.
She was diagnosed with stage 1b lesion and underwent radiation.
She was subsequently found to have a breast lesion and multiple abdominal lesions consistent with endometrial biopsy.
At baseline she is able to ambulate [**12-2**] mile without shortness of breath or chest pain.
She feels 100% better, chest pain free.
No complaints.
Hysterectomy for uterine cancer on [**2133-8-31**] treated with [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol.
History of pulmonary embolism for which she has completed her  Coumadin therapy.
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Hypertension .
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed: --the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had a 60% stenosis at D1; D1 had a 60% origin stenosis.
--the LCX had mild diffuse disease.
--the RCA was extremely tortuous with steep angulation, and had a proximal 50-60% stenosis with total occlusion distally.
There was severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 177 mmHg.
Final angiography revealed a 30% residual stenosis in the RCA, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
Acute inferior STEMI 2.
Two-vessel CAD with distal RCA occlusion 3.
Systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior posterior wall and akinesis of the midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old female with metastatic endometrial cancer s/p TAH, DM2, HTN presented with inferior STEMI now s/p PTCA of distal RCA with newly depressed EF of 30-40%.
#CAD: Risk factors include hypertension and diabetes mellitus presents with inferior STEMI found to have 2 vessel CAD now s/p PTCA of distal RCA.
Chest pain free since intial presentation.
Nitrates if recurrence of chest pain.
Repeat echo on admission demonstrated new left and right ventricular contractile dysfunction with EF 30-40%.
Patient on optimal heart failure regimen.
# Metastatic endometrial CA: Had appt on day of admission.
No active issues.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a catheterization with a balloon procedure to your right coronary artery.
You may find that you retain fluid and notice that your feet are swelling or you develop some shortness of breath.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any chest pain, trouble breathing, nausea, dizziness or lightheadedness.
