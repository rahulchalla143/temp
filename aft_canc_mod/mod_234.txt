HEENT: Left frontal cranial deformity present nontender, nonerythematous .
b/l diffuse LAD Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
No rebound or guarding.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
INDICATION: Metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting.
CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is a large infiltrative sclerotic lesion in the left frontal calvarium, with an extensive extracranial soft tissue component, likely representing a metastatic lesion from the patient's known prostate cancer, more extensive than the prior study of [**4-2**].
This may represent hemorrhage into the metastatic lesion extending into the left frontal lobe, or focal hemorrhage in the left frontal parenchyma itself.
Additionally, there may be a small subarachnoid component both at this level and higher up towards the vertex on the left, seen best on series 2, image 22-24.
There is a small adjacent left parafalcine subdural hematoma.
There is no discernible midline shift of the adjacent falx.
There is at least one other suspicious area in the right superior parietal calvarium for an additional metastatic lesion, with an adjacent convex hypersenity, possibly a small extraaxial hematoma.
There is extensive vascular calcification in the cavernous carotids and vertebro-basilar arteries.
IMPRESSION: 1) Large left frontal calvarium based metastatic lesion with hemorrhagic extension into the left frontal parenchyma, and extracranial soft tissue extension.
There is mild surrounding vasogenic edema, but no shift of the adjacent midline falx.
There appears to be a small component of subarachnoid blood within a sulcus adjacent to the metastatic lesion, and also higher up near the left vertex.
Mild surrounding vasogenic edema, without shift of the midline falx.
2) Second metastatic lesion in the right superior frontoparietal calvarium, with probable adajcent small extraxial hematoma.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2152-2-15**] 10:15 AM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  Reason: Need to assess for possible resection Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old man with history of prostate ca, now with head bleed underlying mass REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Need to assess for possible resection CLINICAL INFORMATION: Need to assess for possible resection.
The lesion involving the left frontal bone has an extracranial and intracranial component.
There is some associated parenchymal hemorrhage in the subjacent location.
There is also parafalcine subdural hemorrhage and some subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe.
The lesion in the right parietal region does not clearly have a soft tissue component either extracranially or intracranially, although there is a small question whether there are prominent veins or a small intracranial extension on the medial aspect of the lesion on the coronal post-gadolinium study.
There also appears to be a small degree of hemorrhage in the brain subjacent to this lesion.
Additional metastatic lesions are not identified.
There is no evidence of abnormal diffusion to suggest the presence of acute infarction.
IMPRESSION: The lesion in the left frontal lobe has an intracranial extension which may involve the subjacent brain.
The lesion in the right parietal lobe does not clearly extend into the brain but there does appear to be some subjacent hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **], [**Known lastname 780**] is a 62 year-old man presented with 24 hours of aphasia and mild confusion, 1 day of blurry vision and chills, sudden onset of severe HA with fever up to 102.2 Patient seen and evaluated in ED  and transferred to ICU for neurologic monitoring.
MRI of the brain showed left frontal lesion involving the bone has an extracranial and intracranial component.
There is some associated parenchymal hemorrhage in the subjacent location.
There is also parafalcine subdural hemorrhage and some subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe.
The lesion in the right parietal region does not clearly have a soft tissue component either extracranially or intracranially.
Patient was monitored closely with pain and other symptomatology improving over the next few days.
