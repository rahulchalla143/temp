Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: icteric sclera, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: ERCP The major papilla was protuberant and fleshy- likely representing hyperplastic response from prior long-term plastic CBD stent.
We did not biopsy this area given other ERCP evidence concerning for cholangitis.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
There was evidence of pus drainage shortly after introduction of the sphincterotome.
There was a stricture involving the common hepatic duct and bifurcation.
There was severe upstream dilation in the right intrahepatic system, with filling defects suggestive of stones.
There was signficant irregular stricturing throughout the visualized left intrahepatic system.
The common bile duct appeared normal, although contrast opacification was limited given evidence of cholangitis.
Several stone fragments and a moderate amount of pus was extracted successfully using a balloon.
A 9cm by 10FR biliary biliary stent was placed successfully, entering the right intrahepatic system, with immediate drainage of pus and bile.
Otherwise normal ERCP to 3rd portion of the duodenum .

# Cholangitis: Given pus observed on ERCP, cholangitis was felt likely.
She was monitored for 24 hours after the change without fevers, changes in symptoms or any other complaints.
# Hypotension: Following placement of biliary stent, felt likely due to the significant instrumentation and transient bacteremia.
The patient was also likely hypovolemic, dehydrated from generally not feeling well (nausea, weakness).
Likely early sepsis vs. SIRS.
Patient remained borderline hypotensive with BP ~100/50 but responded to fluid boluses and resuscitation.
# H/O Breast Cancer - Continued on tamoxifen .
