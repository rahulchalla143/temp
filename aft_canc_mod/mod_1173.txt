Neutropenic fever: She had no obvious infectious etiology, CXR notable only for intersitial markings c/w pulmonary edema or drug reaction.
Changed cefepime to ciprofloxacin when she was afebrile and no longer neutropenic.
Hypotension: This was likely due to poor po, relative adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, or cardiomyopathy from adriamycin.
Pt responded to IVF boluses and stress dose steroids which support sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and hypovolemia.
Metastatic sarcomatoid kidney cancer: s/p 1st cycle chemotx and will continue chemotherapy as an outpatient.
Addison's: She had erratic and uncontrolled BP while receiving chemotherapy.
CRI: Baseline creatinine is 1.5, and she did not have worsening renal function during this admission.
Neutropenic Fevers 2.
Addison's disease   Discharge Condition: Afebrile and no longer neutropenic; still requiring 2L NC for ambulation.
