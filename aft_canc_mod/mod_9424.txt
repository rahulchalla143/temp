Since he uses oxygen at home with 3 L NC due to his secondary diagnoses of severe COPD and ILD he is very sensitive to minor changes in his left ventricular function.
The patient had an echocardiogram that did not show any evidence of diastolic dysfunction and his BNP was not checked upon admission.
However, he clinically presented as acute on chronic heart failure that required BiPAP, hemodialysis and UF to manage fluid status.
These strengthen the evidence of diastolic heart failure.
