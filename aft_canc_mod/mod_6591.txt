FINDINGS: The sagittal T2 inversion recovery images demonstrate no definite evidence of abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
Mild heterogeneity of the cord signal throughout the thoracic region appears artifactual.
There is mild disc bulging seen at T2-T3, T5-6 and T7-T8 levels slightly indenting the thecal sac.
At T2-3the, there is a small central protrusion seen with minimal indent to the anterior aspect of the spinal cord.
There is no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection identified.
No abnormal signal seen within the vertebral bodies.
IMPRESSION: No definite abnormal signal seen within the thoracic spinal cord.
Mild degenerative changes are also seen at other levels in thoracic region.
No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 3905**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3906**] Approved: SUN [**2119-5-28**] 6:57 PM  HISTORY: Recent ascending aortic arch replacement due to type A dissection with decreased movement of right leg since surgery.
Assess for cord injury.
Slight loss of normal bright T2 signal surrounding the thecal sac is also present which may relate to some re-distribution of patient's known prior subarachnoid hemorrhage.
This limits evaluation for any focal cord edema or pathology.
Minimal multilevel degenerative bulges are noted without any significant foraminal or canal compromise.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: Conus medullaris terminates at approximately L1-L2 interspace of the distal cord and exiting nerve roots appear unremarkable.
Abnormal increased T2/STIR signal is noted within the posterior paravertebral muscles and the subcutaneous fat which may relate to prolonged bed rest or other etiologies such as rhabdomyolysis.
The overall signal within the vertebral bodies is slightly abnormal with increased fatty content within the marrow for patient age.
No focal spinal cord or vertebral body lesions are noted.
A mild disc bulge is noted at the L3-L4 interspace causing mild right foraminal narrowing but no significant central canal, lateral recess, or left foraminal narrowing.
At L4-L5 there is diffuse disc bulge which results in mild bilateral foraminal narrowing but no significant narrowing of the lateral recesses or central canal.
Incidentally detected on the large field of view images is posterior disc protrusions at the C5-C6 and as C6-C7 interspaces with mild mass effect on the ventral aspect of the cord noted at C5-C6.
Some mild mucus cysts are noted in the maxillary sinuses.
Difficult evaluation of the signal within the thoracic cord due to motion and pulsation artifacts.
If there remains clinical concern for a focal postoperative thoracic cord infarct would recommend repeating the thoracic spine imaging when feasible.
Mild spondylosis within the thoracic and lumbar spines as detailed above.
Partially evaluated disc protrusion noted within the cervical spine which results in mild mass effect on the ventral aspect of the cord at C5-C6.
Increased edema within the posterior paravertebral musculature of uncertain etiology that may to patient's prolonged bed rest.

There is no evidence for gas or gas collections in the mediastinal fluid to suggest presence of abscess.
There are scattered mediastinal nodes which appear stable.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.
There is slight increase in size of left basilar atelectasis with air bronchograms.
There is decreased right basilar atelectasis compared to previous examination.
There are no clearly defined masses or nodules in the chest.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence for sternal dehiscence.
On liver windows there is heterogeneous density of the spleen with the periphery appearing hypodense concerning for infarcts.
The kidneys are unremarkable in their appearance without stones or hydronephrosis.
The liver appears unremarkable without intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There are scattered retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes, none of which reach CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal.
There is trace simple fluid in the left paracolic gutter and adjacent to the liver, increased in volume since the prior examination.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
There is a rectal Flexi-Seal catheter.
Otherwise, the rectum, sigmoid colon and pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
There is no free air in the pelvis.
There is no significant pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.
There are skin staples in the patient's mid abdomen without evidence for dehiscence.
There is no evidence for breakdown of the ventral wall incision.
There are no hernias.
There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Increased simple fluid in the abdomen and pelvis without evidence for abscess or loculated collections.
Stable moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis/consolidation.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Heterogeneous density of the spleen concerning for splenic infarcts.
It consists of multiple fragments of yellow to red soft tissue.
He had 21 minutes of hypothermic circulatory arrest and 2 minutes of cerebral circulatory arrest.
CARDIAC: Experienced paroxsmal atrial fibrillation and was eventually started on Warfarin anticoagulation.
He remained persistently hypertensive and required multiple after-load agents as well rate-control medications.
PULMONARY: Weaned and extubated then required reintubation due to collapse with prolonged intubation, extubated [**5-22**] without complications.
He required placement of left chest tube for pleural effusion.

At discharge, there are no signs of recovery of renal function.
Neurology was consulted and a CT of the head showed no acute intracranial process.
