Progression of multiple bilateral pulmonary metastatic lesions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Progression of right adrenal, likely metastatic lesion.
[**12-5**] AP CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-4**], there is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with multiple pulmonary metastases apparently complicated by a pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists and there is mediastinal widening reflecting diffuse adenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4711**] is a 51 year old male with stage IV clear cell renal carcinoma with known lung mets who presented with worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia.
# Dyspnea, Hypoxia - Patient initially required 2L O2 to maintain O2 sats 94%.
Chest x-ray demonstrated worsening bilateral patchy opacities.
His hypoxia and dyspnea are most likely secondary to his widespread pulmonary metastatic disease.
He was given morphine and nebs to treat his dyspnea and guiafenesin with codeine and benzonatate for cough.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:  He recently completed a cycle of Sutent.
He has stage 4 disease with poor prognosis.
He is being discharged to inpatient hospice for further symptom management and due to his high oxygen requirement.
Hypercalcemia:  Patient was noted to have elevated calcium on presentation.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient had intermittently elevated serum potassiums that peaked at 5.2.
Etiology is unclear but may be secondary to dexamethasone or tumor burden causing increased lactate due to increased metabolic demand.
There was no evidence of renal failure or acidemia.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Requires 50% face tent to maintain O2 sats > 93%   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of shortness of breath.
While you were here, you had imaging which showed that the cancer in your lungs has progressed and is likely what is causing your symptoms.
There is no further treatment available for your cancer at this time.
