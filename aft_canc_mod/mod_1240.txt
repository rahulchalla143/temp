Admission Date:  [**2102-4-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-4-25**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year-old woman with a history of CLL, breast cancer and gallstones status post cholecystectomy who comes in with right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting.
The patient reports that she had seven days of pain prior to admission and developed nausea, vomiting and right upper quadrant pain that was progressive and worse over the last four days.
She reported that one week ago she had suprapubic tube replaced, which she has chronically for a history of post obstructive bladder obstruction.
She gets it replaced every two weeks without discomfort.
Her urine became dark colored and the tube was replaced again.
Four days ago the patient had nausea and vomiting that was worse and nonbloody, watery in nature.
The patient lost her appetite and had pain in both lower quadrants.
She had pain in the axilla and back, which was now improved after the tube had been changed.
The patient had fevers to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
No lightheadedness or dizziness.
No weight loss.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 4527**] for concern of cholangitis and started on Amp, Levo and Flagyl with blood cultures drawn prior to antibiotics initiation.
Pertinent physical examination findings included icteric sclera.
Dry mucous membranes.
Normal heart sounds and no murmurs.
Right upper quadrant tenderness with left lower quadrant tenderness.
No rebound tenderness.
Diminished bowel sounds, soft and nondistended abdomen.
The patient had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally with chronic venostasis and lower extremity skin changes.
Her blood cultures from the outside hospital grew out Ampicillin resistant Klebsiella in two out of four bottles.
CT abdomen revealed intrahepatic biliary dilatation with a question mass in the pancrease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography laboratory where multiple stones were found in the common bile duct consistent with choledocholithiasis.
The patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit for one day due to a drop in her hematocrit down to 22 status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
No acute source of bleeding was found and the patient was transfused 2 units of blood and her hematocrit responded appropriately and was stable throughout her hospitalization.
The patient also experienced thrombocytopenia during her admission.
This was thought to also possibly be related to the patient's history of CLL as her white count remained in the 20 to 30,000 range despite appropriate antibiotic treatment.
She was also discovered to have lymphocyte percentage of 100% at certain times and the patient was noted to be neutropenic.
The patient was afebrile throughout the remainder of her admission.
The patient's abdominal pain resolved and her bilirubin trended down to close to normal at the time of discharge.
During the patient's endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography she was noted to have esophageal candidiasis.
The patient was started on a course of Fluconazole, which was adjusted for her chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient was discharged to home despite a physical therapy evaluation that recommended rehabilitation as she had become deconditioned during her hospitalization and was having difficulty getting around and getting up.
The patient had a brief run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and will therefore receive beta blockade for two weeks postoperatively.
Esophageal candidiasis.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
