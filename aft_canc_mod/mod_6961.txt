Increased size of pleural effusions, ascites and diffuse anasarca.
New dilation of the distal pancreatic duct  in the tail (new since [**2146**]), with stable atrophy involving the distal pancreas.
Small amount of fluid adjacent to the body of the pancreas, which was seen in [**2147-11-6**].
Findings may be related to acute on chronic pancreatitis, however exclusion of an underlying neoplasm is recommended.
Enhancing nodular area within the head of the pancreas measuring 8 mm is unchanged from [**2146-9-5**], could be a neuroendocrine tumor.
Slightly thickened and edematous duodenum and jejunum may be from duodenitis/jejunitis versus third spacing.
[**2147-12-12**] EGD Ulcers with overlying eschar in the first, second, and third part of the duodenum Normal mucosa in the antrum (biopsy) Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus compatible with esophagitis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**2147-12-13**] Video/barium swallow 1.
Unchanged mild narrowing of the distal esophagus.
[**2147-12-14**] CXR (portable) FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural effusion have substantially increased in extent and severity.
Mild pulmonary edema is present.
Areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases.
Unchanged appearance of the right PICC line    Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo male with hx of ETOH, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears and fatty liver p/w weakness at home with associated poor PO intake initially admitted to the MICU with hypotension requiring pressor support.
He was dependent on three pressors and persistently hypoxemic and acidemic despite ventilatory support, showing signs of multi-organ system failure.
# Hypotension/Shock- Patient noted to have hypotension of unclear etiology which has failed to improve with the administration of IVF and initially requiring pressor support on admission.
There is clearly a component of volume depletion as the patient is visibly dry on exam.
No clear infectious source to suggest a septic picture (normal WBC, nml CXR, nml UA, effusion on exam but exam not c/w a septic joint).
The patient does have a history of hypothyroidism but reports compliance with levothyroxine therapy.
No hx of bleeding and HCT is stable from previously documented baseline.
EKG findings is concerning for cardiac etiology namely effusion with possible tamponade however reassuringly there is no evidence of JVD or cardiomegaly on CXR.
PE is on ddx given history of dyspnea but this is less likely.
The patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated during his ICU course, with a total net positive of almost 18L, and weaned off of pressors but despite this he continued to have low SBPs in the 80-90 range with low measured CVPs.
Adrenal insufficiency was entertained as a diagnosis, however his cortisol was wnl and there was no mention of atrophic adrenal glands on his CT scan, and on a trial of hydrocortisone his BPs were minimally responsive, if at all.
Hypothyroid contributing to his picture is a possibility, however his TSH is minimally elevated and he has been stable on his dose of thyroid replacement for quite some time.
The leading diagnoses for this patient at the time of transfer to the floor are autonomic dysfunction vs possible adrenal insuffiency.
On [**2147-12-14**], patient found to have T <[**Age over 90 **]F, short of breath and hypotension in the low 100s.
CXR revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
He was showing signs of multisystem organ failure including worsening hypoxemia and kidney failure.
# Weakness/Malnutrition - Likely related to poor PO intake and generalized deconditioning.
Wt loss is certainly concerning for possible malignancy, immunsuppression or TB given findings on CT chest.
#) Duodenal ulcers: EGD showed significant ulcers in the duodenum which may explain his difficulty with po intake.
CT abdomen showed a hypoattenuating mass at the head of the pancreas, which was suspcious for possible gastrinoma.
Unclear if mass is malignancy (pancreatic or lymphoma) vs. CMV infection vs. pseudocyst secondary to alcohol use.
Elevated TSH and free T4 of 0.84 on [**12-1**] suggests noncompliance or need for higher dose of levothyroxine.
Switched to IV for concern for low intestinal absorption due to diarrhea and thickened colonic mucosa per CT. Hypothyroidism likely contributing to the weakness.
Per derm consult unlikely to be specific vitamin deficiency syndrome, most likely xerosis and age-related changes.
No corkscrew hairs which herald scurvy.
He receieved repletion with vitamin C, MVI and thiamine during his ICU course, as well as Aquaphor lotion for his xerosis.
#) THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Allergic to heparin products, not receiving them here, but central line was coated in heparin.
Also possibly secondary to bone marrow suppression from inflammation vs TTP.
Also possible cirrhosis given presence of ascites.
No evidence of active bleeding, although meets criteria for transfusion with hemoglobin of 7.0.
Likely secondary to alcohol.
No evidence of active bleeding and folate and vitB12 are normal.
Elevated ferritin with high transferrin saturations concerning for hemochromatosis.
In addition, macrocytic anemia with thrombocytopenia can be a result of MDS/Myeloma/POEMS syndrome.
Peripheral smear only shows many target cells, possibly from underlying alcoholic liver disease.
No hx of withdrawal szs or DTs.
