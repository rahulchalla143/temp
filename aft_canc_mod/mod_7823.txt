Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed two veseel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA has minimal disease.
The LAD has a 90% ostial stenosis and a 40% distal stenosis.
There is a 80% stenosis in the mid diagonal branch.
The RCA has minimal disease.
Echo [**2104-2-22**]: Pre Bypass: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Incidental note made of a possible web versus artifact at the pa branch point which was not flow limiting.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-24**], there may be a tiny residual left apical pneumothorax.
Some increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle is consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.
There may also be a small effusion with minimal atelectasis on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service after an ETT showed marked ST segment depressions in the inferolateral leads.
He was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed multivessel disease.
His medications were adjusted for afterload and cardiac remodeling reduction with metoprolol, and his statin was increased to a maximum dose.
He continued to progress and was ready for discharge with services on post operative day four.
