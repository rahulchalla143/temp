Admission Date:  [**2129-7-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-9-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Nitrofurantoin / Primaquine / Nalidixic Acid / Dapsone / morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 59601**] is a 30 year old woman with recurrent HTLV-1 associated peripheral T-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement s/p [**Hospital1 **]/CHOP x 6, ESHAP x 3, ICE x 2, 6 doses of Pralatrexate (last given on [**2129-5-2**]), MTX x4 (last given [**2129-7-7**]), recently discharged from the hospital after HD-MTX and noted to have acinetobacter UTI which has since been treated, presenting to the ED with nausea and severe headache for 2-3 days unresponsive to oxycodone.
Patient states her severe headache started about 2-3 days ago and got progressively worse.
Pain was primarily in L parietal region but spread to involve her whole head.
Pain was constant but not throbbing, and similar to her normal headaches, just worse.
Of note, patient has had a hx of headaches periodically after being diagnosed with CNS involvement in [**Month (only) **].
Has been taking oxycodone as needed, which was controlling headache pain up until a few days ago.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98 92 102/68 18 100% RA  Patient was noted to be in no apparent disterss, A&Ox3 without any acute neurological changes with dry mucous m embranes, but otherwise a benign exam.
Hickman in left thigh was without erythema, tenderness, swelling or bleeding.
Laboratories were notable for normal white count, hematocrit 33.2 (baseline ~32), platelets 211, normal chem10 with exception of slightly elevated phos (4.7), normal transaminases, LDH 327 (200s-400s in [**June 2129**] admission), normal coags other than PTT (16.6), and lactate of 1.2.
CT head was performed, which showed a hypodense area in suprasellar region which might c/w bleed.
MRI was performed, which suggested lymphoma rather than bleed, as well as new sinus involvement concerning for lymphoma.
Ophtho called because of location of bleed vs. lymphoma, and were to come see patient on [**7-26**].
Patient denies scalp tenderness, postural variation, exacerbation by coughing/straining, visual symptoms or changes, aura, fevers/chills, neck pain or stiffness.
Also denies other neurological ROS including loss of vision, blurred vision, double vision, dysarthria, dysphagia, light headedness, vertigo, weakness, changes in sensation, incontinence of stool or urine, difficultly with gait.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: --Initially diagnosed in [**2127-3-22**] after presenting with severe abdominal pain and a CT scan revealed a large intra-abdominal mass.
Biopsy revealed a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Course complicated by admissions for fevers due to bacteremia, line associated DVT, and bilateral pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation with Lovenox.
--High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant was recommended to induce a durable remission given the aggressive nature of her disease, but deferred by [**Known firstname **].
--In [**11/2127**], re-staging PET-CT done without evidence of lymphoma but noted pregnancy; referred to the high-risk obstetrics group and followed regularly throughout her pregnancy.
--At approximately 31 weeks into her pregnancy, admitted with abdominal pain and possible preterm contractions.
Blood work at that time concerning for recurrence of her lymphoma (LDH 641).
MRI, showed a 14-cm abdominal mass and upper abdominal adenopathy.
Biopsy of the mass confirmed recurrence of her previous diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.
She delivered a baby girl on [**2128-6-10**] without complications.
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.
--Treated with ESHAP on [**2128-6-20**] for relapsed disease with complications of ICU transfer with acute shortness of breath and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
--Completed 3 cycles of ESHAP and again achieved a CR with no evidence of disease per repeat scans.
Pheresis catheter placed on [**2128-9-21**] for stem cell collection.
A neck CT demonstrated clot and extensive phlegmon in the carotid, retropharyngeal, and paravertebral spaces.
--AZT and interferon started during this time in an attempt to keep her in remission: however, she had compliance issues with taking AZT 5 times a day and developed fevers with the interferon so treatment discontinued.
--On [**2128-12-7**], noted for new left-sided cervical adenopathy.
CT of her neck showed significantly increased lymphadenopathy along the bilateral jugular chains and left supraclavicular region.
Lymph node biopsy on [**2128-12-15**] was consistent with relapsed lymphoma.
--Received 2 cycles of ICE but continued to have evidence of progressive disease per PET-CT. --Started on pralatrexate on [**2129-3-17**] with plan for 6 weekly doses.
Repeat imaging by PET scan on [**2129-4-22**] showed residual but improved FDG-avid cervical lymphadenopathy with no other adenopathy or FDG-avid disease.
--With now minimal disease and multiple recurrences, next treatment would be consideration of allogeneic transplant.
CT scan showed no intra-abdominal lesions concerning for lymphoma involvement.
Noted for pneumonia, treated with Cefpodoxime.
--[**2129-6-15**], repeat head MRI showed diffuse FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the bilateral medial frontal lobes, caudate head, and subependymal regions of the lateral ventricles, which had decreased in overall intensity in extent compared to the prior exam, especially in the inferomedial frontal lobes.
There are no new areas of FLAIR signal abnormality.
--[**2129-6-16**], 3rd cycle of high dose MTX @ 8000 mg/m2, complicated by increased tranaminases, improved over time.
--[**2129-7-6**], evidence of persistent disease on CSF; LP showed 30-40 WBCs per hpf, suggestive of lymphoma involvment, confirmed with immunophenotyping --[**2129-7-7**], 4th cycle of high dose MTX @ 8000 mg/m2, complicated by increased transaminases, improved over time.
Continued involvement by T cell lymphoma on CSF evaluation.
Hypothyroidism during pregnancy, not currently on thyroid replacement 5.
History of recurrent, catheter-related deep vein thrombosis as well as pulmonary embolism, continues on Lovenox.
She moved here from [**Country 2045**] 13 years ago and was working as a nurses aid at a nursing home prior to her diagosis and chemotherapy.
Family History: Per records, no history of DM, CAD, HLD, HTN, cancer or other inherited disorders.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 98 83 100/62 20 100% RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, uncooperative and unwilling to respond to most questions HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no rebound or guarding GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII grossly intact, sensation/strength grossly intact although patient was uncooperative with full exam, gait deferred Line: tunneled hickmans femoral catheter in left leg (placed [**2129-5-27**])  Discharge exam: NAD.
Oriented, no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Nl S1, S2, no m/r/g.
Given this appearance, as well as the hyperdensity on the most recent comparison CT, and the patient's history of lymphoma, these findings are suggestive of suprasellar lymphoma.
New abnormal soft tissue thickening and signal in the right nasopharynx as above.
Given the intracranial findings already discussed, this is concerning for an additional area of lymphomatous involvement.
New 1.7cm hyperdense lesion in the suprasellar region is concerning for hemorrhage into the pituitary (pituitary apoplexy) given its interval development, with lymphoma or other hyperdense mass lesion also considerations.
Bifrontal hypodensities and ventricular dilation have increased from [**2129-5-12**].
No acute process and no change from [**2129-7-31**].
Slightly prominent ventricles, unchanged from [**7-31**], but new since [**2129-5-12**], some of which may relate to known subependymal disease, as documented previously.
Pituitary and nasopharyngeal masses, unchanged, likely represent lymphomatous involvement  [**8-4**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of the presence of a relatively invariant theta background rhythm.
No clear focal or epileptiform features were identified.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: In comparison to more remote studies, even as recent as [**2129-5-12**], there is marked ventriculomegaly, as well as periventricular hypoattenuation, which also appears progressive.
As suggested in the report of the MR study dated [**2129-5-11**], this may represent progressive communicating hydrocephalus related to lymphomatous involvement of the subarachnoid space, which should be correlated with clinical data.

#Seizures: The patient had 1 absence seizure on the floor and then another witnessed seizure in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] lasting approximately 1 minute and with observed staring and turning of head; she was observed to have bradycardia to the 30s-40s which resolved with resolution of the seizure.
Seizures were thought to be likely secondary to suprasellar mass visualized on MRI, most consistent with recurrent T-cell lymphoma; she did not appear to have other obvious causes for seizure such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoglycemia.
Even after starting Dilantin, she had a breakthrough seizure which was again absence in nature, with eyes deviating to left, lasting approximately 1 minute and resolving on its own.
At that time CTA and CT were recommended; she was unable to get a CTA due to problems with access and receiving contrast, but did get a CT which showed no new process.
A 24 hour EEG was attempted, however the patient removed most of her leads and this was a limited study.
She was maintained on dexamethasone 4mg IV q6h for treatment of edema associated with the mass.
Patient was then re-transferred to the ICU for recurrent seizure.
She did receive whole brain irradiation on [**8-1**], she was restarted on her enoxaparin [**8-1**], but her CT head did not show any acute process including bleeds or edema.
She has a new leukocytosis but has been seizing recently.
She has not had any fevers or other localizing symptoms for infection.
For now, suspect that her acute mental status changes are due to continued seizures, which are likely directly related to her brain mass and subtherapeutic dosing of her anti-epileptic medications.
# Altered mental status: Patient developed altered mental status with symptoms of psychosis several days after initiating dexamethasone.
Patient remained without headache.
Other potential causes were considered, including worsening of CNS process; CT scan performed showed no new findings.
Patient remained without further episodes after starting Zyprexa.
# T cell lymphoma: Patient has known history of persistent CNS disease with her recurrent T cell lymphoma.
She was started on cyberknife radiation for her new suprasellar mass on [**2129-8-1**] for a planned 10 day course.
Patient with severe headaches on admission.
Given abnormalities of pituitary axis, adrenal insufficiency was considered and endocrinology consult was obtained.
Low random serum cortisol but with normal response to ACTH suggested potentially acute injury, according to endocrine.
Endocrinology recommended against stress dose steroids as long as she was on the dexamethasone as mentioned above (given to reduce edema surrounding suprasellar mass).
# Hypothyroidism: Normal TSH but low free T4 suggests sick euthyroid.
However, endocrinology felt that TSH is unreliable in the setting of pituitary disease, and this should be treated like hypothyroidism.
# Recurrent DVT/PE: History of large clot burden in upper extremities, making access challenging.
She was started on a heparin drip on the floor, which was discontinued when there was concern for possible bleeding from her suprasellar mass.
Hgb/Hct remained largely within her normal range throughout the admission, although started to drift down towards end of hospitalization, likely due to iatrogenic causes.
Patient was otherwise hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic, and without evidence of ongoing blood loss.
# Leukocytosis: Patient had a leukocytosis of unclear etiology after seizures.
Was thought to be likely due to recent seizure activity even though patient was not having tonic clonic seizures, so less typical.
Remained afebrile without localizing symptoms, and UA/urine culture and blood culture remained negative.
