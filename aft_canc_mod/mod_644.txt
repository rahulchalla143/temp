Intercostal muscle flap buttress.
Laparotomy and partial esophagectomy with     esophagogastric anastomosis in the left chest.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 16919**] is a 61-year-old woman with 1 year history of recurrent URI-type symptoms.
A chest x-ray ordered by her PCP demonstrated [**Name Initial (PRE) **] suspicious spiculated LLL lung nodule, and CT scan revealed a 5.2-cm juxtahilar superior segment spiculated mass and left hilar lymph node enlargement, as well as esophageal thickening consistent with primary esophageal neoplasm.
Subsequently, she underwent PET scan which revealed a dominant FDG-avid left hilar mass, SUVmax 13.6, centered in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, compatible with bronchogenic carcinoma, as well as low-level FDG-avid nodules at the base of the left upper lobe and in the right lower lobe and FDG avidity in and around the distal esophagus with a thickened wall.
Biopsy obtained on EUS revealed adenocarcinoma, positive staining of the tumor cells with CDX2, variable staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin 7 and few scattered tumor cells staining with cytokeratin 20, with tumor cells nonreactive with TTF-1.
Biopsy obtained on EBUS revealed NSCLC, positive staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, few scattered cells show positive staining with p63, with tumor cells non-reactive with CK20 and CDX2.
Past Medical History: 1) hx bilateral breast CA      - s/p L mastectomy and chemo (CMF) [**2153**] for stage II breast        CA, ER/PR positive      - s/p R mastectomy [**2157**] for stage I breast CA, no adj rx      - s/p bilateral breast reconstruction  2) Squamous cell skin CA excised R thigh [**8-28**], invasive, well-differentiated, at least 3 mm deep, extended to peripheral and deep specimen margins.

[**2176-2-19**]  There is residual left upper lobe atelectasis and interval improvement in the right basilar atelectasis.
[**2176-2-18**] Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm reflecting left lung resection is stable since [**2-15**].
Leftward mediastinal shift has improved.
There is a combination of atelectasis at the base of the post-operative left lung and the gastric pull-up which probably is responsible for most of the opacification at the medial aspect of the left lower lung.
Mild atelectasis in the right lung is new.
No pneumothorax.
Left pleural tubes still present at the base and upper midline left hemithorax.
Esophagus: [**2176-2-21**]  Status post esophagectomy with gastric pull-through, without evidence of a leak.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular free wall is mildly hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No complications or injuries noted   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2176-2-14**] for Left thoracotomy and left lower lobectomy plus lingulectomy.
Intercostal muscle flap buttress.
[**2-17**]: She had rapid atrial fibrillation to the 170's.
Her esophagus study on [**2176-2-21**] revealed no leak.
Her pain was well controlled with Roxicet and motrin.
