We planned to treat this lesion wiht ptca and stenting.
A prowater wire crossed the lesion with minimal difficulty.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated a diffuse CAD with a severe single vessel CAD.
The LAD had 99% ISR of a previously placed proximal Cypher DES; the distal LAD was a small and diffusely diseased vessel.
The LCx had a severe diffuse disease of the OM2 branch and diffuse disease in the distal LCx.
The RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with a diffuse disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic aortic normotension with an SBP of 126 mmHg.
Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated LVEDP and renal dysfunction.
Successful ptca and stenting of the proximal in-stent restenotic LAD lesion with a 3.0x16mm taxus stent which was post-dilated to 3.5mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow (see ptca comments).
Diffuse CAD with a severe ISR of the proxiaml LAD Cypher DES.
ATTENDING STAFF: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] P.   ([**Numeric Identifier 105015**])      Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 71 year old diabetic male with h/o CAD s/p DES x2 to mid/proximal LAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with 2 days of chest pain, positive enzymes.
Post MI echo was significant for depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF= 40%) with apical akinesis, without obvious thrombosis.
Given patients history of severe GI bleeding the decision was made to start patient NOT on Coumadin as patient already hypocoagulable due to aspirin, Plavix and hemodialysis.
During the hospital course, after cardiac catheterization, patient developed mild respiratory distress with O2 saturation as low as 85% however without subjective feelings of shortness of breath or changes in mental status.
Patient appeared sleepy and somnolent on several occasions throughout the day.
We suggest further workup as out patient with sleep studies to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Family & [**Hospital1 1926**] Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction Acute systolic congestive heart failure End stage renal disease on hemodialysis .
Secondary: Hypertension Diabetes mellitus, type 2 Hyperlipidemia Complete heart block status post pacemaker Bilateral adrenal adenomas Diverticulosis Antral polyps Cholelithiasis Status post right CFA pseudoaneurysm repair   Discharge Condition: Afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest pain and found to have a mild heart attack.
After the procedure you developed trouble breathing related to fluid overload and required an overnight stay in the intensive care unit for dialysis.
You were also noted to have poor contraction of a portion of your heart likely due to the heart attack.
The location of this heart dysfunction increases your risk of stroke and therefore starting a medication to thin your blood (coumadin) was discussed with you.
