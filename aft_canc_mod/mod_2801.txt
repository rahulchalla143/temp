Patient noted to have a dramatic HCT drop and abdominal CT revealed a splenic hematoma and quickly underwent splenic artery embolization on [**2121-11-13**].
He was also started on stress dose steroids for suspected adrenal insufficiency in the setting of adrenal metastatis as well as external beam radiation as palliative treatment for his lung CA.
At [**Hospital 1281**] hospital the patient had bronchoscopy and CT imaging and was noted to have a left lower lobe collapse.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further airway management and possible mechanical intervention.

Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery, narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post obstructive consolidation.
Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and dependent consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance most typical for aspiration pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to moderate in the right.
Diffuse metastasis to multiple ribs and the T1 vertebral body, as well as to the left adrenal gland.
Large perisplenic hematoma, likely related to recent finding of splenic artery aneurysm which is status post coiling.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
He had a chest CT overnight which showed --Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery, narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post obstructive consolidation.
--Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and dependent consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance most typical for aspiration pneumonia.
--Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to moderate in the right.
--Diffuse metastasis to multiple ribs and the T1 vertebral body, as well as to the left adrenal gland.
In the AM [**2121-11-18**] the patient had a bedside thoracentesis both therapeutic and diagnostic analyzing his left pleural effusion.
A bronchoscopy was performed and no endobronchial lesions were seen.
The patient will be continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the possibility of a post-obstructive pneumonia.
He was evalutated at the bedside by Dr. [**Name (NI) **] and the interventional pulmonary team using ultrasound which did not reveal any reaccumulation of pleural fluid at the thoracentesis site.
On the day of extubation, the patient's BP had normalized and he had an episode of tachycardia and persistent HTN s/p extubation.
NSC-lung CA: The patient has significant pain related to his mets.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-small cell lung cancer status post thoracentesis and bronchoscopy   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: You are being transferred to [**Hospital 1281**] hospital for further management of your care.
