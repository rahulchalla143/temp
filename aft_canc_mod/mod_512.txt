[**2196-11-22**] Chest X-ray: AP AND LATERAL CHEST: Extensive pleural thickening, volume loss, and rightward mediastinal shift is again identified.
There is again evidence for underlying COPD and the left lung remains clear.
Calcification of mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes is identified, as is a 5 mm calcified pulmonary nodule at the left lung base.
Right midlung calcifications are noted laterally.
No pleural effusion is seen.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch is observed.
Multilevel thoracolumbar spondylosis is noted with severe wedging of T12 and moderate anterior wedging of L2, of unknown chronicity.
Mild degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joints are noted bilaterally.
Chronic pleural thickening, volume loss, and rightward mediastinal shift, though comparison is limited to the report from 3/[**2188**].
COPD with no definite focal consolidation.
[**2196-11-22**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is prominence of the subdural space along the left cerebral convexity which likely represents a left subdural hygroma.
There is no shift of normally midline structures and no acute intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular territoral infarct is observed.
Mild sulcal and ventricular prominence is consistent with age related atrophy.
Mild periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Atherosclerotic calcification and possible aneurysmal dilatation of the cavernous carotid arteries are observed bilaterally.
Bone windows reveal no fracture.
The imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Prominence of the left convexity subdural space likely represents a subdural hygroma.
Possible aneurysmal dilatation of the cavernous carotids bilaterally.
[**2196-11-22**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: Final Report FINDINGS: Volume loss at the right lung base is partially observed with scattered pleural calcifications noted.
The liver demonstrates diffuse fatty infiltration without focal abnormality identified.
The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
A small right renal interpolar hypodense lesion measures 5 mm and is too small to characterize but likely represents a cyst.
Atherosclerotic calcification involving the abdominal aorta and its branches, though the abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.
An irregular collection of extravisceral air is noted adjacent to small bowel loops in the left mid abdomen, extending into the mesentery and surrounding mesenteric vessels.
This likely represents a combination of pneumatosis and free mesenteric air.
No portal venous gas is seen and the celiac, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery appear patent.
There is no evidence for obstruction as orally administered contrast has passed through into proximal colonic loops.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable with a Foley catheter present within the bladder.
A large partially calcified heterogeneous fundal exophytic fibroid is located anteriorly and measures approximately 4.8 x 4.7 cm in greatest axial dimensions.
No free pelvic fluid is seen and no pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are observed.
Bone windows reveal multilevel thoracolumbar degenerative changes with anterior moderate-to-severe wedge compression deformities involving T12 and L2.
Diffuse anasarca and muscle atrophy is noted.
Left abdominal small bowel pneumatosis and free air within the mesentery.
Fibroid uterus.
ADDENDUM: There is marked circumferential wall thickening of a short segment of ascending colon.
These findings are concerning for short segmental [**Last Name (un) **]-colonic intussusception likely secondary to an underlying mass/carcinoma.
Colonoscopy is recommended to evaluation for underlying malignancy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
BACK PAIN: Unclear if this was due to underlying bowel abnormalities or T12/L1 compression fracture.
PNEUMATOSIS, BOWEL WALL THICKENING: Imaging suggests ischemic colitis with peri-vascular free air and possibly some abdominal free air.
Also bowel wall thickening in ascending colon which was a distinct process and likely represents malignancy such as colon cancer.
The patient's blood cultures were negative, she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
She had no elevation in her white blood cell count.
Her abdomen remained soft and the patient had minimal tenderness on exam.
She had diarrhea which may have been due to her underlying abdominal problems or side effects of antibiotics.
MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: The patient presented with some confusion and disorientation at home.
During this hospitalization, she continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status changes.
She was confused at times, especially at night, and was having visual and auditory hallucinations.
She was given Zyprexa 2.5mg with little effect and then Ativan 0.25mg PO q6 hours.
She had a head CT with no evidence of bleeding, had no clear signs of infection such as UTI or pneumonia and no metabolic cause of delerium.
Her TSH was checked and she was slightly hypothyroid but with a normal TSH.
It was felt that her most likely cause for delerium was her intra-abdominal process with bowel ischemia or perforation causing free air.
LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA: Due to worsening LE edema, she had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed some signs of diastoic dysfunction but normal ejection fraction.
It was felt that her edema was likely secondary to poor nutritional status and hypoalbuminemia.
Compazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO q 6 hours PRN as needed for nausea.
Pneumatosis  Secondary Diagnoses: 2.
Hypokalemia   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, weak   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for back pain and found to have air in your abdomen which was concerning for small bowel perforation or low blood flow to the intestines.
You were also found to have thickening of your bowel wall which is concerning for cancer.
