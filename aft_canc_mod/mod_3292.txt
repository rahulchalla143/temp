The etiology is uncertain, but differential diagnosis includes includes infectious or inflammatory process, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic or hypersensitivity pneumonia and pulmonary edema superimposed on severe emphysema.

Pt covered empirically X 4 days on Vanco/Levo/Flagyl, d/c Vanco [**2153-2-6**], and continued Levo/Flagyl to complete 7 day course given history of liver abscess in past.
Hypotension, Fever on admission thought to be [**1-11**] Septic-picture:  with no clear source.
However low BP, documented fever at OSH, and hx of chills makes infection likely.
