In [**2179-1-19**] pt admitted with ESRD found to be Glomerular Sclerosis attributed to her lymphoma.
Pt's daughter noticed the pt became increasingly short of breath while in the rehab home and transferred her back to the hospital for evalution.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt found to be confused and lethargic and was emergently intubated for airway protection and increasing respiratory distress.
Inititial CXR showed LLL collapse, B effusions and evidence of CHF.
Repeat CXR post intubation showed re-expansion of L lung but persistence of bilateral effusions.
CTA in the Emergency room ruled out acute pulmonary emboli.
No episodes of hypotension.
ESRD- glomerular sclerosis consistent with end stage disease, likely from the lymphoma-- started on HD [**2179-2-11**] 3.
Atrial Fibrillation on verapamil and atenolol 4.
Hypertension 5.
Anemia from chronic disease 6.
Congestive heart Failure (EF 20%) 7.
[**Name (NI) **] daughters are [**Name2 (NI) **] Scientists; husband and sons are not, but are supportive of her religious beliefs and of her decisions in the past and presently about treatment.
Family History: There is no family history of cancer, renal disease, or MI.

Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old female with history of lymphoblastic lymphoma started on CVP (Cytotoxan, vincristine and prednisone) last month.
Admitted to hospital with increasing respiratory distress requiring intubation for airway support.
CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion with concern for pneumonia and echo obtained on [**3-2**] confirmed a markedly decreased ejection fraction of 20%.
Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated in the ED for airway protection and increasing respiratory distress.
Chest CT angiogram ruled out acute pulmonary emboli.
Initial chest x ray showed bilateral pleural effusions and along with a retrocardiac opacity and bibasilar collapse.
Etiology of her respiratory failure thought to be multifactoral including volume overload in the context of her CHF and pneumonia.
Cultures obtained and patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for her community acquired pneumonia.
Pt was also started on both albuterol and atrovent for maximal bronchodilation.
Pt's sputum cultures grew out oropharyngeal flora and her blood cultures remained negative throughout her admission.
She continued her dialysis sessions with a goal of [**2-18**].5kg fluid removed daily.
Encourage incentive spirometry to lower risk of recurrence of pneumonia.
Hold albuterol given history of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Neuro / Psych - Mental status improved to baseline with difficulty word finding, mild anxiety, and occasional mild confusion.
ESRD - secondary to focal glomerulosclerosis likely from involvement of lymphoma.
Discontinued phosphate binder for low phosphate as per renal consultation.
Pt presented with bilateral pleural effusions and was diuresed.
Found to be in atrial fibrillation and started on an esmolol drip in the unit.
[**Date Range **] obtained on [**3-2**] showed a marked decrease ejection fraction of 20% with global LV hypokinesis aside from the inferior and posterior walls.
Echo also revealed a severly dilated RA and RV.
Gentle use of beta blockers to control rate because the patient may need the tachycardia to offset her markedly depressed EF of 20%.
Continue to hold her calcium channel blockers given her low ejection fraction and propensity for extensive lower extremeity edema.
Now, she is likely not a good candidate for aggresive anticoagulation given the extensive tumor burden.
Anemia - thought to be due to anemia of chronic disease, likely from lymphoma, chemotherapy, and ESRD.
She will follow up with oncology in 1 month to determine future need for chemotherapy.
Continue renally dosed allopurinol for prevention of tumor lysis syndrome.
Prophylaxis - protonix, subcutaneous heparin Nutrition - Encourage oral intake.
