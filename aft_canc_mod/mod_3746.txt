- Increase in size of multiple perihepatic masses adjacent to the inferior aspect of the liver in comparison to the prior study.
Due to concern for thrombus risk in his prosthetic aortic heart valve, heparin was started and then bridged back to coumadin when it appeared he was not having large amounts of bleeding.
His records had been reviewed by oncology at this institution and it was determined that this was the most appropriate medication given the type of tumor although there was a risk for bleeding.
On [**12-16**] he was ordered for bowel prep to attempt a colonoscopy on [**12-17**] and on the morning of [**12-17**] he had multiple large volume bowel movements that were very bloody.
Bowel movements since the time of the procedure have been brown with no evidence of bleeding.
