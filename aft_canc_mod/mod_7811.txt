Per OMR and his daughter, he was discharged [**2123-9-1**] from [**Hospital1 18**] after admission for orthostatic hypotension on florinef.
His daughter called his PCP office on [**2123-9-6**] concerned for worsening back pain, and on [**2123-9-8**] called EMS when symptoms worsened to prevent ambulation.
Of note, the patient has a known T12-L1 compression fracture 2/2 MM with mets elsewhere.
He notes decreased appetite and poor PO intake with associated 30 pound wt loss over the last several months.
Nothing new was found and he was going to be admitted for pain control.
He then developed acute mental status changes and labs were checked.
He had a u/a which suggests possible infection and he was given ciprofloxacin.
His chemistries returned and he had hyponatremia to 122.
He was given a total of 4 L NS with little change to his mental status.
During this time, he also had a non-contrast head CT which was negative for acute process and he had a non-contrast CT torso which was negative for acute process but showed atherosclerosis and aneurysms of the aorta and iliac arteries on prelim read.

#Altered Mental Status: multifactorial toxic metabolic encephalopathy with contributions from hypovolemic hyponatremia [**3-6**]  to poor po intake, delirium [**3-6**] narcosis, malnutrtion, infection; and UTI.
Neurology was consulted re: fluent speech with paraphasic errors and word finding difficulties greater than baseline per family unlikely, recommended MRI head which was negative for CVD in wernicke area, and CT head negative for bleed.
#Hyponatremia: secondary to hypovolemic, dehydration, and possible component of tubular dysfunction with sodium wasting.
#UTI: Resolved after 3 days of empiric ciprofloxacin.
However, high risk for recurrent simple or complicated infection [**3-6**] immune dysfunction related to MM and requirement for indwelling foley for urinary retention related to BPH and inability to tolerate flomax [**3-6**] orthostatic hypotension.
#Delirium: may be in part related to narcotic use and infection, hyponatremia and malnutrition.
- florinef increased from once daily to 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] - evaluated by [**Hospital1 **] Service who recommend:  wearing compression stockings up to the thighs.
#Back Pain: due to malignant compression fractures [**3-6**] multiple myeloma, well controlled on home oxycodone, unlikely spinal cord compression given negative imaging, with moderate control on tylenol alone.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after having increased back pain and also having your blood pressure drop low when you stood up.
In the Emergency Room you were found to have a low blood sodium (hyponatremia) and were confused for a period of time.
After multiple consultations you were started on medications to improve the control of your BP when standing (Sodium Chloride tablets and Florinef), waist-high compression stockings & an abdominal binder were placed and you are urged to drink 2-2.5 liters of fluid every day.
