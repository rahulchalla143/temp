Brief Hospital Course: 53M with Hep C cirrhosis, severe pulmonary hypertension presents after being found down at home, found to be dehydrated and encephalopathic.
Hypotension: Likely related to volume depletion, as he may have been down for a considerable amount of time given his increase in creatinine and apparent pre-renal state.
This was likely secondary to known adrenal insufficiency.
They diuretics were restarted when his blood pressure had been stable for 48 hours to prevent ascites and to relieve LE edema.
Encephalopathy: Likely had excephalopathy in setting of protein load (2 pork chops) and dehydration.
He had asterixis on admission and was A&O x1.
HCV Cirrhosis with grade I esophageal varices: MELD 20.
His diuretics were intially held secondary to hypotension.
pulmonary hypertension: Likely combination of underlying pulmonary hypertension.
Hypoxia on admission resolved.
ARF likely [**1-11**] volume depletion, and improved quickly with rehydration to 0.9 on discharge.
