Admission Date:  [**2173-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-5-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**] Chief Complaint: hypoglycemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with stent placement, central line placement   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo male came from at rehab with h/o possible cholangiocarcinoma as suggested by imaging, HTN, CAD, tachy/brady syndrome, hypothyroidism presenting after episode of unresponsiveness at NH and found to have fingerstick of 6.
Of note he has become increasingly jaundice and per notes on transfer has had multiple admissions for sepsis at [**Hospital1 **].
It was noted that his T.bili was 7.2 and a RUQ U/S was performed and revelaed obstruction at the level of the stent.
While in the MICU patient required D20 gtt for 20 hours beacuse of low blood glucose that was stopped on [**5-9**].
Patient with low urine output while in the MICU and was getting bolused 500cc for total of 8L with minimal improvement of urine output.
Patient started on dopamine for decreased blood pressures.
Past Medical History: CAD HTN Tachy/brady Syndrome with HRs noted on 30s and 40s h/o CBD stones with imaging suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD stent but no definitive pathology s/p appendectomy as a child   Social History: Came from [**Location (un) 38**] Landing Rehab.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: T 96.4 BP 107/50 P 80 RR 23 Pox 100%RA Gen: NAD Heent: PERRL, EOMI, +scleral icterus, MM dry, no elevated JVP Lungs: Crackles at R base Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 no murmurs Abd: soft, NT, NABS Ext: +2 pitting edema in ankles and arms, with echymoses Neuro: Awake and alert, oriented only to person   Pertinent Results: [**4-27**] ERCP:There were multiple filling defects within the CBD consistent with stones.
Multiple moderately sized stones and pus and debris were extracted.
Pathology: [**4-27**]: Ampulla tissue: Ampullary mucosa with focal acute inflammation and regenerative changes [**4-27**] CBD brushings: Atypical.
Sheets and crowded groups of atypical ductal epithelial cells, some appear columnar, and bile salts.
[**5-11**] CBD stent: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No ductal epithelial cells present.
ECG: atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, rate 47   Radiology [**2173-5-8**] LIVER/GB U/S: 1.
Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant with severe intrahepatic ductal dilatation redemonstrated.
Low-attenuation mass-like lesion in right lobe of liver, not well evaluated on the current study.
Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant with severe intrahepatic ductal dilatation redemonstrated.
Low-attenuation mass-like lesion in right lobe of liver, not well evaluated on the current study.
If no outside studies are available for comparison, recommend MRI (if patient can tolerate) versus multiphase CT.  [**2173-5-12**] CXR: Small left greater than right pleural effusions.
[**2173-5-16**] MRCP: Extremely suboptimal examination.
The central obstructing mass is less well visualized than on the prior CT. New left lobe cystic fluid collection, likely incident to ruptured bile ducts (intrahepatic bilomas) due to marked obstruction.
Ascites, pleural effusion, and anasarca.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with possible cholangiocarcinoma, HTN, CAD, hypothyroidism, tachy/brady syndrome with recent CBD stent on [**5-1**] presenting after episode of unresponsiveness found to have a fingerstick of 6, found to have cholangitis.
1) Sepsis due to Cholangitis in the setting of a hepatic mass: The patient underwent an ERCP (see result section) which showed a dilated common bile duct at 15 mm.
The patient's Alk phos/Tbili remained elevated, likely due to ongoing obstruction related to known liver mass.
The patient underwent an MRCP which showed a new left lobe cystic fluid collection, likely incident to ruptured bile ducts (intrahepatic bilomas) due to marked obstruction.
Given his poor long-term prognosis, in the setting of ongoing biliary obstruction (possibly due to cholangiocarcinoma given markedly elevated CA [**85**]-9 at 2551) and risk of recurrent cholangitis, as well as his rapid clinical decline over the course of the last several months (malnutrition, declining mental status), the patient's family decided to pursue comfort-oriented care.
This may have been related to recent sepsis (see above), however a HIT antibody was positive (low titer).
A hematology consult was obtained, who felt that, while the patient's risk of thrombosis was high, (presumed cancer, possible HIT antibody), his risk of bleeding in the setting of underlying liver dysfunction and recent procedure was also high.
6) F/E/N: Given concern for aspiration, the patient received ground solids and nectar-thickened liquids.
Given the patient's dissatisfaction with thickened liquids, and the goal of comfort-oriented care, he was discharged on ground solids and thin liquids.
