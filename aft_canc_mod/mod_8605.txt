metabolic syndrome, GERD, and multiple other chronic medical issues (mostly MSK and insomnia) who presented to ED with CP this AM at ~ 4AM (onste 2AM), was found to have a STEMI.
was in USOH until [**3-28**] 11am, when he noted SS pain, burining and twisting sensation associated with diaphoresis.
He did not have SOB, palpitations, or radiation of his pain.
Pain was described by pt with placing a fist onto his chest.
He continued about his day without further symptoms until bedtime for him around 2am.
After laying to bed, he noted again the same substernal chest pain with diaphoresis and now subscapular in location.
He notes that he had had no prior sx, no DOE, no CP, no fatigu.
He was taken to cath lab where he was found to have LAD occlusion -> DES with TIMI 3 flow thereafter.
Intracath was noted to have transient wide complex tachycardia that resolved with opening of the vessel.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA but is concerned he has some dysfunction with his midbrain (has esotropia).
No hx of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism but has had intrabdominal hematomas in the past in a perioperative setting.
Denies myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
No recent fevers, chills or rigors.
No exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for no dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a proximal total occlusion.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated systemic arterial pressures with central aortic pressure 171/91 with a mean of 121 mmHg.
Final angiogram showed 0%  reisdual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.
Successful export thrombectomy and DES of proximal LAD for acute STEMI.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis to akinesis suggested.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo man with HTN, HL, ?
metabolic syndrome, GERD, and multiple other chronic medical issues (mostly MSK and insomnia) who presented to ED with CP this AM at ~ 4AM (onste 2AM), was found to have a STEMI .
# CORONARIES:  CP of unstable angina likely with plaque formation/resorption over the past 24 hrs.
An ECHO showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis to akinesis-.
Given his apical involvement and decreased EF, anticoagulation with coumadin was considered but given his ongoing GI bleed (to be followed as an outpatient with GI), this was defered for future consideration.
# PUMP:  No evidence of acute CHF now.
Has S4 thus likely has diastolic dysfunction in setting of longstanding HTN.
Given his apical hypokinesis, he was started on coumadin (despite his known history of foveal bleed -per Optho consult) but stopped given lower GI bleeding.
# RHYTHM: Maintained sinus rhythm while monitored on Tele while in hospital.
#  Hx of left foveal bleed.
: Coumadin was started despite the risk of rebleeding but stopped the next day.
# Hematochezia: pt had several episdoes of frankly bloody stools, he had a stable hct however and known colonic disease.
He had refused GI colonoscopy in the past, but GI was consulted for risk assessment of coumadin.
#  C spine and L spine pain.
