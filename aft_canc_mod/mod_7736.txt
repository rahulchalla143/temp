IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
EGD [**2152-10-4**] Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Tongue of salmon mucosa was seen at GE junction consistent with known Barrett's.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Small patchy areas of abnormal mucosa were seen throughout the whole stomach.
These may represent areas of intestinal metaplasia.
Protruding Lesions A single 7 mm polyp was found in the fundus by the GE junction with some slight abnormal mucosa overlying it.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus consistent with known Barrett's Abnormal mucosa in the stomach.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent intestinal metaplasia related to H. pylori.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: No source of the patient's GI bleeding was seen on EGD.
Patient should have a repeat EGD to assess areas of abnormal mucosa for biopsy and for follow up of Barrett's esophagus.
Colonoscopy [**2152-10-4**] Findings:  Protruding Lesions Several sessile polyps visualized in cecum randing from 3-4 mm.
No bleeding noted from polyps.
Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with large openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be severe.
Other Fresh bleeding noted from two localized points in the proximal ascending colon.
The surrounding and underlying mucosa was normal without underlying lesion although suspect Dieulafoy's lesion.
Old dark blood seen in the remainder of the colon.
Three endoclips were successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis to the two localized points.
No active bleeding visualized after clip placement.
Terminal ileum with bilious output.
No clotted or red blood visualized.
Impression: Fresh bleeding noted from two localized points in the proximal ascending colon.
The surrounding and underlying mucosa was normal without underlying lesion although suspect Dieulafoy's lesion.
Old dark blood seen in the remainder of the colon.
(endoclip) Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon Terminal ileum with bilious output and without bleeding.
Active bleeding from two localized points in the proximal ascending colon appear to be the source of bleeding.
Three endoclips placed at site with no further bleeding.

# Lower GI Bleed, [**1-19**] suspected colonic Dieulafoy's lesion.
Patient was found to have low Hct down to 17 in presentation.
He underwent both EGD and colonoscopy on [**2152-10-4**] which found non-bleeding mucosal change consistent with Barrett's and an ascending colonic AVM x2 which was clipped with 3 endoclips with resolution of bleeding.
His ACE-I, Spironolactone, HCTZ were restarted and patient was switched from home Atenolol, which was being held, to Metoprolol 25mg because of renal insufficiency.
He had no further episodes of GIB and his diet was advanced to regular.
Had lateralized EKG changes with STD in the V4-6 area and mildly elevated troponin up to 0.09.
However, CK and CKMB stable.
No cardiac symptoms.
This was most likely from underlying CAD in the setting of blood loss to Hct 17.
When transferred to the floor his aspirin was restarted and atenolol changed to Metoprolol because of renal insufficiency.
Should readdress Coumadin as an outpatient and the risks of stroke given CHADS2 score=4 should be weighed against the risk of rebleeding  # Acute Renal Failure.
Most likely pre-renal given profound anemia from LGIB.
# Dyspnea.
He Appeared euvolemic-hypovolemic on arrival and was not hypoxic.
- Metoprolol 25mg PO BID was restarted instead of Atenolol 100mg Daily because of renal insufficiency.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Active: - GI Bleed - Atrial Fibrillation anticoagulated on admission - Prior GIBs while on Coumadin .
Chronic: - HTN - HLD - CAD - Anemia - Barrett's Esophagus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 827**] with a severe GI bleed which required you to be monitored in the MICU.
You received multiple transfusions and has a colonoscopy which showed the site of bleeding.
The site was clipped and your bleeding resolved.
Because the bleeding occurred while you were taking Coumadin the medication was held and you were given vitamin k to reverse the anticoagulation.
You are being discharged in stable condition with a blood count which has been stable for several days.
This is being stopped because this is your 3rd GI bleed while you have been on Coumadin.
