Bibasilar opacities might represent either part of multifocal infection or atelectasis or aspiration.
Note is made of extremely tortuous ascending aorta.
No definitive evidence of pulmonary edema is present.
OSH Head CT There is no evidence of intra- or extraaxial hemorrhage, edema,      masses, or acute large territorial infarction.
There is evidence of periventricular hypoattenuation suggestive of      small vessel ischemic disease which is unchanged compared with prior.
Calcifications of the carotid siphons and vertebral arteries are again      visualized.
A prior lacunar infarct is seen in the left basal ganglia      and appears unchanged.
Degenerative changes are seen at the      atlantoaxial junction.
IMPRESSION:      NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL ABNORMALITY.
OSH lumbar xray  IMPRESSION:      MULTILEVEL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES INCLUDING DEGENERATIVE DISCOGENIC      CHANGE AND LOWER LUMBAR SPINE FACET ARTHROPATHY.
SOMEWHAT LIMITED      SERIES LIMITING ASSESSMENT FOR NONDISPLACED FRACTURE.
Acute infarct in the white matter of left parietal lobe.
Global parenchymal atrophy with extensive changes of microvascular ischemia.
Right hip x-ray There are degenerative changes of the right hip with spurring and decreased joint space at the superolateral aspect.
No acute bony injury is identified.
Small osteophytes about the femoral head and neck junction on the right side are also seen.
The left hip demonstrates normal joint space with minimal subchondral sclerosis at the superior acetabulum consistent with early degenerative changes.
Mild degenerative change of lower lumbar spine is also visualized.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yoM with CLL with baseline WBC around 50,000, HTN, prior TIA (unknown details), DM, CRI, dementia, transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with new right leg weakness; .
# Right-sided weakness: Head CT at [**Location (un) 620**] was neg for a bleed.
Since pt was unable to follow directions for an MRI without sedation and possible intubation, and the management would not be affected, the MRI was not done at the OSH.
Neuro consult was obtained and recommended MRI of head which showed acute infarct in left parietal lobe and global parenchymal atrophy with extensive changes of microvascular ischemia.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: On [**11-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 20450**] developed sudden respiratory distress.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a possible aspiration pneumonia and improved gradually over the ensuing days.
# HTN: His BP was elevated on admission and was allowed to be somewhat elevated following post-ischemic stroke guidelines.
# Nutrition: The patient was supported with enteral feeding via NGT due to his risk of aspiration s/p CVA.
Hypernatremia was attributed to volume depletion and improved with IV fluids and NG tube free water flushes.
No clear symptoms.
# NSTEMI likely [**2-12**] demand; troponins trended down and pt showed no signs of volume overload.
No heart sounds or breath sounds were auscultated for over 1 minute.
Neuro exam showed no reflexes.
