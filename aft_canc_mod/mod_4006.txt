Admission Date:  [**2200-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2151-12-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**] Chief Complaint: pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 48 yo primarily Portuguese-speaking woman with a several year history of intermittent RUQ/epigastric pain precipitated by certain foods (salmon, red meat, beans, chocolate) who noted an acute exacerbation of this pain after eating some chocolate on [**2200-3-8**].
This was associated with significant nausea and bilious emesis but no diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, or sweats.
She went to an OSH where she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based upon lab data (amylase 8289, lipase 36,687) and imaging studies (abdominal CT scan done [**3-9**] showed extensive pancreatitis with a large amount of ascites and poor enhancement in the body and tail raising a question of necrosis).
The etiology was presumed to be due to gallstones; her initial CT scan reportedly showed 7 cm CBD dilatation without evidence of cholelithiasis.
She was treated supportively with IV fluids, analgesics, and IV antibiotics (initially Unasyn, then Zosyn, and finally imipenem) and initially did well with decreasing pain and improving lab parameters.
Despite her initial improvement, she subsequently developed a recrudescence of fever to 101 with an associated leukocytosis to 26,000 on [**3-14**].
A repeat CT scan reportedly showed progression of pancreatitis with increasing ascites.
Family History: Mother and brother had gallbladder disease (presumably cholelithiasis vs. cholecystitis).
No known history of pancreatic or hepatic disease.

Pancreatitis: Appears most likely to be due to gallstones or biliary sludge despite lack of evidence of cholelithiasis on OSH CT scans.
There is no history of recent EtOH use, and the patient was not hypercalcemic or hyperlipidemic on admission to the OSH.
She was not taking any medications known to cause pancreatitis, and there was no antecedent viral prodrome or trauma.
By all lab parameters, her pancreatitis is improving, but the severity of her pancreatitis is worsening by CT scanning.
Her pancreatic inflammation also appears to have resulted in significant pleural effusions that now appear to be causing signficant tachypnea and hypoxemia (see below).
- NPO   - Maintenance IV fluids   - Pain control with hydromorphone as needed   - RUQ U/S now to evaluate for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis  2.
Fever and Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 116**] be attributable to worsening pancreatitis given increasing severity on CT scan.
There is clear concern for a secondary bacterial infection, however.
Possible sources include infected pleural or ascitis fluid, pneumonia, bacteremia from bacterial gut translocation, or UTI.
Absent evidence of pancreatic necrosis on CT scanning, there is no apparent indication for empiric antibiotics.
- D/C imipenem   - CXR now to evaluate pleural effusions, r/o infiltrate   - Abd U/S now to evaluate extent of ascites   - Consider thoracentesis vs. paracentesis to r/o secondary infection   - Blood cultures x2 now   - U/A and urine culture now   - Stool for C. diff (patient developed diarrhea at OSH); consider metronidazole   - Low threshold to repeat CT scan to r/o necrosis or abscess  3.
Respiratory Alkalemia: Likely due to mechanical compression of the pulmonary parenchyma caused by atelectasis, pleural effusions, and ascites.
- CXR now as above   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis, although fluid will likely reaccumulate   - Supplemental oxygen   - [**Month (only) 116**] require intubation for adequate oxygenation   - Consider arterial line  4.
Anemia: Patient has no chronic diseases, so anemia of chronic inflammation appears unlikely.
There is concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis given the severity of her inflammation, but there is no physical exam evidence of this.
- Send iron studies, folate, B12, retic count   - TFTs likely to be unhelpful in acute setting   - Send type and screen   - Transfuse for Hct less than 21  5.
She continued to spike fevers to 101.2 and slightly tachy at 102.
HD 11: Pt's pain continued to decrease.
Her pain also decreased slowly over the week.
