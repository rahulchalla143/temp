Admission Date:  [**2151-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-4-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Aztreonam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 65M h/o multiple myeloma, amyloid, s/p autologous stem cell transplant [**2149**], on HD for renal failure [**2-10**] myeloma, recently admitted for w/u of hemoptysis presenting with recurrent hemoptysis.
He underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Etiology was unclear- ddx included cytotoxic and non cytotoxic drugs, infection, or connective tissue disorder.
Ultimately was discharged home to complete a course of levofloxacin and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (primary oncologist), with DAH attributed to being give heparin (for presumed PE in ED) in setting of hemoptysis.
Patient was doing well, though by [**2-20**] had already started to experience slightly labored breathing.
Continued to carry out daily activities with minimal residual cough (dried blood) until Monday when symptoms acutely worsened with acute onset SOB with associated chest tightness.
Coughed up frank blood for the first time since discharge and given increased respiratory distress came to ED for further evaluation.
Patient was visibly tachypnic and hypoxic.
Also received labetalol 10 mg for hypertension 213/102 with heart rates in the 120s.
EKG showed new left bundle branch block.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: - Multiple Myeloma, s/p autologous stem cell transplant in [**2149**] - Amyloidosis  Other Medical History: - ESRD [**2-10**] amyloidosis - Hyperlipidemia - Restless leg syndrome - H/o genital herpes - Depression - Anxiety - s/p lens implantation (left) for cataracts - s/p discectomy - history of shoulder injury  Social History: - He works as a sales executive for luggage store, has been married for about 40 years.
- Drinks occasionally.
Family History: He has a significant family history notable for one brother with CLL and two first cousins with AML.
Father died at age 89 of prostate cancer and mother of PE and an MI.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.7 BP 78/46 HR 67 RR 22 100% intubated General: intubated, sedated, no acute distress HEENT: intubated, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: coarse BS b/l, no rales or wheezes appreciated CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, prominent holosystolic murmur radiating from L AVF Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, excellent thrill in the L AV fistula   Pertinent Results: TT Echo: [**2-24**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Severe (4+) central, mitral regurgitation is seen.
No apparent chordal rupture or partial flail leaflet is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline/mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no evidence of mitral valve leaflet flair due to tendinae or papillary muscle rupture.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation secondary to isolated papillary muscle dysfunction; no flail seen .
TT Echo [**3-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-2-24**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now lower.
LAD:  Ectatic vessel with mild luminal irregularities LCX:  50% diffuse mid vessel disease in OM RCA:  Mild luminal irregularities with ectatic vessel  Assessment & Recommendations 1.
Mild CAD 2.
Euvolemia   Brief Hospital Course: 65 year-old male with multiple myeloma s/p autologous stem cell transplant ([**2149**]) and amyloidosis, ESRD on HD with recent admission for DAH of unknown etiology admitted to MICU [**2151-2-23**] with hemoptysis.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse hemorrhage without purulence.
Etiology of hemoptysis was suspected to be new severe mitral regurgitation (not seen on TTE just 10 days prior); autoimmune workup from prior admission was within normal limits.
RHC/LHC revealed normal wedge pressure, absence of occlusive coronary disease (50% OM, otherwise normal), and increased cardiac output.
For evaluation of hypokinetic LV papillary muscle (without rupture) with surrounding normal myocardium, he was initially planned for cardiac MRI to assess for amyloidosis - given risk of NSF on ESRD, this was not done.
Case was discussed with BMT service; repeat protein electrophresis revealed persistent monoclonal gammopathy.
He was transferred to cardiology service on [**2151-3-3**] for further management with a plan for afterload reduction to reduce degree of MR and thereby negate the need for urgent surgery.
Given the need for agressive afterload reduction, and his demonstrated HTN while on HD despite significant volume reduction his BP meds should be given prior to HD each morning.

Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diffuse Alveolar Hemmhorage Mitral Regurgitation Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for hemoptysis (coughing up blood.
You were found to have severe Mitral regurgitation and high blood pressures.
It is likley that your high BP and faulty valve worked togather to cause pressures to build up in the blood vessels in your lungs which caused you to have shortness fo breath and hemoptysis.
We controlled your BP agreessivly and your mitral regurgitation and shortness of breath improved.
