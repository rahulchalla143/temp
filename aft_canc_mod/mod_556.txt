Admission Date:  [**2112-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-12-3**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: delta MS, weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 83 yo male, h/o metastatic breast and lung cancer, brain mets, ICH in the past, presenting with weakness and delta MS x [**4-5**] days.
Son reports that he has had some episodes of urinary incontinence over the past few days, thought to be [**2-3**] the fact that he has been too weak to make it to the bathroom.
Son denies that he has been more clumsy/denies one-sided weakness or focal deficits.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was A&Ox2, CT of the head showed interval development of hypodensity within the grey matter of the bilateral posterosuperior parietal, possibly occipital lobes.
He was also found to be hypertensive with SBP to 180s, HR 40's.
Neurology was consulted and felt that new stroke/infection could not be excluded; they recommended ?LP, antibiotics, MRI.
EKG had no specific changes, but had possible new TWI in L, V6; TNT was elevated to 0.46 with flat [**Name (NI) **] (pt without sx).
Lung cancer diagnosed radiographically, no rx 3.
HTN   Social History: Lives downstairs from son, wife passed away fairly recently; 70+ pack year history (still smoking), no etoh/drugs, retired electrictian     Family History: son with NHL, mother died CVA, father died MI age 72  Physical Exam: Admission PE: 98.8, BP: 183/55, HR: 44, RR: 19, O2sat: 98% 2L GEn: NAD, pleasant male, sitting in bed HEENT: CN II-XII grossly intact; some asymmetry of right eyelid/increased closure Lungs: CTA bilat, no w/r/r CV: [**Last Name (LF) 8450**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] S1/s2, 2/6 SEM at LUSB Abd: soft, nt/nd, nabs Extr: no c/c/e, PT 2+ bilat Neuro: moving all 4 extremities, CN as above, weakness of L foot Rectal: guaiac neg Skin: no [**Last Name (un) **] lesions, no splinter hemorrhages, no other stigmata of endocarditis  Pertinent Results: EKG: 1st degree AV block SR in 40's, with LAD, TWI in I, L, V4-V6 (?new in L, V6), no other T-wave or ST changes.
Imaging: CT head: interval devpt of hypodensity iwthin [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of bilateral posterosuperior parietal, possibly occipital lobes, new from [**11-4**] .
MRI brain: multiple embolic strokes in cerebellar, parietal, occipital lobes; enhancement of mets, temporal lobes .
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Antero-apical hypokinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Carotid series: IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
[**11-24**] MRI (full read):  FINDINGS: There are multiple new areas of T2 signal abnormality, involving the cortex and underlying white matter of the occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres.
These areas exhibit diffusion signal hyperintensity, consistent with recent infarction.
However, there are also small foci of diffusion signal abnormality in both parietal and frontal lobes, primarily near the cortical surface.
These areas are difficult to distinguish from regions of chronic infarction and gliosis also identified as hyperintense foci on T2 and FLAIR images.
There is ventricular enlargement, but not substantially changed since previous exam.
The right occipital lobe enhancing metastasis is unchanged in size and less well seen on today's study than previously.
Gradient echo images demonstrate previously identified areas of susceptibility artifact.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates flow in both intracranial internal carotid arteries and in the anterior and middle cerebral arterial branches proximally.
Flow signal is observed in the right vertebral artery, basilar artery and proximal portions of the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries.
Multifocal recent infarction is identified within the cerebrum and cerebellum.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  83 yo male, h/o metastatic breast and lung cancer, presenting with weakness, delta MS, new findings on head CT, elevated troponin.
Neuro: upon admission, pt had a head MRI performed which showed new multifocal cerebral and cerebellar infarcts which were believed to be responsible for the mental status changes and R sided weakness.
The cause of the new multifocal infarcts was believed to be hypercoagulability [**2-3**] malignancy.
Metastatic breast/lung cancer: previously undergoing XRT, which was stopped given the mental status changes.
Elevated troponin: no changes in CK-MB, no significant EKG changes, no symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia.
Likely due to decreased renal clearance given slightly elevated creatinine.
Had poor control of sugars while on steroids.
FEN - diabetic diet, Cr improved with some hydration.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 3894**] Hospice VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic lung cancer Breast cancer Stroke, ischemic Insulin dependent diabetes   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as needed.
