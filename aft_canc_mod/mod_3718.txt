Admission Date:  [**2171-11-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-1-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Keppra  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ridig bronchoscopy with stent placement then stent removal  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63 year-old man PMH follicular/variant papillary thyroid CA s/p total thyroidectomy and radical neck dissection in [**2156**] along with radioactive iodine as recently as [**2167**], surveillance scanning revealing pulmonary nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy in [**2168-2-9**] with subsequent PET-CT demonstrating FDG-avidity to these areas as well as to bone.
Since that time, he was additionally found to have cranial metastases found to be thyroid CA mets at craniotomy, and other scattered bone mets including, among others, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.
Sutent was most recently stopped in [**Month (only) **] [**2171**] after he developed a peri-met intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
He presented to clinic on [**2171-10-23**] complaining of shortness of breath and wheezing with a saturation of 94% on room air.
He received CTA for PE and ruled out MI, but did not want to be admitted for workup and left ED AMA.
He re-presented on [**11-4**], with progressive dyspnea at rest and wheezing and subjective fevers.
CXR suggested possible post obstructive pna so he was placed on levaquin and flagyl.
IP consulted who felt he had a post-obstructive collapse on the left side and planned to bronch.
On [**2171-11-9**], he [**Date Range 1834**] flexible and rigid bronchoscopy which revealed a near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus endobronchial lesion with near complete obstruction of the airway.
The LUL and LLL showed near complete obstruction, So mechanical debridement and argon plasma coagulation done to the distal left mainstem and LUL and LLL bronchi with only mild improvement of the patency.
CXR showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
The stent had evidence of migration, and was subsequently removed on [**11-10**].
His MICU [**Last Name (un) **] was also complicated by coffee ground emesis; EGD preformed did not demonstrate any lesions, and the finding was likely secondary to digested blood from the procedure.
On arrival to the floor he states that he has a slight cough with white sputum since extubation, but is AOx3 and otherwise feeling well.
ROS: denies fever, chills, weight change, headache, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain or tightness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, BRBPR, focal weakness, rash.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 76117**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with thyroid carcinoma.
He was found to have thyroid carcinoma and [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a total thyroidectomy with right radical neck dissection.
20 lymph nodes were positive.
Pathology was consistent with follicular versus follicular variant of papillary carcinoma.
CT in [**11/2167**] showed no recurrent or residual tumor, but there were small scattered pulmonary nodules.
In [**2-/2168**], a neck ultrasound was notable for right posterior triangle lymph nodes.
CT chest on [**2168-2-23**] showed multiple pulmonary nodules and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
PET scan on [**2168-3-15**] confirmed FDG avid right hilar lymph nodes, numerous pulmonary nodules, and a lucency in L5 concerning for metastasis.
He was asymptomatic and the decision was made to follow him until he became symptomatic.
CT chest in [**7-/2168**] showed a slight increase in his pulmonary nodules, along with mediastinal and right hilar lymph node enlargement.
In [**9-/2168**], he developed headaches and diplopia in his right eye.
Brain MRI on [**2168-9-19**] showed a large spongy-appearing lesion on the posterior fossa within the calvarium.
PET scan of the brain on [**2168-9-21**] showed a lytic mass lesion involving the suboccipital skull, centered to the right of midline.
Pathology was consistent with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.
He completed radiation therapy to his skull on [**2168-12-21**] (total dose of 5000cGy) but then developed low back pain.
MRI L spine on [**2168-12-12**] revealed bony metastatic disease most prominent at L1 with extension into the left epidural space.
He began sorafenib on [**2169-1-23**] and had a significant radiographic response in his parenchymal disease, but his osseous metastases did not respond as well.
He progressed through sorafenib in [**3-/2170**] and developed a metastasis in his right glenoid cavity for which he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] radiation.
He completed radiation around [**2170-5-28**] and stopped sorafenib shortly thereafter.
He then started sunitinib on [**2170-6-11**] at a dose of 50mg PO daily x 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off, until [**2171-7-23**] when he presented with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage due to a right parietal mass.
He had progression of his disease but declined further chemotherapy.
Past Medical History: -Cervical spinal laminectomy in [**2144**] and [**2146**] -Spinal fusion in [**2149**] -[**10/2156**], surgery for thyroid mass at [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] Medical Center -[**2168**], surgery for mass on his skull -[**2171-7-26**], brain tumor metastasis removed.
Family History: Positive for cancer in one brother and heart disease in father.

slight edema to midleg bilaterally.
[**2171-11-4**] Portable CXR: Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates left lower lobe consolidation, which is new compared with prior.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is again evident.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no intraperitoneal free air.
Interval development of left lower lobe consolidation, which given that it developed over a period of 12 days most likely represents pneumonia.
This is likely post obstructive given the appearance of recent imaging.
Stable appearance of metastatic thyroid cancer within the limits of the chest radiograph.
[**2171-11-4**] Head CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial collection, or mass effect.
The ventricles and sulci are stable in configuration without evidence of hydrocephalus.
A hypodensity in the left insula is stable and probably represents a prominent perivascular space.
There are post-surgical changes of right parietal craniotomy.
A linear defect within the right temporal lobe is stable in appearance compared with MRI of [**2171-9-30**] and is certainly postoperative.
There is mucosal thickening of the bilateral maxillary sinuses, the sphenoid, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses are clear.
There is a stable appearance of lytic osseous destruction of the right sphenoid and occipital bones.
No acute intracranial process.
Post-surgical changes in the right parietal lobe are stable-appearing.
Stable appearance of right sphenoid and occipital lytic osseous metastases.
[**2171-11-8**] CXR There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with deviation of the cardiomediastinum towards the left consistent with a new left upper lobe collapse.
The patient had already left lower lobe collapse.
The amount of left pleural effusion cannot be evaluated, probably is small.
There is a new stent in the left main bronchus.
Minimal opacities in the right upper lobe are new, could be due to atelectasis or aspiration.
No evidence of right pneumothorax.
Interval placement of a left main bronchus stent with opacification within the distal aspect of the stent and resorptive atelectasis of the left lower lobe with mediastinal shift to the left.
This could represent mucous plugging within the distal aspect of stent, but soft tissue mass involvement cannot be excluded as the subcarinal region and left main bronchus appear encased by soft tissue mass.
Small left-sided pleural effusion.
Numerous osseous and pulmonary metastatic lesions with small new 1.2-cm right upper lobe pulmonary parenchymal lesion and increase in size of left lateral seventh rib lytic destructive osseous mass lesion with associated soft tissue component.
EGD [**2171-11-10**]: Blood in the esophagus Blood in the stomach Abnormal mucosa in the stomach Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Prilosec 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for gastritis.
This was not the etiology of his coffee ground emesis.
No specific etiology of his coffee ground emesis could be found endoscopically.
Given his recent IP procedure it is possible he swallowed some blood into the stomach.
CXR [**2171-11-10**]: Current study demonstrates substantial reexpansion of the left lung with resolution of the vast majority of atelectasis, but still present left perihilar consolidation.
There is new right basal opacity that might reflect progression of infectious process versus aspiration.
There is no  pneumothorax.
Pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded on the right and most likely present on the left.
Progressive improvement in left hemithorax opacification with some persistent retrocardiac opacification.
Minimal right basilar atelectasis.

# Pulmonary -  Patient was found to have an airway obstruction on the left side due to a mass.
He was taken back to the suite where the mucus plug was removed and the stent was also removed secondary to migration.
GI - coffee ground emesis likely secondary to swallowed blood with procedure, as no culprit lesion appreciated on EGD on [**11-10**].
