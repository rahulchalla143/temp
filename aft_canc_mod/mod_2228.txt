He had an ECHO that showed EF 30% c/w NYHA heart failure class [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely need an ICD in the future.
and had a paracentesis removing 6L.
He currently feels very weak and swollen with edema though his abdomen is less full.
He notes pain of his scrotum, around his foley catheter, and on his back.
He denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomitting, head ache or leg pain.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HX: - [**1-/2115**] Initial dx with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, presented with L cervical area adenopathy, bx showed immunoblastic B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with an extremely high proliferation fraction of over 90%.
Staging workup showed disease in the left neck and mediastinum as well as the hilar regions and mesentery.
- CHOP x 6 cycles, though with continued disease in mediastinum,  supraclavicular, and mesenteric areas.
- RIME x 3 cycles in preparation for auto SCT, with stem cell collections following the third cycle.
- FDG scan showed persistent avidity in the anterior cervical lymph node chain as well as the mid abdominal area.
Therefore completed consolidative XRT with an involved field boost to the anterior cervical nodes and epigastric area and then proceed with high-dose chemotherapy.
- [**1-17**] Autologous SCT - 4 weeks posttransplant of Rituxan - XRT to L abdomen for faint residual uptake in the left abdomen, after which the avidity resolved and he was in remission.
- [**9-21**] at routine follow-up PET scan noted a calcified mesenteric mass on increased FDG avidity.
Abd CT showed a mesenteric mass in the LUQ highly suggestive of tumor.
- [**2119-11-29**] he underwent surgery with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], biopsy revealed extensive scar tissue with no evidence for carcinoid or lymphomatous involvement.
- Also persistent anemia: bone marrow from [**2119-10-13**] revealed mild dysplastic features with no evidence for lymphoma but with chromosome abnormalities consistent with MDS.
- [**6-22**]: Recent bone marrow with unfortunate evidence for recurrent myelodysplasia .
Sclera anicteric.
No M/R/G Lungs: decreased BS at bases 1/4 up, otherwise clear Abd: +mild distention.
GU: +scrotal edema Back: could not be examined Ext: [**3-22**] + pitting edema up legs/thigh.
+pitting edema in arms b/l.

There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30-40 percent).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (>12mmHg).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR ([**9-11**]): Moderate volume left pleural effusion has been stable since [**9-4**] and atelectasis at the medial aspect of the left lower lobe has improved.
No pneumothorax.
CT abdomen/pelvis ([**9-15**]): 1) Large 5.4 x 3.8 cm calcified central mesenteric mass with spoke wheel retraction of the adjacent mesenteric fat.
2) Large amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites, large left and moderate right pleural effusions (increased from the prior CT), moderate pericardial effusion, and anasarca.
3) Small nonobstructing renal calculi bilaterally.
5) Minimally prominent loops of small bowel just proximal to the mesenteric mass; without evidence of obstruction at this time.

Rare mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells .
Diffuse low voltage.
Left pleural effusion and atelectasis of the left lower lobe is stable.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**9-17**]): Acute monocytic leukemia (FAB-M5b) evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome.

WBC reached a high of 49,300; on [**9-25**], WBC 14,000 with 15% blasts, Hct 31.1, Platelets 85,000, ANC 3720 Please see OMR for further details on laboratory studies   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 35695**] is a 61 year old male with a history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post auto stem cell transplant and subsequent myelodysplastic syndrome status post mini-allo stem cell transplant (day 0 = [**2120-3-27**]), with sclerosing peritonitis secondary to radiation with recent admissions for neutropenic fever thought to be due to SBP or pneumonia, who was readmitted with fever and hypotension.
He was moved to the BMT floor hemodynamically stable with large volume ascites and was made CMO on [**9-25**] due to persistence of peripherally circulating blasts as well as massive ascites.
# MDS --> leukemia: The patient's hematocrit and platelets remained stable, but he was transfused for hct <25, plt <10.
A repeat marrow done [**2120-9-13**]->aspirate results show 64% monocytes and peripheral smear shows 10% monos->acute monocytic leukemia M5B.
The patient did receive hydroxyurea starting on [**9-18**] for escalating white counts with a decrease in his WBC count from 49.3 to 14.
# Fever: The patient had been afebrile throughout the majority of his hospitalization.
A CXR was negative, and he had no diarrhea.
He did have multiple potential sources of fever including ascites, recurrent left pleural effusion and indwelling PICC.
# Aanasarca & ascites: The patient did have continuing massive edema despite paracentesis, also with low albumin.
We did monitor BP closely, but avoided fluid boluses as was possible due to fluid third-spacing.
He did have a therapeutic paracentesis on [**9-15**] and on [**9-19**] for symptom relief; 6L removed and patient with much improved pain and dyspnea.
He did have a PCA prior to a morphine drip for pain control.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated on last check, ?
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute myelogenous leukemia, evolving from MDS which was secondary to treatment for NHL secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Location (un) **] exposure  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: n/a  Followup Instructions: n/a   Completed by:[**2120-11-19**
