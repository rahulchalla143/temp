Pt noted generalized fatigue at that time.
Patient was planned to have synergeneic transplant (she has a twin sister-however this is in the process of being confirmed), with BU/CY containing regimen.
Uses ativan to help control her nausea, has had occasional diarrhea with the most recent episode this am, denies any blood in stool.
She denies any fever/chills or night sweats.
She notes trouble sleeping, which often results in a headache the following morning.
She also reports some chest/substernal "discomfort"-particularly in the am, but denies pain or SOB.
Patient notes increased anxiety with this hospitalization.

Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
A small left effusion is stable.
Opacity within the left lower lobe and the peripheral right lung base is unchanged.
No failure or pneumothorax is seen.
Opacity in the left lower lobe and the right lateral lung base representing possible pneumonia Vs. atelectasis are unchanged compared to [**2168-11-17**].
[**11-13**] RUQ US: There is a large right-sided pleural effusion.
There is possible sludge within the gallbladder.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Large right-sided pleural effusion.
Gallbladder wall thickening without gallstones identified.
Causes of gallbladder wall thickening include hypoalbuminemia, CHF, liver disease, and other causes of third spacing.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 year old female with relapsed AML, admitted for re-induction followed by syngeneic/identical twin allogenic transplant.
Course was c/b intermittent episodes of hypotension (below baseline hypotension of SBP 80's - 100's) and lightheadedness.
Following stablization after weight loss and transfer to the floor, patient had orthostasis, continued total body edema and continued to complain of dry mouth.
Her cardiac managment is otherwise complicated by continuous sinus tachycardia to 120-140's.
Patient was then transferred from the floor to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for management of heart failure and diuresis.
On [**11-7**], patient diuresed well on lasix with a slight elevation in creatinine to 1.6, but a new anion gap was noted with a lactate of 7.
On [**11-10**], patient become hypotensive to 60's overnight with worsening respiratory distress.
Unclear whether this was due to sepsis versus cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **].
Patient was subsequently transferred to the CCU and intubated due to respiratory distress.
As mentioned above, [**Hospital 228**] hospital course also complicated by strep viridans endocarditis with visible vegetations seen on most recent ECHO [**2168-10-19**].
Diagnosed in [**10-1**] treated with 10 days gentamicin and 4 weeks ceftriaxone, generalized anasarca, persistent sinus tachycardia with occasional [**Month/Day (1) 6059**], bilateral pleural effusions, acalculous cholecystitis, portal vein thrombosis, DIC and hemorrhoids.
Patient's chest x-ray was negative, no active symptoms now or during previous chemotherapy.
Pt also received a PICC line in addition to her R double lumen Hickman.
Attemtp to L sided Hickman previously failed secondary to inability to advance the catheter during IR.
During her MICU stay, there was no evidence of AML recurrence.
* Abdominal pain -  The patient complained of right sided abdominal pain of mild severity, worse with palpation, often absent at rest, during her MICU stay.
A CT w/ contrast on [**10-24**] revealed contracted portal vein thrombosis, cecal wall thickening, possibly secondary to ascites and a question of free air, which was further discussed with radiology and determined to be most likely in the appendix.
However, no clear source for her polymicrobial blood cultures was found.
She has remained afebrile since.
* CP - patient intermittently complained of CP on several occasions.
Repeated EKGs showed no ST changes.
Later in the course they were significant for sinus tachycardia.
This was thought to represent mild troponin leak secondary to demand ischemia sometimes as could be expected in high catecholamine states that accompanies severe sinus tachycardia.
Repeat Echo also showed worsening EF with global hypokinesis.
Pt also had an increasing pulmonary artery pressure.
V/Q scan was normal and there was only mild pulmonary edema on diagnostic studies.
Patient had periodic echocardiograms done showing progressively worse systolic right and left sided function.
An echo on [**9-27**], done to evaluate interval changes prior to surgery for suspected cholecystitis, showed worsened EF<20% and new vegetations on the tricuspid valve and the chordae to the tricuspid valve.
However, on transfer to the BMT floor, she did have several instances of chest pain without EKG changes.
The worsened heart function was believed to be secondary to cytoxan as well as prior anthracycline.
She had diffuse anasarca, due to EF <20%, severe tricuspid regurgitation, as well as malnutrition and low albumin with low oncotic pressure.
It was unclear if her cardiac function would improve.
In addition, she had a thoracentesis of her right sided pleural effusion with removal of 1L, and some improvement of her dyspnea.
A repeat CXR on [**10-31**] showed marked improvement of her asymetric pulmonary edema, though on exam, she continued to have [**11-29**]+ LE edema L>R and ascites.
She was also tried on carvedilol per cardiology for rate control with a drop her SBP to the 70s.
Cardiology then recommended acebutalol for greater Beta 1 selectivity, but she also did not tolerate this with a drop in SBP to 69, which returned to 85 after 150 cc IV bolus of NS.
However, lasix was discontinued after 2 days due to elevated creatinine.
After 1 week on nesiritide, this also had to be discontinued due to hypotension and development of other medical issues including elevated lactate.
Due to severe hypotension which was thought to be secondary to cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and milronone drip was initiated.
Upon presentation to the CCU, the patient was afebrile without white blood cell count or clear souce of infection.
However, repeat ECHO showed persistent vegetations and TR.
Patient was continued on the balloon pump for 1 week without ability to wean and so was it was subsequently discontinued.
*Sinus Tachycardia - Patient was also noted following her chemotherapy to have sinus tachycardia, onset at same time as her above CHF.
It was believed that her sinus tachycardia was likely compensatory for her poor ejection fraction with her CHF.
A trial of carvedilol and acebutelol was attempted prior to transfer to cardiology, but was not tolerated due to hypotension.
She had two episodes of [**Name (NI) 6059**] lasting apptoximately 12 beats with a background of sinus tachycardia ranging up to 150s.
While in the CCU, patient had persistant atrial tachycardia.
Digoxin was discontinued secondary to toxicity.
* Endocarditis - Multiple cultures including fungal and m.fufur cultures were drawn but remained negative.
However, a repeat echo showed unchanged size of the vegetatations, and a diagnosis of marantic endocarditis was suspected.
A subsequent echo showed worsening TR without note of the vegetation on the echo dated [**10-19**].
Follow up blood cultures and ECHO should be done at that time to ensure bacteremia and tricuspid vegetations have resolved.
- h/o strep viridans endocarditis, s/p 10 days gentamicin and currently on CTX (started [**10-16**]) to complete a 4 week course, [**11-7**] repeat ECHO show persistent vegetations on TR.

# Elevated Lactate and AG:  Pt noted to have elevated lactate to 6.57 on [**11-7**], AG = 18/19.
Therefore likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
* Acute cholecystitis/Elevated LFTs - pt consistently had tachycardia which was thought to possibly be related to an occult infection.
She began developing RUQ pain and US was done suggestive of acute cholecysitis.
General A repeat US showed a decompressed gallbladder.
Her transaminases continued to rise above 1000, and a repeat abdominal U/S and CT scan were done, showing a new partial portal vein thrombus.
Hepatology was reconsulted and believed this rise was secondary to hepatic congestion from right heart failure.
* Portal vein thrombosis - patient was started on a heparin drip and continued with a goal PTT 60-80.
Her liver abdnormalities resolved on the heparin drip.
The patient accidentally partially removed the cholecystostomy drain, her labs remained stable as did the abdominal pain for the next few days and the drain tube was discontinued.
A repeat u/s showed persistent thrombus.
A CT on [**10-24**] showed a contracted portal vein thrombosis.
A RUQ ultrasound on [**2168-11-6**] demonstrated resolution of her portal vein thrombosis.
* RUE swelling, labial swelling - the pt was noted to have a swollen R arm.
An US obtained while the pt was in the MICU revealed no clot and was believed to be related to anasarca.
In addition, she had labial swelling R>L, concerning for abscess.
Fluid was aspirated and negative for infection.
It was felt that the endocarditis or sepsis were the most likely etiologies, although initial blood cultures did not grow any organisms.
* Hemorrhoids - On [**8-22**] she started complaining of hemorrhoidal pain c/w large external hemorrhoids.
Morphine was used for pain control.
Although she did have intermittent diarrhea that was controlled with Immodium.
Dispo - pt transferred from to cardiology for optimization of her cardiac regimen.
Pt then transferred to the unit due to persistent hypotension, elevated anion gap, elevated lactate for further management.
Patient then transferred from cardiology floor to cardiac intensive care unit for persistent sinus tachycardia and hypotension.
Due to persistent hypotension refractory to fluid boluses and pressors, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the setting of cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **] +/- septic [**Month/Year (2) **].
#pump: nonischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF: EF ~10%, likely secondary to chemo toxicity vs [**12-30**] persistant tachycardia.
Given improvement with IABP, on milrinone, no WBC, afebrile, no clear source of infection likely in cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] also have an element of septic [**First Name3 (LF) **].
#rhythm: persistant atrial tachycardia.
