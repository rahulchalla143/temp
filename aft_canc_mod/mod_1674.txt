The patient presented with a three day history of intermittent worsening and crampy abdominal pain in the lower quadrants, worse on the right than on the left.
The pain was described as severe.
KUB on arrival in the Emergency Department showed dilated loops of small bowel with air fluid levels.
A CT scan obtained shortly thereafter showed two large mesenteric masses with erosion into small bowel and free perforation of the more proximal segment of small bowel, as well as mechanical mid small bowel obstruction.
Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the lung, brain, bowel, left flank  MEDICATIONS: 1.
50 mcg fentanyl patch  The patient had recently been on his first week to Taxol dexamethasone therapy and had also been through four cycles of IL-2/temozolomide for his metastatic melanoma.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  No jugular venous distention, no palpable nodes.
HEART:  S1, S2, tachycardic with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Distended, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Abdomen was tense and was a 7 cm subcutaneous mass on the left flank.
EXTREMITIES:  There was no lower extremity edema, cyanosis or clubbing.
On postoperative day #3, the patient was noted to have a slightly increased temperature to 100.2??????.
Because of continued increase in white cell count from 14.3 on postoperative day #4 to 16.0 on postoperative day #5, the patient was sent for an abdominal CT.
Although no abscess was identified that could explain the patient's increase in white cell count, the patient was noted to have developed mural thrombus in his abdominal aorta and in the left iliac artery.
The patient was also noted to develop some new bilateral pleural effusions with some barium in the left lung base.
The patient's neuro-oncologist requested head CT be obtained to rule out any new brain metastases with bleeding because this would determine the patient's suitably for anticoagulation.
Oncology was of the opinion of the patient, was unsuitable for anticoagulation with Coumadin or heparin but that aspirin could be initiated.
At the suggestion of the patient's oncology team, the surgery team also transfused the patient with 1 unit packed red blood cells on postoperative day #8 for borderline low hematocrit of 26.1.
