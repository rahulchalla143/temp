In [**Name (NI) **] pt spiked a fever to 103.3 but otherwise normotensive and not tachycardic and was initally seen by urology who suspected superficial cellulitis, but due to immunocompromised status he was started on Vancomycin, Flagyl, and continued on Levofloxacin for risk of Fournier's gangrene.
Scrotal U/S and pelvic CT only showed soft tissue edema w/o subcutaneous air.
Area of erythema was circled in perineal and suprapubic area.
On [**10-20**] a.m. it ws noticed that erythema was rapidly extending beyond line so urology was reconsulted for suspected necrtotizing fasciitis.
Per ID reccomendations, Levofloxacin was changed for Meropenem, and Flagyl was changed to Clindamycin and urology took the pt to the OR for debridement of Fournier's gangrene after repeat CT pelvis was unchanged.
In the OR purulent fluid was noted in the scrotum bilat with signs of orchitis on the left.
for three weeks for the Shigella infection; also during that admission, he had problems with Herpes simplex esophagitis, and he was found to have Kaposi's sarcoma in his duodenum.
At that time, a repeat upper endoscopy revealed complete resolution of the Kaposi's sarcoma.
Liver ultrasound revealed hepatomegally with dilated biliary ducts, thought to be AIDS cholangiopathy.
An ERCP revealed a slightly dilated common bile duct, a sphincterotomy was done, and specimens obtained during this procedure were positive for Microsporidium and Cytomegalovirus.
A liver biopsy revealed mild focal mild portal inflammation with negative special stains and cultures.
Head and buttock staph abscess as in HPI  Social History: He was born in [**State 3706**] but has lived in [**Location 86**] for 11 years.
Family History: Parents are both alive and well, no diseases run in his family that he can recall   Physical Exam: PE: Tmax-102.4 Tcurr-1012 HR- 102(84-108) BP 153/87 (122-162/66-85) RR 18-23    I 4820, O 1780 (LOS +5.4L)    FS: 108-148 HEENT-PERRL, EOMI, no elevated JVD, pharynx clear Hrt-tachy reg rhythm, [**2-25**] HSM at RUSB, no gallop Lungs-CTAB Abdomen-firm, mod distended, mod suprapubic tenderness, normoacitve BS Extrem-5/5 strength in feet bilat, 2+ dp pulses bilat trace L ankle edema Neuro-A+Ox3 CN ii-12 intact, LE distal sensation to light touch intact Vascular access- Right IJ, 2 right peripheral, 1 left peripheral.
Scrotal abscess- Pt initially getting Vanco/Clindamycin/Meropenem for empiric coverage, but this was narrowed to Vancomycin on postoperative day #2 when perioperative wound cultures were postive for MRSA.
He was weaned off the Dilaudid PCA to oral Percocet with good pain control.
Penrose drains placed during debridement were removed on postoperative day #3 since there ws minimal sanguinous drainage although the left scrotum continued to be severely indurated.
[**Name (NI) 19278**] Pt remained afebrile after debridement and blood cultures and urine cultures were all negative, so no other infectious workup was completed.
