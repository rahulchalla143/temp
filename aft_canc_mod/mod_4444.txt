Repeat EGD in [**11/2196**] revealed dysplasia concerning for neoplastic transformation.
Given patient's family history of his father dying from esophageal CA at age 67 he wanted to see a surgeon as soon as possible and presents to clinic today.
The patient denies any worsening of his reflux and states symptoms are controlled on PPI.
He does say that he has some dysphagia with occasional difficulty swallowing solids but not liquids.
Denies odynophagia or regurgitation.
Past Medical History: Spontaneous PNX [**2-/2154**] treated with Chest tube Sigmoid colectomy [**9-/2193**] for large polyp, margins clear, no evidence of recurrence on follow up b/l inguinal hernia repair [**2190**] Cataracts CAD - no stents/MI/[**Doctor First Name **] in past   Social History: 25 pack year history of smoking, quit [**2167**], drinks 2-3 ETOH beverages.
Family History: father died at 67 of esophageal CA   Physical Exam: VS: 99.2 96.9 90 130/70 20 94% RA General: 67 year-old male in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple no lymphadenopathy Card: RRR normal S1,S2 no murmur Resp: slight decrease at bases b/l GI: benign, non-tender, non-distended.
J-tube terminating within the small bowel, however, there is a leak extending around the tube.
Normal barium swallow examination of esophagectomy and gastric pull-up, with no evidence of leak.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Small right pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
Bilateral anterior rib fractures, without evidence of callus concerning for acute rib fractures.
This should be correlated to the history of possible chest compressions during resuscitation.
Intramural position of a right femoral central venous line.
[**2197-3-27**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Chest Xray [**2197-3-31**] In comparison with the study of [**5-29**], there has been an apparent gastric pull through producing soft tissue and gas to the right of the mediastinum.
Left effusion is again seen.
This procedure went without complication, for more details please see the operative note.
He had a JP draining his mediastinum and a right sided chest tube.
On POD 1 he was extubated without complication and remained in the ICU for monitoring until POD 3 when he was transferred to the floor.
His Chest tube was placed to water seal on POD 1 and he did not have a leak.
The JP continued to put out minimal amounts of serous output that was non-chylous or bilious.
When the patient arrived on the floor on POD 3 he was doing well, ambulatory, tolerating his J tube feeds and his NGT remained in place with minimal output.
His pain was controlled with the epidural and his chest tube remained on water seal.
At 11am later this day, he was found to have a paroxysmal bradycardic event after standing up from the chair and getting into bed.
After atropine, epinephrine and approximately 8 minutes of chest compressions and bag masking he was intubated and found to have a pulse.
An extensive workup for the cause of his asystolic arrest was initiated immediatly after his admission to the ICU -> A bronchoscopy did not show any gross aspiration event.
An echo demonstrated an EF of >55% and did not show any focal wall abnormalities, valvular problems or ventricular dilation.
A CT head was negative for an acute bleed or defect.
A CT Torso was performed that was negative for dissection/embolic filling defect.
It did show b/l small pleural effusions and a small R PNX.
It also demonstrated a right coronary from the L sinus of valsalva -> a "malignant course of the R coronary."
An EGD on POD 7 did not show evidence of a leak, and and NGT was replaced to drain the stomach and conduit.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that the best explanation for these events was carotid sinus hypersensitivity and episode was most-likely vaso-vagal given the story, symptoms and carotid sinus hypersensitivity.
He transferred to the floor in stable condition with no further ectopy.
His pain was well controlled.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg/5 mL Solution [**First Name (STitle) **]: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 5 days.
Acetaminophen 500 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Five (5) ML PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 10 days.
