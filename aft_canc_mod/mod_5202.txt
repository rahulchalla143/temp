At [**Hospital1 **], he had worsening abdominal pain, and he was noted to have a rising bilirubin.
ERCP/stenting cannot be performed at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was transferred here for urgent evaluation and stenting.

MICROBIOLOGY: Blood cultures grew Klebsiella and then later Enterococcus faecium .
[**2143-10-8**] CBD brushings/cytology: no evidence of malignant cells.
Echo [**2143-10-10**]: Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 107bpm.
3.5 x 3.5 cm mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for malignancy.
Fatty liver without evidence of focal lesion.
No acute process identified.
Liver US [**11-24**]: The liver displays no focal masses and unremarkable parenchyma.
Again identified is mild prominence to the extra- hepatic biliary system measuring approximately 6 mm and large amount of sludge within the gallbladder.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Old lacunar infarct.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive for acute stroke and metastasis.
Renal US [**12-3**]: Normal renal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Dilated extrahepatic common bile duct, with stent and sludge seen within.
No evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Sludge again seen within the gallbladder, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
CXR [**12-6**]: Improved bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions, now very small.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59yM with pancreatic mass (likely malignant) s/p CBD stenting in [**2143-4-9**] who presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, and hypotension, found to have blocked CBD stent with frank pus.
He developed respiratory failure and was treated in the ICU for septic shock.
# Hypotension/Septic Shock: Most likely secondary to biliary source.
Nevertheless, he continued to develop episodes of hypotension with recurrent fevers on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**].
#) Respiratory failure: Intubated in ED secondary to altered mental status, extubated [**11-23**] and re-intubated [**11-24**] with low bp and rigors.
He had underlying CHF and COPD, and he continued to be difficult to wean from the vent.
#) Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely secondary to hypotension (SBP in 50s prior to intubation.
#) Pancreatic mass: Patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate.
He had no tissue diagnosis, but given that his CA [**54**]-9 was elevated, there was high suspicion that the mass represented a malignant process.
Unclear if he may have underlying encephalopathy vs delerium related to critical illness.
Poor synthetic function indicates likely underlying liver abnormality.
new [**12-2**]) and slight tremor in upper extremities b/l with repositioning.
No clonus on exam.
Head CT negative for acute process.
He received FFP prior to procedures, and his coagulopathy somewhat increased during his course.
ACE inhibitor was held because of his renal failure.
