Extensive non-occlusive portal thrombosis in the right, left and main portal veins extending to the SMV.
Ventricular lead has a relatively short ventricular excursion and may not be accurate.
Right basal edema has improved.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion is present.
DOPPLER LE: No evidence of deep [**Month/Day (4) 5703**] thrombosis.
CXR [**7-11**]: Since the prior study there has been slight interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is still present associated with bilateral large pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation  Abd Doppler [**2171-7-16**]: Patent TIPS shunt.

CT Head [**2171-7-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M with PMH cyptogenic cirrhosis and afib who presented with variceal bleeding, hypotension, and leukocytosis.
Noted to have multiple UE clots, and started on lovenox.
EGD positive for bleeding AVM x5, s/p ablation.
Course c/b by AMS thought to be [**1-10**] ICU delirium .
Hct remained stable with no further bleeding noted in house.
EGD several days after initial bleed significant for grade 2 non-bleeding esophageal varices and several oozing gastric AVM's.
# aspiration PNA: pt noted to have aspirated during intubation at OSH.
treated with clindamycin and CTX x7 days for presumed aspiration PNA and infection ppx as above.
Resolved by the time he wsa on the floor, and pt had no additional cough, purulent sputum or fever .
# Multiple thrombi and h/o PE: On pradaxa which was stopped due to GIB.
Obtained LLE doppler to r/o DVT and it was negative.
Pt developed asymmetrical edema of LUE while on the floor.
Although pt had recent h/o GIB, decision made to place on chronic anticoagulation as chance of stroke or other embolic/thrombotic event very high.
Pt is allergic to coumadin and pradaxa irreversible, so started on lovenox 90mg [**Hospital1 **].
Monitored for worsening of GIB for several days prior to discharge and hct remained stable.
Had diagnostic para at OSH which had high WBC count but not enough PMN to satisfy criteria for SBP.
Heme/onc was consulted and believed that given the acuity in onset, this represented leukemoid reaction rather than malignancy/dyscrasia.
several liters up at that time [**1-10**] aggressive volume resuscitation and was also being treated for PNA, which were the likely causes of his hypoxia.
Also had bilateral pleural effusions.
Obtained echo to eval cardiac function in setting of effusions and it showed "Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation."
#VRE Bacteruria: Pt grew VRE from urine several times, however, symptom free and UA not suspicious for infection.
Mental status waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] after extubation but he was oriented for the most part with some mild confusion.
Likely component of hepatic encephalopathy in setting of new TIPS.
Went into afib with RVR to 140s on [**7-11**] and became hypotensive to SBP 80s while in RVR.
This happened again on [**7-14**] (RVR to 150s + hypotension to SBP 80s).
He was asymptomatic at that time.
Went into one additional episode of Afib w/RVR on the floor with hypotension, however, reverted to NSR after 5mg metoprolol IV x3.
#CHF: History of ?diastolic CHF.
Volume overloaded in the ICU and started on IV lasix on floor.
Became euvolemic and continued on home dose of lasix.
# BPH Finasteride held in setting of bleeding and hypotension.

You had extensive bleeding from your stomach and esophagus.
We gound several sites of bleeding in your stomach.
You may have more sites of bleeding i your colon or bowel that we could not find with the camera we used.
We also found several nodules on your esophagus.
You had several episodes of atrial fibrillation that resulted in temporary lowering of your blood pressure.
