An abdominal US was sig for contracted gallbladder w/ wall thickening, sludge concerning for acute cholecystitis superimposed on chronic inflammatory changes, with mildly dilated CBD 9mm, and loculated ascites.
MRCP was notable for dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts and proximal CBD, with midportion of the CMB narrowed by extrinsic mass.
Urine cx grew enterococcus faecium (prior urine cx [**1-21**] sig for enteroccocus R to amp/vanc/macrobid, S linezolid/gent) and she was started on linezolid.
Labs on transfer sig for down trending ast/alt 127/94, ap 585, but persistently elevated t bili 3.9. .
ERCP was notable stricture at the common hepatic duct and bifurcation of main biliary duct w/ mild post-obstructive dilation compatible w/ extrinsic compression.
She had brief episode of sbp in 90s, received 100mcg of neo.
During procedure, patient had retained food in the stomach and with worry for aspiration in setting of possible SBO, she remained intubated.

ERCP [**2118-1-28**]: Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: Normal major papilla Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
There was mild post-obstructive dilation.
These findings are compatible with extrinsic compression.Likely large mass at porta hepatis causing Bismuth III type stricture.
There was mild post-obstructive dilation.
These findings are compatible with extrinsic compression.
Likely large mass at porta hepatis causing Bismuth III type stricture.
CXR [**2118-1-31**] In comparison with study of [**1-30**], allowing for differences in patient position, there is little change.
Left basilar opacification persists, consistent with volume loss and pleural effusion.
Diffuse pulmonary metastases are again seen.
Mid-small bowel obstruction, likely due to omental and anterior abdominal wall mass.
Necrotic left pelvic side-wall mass, possibly nodal.
Enlarged celiac axis, paraaortic, and right external illiac lymph nodes.
Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules compatible with metastatic disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with compressive atelectasis on the left side.
There is periportal edema and mild biliary ductal dilation.

No evidence for cholangitis.
Patient is currently s/p ERCP that was notable for stricture at the common hepatic duct and biliary duct.
SBO: Suspected SBO, given high grade emesis, abdominal pain and distension and from residual food seen in stomach during procedure.
Likely secondary to presumed extensive peritoneal involvement of her ovarian cancer.
CT torso was done which confirmed incomplete partial small bowel obstruction of small and large intestines without definite transition point identified.
Pt developed diarrhea as well, this was C diff negative x3.
By discharge, her emesis had stopped, and she was started on clear liquid diet with mild nausea.
Metastatic Ovarian Cancer: Extensive pulmonary mets as well as abdominal disease seen on CT torso, pt and family was made aware of this metastasis.
Aspiration PNA: Concern for aspiration PNA given aspiration event, leukocytosis, and tachycardia.
Diarhea:  She developed significant diarrhea, requiring rectal tube.
Stool was negative for C diff X 3. .
FEN: on clear liquid diets as of today, replete electrolytes, regular diet -- If cannot start tolerating POs soon will need nutrition consult for possible TPN .
HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.5 mg IV Q2H:PRN Pain Hold for sedation or RR<12 11.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cholecystitis Small Bowel Obstruction Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
We found a mass compressing the biliary tree.
You were also vomiting, because of a small bowel obstruction.
We treated you for an aspiration pneumonia and placed an nasogastric tube for your obstruction.
