History of Present Illness: 53M with a history of hepatitis B and resultant cirrhosis complicated by ascites, portal hypertension, varices and portal gastropathy as well as hepatocellular carcinoma.
In [**2173**], the patient had banding of varices and radiofrequency ablation of a 3 cm mass in the liver later that same year.
The patient's most recent endoscopy was on [**12/2174**], revealing no varices, benign post-banding stricture, portal hypertension and gastropathy.
The CT scan done on [**2-/2175**], revealed stable satisfactory appearance of the radiofrequency ablation site within segment VIII, no evidence of recurrence or new lesions, nonobstructing right renal calculi, cirrhosis, splenomegaly and esophageal varices.
He is known to be known to be e antigen positive, e antibody negative, and positive hepatitis A antibody.
He denies recent illnesses or hospitalization.
The patient denies any cardiac history or vasculopathy.
He has 5 siblings: 3 brothers all of whom have died from liver cancer; 2 sisters who are alive but have not been screened for CAHBV or liver cancer.
The remainder of the family history is noncontributory   Pertinent Results: Admission [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD WBC-1.8* RBC-4.03* Hgb-10.8* Hct-32.7* MCV-81* MCH-26.9* MCHC-33.2 RDW-16.7* Plt Ct-54* [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD Neuts-55.7 Bands-0 Lymphs-34.1 Monos-5.0 Eos-4.4* Baso-0.7 [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD PT-16.3* PTT-32.3 INR(PT)-1.5* [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD Fibrino-175 [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD Glucose-88 UreaN-17 Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-3.7 Cl-106 HCO3-27 AnGap-12 [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD ALT-32 AST-40 AlkPhos-90 TotBili-0.6 [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD Lipase-67* [**2175-4-30**] 12:28PM BLOOD CK-MB-5 cTropnT-0.03* [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD Albumin-4.5 Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.4 Mg-2.0 [**2175-4-30**] 01:15AM BLOOD HBsAg-POSITIVE* HBsAb-NEGATIVE [**2175-4-30**] 06:32AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-373* pCO2-42 pH-7.39 calTCO2-26 Base XS-0 Intubat-INTUBATED [**2175-4-30**] 06:32AM BLOOD Glucose-89 Lactate-0.9 Na-138 K-3.7 Cl-105 [**2175-4-30**] 06:32AM BLOOD Hgb-10.1* calcHCT-30 [**2175-4-30**] 06:32AM BLOOD freeCa-1.10*  Discharge Labs: ................................  [**5-1**] ECHO: Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No embolic material or air is seen in the RA or RV.
Subsuquent exam (45 minutes later): Patient on no vasoactive drips.
[**5-1**] US liver: No liver lesions, no biliary dilatation, and no ___hepatic collections identified.
3) Tiny right pleural effusion.
No ascites identified.
Compromised hepatic artery flow in the main hepatic artery and the left hepatic artery and more significantly in the right hepatic artery.
No biliary dilatation and no hepatic collections identified.
Small right pleural effusion.
High resistance flow within the proper hepatic artery and its branches.
Incidental findings of hepatic artery to hepatic vein fistula in the right lobe and also a hypervascular focus of uncertain etiology in the right lobe.
Significant improvement in arterial flow since yesterday with normal sharp upstroke is identified today in the main hepatic artery and left hepatic artery as described above.
Small right pleural effusion.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, although had a hypotensive episode intra-op.
The patient lost 3L of blood and received 6units of pRBC and 5L crytaloid in addition to ffp and plt.
The US showed compromised hepatic artery flow in the main hepatic artery and the left hepatic artery and more significantly in the right hepatic artery.
No biliary dilatation and no hepatic collections identified.
Due to this concerning study, a hepatic angiogram was performed, which showed a kink/bend seen at the site of the presumed arterial anastomosis of the hepatic artery.
High resistance flow within the proper hepatic artery and its branches.
Incidental findings of hepatic artery to hepatic vein fistula in the right lobe and also a hypervascular focus of uncertain etiology in the right lobe.
No thrombus or stenosis were not observed.
A repeat US performed the next day ([**5-5**]) showed significant improvement in arterial flow since yesterday with normal sharp upstroke is identified today in the main hepatic artery and left hepatic artery as described above.
He had several sessions with the liver coordinator for instruction with medication.
