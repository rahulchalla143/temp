Admission Date:  [**2182-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-7-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-1-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Erythromycin Base / Levaquin / Uroxatral / Valium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 99248**] is a 62yo gentleman with h/o lung adenocarcinoma s/p multiple resections who was initially admitted to surgery for work-up of fever and LFT abnormalities and then was transferred to the medical ICU with concern of cholangitis.
He has been undergoing a work-up for likely malignancy (either metastatic lung CA or new primary) as an outpatient.
A PET scan in mid-[**Month (only) 116**] demonstrated widespread osseous metastases, and he underwent right sacral biopsy on [**6-27**].
The night of the biopsy, he began to develop fevers up to 102 at home.
This was associated with nausea and some episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting.
Although he felt fatigued and somewhat lightheaded, he denied having chills, headache, sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.
He did have some pain at his biopsy site.
DFA was negative for influenza and outpatient labs demonstrated a new hyperbilirubinemia at 5.6 (up from 0.9 only 10 days earlier), and elevated LDH at 4980 (up from 496).
On [**7-2**], he was sent to the emergency room for evaluation of continued fevers with elevated LFTs.
RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis with gall bladder wall thickening and CT abdomen demonstrated periportal/peripancreatic fat stranding.
He was sent for urgent ERCP for concern of cholangitis and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
In addition, his preliminary pathology from his sacral biopsy indicated a likely diagnosis of lymphoma, and he was therefore transitioned to the medical service for work-up.
The study was normal without evidence of obstruction or extrinsic compression of the biliary tree.
He denied pain or difficulty breathing.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 99249**] difficulties began in early [**Month (only) 116**], when he was admitted with confusion and aphasia.
A head CT at [**Hospital1 **] demonstrated a 7mm lesion at the pontine/medullary junction.
Symptoms and LDH improved on a decadron taper at home although repeat imaging at [**Hospital1 **] showed no evidence of CNS lesion.

Micro: UCx [**7-2**] pending BCx [**7-2**] and [**7-3**] pending DFA negative for influenza  Imaging: PET scan from [**2182-5-31**]: 1.
Focal uptake (SUVmax 4.0) in the right lower lobe with corresponding nodule on CT compatible with primary lung neoplasm.
Widespread osseus metastases.
FDG-avid left perirenal metastasis.
Two focal intense areas of uptake in the ascending and transverse colon.
Possible liver metastasis.
No FDG uptake in the pancreas.
Consider further evaluation with HIDA scan if there is concern for acute cholecytitis.
CXR [**2182-7-2**]:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
In the setting of gallbladder wall edema and stones, clinical consideration of cholecystitits and correlation with HIDA scan is recommended.
Diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
Unchanged soft tissue deposit along Gerota's fascia of the left (***per [**2182-6-10**] read, was concerning for metastatic disease***).
Unchanged right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Unchanged hypodense pancreatic uncinate process lesion and unchanged cystic lesion in pancreatic tail, differential as noted in the [**2182-6-10**] CT.  ERCP [**7-3**]: - The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, biliary radicles, cystic duct, and gallbladder were filled with contrast and well visualized.
- The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects.
- The cystic duct appeared patent.
- The pancreatic duct was filled with contrast and visualized in the pancreatic head.
- The course and caliber of the duct are normal with no evidence of filling defects, masses, chronic pancreatitis or other abnormalities.
Right sacral biopsy [**6-28**]:  pending (prelim is lymphoma per onc team)   Brief Hospital Course: In short, Mr [**Known lastname 99248**] is a 62M with history of adenocarcinoma of the lung admitted with fevers in the setting of likely new diagnosis of lymphoma.
# Large B Cell Lymphoma: Had a bone marrow bx on [**7-4**] that showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Final path results from [**6-27**] biopsy showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
He had a TTE pre-chemo that showed normal wall motion without evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy on [**2182-7-5**] with vincristine and adriamycin at a decreased level based on elevated LFTs.
# Fevers: DDx included lymphoma, infection (cholecystitis/cholangitis), or pancreatitis.
In terms of infection, CXR, urine and blood cultures were negative to date and DFA showed no evidence of influenza.
Presentation did not seem consistent with bacterial meningitis.
His imaging showed some peripancreatic fat stranding that could be suggestive of pancreatitis.
No evidence of biliary obstruction on ERCP [**7-3**].
Was initally started on vanco and Aztreonam, then aztronam was changed to cefepime (note that patient is penicillin allergic).
Antbiotics were discontinued after transfer to the BMT service as once treated with high dose steroids his fevers stopped, thus likely secondary to lymphoma.
# Pancytopenia: likely [**3-4**] lymphoma, smear not consistent with hemolysis, however markedly elevated LDH, elevated indirect bilirubin and was direct Coombs positive, antibiodies likely present secondary to lymphoma.
The patient had a normocytic anemia, likely secondary to this hemolytic process, expected to improve with continued treatment of lymphoma.
Had normal iron studies, however markedly elevated ferritin, likely as acute phase reactant or underlying hemochromatosis.
Anemia was monitored with Q6H hct, active type and screen.
Other cell lines down likely secondary to lymphoma infiltrate into bone marrow.
# Elevated LFTs: Although pattern was suggestive of obstructive process, his ERCP was normal.
When checked, found that total bilirubin was elevated secondary to indirect bilirubinemia from hemolytic process.
Although, the patient has evidence of infiltrative process of right side of liver on PET scan.
# Hypotension: Had a bief episode of hypotension to 90/60 on surgical service.
# Hyponatremia: hypovolemic, likely from dehydration, improved w NS.
# Altered mentals status:  Unclear if this is simply that the patient is tired or if he has CNS involvement of his lymphoma.
Had a head CT that showed no acute process.
This was likely secondary to anesthesia given for the patient's ERCP.
# Dyslipidemia: Statin was held given elevated LFTs.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Diffuse B Cell Lymphoma .
Secondary Diagnoses: Adenocarcinoma of the lung s/p resection Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: You were hemodynamically stable prior to discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of fevers and elevated liver function tests.
While you were here the biopsy of the lesion on your hip, which was done as an outpatient, returned as a large B cell lymphoma.
Your fevers were attributed to your lymphoma and resolved once you were treated with chemotherapy.
If you experience chest pain, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention.
