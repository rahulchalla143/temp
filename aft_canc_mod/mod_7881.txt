Per her father, she has been confused for 3-4 days with complaints of recurrent and chronic abdominal pain.
She describes her abdominal pain as constant and nonradiating, the same as always.
In ED, AOx2(not date) with c/o abdominal pain.
She was afebrile in ED and prior to leaving 80 137/95 20 100% on RA.
Of note patient had recent admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 3242**] [**Date range (3) 94160**] where she presented with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain in addition to acute on chronic renal failure.
She was found to have peritonitis with lymphocytic predominance with unclear etiology but Tb vs malignancy was explored.
It seems she was seen by cardiology for CHF (including ICU stay for diuresis with BP support), renal for ARF, psych for coping, ID for peritonitis and surgery for peritonitis.
She was continued on Cellcept despite a slight transaminitis at that time.
She also had thrush and was started on fluconazole.

Brief Hospital Course: 38-year-old female with ALL s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, CHF secondary to anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy, embolic CVA on coumadin presented with altered mental status, ascites secondary to congestive hepatopathy, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation presumed to be secondary to cardiac GVHD with initial EF <10%.
# AMS: Patient initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with altered mental status likely multifactorial in etiology from factors such as uremia and hepatic encephalopathy.
There was no evidence of infection or substance abuse.
Paracentesis was performed on ascites that was not suggestive of peritonitis.
Her mental status improved without clear change in potential underlying cause.
# Acute on chronic congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction:  Patient presented with a depressed EF secondary to presumed GVHD.
Her ECHO on admission was read as 20%, but upon further review by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was <10% consistent with profoundly low cardiac output.
She was volume overloaded on admission.
Given the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] clinical course, the impression was that this did not represent anthracycline-based cardiomyopathy since this would be quite dramatic and irreversible at late stages.
She had myocardial biopsies in the past not showing T-cell infiltration based on prior pathology records, however, it was theorized that her presentation was most likely a result of GVHD affecting the heart.
In the CCU, she was diuresed with a combination of milrinone for inotropic support and furosemide with adjunctive metalozone.
She was again admitted to the CCU where she was diuresed and was taken for right heart cath which demonstrated pulmonary hypertension responsive to sildenafil.
With 100% FiO2: no change in wedge, PVR decreased to 480, wedge increased to 22.
With addition of milrinone: wedge decreased from 31 to 22, there was no change in cardiac output and PVR increased from 160 to 400.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient baseline creatinine 2.5 - 3.0 with admission Cr 3.8.
Urine sediment with many hyaline casts and few granular casts.
FeUrea 38% consistent with pre-renal state.
Likely multifactorial - may be part of GVHD, drug side effect tacrolimus, poor output secondary to CHF.
Renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction.
Throughout the remainder of her course, creatinine fluctuated as her cardiac output changed.
# Parainfluenza pneumonia: Patient developed new fever and pulmonary infiltrates on [**2174-7-7**], she was started IV vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia coverage.
Antibiotics were continued for a 14 day course given concern for bacterial suprainfection.
A sputum collection was also collected; 1 colony of aspergillus fumigatus grew out of the patient's culture.
She also developed a nose bleed.
There was concern that she had developed an invasive fungal infection of the sinuses that was perhaps dripping down through  BAL samples had no growth to date on the day of discharge.
# Transaminitis:  Worsened on admission compared to last set of outpatient labs on [**5-20**].
Secondary to congestive hepatopathy given CHF.
Hepatology was consulted and felt that clinical picture represented cholestatic hepatitis, but may be having fulminant hepatic failure if INR not due to coumadin effect.
# Coagulopathy: Supratherapeutic INR to ~16 on admission, reversed with Vit K and 2U FFP.
Elevated INR is multifactorial and related to congestive hepatopathy and drug interaction between fluconazole and warfarin.
# ALL: s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] complicated by GVHD on immunosuppression with recent decrease in prednisone dose to 50mg prior to admission.
#Left knee pain: While in hospital, patient developed acute onset of atraumatic left knee pain of unclear etiology.
Arthrocentesis ruled out infection and crystalline disease.
The joint fluid was sterile and contained a large number of marcrophages and lymphocytes as did the peritoneal fluid sampled during her last admission.
This may be a sign of broad serositis secondary to GVHD.
A left knee xray was performed to rule out AVN, but noted a periosteal reaction with bone mottled, which was concerning for early AVN.
With time, the pain resolved, etiology remains unclear.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium trended down to mid-120s during diuresis likely from heart failure given decreased effective circulating volume in addition to usage of thiazide.
# Hypocalcemia:  Likely secondary to bisphosphonate administration.
Ativan was given for muscle spasms for symptomatic relief.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient noted to have decrease in platelets since recent [**5-20**] labs of unclear etiology.
Hematology was following with impression of thrombotic microangiopathy from HIT, medication side effect, or other etiology based on blood smear and rising hemolysis markers.
Tacrolimus TMA seemed less likely as LDH rise preceded tacrolimus initiation.
Her HIT PF4 antibody returned weakly positive but a serotonin assay was negative.
# Normocytic anemia: Patient was admitted with Hct 34.5 that trended down to 22.8 requiring 2 units of pRBC.
No signs or symptoms or acute blood loss.
Etiology may be low grade hemolysis given insidious trend related to aforementioned thrombotic angiopathy.
# Embolic stroke in [**3-/2174**]: Patient was on coumadin as an outpatient.
In discussion with her primary oncologist and review of the MRI findings at the time of diagnosis, it was determined that embolic stroke was unlikely and Coumadin was discontinued.
# Abdominal pain: Extensive work-up in past with no clear etiology.
# Hyperglycemia: Secondary to steroid usage and tacrolimus.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Care Group  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Graft vs.
Host Disease Pulmonary arterial hypertension Parainfluenza pneumonia Congestive hepatopathy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your were brought to the hospital with confusion and found to be in heart failure.
Your heart failure is very complex and related to Graft vs.
You underwent cardiac catheterization to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and were started on nifedipine and sildenafil to treat pulmonary hypertension.
We also treated you with diuretics (torsemide) to remove the extra water that had accumulated in your lungs and legs as a result of the heart failure.
While in the hospital, you developed pneumonia and were found to have a viral infection called parainfluenza.
Patients with this infeciton commonly have a bacterial infection in the lungs as well and we treated you with antibiotics.
You also underwent bronchoscopy to collect samples for culture to identify a cause for your fevers.
A sputum culture that was collected grew out a mold called Aspergillus fumigatus so you were started on Voriconazole for treatment.
As part of the work-up to determine where this mold may have come from, you had a CT of your sinuses, which did not show evidence of infection.
We made the following changes to your home medication list: START Nifedipine for pulmonary hypertension START Sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension START Voriconazole for treatment of Aspergillus infection START Solumedrol (methyprednisolone) 60mg IV daily START digoxin for heart failure START omeprazole to protect your stomach while on steroids CHANGE torsemide to 40mg IV daily for heart failure STOP carvedilol.
Instead, take MS Contin (long-acting pain medication) twice a day.
