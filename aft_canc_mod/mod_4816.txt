There are low lung volumes.
Opacities in the right perihilar and right lower lobe regions could be atelectasis but early infection cannot be totally excluded and followup is recommended.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Markedly abnormal liver with multiple ill-defined masses throughout.
Markedly dilated intrahepatic ducts within the left lobe of the liver.
Moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation in the right lobe of the liver.
Common bile duct stent seen and appears similar in configuration to the recent ERCP of [**2187-10-24**], with an area of focal narrowing in the upper aspect of the stent.
Small amount of ascites, mainly over the right lobe of the liver and also small amount seen within the left upper quadrant.
Normal-appearing kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 87364**] is a 69 year-old gentleman with limited past medical history who was recently diagnosed with metastatic cancer to the liver from unknown primary and now s/p to ERCPs with 2 stent placements in the last 10 days presenting with elevated bili, hypotension, and acute renal failure.
Liver metastases from unknown primary: causing acute liver failure with jaundice/icterus, encephalopathy, ascites, coagulopathy, poor liver synthetic function.
He denied pain throughout admission, but was encephalopathic.
Acute Renal Failure: Renal service was consulted; the exact etiology of his acute kidney injury was unclear.
Possibly ATN related to meds or contrast, pre-renal state vs Hepatorenal Syndrome.
CT at [**Hospital **] hospital showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstructive process.
Likely some element from anemia (see below) but might have also been related to hypovolemia due to poor po intake over last two weeks or secondary to sepsis with a very elevated WBC.
He was responsive to initial fluid boluses but remained hypotensive at discharge to hospice.
He was initially transfused and workup pursued, but when he was made CMO, he received no further interventions.
Leukocytosis: etiologies that were considered include cholangitis, UTI (in the setting of ARF, though urine culture was negative), pneumonia (though CXR was unconvincing).
Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV Q4H:PRN agitation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] FAMILY HOSPICE HOUSE  Discharge Diagnosis: metastatic cancer to liver, unknown primary acute liver failure acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
