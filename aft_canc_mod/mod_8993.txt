She was in her USOH until [**4-15**]; on this day, she states that she went out walking and became extremely fatigued, more than her baseline.
Associated with this, she had an episode of chest pressure and right foot/ankle pain and swelling.
The episode of chest pressure was associated with SOB, but it has not recurred.
She states that she has had a few episodes of GI upset, but she denies any headaches or other neurologic symptoms.
She has noted easy bruising in the past few weeks (notably with bruising of LLE), but no bleeding.
She started taking ASA for her LE swelling and developed the bruising after this.

A head CT on [**2186-5-15**] was negative, but a head MRI on [**2186-5-18**] demonstrated multifocal signal abnormalities scattered throughout the cerebral sulci, with no evidence of septic emboli.
A torso CT on [**2186-5-19**] demonstrated bilateral ill-defined nodular densities within the lungs, a moderate-sized hiatal hernia, and unusual appearance of thickened folds within the proximal small bowel.
A repeat CT on [**2186-5-23**] demonstrated interval worsening of multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity and multiple ill-defined bilateral nodular densities within the lungs and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with an infectious/inflammatory process.
A CT on [**2186-6-6**] demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, involving the left upper, left lower and right lower lobe.
Two days after admission, she had an episode of SVT associated with chest pain and hypotension.
She was started on chemotherapy (vincristine, Daunorubicin, MTX, L-asparaginase, Prednisone), and had a negative reaction to L-asp, including fever, chills, abdominal pain and severe nausea, which was poorly controlled with compazine, anzemet, and zyprexa.
experienced a change in mental status consisting of increased somnolence and depression, which were thought to be secondary to physical deconditioning and prolonged hospitalization.
A CT on [**2186-6-3**] demonstrated a focal filling defect within a segmental branch of the right main pulmonary artery in the right lower lung zone, which represented a segmental pulmonary embolism.
The morning after the PE was discovered, the patient became acutely hypoxic and had a brief episode of hypotension.
A CT on [**2186-6-6**] demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, involving the left upper, left lower and right lower lobe, which was felt to be a possible etiology for her worsening respiratory status.
Due to her thrombocytopenia, the decision whether or not to anticoagulate was debated, and a decision was made to place an IVC filter to prevent further DVT -> PE, and she was placed on a heparin gtt with a plan to continue for 72 hours.
CXR was felt to be possibly c/w fluid overload, and the pt was given over 120mg IV lasix and UOP was more than 6L, but she remained with worsening respiratory status on BiPAP.
