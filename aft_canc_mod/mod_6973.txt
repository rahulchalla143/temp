She reports that he became slow to respond, and would take significant prompting to do things.
While there he had a CT of his head, which showed a new 4x4 cm cystic lesion in the R parietal lobe.
Some difficulty relaying history.
There was no evidence of apraxia.
Showed left sided neglect - unable to correctly bisect lines, only identified the woman at the sink in the cookie jar picture.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2  2 3   2 Left      2 2  2 3   2  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: Difficulty following commands for FNF, HTS, however no obvious dysmetria.
On Discharge: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2126-11-19**]: IMPRESSION: Large cystic lesion centered within the right parietal lobe with surrounding edema and minimal shift of normally midline structures towards the left.
Although morphologically more consistent with a primary brain neoplasm, a metastasis is primarily considered given further history obtained regarding a known primary lung malignancy.
Minimal uncal herniation is also identified.
MRI Brain [**2126-11-19**]: IMPRESSION: Large right temporal lobe mass with solid and cystic components and moderate mass effect.
Head CT [**2126-11-20**] (Post-op): Expected post-operative changes, immediately status post right temporoparietal craniotomy and resection of intra-axial mass.
Small foci of overlying subarachnoid hemorrhage and parenchymal hemorrhage at the resection margins.
Decrease in leftward shift of the midline structures, now measuring only 5 mm.
Enlargement of the left suprahilar nodule in comparison to [**6-/2126**], likely due to progression of malignancy.
Incompletely characterized hyperattenuating hepatic lesions, which can be further evaluated with MRI if clinically indicated.
They are not typical of metastatic disease and appear unchanged in size, although Hepatic cysts and additional hypoattenuating hepatic lesions that are too small to characterize.
Unchanged duodenal lipoma and equivocal benign-appearing left adrenal nodule in comparison to 10/[**2124**].
Bilateral renal cysts.
Additional small renal lesions are too small to characterize.
Air in the non-dependent portion of the urinary bladder, which may be due to instrumentation.
Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle is slightly less or unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 43109**] is a 71 yo male who was admitted to Neurosurgery Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2126-11-19**] for right parietal cystic lesion.
He was monitored closely overnight in SICU and remained at neurologic baseline with left neglect, motors full and following simple commands, but he remains with a dense left neglect.
He had post op MRI which showed stable post-op changes with some improvement to midline shift and mass effect.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
