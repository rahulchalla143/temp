During her stay in rehab after her last admission, she complained about loose stools and abdominal pain.
On the day before her current admission, she reported abdominal pain and passage of loose black stools in the PM.
She reported chills but no fever.

On exam she had BRBPR and two large bright bloody bowel movements.
She had a small amount of non-bloody non-biliary emesis and so was not NG lavaged.
Chest X ray showed no free air but some pulmonary edema.

Ok to restart heparin for her MVR, but please monitor serial hct Please prep for colonoscoppy tomorrow with movi-prep .
She may have had slight bleeding from internal hemorrhoids, but not current stigmata of bleeding was found.
Biopsy [**2116-10-30**]: Terminal ileum, mucosal biopsy (A): Small intestinal mucosa with minimal superficial acute inflammation, otherwise within normal limits.
PENDING STUDIES: YERSINIA ENTERCOLITICA ANTIBODIES (IGG,IGA) Results Pending   Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hosptialization: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with PMH of tachy/brady syndrome with [**Company 1543**] Sigma dual-chamber pacemaker, s/p MVR with St. Jude's valve, DM2 and recent episodes of GI bleed who presented to the ED with report of BRBPR.
In house she never experienced hemodynamic comprimise and had no significant drop in Hct.
EGD and colonoscopy failed to reveal source of bleed and she was noted to not have bloody stools while we observed her.
She also presented with recent history of diarrhea and we found terminal ileitis which on biopsy showed mild, superficial inflammation.
She had belly pain which resolved with treatment for gaseous distension and antibiotics for UTI.
ACUTE CARE: .
GI bleed, loose stools: Patient had an initial complaint of dark stools at rehab and presented to the ED with two reported episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
For concern of acute bleed, she was transferred to the MICU where she underwent EGD and colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy showed internal hemmorhoids and terminal ileitis with a few small polyps and no source of potential significant bleed.
There was no active bleeding and a biopsy was taken of the terminal ileum which later showed minor superficial inflammation.
The GI team suggested possible MR enterography in the future if there is concern for Crohn's, but this is very low on the differential given her age of presentation.
UTI: Pt had grossly positive UA, and was started on Bactrim for complicated UTI given catheter-associated.
Preliminary culture data showed E. coli with sensitivities pending at the time of discharge.
She should have Cr rechecked at rehabilitation to assess for improvemeent.
Volume Overload: Home torsemide was initially held given concern for GI bleed as above.
She appeared euvolemic though with mild crackles on exam.
[**Hospital3 **] for MVR - Last echo done in [**2112**] demonstrated no MR and good prosthesis function and no MR murmur heard on exam.
No evidence of diastolic (mild LA enlargement) or systolic (EF>55) dysfunction.
Warfarn dose should be rechecked at rehabilitation given recent antibiotics.
-Patient will follow-up with gastroenterology as an outpatient for her question GI bleed and terminal ileitis and diarrhea with incidental finding of cirrhotic-appearing liver.
She had no stigmata of cirrhosis, and the findings of this CT were thought to be not of significance.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for concern of bleeding into your gastrointestinal tract.
Our CT scan did show some inflammation of part of your small intestine, and we biopsied this during your colonoscopy.
The biopsy showed only mild inflammation.
You were transitioned back to your coumadin, which was held for the concern of bleed, and we treated a urinary tract infection and took off extra fluid with diuretics.
With these interventions we saw no further bleed and your belly pain and nausea improved.
