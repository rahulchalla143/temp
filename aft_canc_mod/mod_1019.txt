Her Levofloxacin was changed to Augmentin as the patient continued to spike fevers through the Levofloxacin.
The patient developed night sweats as well as inguinal pain.
She was admitted on [**11-21**] for evaluation of fever, night sweats and evaluation of vomiting  On admission the patient's O2 sat was 92%.
The chest x-ray was read as diffuse interstitial infiltrates with bibasilar air space opacities and small pleural effusions compatible with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan on [**11-22**] of the abdomen and chest showed chronic lung changes manifested as interstitial thickening with several punctate cystic lesions and increased consolidation in the right upper and lower lobes with a moderate right sided pleural effusion.
Pericholecystic fluid was seen as well as extensive lymphadenopathy in the inguinal region, thorax and supraclavicular and axillary regions.
Over the past two days the patient has had increasing fevers, increasing oxygen requirements and dyspnea.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-24**] chest x-ray repeated showed a combined alveolar interstitial pattern, which has progressed since [**11-22**].
The [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] moonlighter was called to see the patient at 10:00 p.m. with progressive dyspnea and O2 requirements necessitating 100% nonrebreather.
The patient at that time denied abdominal pain, chest pain and had been compliant with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  HIV since [**2102**], systolic murmur, negative PPD, but anergic pneumonia as described.
Zoster in a VI nerve distribution with post herpetic neuralgia, high grade cervical dysplasia status post cryotherapy, anxiety, depression, left sided oophorectomy, microbacterium in sputum in [**2111**], migraines and herpes.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck bilateral anterior and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.
Respiratory bilateral crackles, no wheeze.
No extremity edema.
Chest x-ray showed worsening alveolar interstitial infiltrates bilaterally right greater then left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 41 year-old end stage who with rapidly progressive pulmonary process likely bacterial pneumonia, though PCP possible, but less likely.
Protonix was given for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
Marked anion gap acidosis likely secondary to lactic acidosis.
Increased ventilation was used for respiratory compensation.
Overnight the patient progressively worsened with increasing oxygen requirements.
The patient became progressively more hypotensive requiring considerable pressor support.
