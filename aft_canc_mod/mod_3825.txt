He presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 5595**] with shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**], found at [**Hospital1 5595**] to have RLL pneumonia.
He has had several days of profound fatigue.
He states that he regularly has some chest pain, both on exertion and at rest, typically once a day, including the morning of admission, though he does not think this has changed recently.
He does have some worsening shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**], and some cough.
He developed leukocytosis on [**2182-4-30**] from 7.1 -> 12.7 with 91% PMN no bands.
ECG showed appreciable inferolateral ST depressions, and a troponin was checked and was elevated at 2.18.
Cards was consulted, but given his overal condition felt he was not a candidate for early revascularization and recommended heparin gtt.

Prior chest CT from [**2178-10-30**] is also available for comparison.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 82-year-old man with shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**].
Evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
There are increased patchy opacities involving both lungs which is most compatible with multifocal pneumonia, though mild superimposed congestion cannot be excluded.
There may be small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with multifocal pneumonia with possible superimposed mild congestion, bilateral small pleural effusions.
<br>  [**5-5**] EKG - sinus, 1st degree block - noted ST/TW changes from admission - without changes, mild prolonged Qtc <br>  [**5-2**] Echo - EF noted 45-50% <br> The left atrium is dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior wall and hypokinesis of the inferior septum.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-2-1**], the inferior septum appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study and the inferior wall is frankly akinetic.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown prior, CAD, advanced Parkinson's Disease p/w PNA and UTI from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab - found also to have positive biomarkers for NSTEMI (due to demand stress) - admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - cardiology notified - tx with hep gtt - otherwise just medical management, and with abx for PNA.
Geriatrics service consulted (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over weekend) for assistance - note after full discussion with pt and family - pt wants aggressive treatment as possible (including full onc evaluation that is planned for [**2182-5-13**] as outpt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (has been notified and aware of patient's concerns).
Pt without CP complaints past 48h with EKGs without changed today from initial admission - however trop further elevated than admission levels (mid 2 range) now at 4.37 - with lack of sx or ekg changes will cont current managment acutely but asking for full cardiology evaluation for further assistance (as pt is interested in aggressive treatment options after full discussion).
Dispo: await cardiology assessment, noted mid-line access lost over weekend, PICC nurse unable to access - awaiting IR PICC access in am - once PICC placed and cardiology eval completed - can transfer to back to [**Hospital **] rehab.
Pt tx with vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/levoflox with double coverage for gram negatives in ICU - on [**5-3**] on floor - with pt doing better - d/c levoflox - BCx without growth to date - no sputum sent for cx prior - given [**Hospital **] hospital stay and from NH - will cont coverage for HAP with vanc - and cont meropenum course.
However on [**5-5**] - pt lost complete access - PICC nurse unable to attain any access, and unable to locate site for EJ attempt - given clinical stability AND that pt with PNA process not UTI - will cont treatment with just levofloxacin po - and restart today - and d/c meropenem as a result.
<br>  # UTI: h/o ESBL Klebsiella in the last.
However with 5/27 UCx results - no active infection from urinary tract - so abx for PNA process as above (thus ok to change to levofloxacin from meropenem).
<br>  # NSTEMI: positive biomarkers, ST depressions on ECG and new inferior akinesis on echo.
AMI is likely a couple of days prior to admission given the relatively low CK and more elevated troponins vs more demand effects from infection.
<br>  # metastatic CA: Patient was recently diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.
<br>  # anemia:  likely due to hematuria.
Stable, hematuria resolved.
# CKD, stage III Cr at baseline (1.3 - 1.6)  # Hyponatremia - mild - and more hypervolemia per exam.
