Note is made of mild tricompartmental osteophytosis.
There is a small enthesophyte at the insertion of the quadriceps tendon.
Peribronchial infiltration and ground-glass opacity with bilateral lower lobe predominance may be infectious or inflammatory.
Leukemic infiltrate is considered less likely given the rapid development.
Appearance is not consistent with pulmonary edema.
Several new nodules measuring up to 1 cm may be related to above process.
Recommend CT followup after resolution of acute symptoms.
Diffuse abnormal bone mineralization related to patient's known AML.

# Fever: 3 episodes of febrile neutropenia.
1) Admitted with spiking fevers to 102, chest x-ray showed left lobe infiltrate concerning for developing pneumonia.
Micafungin was added for fungal coverage when patient continued to spike fevers on antibiotics.
No culture growth, and fevers resolved with treatment of leukemia.
Sepsis resolved.
Cx [**7-11**] with Ecoli sensitive to meropenem.
Ddx included drug fever, fungal PNA (CT showing "tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]" lesions).
Patient also developed diarrhea, C. diff toxins were negative, but PCR positive, so patient started on PO Vancomycin.
Diffuse erythematous rash spreading from central to distal, involving the face, mildly pruritic but otherwise asymptomatic.
Found in afib w RVR on routine physical exam one morning.
Given lopressor 5mg IV x2 with little response.
# Diffuse edema and PMR like joint pain: occurred suddenly after starting MEC.
Diffuse edema in joints, severe pain bilaterally in TMJs, shoulder girdle, wrists/fingers, knees/ankles.
# Hypoxia: Was noted to be hypoxic to 80s while sleeping early into hospital course, placed on nonrebreather and transferred to ICU for monitoring and management.
Repeat chest x-ray was suspicious for pneumonia vs. leukemic infiltrate vs. pulmonary edema, so his abx coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin and he was also given lasix.
CT chest was done and showed ground glass opacity suspicious for infection vs. inflammation.
# Knee pain: He complained of right knee pain on admission, exam showed small effusion and did not show signs of infection.
Pain and swelling was believed to be related to possible leukemic infiltrate.
Pain controlled with lidocaine patch.
# History of portal vein thrombosis: Occurred in the setting of spleenectomy which was complicated by portal vein thrombosis and hemorrheage.
Given expected thrombocytopenia with chemotherapy, and the need for urgent central line placement, warfarin was held and INR reversed with FFP and Vitamin k.  Repeat CT abdomen showed resolution of portal vein thrombosis, so coumadin was not restarted on discharge.
# Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
Reassess need to continue PO diltiazem as patient remained in sinus rhythm since [**7-10**].

You came to the hospital with fevers and was found to have leukemia.
When you were just starting your chemotherapy, you were found to have low oxygen level in your blood.
Your bone marrow biopsy in the middle of chemotherapy showed no signs of malignant cells.
You can stop your hydroxyurea for polycythemia because these cells should be treated from the chemotherapy.
You had an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation) while you were sick.
If this irregular heart beat starts again, you may need anticoagulation with coumadin.
You had intermittent fevers during this hospital stay.
Your blood grew E. coli and Enterococcus (two types of bacteria) and you were treated with antibiotics through the vein.
You developed rashes on your back and on your chest while you were on the antibiotics.
Dermatologists saw you and biopsied your rash, which showed allergic reaction to medications.
Your CT scan of your lung was concerning for fungal infection.
You also had some loose stools while you were here, and we found a bacterial infection in your intestines.
We treated you with oral antibiotic, and you will continue Vancomycin till [**8-18**].
