History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with a right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial invasion at the level of the superior segment and distal bronchus intermedius.
He had undergone previous cervical mediastinoscopy which was negative for any mediastinal nodal disease.
He then underwent 8 weeks of pulmonary rehab.
He was admitted for lobectomy or possible bilobectomy with the help that we could simply do a right lower lobectomy; but in order to get an adequate bronchial margin, this would likely require a tubular bronchoplasty or reanastomosis of the right middle lobe onto the bronchus intermedius.
COPD, currently undergoing pulmonary rehab to pursue surgical resection of the right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma.
