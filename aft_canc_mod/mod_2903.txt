He was admitted to OSH on [**2107-6-18**] for acutely worsening abdominal pain on the background of constipation.
He underwent colonoscopy which showed intussusception and fungating cecal mass with biopsies showing invasive adenoCa.

Pst-operatively, on [**6-25**] he developed hypotension requiring Levophed gtt over the weekend which was weaned off the night prior to transfer.
A TTE was read as reduced LVEF to 25%, with mid/distal anterior wall akinesis, and inferior wall akinesis/scarring.
LV apex documented as akinetic as well with mild impairment of the RV iwth free wall hypokinesis.
Compared to his [**6-21**] echo, the only read was mild concentric LVH, LVEF of about 54%, with inferior wall akinesis/scarring/inferolateral wall hypokinesis.
He complains of severe pain in his right leg, behind the calf and in the knee.
Has numbness in lower extremities that is chronic.
Denies any chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
No abdominal pain.
No new rashes.
No headaches or visual changes.
Denies any history of alcohol withdrawal seizures.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Otherwise no deep venous thrombosis noted in the right lower extremity.
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
An increase in density of the right lung base is likely caused by patient rotation.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Selective native coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coroanry artery disease.
The LAD had a 60% lesion in the mid segment.
The LCX had an 80% lesion in the proximal segment, and the distal LCX was supplied by a patent SVG graft.
Selective venous conduit angiography demonstrated patent SVG to OM and SVG to RCA grafts.
Selective arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA to LAD graft.
Left heart catheterization revealed a severely elevated LVEDP of 28 mmHg.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve with carefull pullback.
Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
The mean RA pressure was moderately elevated at 14 mmHg, and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 18 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 47/22 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 32 mmHg.
The SVR was mildly reduced at 585 dyne-sec/cm5.
The PVR could not be calculated due to the lack of a wedge pressure tracing.
Due to severely elevated filling pressures, the patient was given 80 mg IV lasix.
Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures treated with 80 mg IV lasix.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly reduced SVR.

Discharge labs:  [**2107-7-2**] 07:35AM BLOOD WBC-5.7 RBC-3.51* Hgb-10.5* Hct-32.5* MCV-93 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.3 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-246 [**2107-7-2**] 07:35AM BLOOD Glucose-87 UreaN-9 Creat-0.6 Na-139 K-3.4 Cl-103 HCO3-24 AnGap-15 [**2107-6-30**] 06:05AM BLOOD Calcium-8.1* Phos-3.8 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 60205**] is a 75 year old man with history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with left main (LM) stent in [**2106-6-9**] and prior CABG in [**2104**] who is transferred to the CCU from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for concern for NSTEMI given hypotension and decreased LVEF following surgery for large colon mass.
He underwent cardiac cath with no interventions, thought to have a autolysed thrombosis from heparin gtt > 48 hours before cath.
# CAD: patient has significant CAD s/p CABG and recent PCI in 2/[**2106**].
Prior to surgery his EF was 45% by echo and then after the surgery he was hypotensive and developed new focal wall motion abnormalities with depressed EF to 25%, concerning for new ischemia.
He was restarted on a heparin drip to cover for an acute plaque ruputure and admitted to the CCU.
Cardiac cath showed chronic disease with occluded RCA, LAD 60% occluded but prior stent patent, and Left circumflex 80% occluded.
We felt that the new wall motion abnormality and troponin elevation represented a true ischemic event, brought on by massive surgery, but that his prolonged heparin gtt was effective in lysing the clot prior to cath.
# Systolic congestive heart failure: patient has history of decreased EF however his preop TTE showed EF of 50% and postop showed EF of 25% with focal wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemic heart failure due to MI perioperatively.
# Delerium- patient became delirious in the evenings, and required haldol 0.25mg x2.
# Colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy at OSH: His wound healed well and he was able to pass stool and eat during this admission.
#Liver cirrhosis:  He had a CT abdomen at the OSH for staging which showed nodular liver and the intraoperative report noted a nodular, cirrhotic liver.
Albumin was 3.2  Social work was consulted to help with his alcohol abuse and he should have further work-up and follow-up for chronic cirrhosis.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - New diagnosis of cirrhosis need outpatient FU - Has f/u appt with surgeon on [**7-12**], wife has appt details.
