She then became tachycardic, with a HR of 136.
She was given 0.5mg ativan PO for anxiety which then caused her BP to drop further to 80s/50s.
Ms. [**Known lastname 60949**] appeared diaphoretic and continued to be tachypneic, with RR in the 40s.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Onc history: Mrs. [**Known lastname 60949**] was diagnosed with MDS in [**2169-9-9**] after a greater than 6 year history of anemia treated with iron supplementation.
In [**7-14**] [**Known firstname **] became more fatigued and irritable and was noted to be pancytopenic.
Bone marrow biopsy at that time showed: hypercellular for age bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia, moderately dysplastic granulopoiesis, mildly increased myeloblasts, megaloblastic and dysplastic erythropoiesis, abundant megakaryocytes wtih frequent small hypolobate dysplastic forms, decreased stainable iron, no ring sideroblasts seen, and mild to focally moderatley increased bone marrow reticulin.
Her biopsy and aspirate were consistent with a myelodysplatic disorder.
Cytogenetics show multiple abnormalities including a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 and trisomy 8.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: AML- supportive tx only (no chemo/radiation) s/p fall [**12/2169**] sustaining a right trimalleolar fracture CHF- [**2170-4-9**] Paroxysmal Afib bradycardia Colon Cancer- no radiation or chemotherapy Depression UTI [**5-15**] Urinary urgency/incontinence Stoma bleeding- [**2170-4-9**] .
[**Name (NI) **] mother died of a stroke in [**2127**].
Physical Exam: VS - T 99.3 P 67 BP 140/60 RR 30 O2sat 95% 5L NC Gen: Elderly female, Russian only speaking, thin female, in mild resp distress.
Neck supple, no evidence of JVD.
Lungs: Crackles [**12-11**] way up lungs bilaterally, no wheezes, poor resp.
+ hernia around ostomy site.
No masses, no HSM appreciated.
There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter in place, with the tip in the proximal right atrium.
Moderate-to-severe congestive failure persists.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate-to-severe congestive failure.
An underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded  Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo f with MDS recently tranformed to leukemia presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after acute onset SOB likely due to CHF exacerbation with possible PNA as well.
On admission the patient had evidence of volume overload on CXR an on exam.
It was thought that there may also have been a component of leukocytosis contributing to her resp distress as well given her CBC showing 80% blasts.
For her possible leukocytosis she was given hydrea, 500mg x1 and 1000mg x1.
Although she responded to diuresis, given her refractory leukemia she remained transfusion dependent and unfortunately with transfusion would become overloaded with worsening respiratory status.
She continued to complain of SOB and she began to require morphine IV to make her breathing more comfortable.
She was continued on Nitropaste and given morphine as needed for comfort.
When she became CMO her antibiotics were discontinued and labs were no longer checked.
