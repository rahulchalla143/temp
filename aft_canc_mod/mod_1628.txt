Left adrenal adenoma.
SURGERY:  [**9-27**] - right limited pelvic lymphadenectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy.
NARRATIVE SUMMARY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 31225**] is a 61-year-old man diagnosed with carcinoma of the prostate.
During his preoperative evaluation, he was found to have a left adrenal mass.
He was seen and it was felt that he did not have pheochromocytoma.
The prostatectomy was difficult because of periprostatic adhesions.
There was no concern about a rectal injury, but inspection at the conclusion of the surgery was negative for this.
However, postoperatively, he did complain of more rectal pain than average, and therefore he was kept on a liquid diet right up through the time of discharge.
