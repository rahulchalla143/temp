Pt was also recently discharged on [**2142-12-30**] after presenting with nausea, chills, tachypnea, hypoxia, and tachycardia after being given platelet transfusion and IVIG, thought to be CHF exacerbation (improved with diuresis).
He was admitted again on [**12-5**] for shortness of breath due to likely early signs of tamponade and had a pericardial drain placed (removed after 1 day with no signs of reaccumulation).
Pt now presents with c/o fever and increased O2 requirement.
2 days PTA the pts wife again noted the pt turned pale and was satting at 93% while watching TV.

Per the pts wife, the pt also has increased leg pain and weakness which has progressed to the point that the pt is unable to stand.
CXR revealed a R pleural effusion increased in size from prior.

Basilar atelectasis is again noted.
A hazy left upper lobe opacity is again noted.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction [**10-4**] percent).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-1-9**], a very small posterolateral pericardial effusion is now present (no tamponade).
BL patchy and nodular opacities c/w an infectious process.
Large R pleural effusion and fluid along major and minor fissures.
Small L pleural effusion.
Small  Loculated collection in anterior R chest wall is decreased in size.
EKG: tachycardia with rate 140s, leftward axis, LVH, LV strain evidenced by ST depression in V2, V4 and V5   Brief Hospital Course: 49 y.o.
man with CLL who presented with febrile neutropenia and SIRS.
# SIRS/ID:  The pt presented with fever up to 100.7, tachycardia in 130s-150s, and tachpnea to the 30s on admission.
The pt however never experienced hypotension or had an elevated lactate.
The ddx for likely sources of infection included parapneumonic effusion/PNA and bacteremia.
CTA on admission also showed continued diffuse nodular opacities, a small resolving loculated collection in anterior chest wall, and a large R pleural effusion.
The pt was continued on cefepime and vancomycin given his febrile neutropenia and potential staph aureus in the blood.
He was continued on flagyl for empiric c diff treatment given his chronic diarrhea.
Voriconazole was continued  for resistant oral [**Female First Name (un) **] and aspergillosis seen on BAL in the past, and valacyclovir was continued for oral HSV treatment (the pt was on valacyclovir and voriconazole from his previous admission in [**11-19**]).
On [**1-23**] the pts R sided pleural effusion was tapped after US guided marking.
The effusion appeared exudative in nature given elevated LDH and protein ratios.
The pleural fluid grew MRSA, and it is likely the pt seeded his pleural fluid by an infected PICC line (given the MRSA on [**1-21**] blood cx prior to PICC line removal).
He was also on empiric flagyl for diarrhea (c.dif neg; c.dif toxin b neg).
#Increased O2 requirement/tachypnea:  The pts tachypnea was felt to be related to either his R sided pleural effusions or his overall infectious lung process.
There were no signs of pericarditis or recurrent tamponade given TTE on admission which showed only a small pericardial effucsion.
As per above his R pleural effusion was tapped on [**1-23**].
He also required Lasix 20 mg IV on both [**1-23**] and [**1-24**] for mild volume overload.
He was dosed with lasix if he was SOB and felt to be fluid overloaded.
The pt was placed on neutropenic precautions and neutropenic diet.
Famvir was continued for acyclovir resistant Herpes infection.
He remained tachycardic during the admission which was felt to be due to illness / cardiomyopathy.
Cardiomyopathy:  The pt has known dilated cardiomyopthy with EF 20%.
Pt is s/p recent pericardial drain, however repeat TTE on admission showed only small pericardial effusion and EF still 20%.
ALK PHOS ELEVATION / HYPERCALCEMIA: For unclear reasons, on admission to the floor his alk phos was elevate to the thousands, and he was hypercalcemic.
Imaging revealed only hemosiderin changes, and no heptosplenic candidiasis (on MRI).
He was given a dose of pamidronate, as well as kept on increased maintenance fluids and lasix, which helped to correct his calcium.
A bone scan did not have any revealing source of new bone lesions ot account for this incerase.
He had no hypertensive issues during hospitalization.
# F/E/N: Neutropenic diet, TPN started on floor, with feeding tube (NG) placed on [**2143-2-10**] for home care.
