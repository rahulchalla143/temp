He notes that since his discharge he has had worsening fatigue and increased crampy pain in his legs with exertion (bilaterally, oppsed to his baseline left leg pain).
He's also had decreased appetite and overall energy.

He went to his scheduled vascular appointment today where he was found to be pale, and noted to have a Hct drop and subsequently referred to the ED.
EKG showed NSR, no signs of ischemia.

Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side, are consistent with likely small pleural effusions and consolidations.
There is mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR [**4-20**]: IMPRESSION: Substantial interval improvement of post CABG pulmonary vascular congestion and left-sided pleural effusion.
EGD [**4-19**]: Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus No blood or bleeding.
No abnormality to accound for GI bleeding Polyp in the second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  ECG	Study Date of [**2172-4-20**]  5:16:08 PM Sinus rhythm.
Inferior Q waves with T wave inversions.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction with lateral involvement.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yom with CAD, s/p NSTEMI with DES placed [**3-30**], recent diagnosis of a. fib, discharged on [**4-1**] on aspirin/plavix/rivaroxaban now presenting with significant Hct drop in setting of GI bleed, initially admitted to MICU.
# GI bleed with Hct drop:  Hct 19.7 on admission.
Given dark stools without signs of bright red blood, most likely represents an upper GI bleed in setting of starting aspirin, plavix, rivaroxaban.
He was maintained on protonix ggt and changed to PO PPI once EGD showed no active bleed.
Rivaroxaban was held given low daily stroke risk with afib and discharge plan for this was to continue to hold it.
Lisinopril was held given bleed and was restarted at discharge.
# SOB:  Pt developed acute SOB on morning of [**4-17**].
CXR showed concern for volume overload vs. TRALI in setting of blood transfusion.
# Recent NSTEMI: S/p DES in OM1 graft, discharged on aspirin/plavix.
Both were continued given the high risk of in-stent thrombosis, though aspirin was initially changed to 81mg in-house and changed to 81 mg on discharge.
Metoprolol was continued at lower dose given GI bleed and was changed back to home dose on discharge.
No cardioversion performed.
Overall has very low daily risk of CVA off of anticoagulation (~5% yearly risk) so held rivaroxaban with plan for continued holding on d/c and follow up with PCP/ cardiologist.
# PVD: On cilostazol as outpt for PVD for symptomatic treatment.
# GERD: Maintained on protonix ggt and then changed to [**Hospital1 **] PPI  # Transitional Issues -Pt is full code -Needs outpt follow up for barrett's esophagus -Restarting cilostazole per PCP.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: # Acute blood loss anemia # Gastrointestinal bleed  Secondary diagnosis: # Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of fatigue and dark stools concerning for a gastrointestinal bleed.
