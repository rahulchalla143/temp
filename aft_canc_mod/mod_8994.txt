There is nonspecific small bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.
The bilateral visualized lung fields are without gross infiltrate.
No evidence of free air to suggest perforation on the lateral decubitus films.
Residual contrast is seen within the distal colon, and there is nonspecific small bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.
[**2183-10-21**] Head CT without contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are moderately enlarged, consistent with age-appropriate atrophy.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities including infarction or hemorrhage.

[**2183-10-25**] Portable Abdomen: There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is no free air.
The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with emphysema.
Aside from minimal atelectasis in the left base, the lungs are otherwise clear.There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There are no interval changes.
A preprocedural huddle and timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed in a triangular fashion, elevating the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall.
A small skin incision was made between the T-fasteners and a 19-gauge needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance.
The position of the needle was confirmed with small contrast injection, and a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was placed through the needle.
The tract was further dilated with the telescopic soft tissue dilator and a peel-away sheath was placed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
multiple dilated loops of small bowel concerning for SBO.
no free air.
bibasilar atlectesis.
Brief Hospital Course: # Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: Abdominal mass and pulmonary nodule are both PET avid and were concerning for either a second primary or metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, with evidence of tumor in liver, peripancreatic, probably posterior LN, and portal vein.
Prior EGD-biopsy of the mass was inconclusive performed at a outside hospital.
Repeat biopsy of the abdominal mass was done at time of ERCP on [**2183-10-14**] and results returned [**2183-10-15**] showed poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with colonic primary site.
However, she developed recurrent small bowel obstructions, for which she is a non-operative candidate.
# Obstructive jaundice: Pt underwent an attempted ERCP [**2183-10-14**] for decompression but cannulation of the ampulla was unseccessgul due to tumor mass.
On [**2183-10-15**] she underwent percutaneous catheter decompression via Interventional Radiology team and tolerated both procedures without immediate complication and with lab evidence of decompression.
The patient experienced significant post procedure pain thought secondary to the lengthy tumor that was cannulated for stent placement.
Her pain was treated with narcotic analgesia.
Perforation was ruled out with abdominal plain films.
# COPD with Hypoxemia and Hypercarbia: The patient developed a new oxygen requirement shortly after her initital percutaneous biliary catheter was placed.
A CTA was negative for PE, but showed marked emphysema.
On the day following placement of her metal biliary stent on [**2183-10-20**], the patient became acutely more confused with an increasing oxygen requirement.
A head CT without contrast was negative for an acute process.
ABG showed marked hypercarbia.
THe patient was tranferred for 1 day to the ICU for management for hypoxia and hypercapnea.
Her hypoxia was likely due COPD, narcotics, and volume overload from IVF and resolved with IV Lasix.
Signs of mild delirium waxed and waned.
She had another episode of hypercapneic respiratory failure [**2183-11-4**], which resolved with naloxone.
Narcotic analgesia and benzodiazepines were entirely stopped.
# Upper GI bleeding: The patient passed a large melenic, guaiac + stool on [**2183-10-23**] with a drop in her hematocrit for which she was transfused 1 unit PRBSs on [**2183-10-24**].
The etiology was felt to be her known necrosing duodenal tumor mass and discussions with the GI consult service and her covering primary oncologist felt that there was no role for endoscopic intervention.
Radiation oncology consult was obtained to consider several fractions of radiation to the duodenal tumor mass in an effort to slow her blood loss.
# Small bowel obstruction: On [**2183-10-25**] the patient developed acute nausea and vomiting.
Plain film of the abdomen revealed multiple air fluid levels consistant with a small bowel obstruction and thought to be secondary to the patient's known tumor mass.
On [**2183-10-29**] a venting gastrojejunostomy tube was placed without complication and the patient's nasogastric tube was removed the following day.
Late on the evening of [**2183-10-31**], the patient developed abdominal distension and right upper quadrant pain, a repeat abdominal film again showed multiple air fluid levels consistant with small bowel obstruction despite little output from when the patient's venting G tube was placed to suction.
Her symptoms improved, but repeat KUB showed worsening SBO.
# Hypotension/tachycardia/acute renal failure: On [**2183-10-26**] the patient became hypotensive, tachycardic, and less responsive with an elevated BUN/creatanine of 30/1.2.
Her fluid status has been difficult to manage given her poor nutrition, small bowel obstruction with nasogastric drainage, and propensity for congestive heart failure prior to her intensive care unit transfer.
She understands her disease is terminal and she is very sick with many life-threatening conditions and a high chance of never improving.
