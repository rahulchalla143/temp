Concerning the patient's second episode of anaphylaxis on [**2148-9-17**], the patient had eaten a cheeseburger for dinner and shortly afterwards reported increasing abdominal pain followed by shortness of breath.
She was ordered back to the regular floor on [**9-19**] where here abdominal pain she graded as 2 to 3 out of 10, however, it still required Dilaudid 2 to 3 mg IV q2 to 3 hours.
Soon after that because the pain was so well controlled it was decided that the patient should give a trial of p.o.

She was given two tablets of Percocet and after 5 minutes she said the pain had gotten worse to 7 out of 10.
The pain was radiating to her chest from back.
She was nauseous, but no vomiting or diaphoresis.

Her lungs were clear bilaterally and her abdomen was tender to palpation, no rebound, no voluntary guarding.
An EKG done showed no changes from previous exam and no ST changes.
He informed us that she is under many psychosocial stressors with a strong psychiatric history, so therefore she was a suicide risk, even she denied any suicidal ideation at the time.
Regarding her chest pain an EKG was done and it showed no changes from previous exam, so it was decided that this chest pain was not of cardiac origin, but merely referred pain from her abdomen.
That night the patient's pain was controlled with Percocet one to two tablets every 4 to 6 hours and breakthrough pain was controlled by 5 mg of Oxycodone every 4 to 6 hours, however, the Percocet was the first line medication.
