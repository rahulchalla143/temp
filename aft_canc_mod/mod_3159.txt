The patient had an abdominal CT scan which revealed a subcapsular liver hematoma.
CT of the abdomen also revealed the patient had one 8.0 centimeter and one 4.0 centimeter liver lesion as well as multiple small liver lesions throughout his liver.
Initially the CT of the abdomen revealed that the patient had a cirrhotic liver.
