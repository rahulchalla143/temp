is a 43 yo F being transferred to the floor from the SICU after resolution of acute cerebral edema.
The patient presented to her PCP one day prior to her admission but no interventions were done at that time.
The symptoms continued, so the patient presented to an outside hospital ([**Hospital1 2436**]) on [**6-29**] where a CT scan of brain revealed B/L basal ganglial masses with B/L vasogenic edema and mild mass effect with mild subfalcine herniation.
A CT scan showed progression of mass effect and she was admitted to the SICU.
A subsequent MRI showed multifocal ring enhancing lesions strongly suggestive for Toxoplasmosis.

MRI Head w/wo Contrast ([**2186-6-30**]):  Thin walled ring enhancing lesions within the basal ganglia and right parietal lobe with vasogenic edema resulting in mild rightward subfalcine herniation.
Findings are suggestive of toxoplasmosis with a differential of lymphoma and metastasis.
Thallium SPECT scan can be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
Moderate improvement in lingular consolidation, which can be followed to resolution by chest radiograph.
Resolution of right upper lobe infectious process and pulmonary nodules.
Resolution of bibasilar atelectasis and tiny effusions.
A CT scan showed progression of mass effect and she was admitted to the SICU.
A subsequent MRI showed multifocal ring enhancing lesions strongly suggestive for Toxoplasmosis.
HIV: Patient was informed of HIV status with the help of Infectious Disease and HIV Social worker.
She was receiving fluconazole for oral candidiasis.
However she developed a transaminitis, likely secondary to the fluconazole.
Patient had no seizures, headaches, or vision changes during hospital stay.
