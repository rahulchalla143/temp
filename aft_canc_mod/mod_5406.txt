Admission Date:  [**2198-8-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-10-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-3-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7573**] Chief Complaint: Status epilepticus in setting of severe metabolic derangement in setting of liver failure due to NASH and HCC, with prolonged multifactorial encephalopathy (post-ictal, non-convulsive status, metabolic derangements) and a protracted hospital course in light of the above, as well as several complications as outlined extensively under "Brief Hospital Course".
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Continuous Venous Venous Hemodialysis.
Continuous EEG monitoring.
History of Present Illness: 63yo man with cirrhosis, DM, HTN, and seizures diagnosed in [**11/2197**] presents with seizures as a transfer from an OSH.
She reports he was in his USOH until this evening, when returning from dinner he had a seizure with left head deviation and left arm shaking.
His wife told her this was different from the prior events in that it was the right, not left, and that he had no shaking.
He was noted to have his first seizure while in the ICU in [**11-22**].
On [**2197-12-14**], he was found to have slight left head deviation with jerking movements of the shoulders and head.
He was noted to have subclinical seizures on bedside EEG.
He has had seizures since only in the context of AED vacation, and was thus restarted on the medications.
Of note, MRI had shown bilateral cortical DWI abnormalities thought to be due to hepatic disease vs seizure; these had resolved on repeat MRI one week later.
Past Medical History: DM HTN NASH cirrhosis, on transplant list seizures as above hypothyroidism GERD   Social History: lives with wife, remote smoking history, no EtOH or drug use   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.9, HR 84, BP 152/74, RR 14, SaO2 98%/RA, FS 187 Genl: lying on side, moving purposefully, appears to be seizing (see below) CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly Abd: soft, NT, BS+ Ext: warm and dry  Neurologic examination: Pt is lying on side, with head and eyes deviated far to the right, and right beating nystagmus.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or large vascular territory infarct.
There is no evidence of fracture.
This is likely due to chronic sinusitis changes, however, would recommend work up to rule out fungal infection if clinically warranted.
There is no change to the appearance of this sinus compared to prior studies.
A left maxillary sinus also has mucosal thickening posteriorly, and there is fluid or mucosal thickening in the left frontal sinus as well.
EEG - [**2198-8-2**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of frequent sharp and sharp and slow wave discharges arising from the left posterior quadrant with maximal frequency of about 1 per Hz in the setting of brief episodes of theta frequency slowing seen in the same region.
The findings suggest an area of cortical and subcortical  dysfunction along with cortical irritability which may serve as a focus for potential seizure activity.
No clear electrographic seizures were noted.
In addition to the pushbutton activations, routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs captured multiple episodes of rhythmic, sustained, and prolonged generalized spike and slow wave discharges occurring at a maximal frequency of about 8 Hz, at times associated with eye blinking or left upper extremity jerking and, at other times, without a clear clinical correlate.
The majority of these electrographic seizures were captured at the beginning of the recording on the evening of [**2198-8-4**].
These events are consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
As the electrographic tracing  continued, the tracing evolved into a pattern of burst suppression, albeit with continued intermittent sharp and sharp and wave discharges arising from the left posterior quadrant.
This pattern continued  overnight until the following morning where there were several episodes of rhythmic monomorphic sharp wave discharges seen in a generalized distribution.
While these electrographic findings may be artifactual in nature, we cannot rule out recurrent electrographic seizure activity.
Routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs demonstrated several episodes of rhythmic 8 Hz monomorphic blunted sharp wave discharges occurring in a generalized distribution.
There is no clear source of artifact associated with these events raising the possibility of  persistent electrographic seizure activity.
At other times, the recording showed bursts of low amplitude activity admixed with sharply contoured waves arising from the left posterior quadrant and, at times, evolving over the left hemisphere intermixed with periods of background voltage suppression consistent with a burst suppression pattern.
New right and left lower lobe collapse compared to [**2198-5-7**].
New small right pleural effusion.
Patchy appearance of left lung base raises the suspicion for component of aspiration.
Overall findings suspicious for pneumonia.
No significant amount of abdominal ascites.
No evidence of acute abdominal or pelvic pathology within the limitations described.\  CT torso - [**2198-10-23**] " CHEST: The patient is status post tracheostomy tube placement, with the tip terminating at the level of thoracic inlet.
There are small mediastinal lymph nodes; however, there is no significant lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Small pericardial nodes are noted; however, measure less than 5 mm.
There is trace pleural effusion bilaterally.
In the lung window, again note is made of patchy opacities in the dependent portion of lower lobes, decreased since prior study, likely representing residual atelectasis.
Somewhat confluent area in the left lower lobe is noted, likely due to a part of resolving atelectasis; however, the attention should be paid to this location at the time of next follow up.
There is no endobronchial lesion.
ABDOMEN: The patient is status post RF ablation of two lesions in the right lobe of the liver, which demonstrate hypoattenuation relative to liver parenchyma on all the phases.
There is no new focal arterial enhancement.
Gallbladder is unremarkable without evidence of calcification.
Pancreas is somewhat atrophic, without ductal dilatation or focal solid lesion.
There is fat replacement of the pancreatic head.
There are enlarged peripancreatic and porta hepatis nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm in short axis, unchanged since prior study.
There is no significant ascites.
The visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
There is no hydronephrosis.
PELVIS: There is colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The visualized portions of small intestines are within normal limits, without ascites or lymphadenopathy.
There are degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine; however, there is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
Decreased parenchymal opacities in both lower lobes with residual atelectasis and effusion.
Somewhat confluent area near the left lower lobe, likely a part of resolving atelectasis.
Post RF ablation of two liver lesions without new arterial enhancement, with severe cirrhosis and splenomegaly.
Enlarged porta hepatis and peripancreatic nodes, unchanged.
No gross acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged multifocal sinus disease as described on [**2198-8-2**].
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW: The study is markedly limited for the evaluation of brain parencyma due to streak artifacts from the several external metallic objects.
There is gross midline shift.
There is new moderate opacification of the sphenoid sinus and the left side of frontal sinus and the marked opacification of ethmoid air cells is worsened.
EEG - [**2198-8-8**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs showed bursts of sharply contoured waveforms occurring in a generalized distribution but also with a leftsided predominance lasting up to one to two seconds in duration and admixed with other periods of voltage suppressed background lasting, at times, up to 10-20 seconds.
These findings are consistent with a burst suppression pattern.
Superimposed on this pattern, later in the tracing, there is also rhythmic high amplitude low frequency slow wave morphology discharges that are related to artifact from the  dialysis machine.
There were no prolonged or repetitive discharges.
No clinical seizures were noted.
[**2198-8-10**] ECHO Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
CONCLUSION:  Negligible interval change in the appearance of the brain compared to the prior study.
Particularly in view of the history of status epilepticus, it is of some interest that the present diffusion scan is normal, whereas as a diffusion imaging study from [**2197-12-15**], showed very extensive areas of signal abnormality.
ADDENDUM:  Multiple paranasal sinuses exhibit mucosal thickening, and likely fluid as well within the mastoid sinuses.
No acute intracranial process.
Multiple paranasal sinuses exhibit mucosal thickening and some demonstrate air-fluid levels.
This may represent sinusitis or post intubation changes  [**2198-10-26**] Most recent labs - see attached printout.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for convulsive status epilepticus on [**2198-8-2**].
On the evening of [**2198-8-3**] he had a seizure and then three more on the morning of [**2198-8-4**].
The patient again had difficulty breathing and was intubated and started on propofol gtt.
Elevated ammonia/hepatic encephalopathy was thought to be the trigger of the patient's seizures.
EEG on [**2198-8-6**] continued to demonstrate isolated occipitally predominant and leftsided predominant spike and wave discharges despite this heavy dose of antiseizure medication.
In the afternoon of the same day the patient was noted to have increasing acidosis, elevated lactate and rising CKs which were both attributed to his propofol.
On [**2198-8-7**] Mr [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive requiring two pressors.
An EEG on [**2198-8-8**] was read by the covering resident as suggestive of insufficient burst suppression and the patient was given a 400mg IV dilantin bolus.
Renal function/acidosis improved on the CVVH and by [**2198-8-9**] it was discontinued.
A STAT echo showed hypokinesis of the anterior septum, akinesis of the inferior septum, and severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall.
Of note a definite source of the infection was never identified.
An MRI failed to detect any significant abnormality or change from prior.
As the Ativan was tapered the patient's EEG showed an increased quantity of 1hz global paroxysmal epileptiform discharges.
Since then, he has been gradually weaned off phenobarb with no significant changes in his EEG.
Of note, a repeat MRI of the brain on [**10-15**] showed no ischemic changes.
Despite this slow taper, the patient remained deeply encephalopathic, despite the absence of epileptiform abnormalities on EEG, which continued to show an encephalopathic pattern with very low voltage slow background and occasional parasagittal sharp wave discharges, but these were not frequent or rapid enough to suggest ongoing seizures.
On exam, he would have his eyes open, but he would not regard, localize sound or regard his examiner, nor blink to threat.
He would not grimace nor move his extremities to noxious stimulation, but he would grimace to flexion of his arms, suggesting that perhaps he had distal sensory deficits as well as marked weakness and muscle bulk loss, suggestive of a critical illness polyneuromyopathy.
Note that 1 week prior to discharge hid improved neurologically on a daily basis: he made eye-contact, would fix and follow a face (non consistently), and would occasionally following midline commands such as sticking out his tongue, and mouthing words like "good-morning".
Prior to this, he was basically considered to be in a persistent vegetative state, but thankfully he disproved this prior to discharge to rehab.
He should have interval EEGs to assess for continued epileptiform activity.
Later, the metoprolol was further decreased due to continued low bloodpressures.
Resp/ID: Requiring prolonged stay in the stepdown unit due to the intensive nursing care needs, the patient kept having marked sputum production.
A chest CT done just prior to discharge showed "decreased parenchymal opacities in both lower lobes with residual atelectasis and effusion.
Somewhat confluent area near the left lower lobe, likely a part of resolving atelectasis.
GI: The patient had stable LTFs and ammonia levels, as long as having daily BMs.
He had a Dobhoff in place fo several weeks, and an assessment of the amount of ascitis by U/S on [**10-22**] showed no intra-abdominal ascites, making PEG placement possible.
To assess overall prognosis (re: PEG placement) a bone-scan and CT torso (post-RFA protocol) were obtained on [**10-23**], which showed extensive degenerative joint disease but no progression of his HCC (see details in results-section).
Hepatology was then scheduling his PEG placement, but due to logistical issues this could not be done promptly.
Endo: The continued to have low thyroid function, likely absorption impaired [**1-19**] continuous feeds, so he was changed to IV thyroxine with improvement after gradual upward titration of the dosis.
In summary, the pancytopenia was considered secondary to chronic illness with polypharmacy, and a bone marrow biopsy was not performed.
Musculoskeletal: As outlined under the neurological section, he had marked muscle wasting and areflexia, as well as decreased response to peripheral noxious stimuli, making a critical illness polyneuro-myopathy likely.
Of note however, his pain seemed to be exacerbated when his joints were passively moved, ranging from smaller joints in the hand to larger joints as elbow.
His bone scan, done to assess for bony metastasis of his HCC, showed diffusely symmetric increased uptake of tracer in all joints, indicating degenerative disease.
