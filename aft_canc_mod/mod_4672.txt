He has a very longstanding history of left lower extremity osteo with a chronic wound draining purulent discharge ever since he sustained a shrapnel injury in [**Country 6171**] in a WWII explosion.
He denies any significant change in this condition recently, but his wife notes increasing swelling and erythema of the extremity over the past few days.
He had been rehabbing from an early-[**Month (only) 116**] hospitalization for multifocal pneumonia for which he received a course of CTX/Azithro, and was referred to the ED this morning when he became febrile to 104. .
LLE tib-fib films showed chronic osteomyelitis without subcutaneous gas, and a CXR showed stable bilateral effusions from earlier this month.
He had an elevated lactate to 3.5 that corrected with fluids to 2.0.
He is comfortable and in no acute distress.
He denies any increased pain or fevers recently.
He has intermittent shortness of breath, and notes that he sometimes is on oxygen at the nursing home.
He has no coughing or sputum production, however.

Family History: Denies history of malignancy.
Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T98.1  BP94/54  P58  RR17  Sat94/4LNC General: alert and oriented x3, NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, very dry MM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: crackles at the bases, R>L, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 3/6 SEM at the second RICS without radiation, second SEM at the apex with radiation to the axilla.
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: The left lower extremity has a 3cmx1cm open wound with purulent necrotic discharge at the level of the tibial tuberosity.
The entire distal extremity is warm, erythematous with 2+ pitting edema that is tender to touch.
Areas of sclerosis and lucency with periosteal reaction is consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.
CXR [**2171-7-10**]: IMPRESSION: Little change except possibly for some small increase in left effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88yoM with AML, h/o bladder cancer, chronic LLE osteomyelitis, HTN, Afib who presented with lower extremity cellulitis and septic hypotension.
# LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY CELLULITIS:  Likely port of entry was non-healing chronic ulcer in left lower extremity.
His erythema and edema improved over the course of his stay.
Once IV antibiotics are finished, he will start on oral suppressive antibiotics for chronic osteomyelitis.
Note 1/2 blood cultures grew Staph coag negative (sensitive to oxacillin and tetracycline), presumed to be a contaminant rather than actual bacteremia.
Echocardiogram was deferred due to lack of suspicion for endocarditis and MRI leg was not pursued due to clinical improvement on antibiotics and patient resistance to surgical debridement.
His chronic non-healing ulcer/chronic osteomyelitis of his left lower extremity is stable in size and without exudate.
# HYPOTENSION:  Initial systolic blood pressure 80-90's prompted ICU admission, he received intravenous fluids and improved.
# HYPOXIA:  Resolved spontaneously, suspected atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema.
No pneumonia was seen on CXR.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Pre-renal secondary to infection and hypotension, resolved with intravenous fluids.
He was mildly neutropenic on the day of discharge (ANC 961), but he was afebrile.
His other medical problems were managed with his home medications without complications.
