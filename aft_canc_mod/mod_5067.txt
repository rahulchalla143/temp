Admission Date:  [**2119-8-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-8-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-2-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**] Chief Complaint: ABDOMINAL PAIN  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hemodialysis Placement and Removal of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter Colonscopy with polyp removal   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old Portuguese-speaking man with extensive history of alcoholic cirrhosis, frequent admissions at [**Hospital1 18**], now here with right-sided abdominal pain, and increased ascites.
Starting on Wednesday ([**8-2**]) he began having right-sided abdominal pain.
His wife reported that he had increased fatigue, abdominal pain, abdominal girth, and one episode of non-bloody emesis.
With consideration of ischemic colitis, the ED sent him for CT scan, ordered without contrast given his renal function; this did not show any signs of ischemia.
Past Medical History: Alcoholic cirrhosis known varices portal vein thrombosis s/p TIPS DM Hypothyroid Pituitary mass h/o nephrolithiasis h/o +PPD   Social History: Lives w/ wife at home.
Brief Hospital Course: LIVER CIRRHOSIS, ETOH, w/ encephalopathy Hepatorenal syndrome worsens prognosis.
Could have been precipitated by large volume tap on prior admission, though pt has tolerated similar (~5L) in the past.
U/S shows some stenosis from TIPS in protal circulation.Being worked up for liver/renal transplant, f/u workup with transplant surgery team.
Patient was treated for HRS with improvement.
Treated with Cipro in hospital and continued on prophylactic doses on discharge due to possible history of SBP.
RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Patient presented w/ ARF that was likely [**1-23**] hepatorenal syndrome, but perhaps [**1-23**] large volume tap on last admission; vs change in hemodynamics [**1-23**] infection; vs compartment syndrome from ascites causing pre-renal picture vs metformin side effect.
He was admitted to the MICU where patient underwent emergent dialysis for significanly elevated lactate and was started on octreotide and midodrine.
It was felt that his acute renal failure may have been secondary to HRS related to his recent large volume tap vs lactic acidosis related to metformin versus infection.
He had abd u/s which confirmed large amt of ascites with persistent elevated TIPS velocities.
Given elevated WBC ct and concern for infection pt started empirically on zosyn.
Due to hypertension and hyperglycemia, octreotide and midrinone were discontinued, but albumin was continued.
On the day prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 68037**] tunneled HD line was removed without complication.
HYPOTENSION Possibly due to decreased venous return due to abdominal pressure vs infection/sepsis vs hypovolemia due to fluid sequestration as ascites.
This was thougth to due to hepatic encephalopathy that could have been caused by infection, UTI vs SBP, vs acidemia.
His acidemia resolved after HD.
LACTIC ACIDOSIS Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though metformin toxicity in setting of new renal failure may also be responsible.
Mesenteric ischemia could be culprit as patient presented with large moderately tense ascites.
On [**8-16**] his MS [**First Name (Titles) 68038**] [**Last Name (Titles) 68039**] and became acidemic with a lactate of 6.4.
Concern for abdominal source but as above this is not clear after dx tap and CT abd/pelvis.
Empiric gram negative coverage with vanc/zosyn, which he received for a total 7 days course, his leukocytosis resolved shortly after starting treatment.
He had a second episode of acute increase of his WBC, this one on [**8-18**] after the episode of AMS for which he had to be transfered to the MICU.
Cipro was continued at treatment doses until his leukocytosis returned to [**Location 213**].
Cipro was continued at SBP prophylactic doses due to quesitonable history of SBP in the past.
DIABETES Patient's oral antihyperglycemics were discontinued as metformin could have been cause for lactic acidosis.
The drip was d/c'ed after 24 hours with  normalization of gap and blood glucose.
Due to possible lactic acidosis from metformin on admission, and in consultation with [**Last Name (un) **], Mr. [**Known lastname 16651**] was sent home on Glargine and HISS after extensive education with his wife and translator.
Plan was for the patient's wife to check blood sugar and draw up insulin due to his confusion [**1-23**] liver disease.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Alcoholic Cirrhosis Acute Renal Failure Lactic Acidosis Hepatic Encephalopathy Hepatorenal Syndrome Refractory Ascites  Secondary: Portal vein thrombosis Diabetes mellitus Hypothyroidism Pituitary mass   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile.
You were found to have very abnormal labs and so underwent urgent dialysis.
These abnormal labs were likely related to a combination of kidney failure from your liver disease and the metformin you were taking for your diabetes.
Your course was complicated by fluctuating mental status, high blood sugars, and fluctuating kidney status.
You may have had an abdominal infection so you were given antibiotics and should continue on the antibiotic (cipro) to prevent any futher infections.
Please call the liver clinic or return to the emergency room if you experience fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, constipation, diarrhea, bloody or black bowel movements, confusion, or any other concerning symptoms.
Followup Instructions: Please come to the liver clinic on Tuesday, [**8-29**] to have your blood work checked.
This is because you were noted to have a small, stable lesion in the base of your brain.
