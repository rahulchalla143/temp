Admission Date:  [**2138-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-9-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Phosphorus  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: unsteady gait  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Craniotomy for resection of R cerebellar lesion   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old woman with HTN sent by her PCP for evaluation of a headache.
She had associated nausea without vomiting, and also a "feeling of being drunk" whenever she tried to walk without apparent discoordination.
Her PCP reported to the ED that she had dysmetria and a present Romberg sign.
The ED ordered an NC Head CT with a noted right cerebellar lesion of unknown etiology with mass effect but without evidence of herniation or hemorrhage and thus consulted our team for further evaluation.
Language fluent with intact repetition and verbal comprehension.
No paraphasic errors.
High and low frequency naming intact.
No dysarthria.
No apraxia or neglect.
[III, IV, VI] EOMI, no nystagmus.
No pronation, no drift.
No tremor or asterixis.
- Coordination - Normal FTN.
No dysmetria with finger/foot mirrored movements.
+Mild slowing with rapid alternating movements.
Mild sway, more to R than L, on Romberg testing but no fall.
Hypoattenuating mass lesion in the right cerebellum with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
Findings concerning for primary neoplasm or metastatic disease.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2138-7-10**] MR head with and without contrast: 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm ring enhancing hematoma in the right cerebellar hemisphere with associated vasogenic edema and mild mass effect over the 4 ventricle, pons and remaining cerebellum.
Differential diagnosis includes a hemorrhagic neoplasm, such as a metastasis, or a subacute hematoma with the wall enhancement reflecting the wall of the hematoma itself, rather than tumor.
3.9 cm cavitary mass demonstrated within the superior segment of the right lower lobe with an immediately adjacent satellite 4 mm pulmonary nodule and adjacent reactive parenchymal opacification that in setting of the cerebellar lesion likely represents the primary malignancy.
Multiple subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities and a left renal hypodensity, too small to characterize, with metastases not excluded from the differential  MRI Head with and without contrast  Postoperative changes seen in the right cerebellar hemisphere with occipital craniotomy defect, subdural fluid along posterior aspect of clivus and right occipital region and bifrontal pneumocephalus   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 97333**] was admitted to the neurosurgical ICU on [**2138-7-10**].
She underwent a CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis to identify any potential primary neoplasm, which revealed right lung lesion.
On [**7-11**] she had emesis and a vasovagal episode.
She also had some Afib overnight and this resolved with some Lopressor.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] of neuro oncology who felt that this was most likely a metastatic lung lesion which should be surgically resected.
Post op MRI demonstrated complete gross resection.
Patient's pain is well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.
Pt's incision is clean, dry and inctact without evidence of infection.
2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
4. cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for neck pain.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: R cerebellar lesion; final pathologic diagnosis pending Right Lung Lesion   Discharge Condition: AOx3.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
