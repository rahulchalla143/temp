Admission Date:  [**2119-4-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-4-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2065-11-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  UROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old male with a diagnosis of muscle invasive Grade II to III/III bladder carcinoma.
In addition, his prostatic urethral biopsies had been positive for carcinoma in situ.
At this time, he presents for discussion for his continent urinary diversion.
He had a CT scan and bone scan in [**2118-10-13**], prior to his chemotherapy that showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
He had a recent prostate biopsy because of a prostatic nodule which showed no malignancy.
Diet controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for his father with a history of lung cancer and a sister with diabetes mellitus.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems on pre-surgical evaluation showed mild urinary urgency after BCG treatment and had decreased erectile function.
Abdomen soft, nontender, no palpable masses.
No costovertebral angle tenderness.
No inguinal lymphadenopathy.
No inguinal hernia.
Nodularity in the left prostatic lobe.
Given this preoperatively assessment, he was given a NuLYTELY bowel prep and erythromycin and Neomycin based antibiotics preoperatively.
He had a preoperative CT scan repeated that did not show any evidence of metastatic disease at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2119-4-14**], he came to the [**Hospital1 346**] and underwent a radical cystoprostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and a continent cutaneous diversion.
Specimens from the case included bladder, prostate, bilateral pelvic lymph nodes, ureteral cuff margins bilaterally.
His pain was being controlled with an epidural and he was otherwise feeling okay.
He was noted to have some mild hypotension immediately postoperatively in the 70s.
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and he had a left subclavian line that was in appropriate position.
Over the next 48 hours, the patient had some low grade temperatures to 100.5 and 100.8 F., respectively.
He had a right internal jugular at this time; it was a new site and stick that was placed.
His epidural was still being utilized, but it had been titrated back and he was now on a total regimen of epidural and PCA for pain control.
He had had a low-grade temperature to 100.3 F., the night before, but was ultimately deemed stable and appropriate for discharge, and sent to the Floor.
On postoperative day number three, he was off antibiotics, feeling well with no pain.
He was now walking and out of bed without assistance.
He was being controlled for pain with a PCA.
The fear for a possible urine leak status post stent removal was investigated and creatinine values on the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were drawn.
This all but practically refutes a possible urine leak.
The patient did very well over the next couple of days and ultimately, by postoperative day number eight, he was afebrile with a temperature of 98.6 F., pulse 80, blood pressure 140/90; respiratory rate was 20 with 98% room air saturation.
He was making over a liter and a half of urine through the suprapubic tube.
His wound is well approximated with no drainage.
He did have bowel sounds and he was soft and flat otherwise.
At this point, he was deemed appropriate and stable for discharge.
He will receive a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] him with these tasks.
