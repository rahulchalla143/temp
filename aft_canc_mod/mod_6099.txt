His symptoms started shortly after he quit drinking and abusing narcotics, about 3 months ago, and he initially attributed the chills and fevers to withdrawal.
He has also noticed an abdominal mass, more prominent on the left side, which is diffusely painful and which prevents him from taking a deep breath if he lies down.
He was transfused and a thoracentesis was performed for pleural effusion (500 cc drained) and then spleen biopsy was performed to evaluate his pancytopenia and lymphadenopathy.

Denied recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT TORSO [**3-17**]: Several enlarged lymph nodes within the axilla, mediastinum, and abdomen.
There is massive splenomegaly.
Additionally, there are numerous small liver lesions as described above.
Overall, these findings are consistent with lymphoma.
INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a Non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Note: H&E sections show nodal tissue with a vaguely nodular infiltrate and abundant sclerosis.
The infiltrate consists of a background of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes harboring many large atypical cells with abundant vesicular chromatin, multiple nuclear lobulations, multiple nucleoli, and scant pale cytoplasm (L&H or popcorn cells).
CD21 highlights few expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks.
MIB-1 highlights germinal centers - where the proliferation fraction is high - as well as scattered large cells within the expanded B cell nodules.
SPECIMEN #2:  SPLEEN, NEEDLE BIOPSY (SLIDES LABELED S09-1874 FROM [**Hospital3 **], [**Location (un) **], MA) DIAGNOSIS: SPLENIC PARENCHYMA WITH MULTIPLE GRANULOMAS.
DEFINITIVE MORPHOLOGIC OR IMMUNOPHENOTYPIC EVIDENCE OF LYMPHOCYTE PREDOMINANT HODGKIN LYMPHOMA IS NOT SEEN.
Note: H&E sections show several small cores of splenic tissue with multiple lymphohistiocytic aggregates, which in some areas coalesce into well-formed granulomas with occasional giant cells.
There are scattered large atypical cells in a background of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.
Special stains for acid fast bacteria and fungus (AFB, PAS, GMS, Giemsa) are all negative for microorganisms with adequate controls.
Of note, splenic involvement by lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is infrequent and when present it is usually not a cause of splenomegaly, let alone massive splenomegaly.
Histoplasma Quantitative Antigen EIA Result:  None Detected ng/ml(-)   Brief Hospital Course: 33M with a history of narcotic abuse who presented w 3 months of fevers, nightsweats, LAD and splenomegaly found to be pancytopenic upon presentation and subsequently diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.
# Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkins Lymphoma.
Bone marrow biospy was not consistent with bone marrow involvement.
His nightsweats had largely resolved and he was afebrile for >48 hours at the time of discharge.
# Hepatosplenomegaly.
Patient had a splenic biospy at the OSH which was reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] pathology and found to contain granulomas which were concerning for infectious vs lymphoma-related process.
Given concern for non-specific infectious process status-post chemotherapy, the patient was started empirically on fluconazole and levofloxacin.
He developed worsening LFT abnormalities as well as hyperbilirubinemia which improved when fluconazole was stopped.
This was also thought to be related to infectious vs lymphoma-related process but was not entirely clear at his time of discharge and was to be closely followed up on as an outpatient.
He was asked to return should he become febrile again at home.
The patient clearly had significant pain related to his abdominal distention from his spleen which required low dose morphine SR with IR for breakthrough pain.
He was discharged with a limited script for these medications with a plan for down-titration with resolution of his HSM in the setting of lymphoma treatment.
On [**3-28**], the patient was afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable with a plan for close follow up in place.
Disp:*25 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma with massive hepatosplenomegaly  Secondary: History of Narcotic Abuse   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable with normal vitals and plan for follow up in place.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for diagnosis and further management of your fever, nightsweats, and abdominal swelling.
You were found to have lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma causing expansion of your liver and spleen.
You may take morphine immediate release for breakthrough pain not adequately controlled by the sustained release medication.
Please call your primary doctor or Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] or go to the ED should you experience fevers >100.4, cough, nightsweats, chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening abdominal pain, pain with urination, changes to your bowels, or any other concerning symptoms.
Because your spleen is so enlarged, you are at increased risk for splenic rupture.
