Admission Date:  [**2119-4-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-4-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pleurex catheter   History of Present Illness: Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with PMH of stage IV NSCLC, CVA, and a recurrent malignant right sided pleural effusion who presented after attempted IP procedure on day of admission with altered mental status and an unresponsive episode.
An incision was made, but at that time the patient became unresponsive with bradycardia into the 30s and hypotension with SBPs in the 60s.
She required ventilatory support with a BVM briefly, got Atropine 0.5mg x 2 and the procedure was aborted (and small incision sutured closed).
She was given flumazenil 0.5mg as well as narcan 0.4mg with minimal response.
At the time of this incident, an EKG was performed that showed atrial fibrillation and ST depressions (reportedly in V2-V3).
Prior to the procedure she reported cough, dyspnea, and weight loss.
She specifically denied orthopnea, PND or leg edema.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain due to patient's mental status.
Atrial fibrillation.
NSCLC as below: -[**10-7**] CXR for cough showed R-sided opacity, chest CT which showed a nodular lesions in superior RLL and mod/large R pleural  effusion - [**2118-11-2**] pleural effusion tapped and negative for malignancy Pt then developed hoarseness and was seen by ENT [**1-8**] and determined to have recurrent nerve paralysis, highly concerning for malignancy.
- [**2119-1-13**] repeat imaging disclosed a smaller LUL nodule and paratracheal mass, likely a lymph node conglomerage - [**2119-1-26**] EBUS with FNA sampled paratracheal mass and lymph node, both positive for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The patient previously worked for the Red Cross and had no occupational exposures.
Family History: No family history of lung disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 95.6 (axillary) BP:97/62 P: 62 R: 20 O2: 99% 2 L General: Withdraws to painful stimuli only, no posturing.
Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, limited air movement at apices only (decreased breath sounds bilateral bases) CV: irregularly irregular normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: withdraws all extremities to painful stimuli only, 1+ LE reflexes, toes downgoing bilaterally.
CXR (portable): [**2119-4-6**] CHEST, AP: Lung volumes are low, with increased left lower lobe atelectasis and a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
Right lower lobe atelectasis and subpulmonic effusion persist.
Left upper lobe nodule is vaguely seen overlying the second anterior and fourth posterior ribs.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and aortic tortuosity persist.
Bibasilar atelectasis, tiny left pneumothorax.
Distended stomach, please decompress through PEG tube.
No acute intracranial process.
1.4 cm calcified left paraclinoid lesion most consistent with meningioma without associated edema.
Areas of hypodensity within the right parietal and right frontal regions corresponding to FLAIR abnormalities on prior MRI and consistent with remote infarcts.
MRI Head [**2119-4-7**]: No acute pathology (prelim) .
CXR [**2119-4-7**] (post Pleurex): No evidence of residual pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: # Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness/altered mental status was possibly due to versed/fentanyl with slow metabolism, but also possibly due to hypoxia and resultant CNS insult that occurred as a result of her hypoperfusion with low HR and blood pressure.
Alternative explanations include CVA and other toxic/metabolic abnormalities.
Patient also with long history of atrial fibrillation, not currently on anticoagulation with an INR of 1.2.
An MRI of her brain was performed due to concern for embolic CVA which showed no acute pathology.
# Hypotension: When the patient first arrived to the ICU, her blood pressures were in the high 90s and low 100s systolic.
# EKG changes: The patient had EKG changes during her initial bradycardic/hypotensive episode with new RBBB and minimal ST depressions in V2-V3.
A repeat EKG 30 minutes later showed resolution of these findings and only showed atrial fibrillation with no ST/T wave abnormalities.
The patient does not carry the diagnosis of CAD, but is a diabetic and is predisposed to vascular abnormalities.
A second set did show a small increase in troponin T to 0.02, but no MB component.
# NSCLC with pleural effusion: Patient is now status post 2 cycles with investigatory drug, now with reaccumulation of pleural effusion.
F/U chest x-ray showed no PTX.
She was discharged the following day with no acute issues.
# DM 2: The patient's diabetes was generally diet controlled, here with glucose range 150-250.
# Hypothyroidism: A TSH was sent and was elevated at 7.8, however, a free T4 was normal at 1.6.

Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 108197**], You were seen and evaluated for low blood pressure and a period of unresponsiveness in the hospital after a planned pulmonary procedure.
Your unresponsiveness was likely due to the medications you received for sedation in the procedure, and you are probably an individual who breaks down these medicines very slowly.
You were monitored closely in the intensive care unit and received fluid resuscitation for your low blood pressure.
We made the following changes to your medication regimen: We stopped you blood pressure medications, including atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide, since you had low blood pressure.
Finally we are giving you morphine, to take sublingually, in case you have shortness of breath or pain.
