He was diagnosed with dehydration and was fluid resuscitated.
He was treated empirically for c. diff colitis with IV flagyl although he stopped having diarrhea upon admission so a stool sample was never sent to be checked for c.diff toxin.
He actually reports that he had a well-formed bowel movement this morning.
Here, the patient confirms that he has dysphagia with both solids and liquids.
He currently denies chest pain, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fevers/chills, or changes in bowel habits.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.

There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.
Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
Minimal left-sided pleural effusion.
[**2178-2-6**] Esophagus: Minimal trickling of contrast through the Nissen fundoplication, with pooling of barium in the large dilated esophagus and the epiphrenic diverticulum.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78M w/ achalasia s/p multiple failed attempts at EGD dilation at [**Hospital3 **].
His course was complicated by development of C. difficile colitis reulting in hypotension, hypoxia and transfer to the SICU.
The patient was treated with with IV fluid resuscitation as well as with broad spectrum antibiotics initially and, but these were narrowed down to Vancomycin enemas and IV flagyl when the patient's condition stabilized.
During his hospitalization, the patient also experienced several episodes of Atrial fibrillation with RVR while unable to take his home meds.
Finally, the patient experienced some post-herpetic neuralgia from his shingles lesions (present on admission) and was treated with acyclovir and gabapentin for this.

Discharge Instructions: *You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] surgery red (west 3) service for a Laparoscopic [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy with partial fundoplication and gastroscopy to treat Achalasia.
Your surgery went well without complications.
*Although your surgery went well, your hospital course was complicated by development of C. dificile colitis with associated diarrhea, dehyrdation and low blood pressure, requiring transfer to the SICU.
*You also had several episodes of rapid heart rate in assocation with Atrial fibrillation.
* After surgery, your diet was gradually advanced from sips to liquids to soft solids and medications, which you tolerated well.
These steps are to prevent any aspiration (breathing in) of food that may  not have progressed through the esophagus into the stomach normally.
* As you were having pain from your shingles lesions, you were started on Acyclovir.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER if: * If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
