Likely old infarcts in left frontoparietal regions.
[**2162-12-20**] CTA:  - TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest was performed with and without intravenous contrast.
There is moderate atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries and aortic arch.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of dissection.
The pulmonary arteries opacify normally without intrinsic filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There has been interval enlargement of mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, some of which are centrally necrotic, measuring up to 2.2 cm in the lower right paratracheal station, 1.4 cm in the right hilar station, and 1.2 cm in the left hilar station.
There is deformity, narrowing and splaying of the right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arteries which remain patent secondary to external compression from bulky right hilar lymphadenopathy.
There has been interval enlargement of a 11.5cm x 8.4cm centrally necrotic mass centered in the right chest wall and extending medially into the right upper lobe with interval worsening of rib destruction involving ribs three through six laterally on the right.
The mass previously measured 7.1 cm x 8.0 cm and has demonstrated significant interval growth into the right subpectoral region.
There is encasement and irregular narrowing of the right middle lobe bronchus with subsequent distal partial atelectasis which is new.
New centrilobular nodules, tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, and foci of peribronchial consolidation, predominantly involve the lower lobes and to a lesser extent within the lingula, which are concerning for aspiration pneumonitis.
Diffuse emphysema is noted throughout the lungs.
No pleural effusions are identified.
A sclerotic lesion is noted in the left clavicle, which is only partially imaged, but present on prior PET study.
Deformities multiple ribs are likely post traumatic in nature, involving the left posterior tenth and eleventhribs, left lateral fourth and sixth ribs, in addition to the right lateral sixth rib.
No additional suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted within the osseous structures.
Multilevel degenerative changes noted throughout the spine.
Although this study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a stable-appearing hypodense right adrenal lesion measuring 2.4 x 1.7 cm consistent with an adrenal adenoma.
No additional abnormalities are noted within the visualized upper abdomen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Large centrally necrotic right chest wall mass, with worsening rib destruction and significant increase in size of the right subpectoral component.
Interval worsening of metastatic mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Centrilobular nodules, tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and peribronchial consolidations predominantly within the bilateral lower lobes.
In light of the distribution and coexisting central bronchial secretions, these findings are most likely attributed to aspiration pneumonitis.
Partially imaged sclerotic lesion within the left clavicle, present on prior PET CT, likely benign in nature given no FDG avidity was seen corresponding to this lesion.
Stable right adrenal nodule consistent with an adrenal adenoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 185**] is a 67 M with a medical history notable for stage IV squamous cell lung carcinoma and previous atrial fibrillation requiring an ablation procedure.
This was ultimately thought to be secondary to poor PO intake and atrial fibrillation.
On the second day of the admission he developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates >150.
Non-small cell lung cancer  - he did not have adequate pain control on his admission Fentanyl patches due to a small amount of body fat; he was discharged on long and short-acting morphine.
He occasionally had hypotension when he would take these and not take adequate POs; if this continues at home his atenolol could be changed to once daily.
Aspiration pneumonia  - failed speech and swallow and placed on 7 days of levofloxacin and Flagyl along with aspiration precautions  4.
Concern for adrenal insufficiency  - while in the ICU he was hypotensive and was started on empiric steroids for adrenal insufficiency as he has an adrenal metastasis.
It is hard to know if this really represents adrenal failure butit likely does not.

We think this was from atrial fibrillation resulting in a fast heart rate and dehydration after your chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, it appears your cancer has not responded to your chemotherapy and we have arranged for you to have hospice services at home to treat your cancer-related pain and shortness of breath.
You also developed a pneumonia while in the hospital and we are recommending 5 more days of antibiotics and a thickened diet to prevent aspiration.
